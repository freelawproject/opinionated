Defendant contends that (1) the trial court did not have a sufficient basis in fact or law to find Corey emancipated under Florida law; (2) the trial court erred in finding that plaintiffs present spouse\u2019s income should not be considered in calculating child support; (3) the trial court erred in fixing arrearages at $14,568.01 and in ordering payment at the rate of $100 per week given the fact that his income was limited to approximately $563 per week; and (4) the trial court erred in finding that he should reimburse plaintiff $349 for life insurance premiums when he, in fact, made payments of those premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">Defendant first contends that the trial court had an insufficient basis in fact or law to find Corey emancipated under Florida law. He argues that jurisdiction of this matter remained in New Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>and that the child support issue should have been decided under New Jersey law. More precisely, defendant contends that New Jersey law should apply to the issue of Corey\u2019s emancipation. Despite these arguments, it is clear on this record, that during the October 28,1994 hearing, defendant\u2019s counsel failed to object, and even implicitly accepted that the issue of Corey\u2019s emancipation would be decided under Florida law.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u201cIt is a well-settled principle that our appellate courts will decline to consider questions or issues not properly presented to the trial court when an opportunity for such a presentation is available \u2018unless the questions so raised on appeal go to the jurisdiction of the trial court or concern matters of great public interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Skripek v. Bergamo, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620, 629, 491 A.2d 1336 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973)), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>303, 508 A.2d 189 (1988); <em>see also Chalef v. Ryerson, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 28-29, 648 A.2d 1139 (App.Div.1994); <em>State v. Bogus, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 419, 538 A.2d 1278 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>567, 546 A.2d 497 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Here, the issue does not concern the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction, but whether the trial court made the proper choice of law decision. Therefore, since no objection was raised below regarding the trial court\u2019s decision to apply Florida law, we decline to review the issue of whether the trial court correctly chose to apply Florida law in determining Corey\u2019s emancipation.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Alternatively, defendant argues that the trial court did not have a sufficient factual basis to determine that Corey, because of his mental or physical incapacity, was emancipated. Application of Florida law to the determination of whether Corey was emancipated, requires reference to Section 743.07 of the Florida statutes, which addresses the rights, privileges and obligations of persons 18 years of age or older. The statute, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">(1) The disability of nonage is hereby removed for all persons in this state who are 18 years of age or older, and they shall enjoy and suffer the rights, privileges, and obligations of all persons 21 years of age or older except as otherwise excluded by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the State Constitution immediately preceding the effective date of this section and except as otherwise provided in the Beverage Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">(2) This section shall not prohibit any court of competent jurisdiction from requiring support for a dependent person beyond the age of 18 years <em>when such dependency is because of a mental or physical incapacity which began prior to such person reaching majority </em>or if the person is dependent in fact, is between the ages of 18 and 19, and is still in high school, performing in good faith with a reasonable expectation of graduation before the age of 19. [Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 743.07 (West 1991) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Based upon this provision, Florida Law \u201cdoes not independently impose on parents the duty of supporting their healthy, non-dependent children who have reached the age of majority.\u201d <em>Zolonz v. Zolonz, </em>659 So.2d 451, 452 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1995). However, as in New Jersey, the determination of whether a child is emancipated is necessarily a factual one. In situations in which there is no evidence that a child \u201clabors under any mental or physical incapacities[,]\u201d a request for child support will be denied. <em>McCauley v. McCauley, </em>599 So.2d 1002, 1004 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1992); <em>Stultz v. Stultz, </em>504 So.2d 5, 6 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1986); <em>see also Madson v. Madson, </em>636 So.2d 759, 760-61 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">It was established that Corey, who, according to defendant suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and requires special education and a lot of attention, was attending Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on a full time basis and taking a \u201cfull course load of twelve credit hours[.]\u201d Corey was living at home and commuting to school five days a week. According to plaintiff, in addition to attending college full time, Corey was \u201cworking a 35 hour week at Radio Shack. He takes seven buses in the course of the day, back and forth. He gets home at about 8:30, nine o\u2019clock at night. He is succeeding in his studies and he does volunteer work at the school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Significantly, the trial court commented on more than one occasion that it did not feel comfortable with the amount of information it had on this issue. At a September 16,1994 hearing, the trial court noted that it \u201cneed[ed] to know a whole lot more about where [Corey] is, what he is doing, the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>courses, whether there are considerations given to him because of his peculiar learning need or needs.\u201d The trial court felt it necessary to conduct a subsequent hearing, which was held on October 28, 1994. At that hearing, the trial court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">[My] sense is that under Florida law, the concept of whether you fall within that unique exception that allows for the status of the child to remain unemancipated beyond the age of 18 does not require a finding that the child be wholly disadvantaged or handicapped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">But, here is what I\u2019m fearful of. I\u2019m fearful that the record is not enough before me to justify a view and frankly, the only way I think I\u2019m going to ever be able to cross the bridge is with some type of affidavit or certification from the doctor who is currently having him in therapy. Because, otherwise, how can I possibly make a finding?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Despite these fears, and apparently without the benefit of any additional information, the trial court declared Corey emancipated under Florida law.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">In our view, the trial court erred in deciding the critical issue of Corey\u2019s emancipation under Florida law without the benefit of more information. The trial court did not have the information it sought in the form of either testimony or an affidavit from a doctor who was currently treating Corey or any other competent medical professional familiar with Corey\u2019s condition and status. Moreover, the trial court did not have the benefit of any other medical evaluation of Corey, which would allow it to make a truly informed decision. Consequently, we are' constrained to reverse the declaration that Corey was emancipated under Florida law and remand the matter to the trial court for further consideration of that issue. We leave to the trial court\u2019s discretion whether a plenary hearing is necessary or whether this issue can be resolved on affidavits, including affidavits or certifications from physicians or other medical professionals who have treated or examined Corey.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">We next consider defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in refusing to consider plaintiffs present spouse\u2019s income in calculat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ing the amount of child support payments for each of the children bom of their marriage. In this regard, defendant argues that pursuant to the Child Support Guidelines, plaintiffs income should include \u201cany maintenance payments and/or income derived from her current husband, Robert Tammaro.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In calculating the income of the respective parties, the trial court determined that defendant\u2019s income for 1993 was $29,250, which the trial court further calculated to represent a \u201cweekly, after tax net\u201d of $563. The trial court determined that plaintiffs weekly disposable income for 1994 was $437. Thereafter, pursuant to the Child Support Guidelines, the trial court compared the two incomes in percentage form and determined defendant\u2019s percentage to be 56.44%.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Even if we were to assume that the income figures used by the trial court were, in fact, comparable to one another, the trial court, in considering plaintiffs income, appeared to disregard a significant segment of <em>Rule </em>5:6A, a rule which governs the application of the Child Support Guidelines. These guidelines \u201care to be applied with respect to the initial determination of child support and to motions for modification.\u201d <em>Koelble v. Koelble, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 194, 618 A.2d 377 (App.Div.1992); <em>see also Zazzo v. Zazzo, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>124, 129, 584 A.2d 281 (App.Div.1990), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>321, 598 A.2d 881 (1991). <em>Rule </em>5:6A states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">The guidelines set forth in Appendix IX of these Rules <em>shall </em>be applied when an application to establish or modify child support is considered by the court. The guidelines may be modified or disregarded by the court only where good cause is shown. Good cause shall consist of a) the considerations set forth in Appendix IXA, or the presence of other relevant factors which may make the guidelines inapplicable or subject to modification, and b) the fact that injustice would result from the application of the guidelines. In all eases, the determination of good cause shall be within the sound discretion of the court, [emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The trial court\u2019s application of these guidelines is thus mandatory unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is demonstrated as to why such application is inappropriate. <em>See Koelble v. Koelble, supra, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 194, 618 A.2d 377. The determination of the existence of \u201cgood cause\u201d is \u201cwithin the sound discretion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>court.\u201d Pursuant to this rule, if \u201cgood cause\u201d, as defined in <em>Buie </em>5:6A, is shown to exist, than these guidelines may be modified or disregarded completely. <em>See Chobot v. Chobot, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>648, 658, 541 A.2d 251 (App.Div.1988). The first prong of the \u201cgood cause\u201d test set forth in <em>Bule </em>5:6A instructs the court to focus upon the considerations set forth in Appendix IX-A of the New Jersey Court Rules, or the presence of other relevant factors which may make the Child Support Guidelines inapplicable. <em>Ibid. </em>One consideration contained in Appendix IX-A states that \u201c[i]n determining gross income, [a factor which] may make these guidelines inapplicable\u201d is the existence of \u201cincome derived by other household members[.]\u201d [Pressler, Current N.J. Court Rules, Appendix IX-A]</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Here, the trial court did not even consider the \u201cgood cause\u201d issue, despite information that plaintiffs standard of living may have changed due to the income of her new spouse who was employed as an accountant. In light of the existence here of income derived from another household member, the trial court, had it considered the \u201cgood cause\u201d test, may well have determined that \u201cgood cause\u201d existed to modify or disregard the guidelines and instead utilize the factors set forth in N.J.S.A 2A:34-23a, which are \u201cto be used in those cases not governed by court rule[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23a. Significantly, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-23a explicitly states that in determining the amount to be paid by a parent for child support, the trial court should consider, among other things, the \u201c[s]tandard of living and economic circumstances of each parent[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-23a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">However, even assuming that the trial court correctly concluded that the Child Support Guidelines were not to be modified or disregarded, it afforded such guidelines too narrow an interpretation. Appendix IX-E of the New Jersey Court Rules provides guidance as to the use of the Child Support Guidelines. In pertinent part, this appendix states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>B. Income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">(1) For the purposes of these guidelines, \u201cgross income\u201d is defined as all earned and unearned income from whatever source derived, including, <em>(but not limited to) </em>the following items: (1) Compensation for services, including wages, fees, commissions, and similar items, (2) Gross income derived from the operation of a business minus ordinary and necessary operating expenses, (3) Gains derived from dealings in property, (4) Interests, (5) Rents, (6) Royalties, (7) Dividends, (8) Alimony and separate maintenance payments from other relationships, (9) Annuities, (10) Income from life insurance and endowment contracts, (11) Income from discharge of indebtedness, (12) Pensions, (13) Income in respect of a decedent, (14) Income from an interest in an estate or trust and (15) disability grants or payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">[Pressler, Current N.J. Court Rules, Appendix IX-E (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Because the definition of \u201cgross income\u201d contained in the Child Support Guidelines is not limited to the sources of income specifically enumerated, a court may consider a party\u2019s spouse\u2019s income in determining child support. Of course, we do not suggest that plaintiffs spouse had a duty to support her children from a prior marriage. However, we do hold that funds given by the spouse to plaintiff constituted income which was not exempt from consideration in determining plaintiffs support obligation to her children. Consequently, the trial court erred in failing to consider plaintiffs spouse\u2019s income in its determination of whether the current level of support should be modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Finally, we are satisfied that the trial court erred in fixing arrearages at $14,568.01 and ordering payment of $100 per week. The record here does not establish how the trial court arrived at the amount of arrearages due or the basis for the weekly payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">In New Jersey, \u201con an application to determine the amount of arrearages and to compel their payment, the court has discretion to determine whether the prior support order or judgment should be enforced and whether and to what extent a spouse should be forced to pay arrearages.\u201d <em>Mastropole v. Mastropole, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>130, 141, 436 A.2d 955 (App.Div.1981); <em>see also Weitzman v. Weitzman, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 358, 549 A.2d 888 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif. denied, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>505, 555 A.2d 623 (1989); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Brennan v. Brennan, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 357, 454 A.2d 901 (App.Div.1982); <em>Winter v. Winter, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>456, 461, 393 A.2d 593 (App.Div.1978). However, this discretion does not relieve the court of the responsibility of providing reasons for its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In <em>Mastropole, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 140, 436 A.2d 955, the defendant contended on appeal that the trial judge erred in failing to determine the amount of arrearages in alimony and child support due from plaintiff. Defendant alleged that the trial court \u201cshould not have left the resolution of the issue of arrearages to agreement of counsel or a summary hearing at some future date.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In considering defendant\u2019s arguments, we held that \u201cthe trial judge should have determined the amounts of arrearages in alimony and support due to defendant.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We also held that \u201c[i]f there were disputed factual issues as to the amount of the arrearages, plaintiffs ability to pay the accumulated arrearages, or the amount of credits to which plaintiff was entitled, the trial judge should have conducted a plenary hearing and resolved the matter.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">We must not lose sight of the fact that the enforcement, collection, modification and extinguishment of unpaid arrearages in alimony and child support payments are matters addressed to the sound discretion of the court. <em>Each case demands careful examination and weighing ofaU of the essential facts.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\"><em>[Mastropole, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 141, 436 <em>A.2d </em>955 (citing <em>Tancredi v.

The trial court here did not appear to undertake such a careful weighing of all of the essential facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Further, it is well established that a trial court needs to state the reasons for its conclusions. <em>Rule </em>1:7-4, in pertinent part, states that \u201c[i]n civil actions tried without a jury and on every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>motion decided by written orders that are appealable as of right, the court shall, by an opinion or memorandum decision, either written or oral, find the facts and state its conclusions of law thereon.\u201d The \u201c[Qailure to perform that duty \u2018constitutes a disservice to the litigants, the attorneys and the appellate court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Curtis v. Finneran, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>563, 569-70, 417 A.2d 15 (1980) (quoting <em>Kenwood Assocs. v.

Monte, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>557, 564, 515 A.2d 1233 (App.Div.1986); <em>see also State v.

Without the benefit of such findings, it is impossible for an appellate court to perform its function of deciding whether the determination below is supported by substantial credible proof on the whole record. <em>Monte, supra, 212 N.J.Super. </em>at 565, 515 A.2d 1233. As we stated in <em>Monte, supra, </em>\u201c[t]rial judges should always state their reasons so that counsel and an appellate tribunal may be fully informed.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Consequently, the judgment affixing arrearages and establishing an order of payment must be reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court for redetermination on the record, supplemented by such additional proofs as the trial court and the parties may deem necessary and appropriate. Upon remand, the trial court should make findings and conclusions as required by <em>Rule </em>1:7-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">We are also satisfied that the trial court should reconsider defendant\u2019s claim that he paid the $349 premium for the life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>insurance on April 6, 1994 and make appropriate findings and conclusions as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Accordingly, the challenged provisions of the order under review are reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
