London in the net amounts of $43,200 for dental expenses and $7500 for past and future pain, suffering and emotional distress. Plaintiff cross-appeals from the amount of the judgment and requests additur, a new trial, and a further remand for a jury to determine whether punitive damages should be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-16\">The underlying facts are those of a typical damage claim based upon tetracycline having stained plaintiffs teeth when she was a young child. <em>See, e.g., Savage v.

Lederle Labs., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>49, 674 A.2d 1013 (App.Div.1996), also decided by us today, involves a similar claim by plaintiffs sister.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Plaintiff, Cathy London, was bom October 1, 1957. As a child, she periodically suffered from upper respiratory infections. During the first ten years of years of her life, she was treated for these illnesses exclusively by the family physician, Robert L. Pierce, M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Dr. Pierce regularly treated childhood infections with a particular class of antibiotics known as tetracycline. On fourteen different occasions from January 8, 1958 through September 4, 1964, Dr. Pierce prescribed various brands of tetracycline to treat plaintiffs infections; he specifically prescribed brands of tetracycline manufactured by defendant Lederle on eleven of those occasions. Until February 4, 1963, Dr. Pierce had prescribed for plaintiff only Achromycin and Declomycin, both of which are Lederle products. Thereafter, on April 4, 1963 and September 4, 1964, he supplied plaintiff with prescriptions for Terramycin, a Pfizer drug, and on May 6, 1964 he prescribed Mysteclin F, a Squibb product. Overall, plaintiff received tetracycline prescriptions twice in 1958; four times in 1959, twice in <em>1960, </em>once in 1961, once in 1962, twice in 1963 (one time from Lederle; one time from Pfizer), and twice in 1964 (one time from Squibb; one time from Pfizer).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The ingestion of tetracycline drugs, particularly during the period from birth through the time a child is approximately eight years old, has the capacity to stain and discolor bones and teeth. Plaintiffs teeth exhibit the type of staining associated with the use of tetracycline.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">At trial, Dr. Pierce testified that he would not have prescribed Achromycin and Declomycin when he did if he had been aware of their side effects, unless \u201cdue to other circumstances you can\u2019t use anything but.\u201d However, at a 1989 pre-trial deposition, the doctor had agreed that he was aware of the correlation between tetracycline and tooth-staining in March of 1964, prior to the time he prescribed the Squibb and Pfizer products. This statement was brought to the jury\u2019s attention during the doctor\u2019s cross-examination. The doctor further agreed that plaintiff had never presented an illness that would require him to \u201coverride [his] best judgment and use tetracycline to treat her although [he] knew that it was possibly going to stain [plaintiffs] teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Plaintiff testified that other children teased her about the discoloration of her teeth and she grew to be extremely self-conscious about smiling, shy and withdrawn. She would like to have had her teeth capped, but could not afford the cost due to her low-wage jobs. She is college educated, and originally considered a teaching career, but rejected teaching because of her shyness. Plaintiff\u2019s prosthodontist estimated that capping her entire mouth would cost $28,800 and that the caps would have to be replaced \u201ca couple of times\u201d or \u201cseveral times.\u201d He estimated that the caps provided in each procedure would have lasted ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The jury was presented with a series of twelve special interrogatories on which they noted their verdict. The interrogatories, along with the verdicts, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">1.

Defendant argues that this result negates proximate cause in that it constitutes a finding that defendant\u2019s failure to warn could not have been a substantial factor in plaintiffs injuries because even a timely warning would not have been heeded. Defendant contends that since plaintiff failed to prove proximate cause, judgment should have been entered in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The juiy\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Pierce would have prescribed tetracycline despite a warning from Lederle must be read in conjunction with its findings on question four. There, it responded that Dr. Pierce \u201cfailed to prescribe tetracycline for its intended purpose or in a way that was not reasonably foreseeable to Lederle\u201d on May 6, 1964 and on September 4, 1964 (after he received Lederle\u2019s warning in March of 1964). On these dates, he prescribed non-Lederle products, but the jury apparently reasoned that Lederle\u2019s warning would not have altered the doctor\u2019s behavior on these dates because there was evidence that he continued to prescribe tetracycline. But nowhere did the jury find specifically that Dr. Pierce would have prescribed tetracycline for plaintiff from birth to eight years of age had he known of the harmful effect. The jury may have meant to express this by its answer; it might also have just answered the interrogatory literally.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">A plaintiff asserting a cause of action based on failure to warn must establish all the same elements required for an action based on a defective product. <em>Coffman v. Keene Corp., </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>581, 594, 628 A.2d 710 (1993). Thus, plaintiff must prove that the product was defective, that the defect could cause injury to a reasonably foreseeable user, and that the defect was the proxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>mate cause of the plaintiffs damages. <em>Id. </em>at 593-94, 628 A.2d 710; <em>Freund v. Cellofilm Properties, Inc., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>229, 241, 432 A.2d 925 (1981). Generally, a product is considered to be defective when it is not \u201creasonably fit, suitable and safe for its intended or foreseeable purposes.\u201d <em>Freund v. Cellofilm, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 242, 432 A.2d 925 (quoting <em>Suter v. San Angelo Foundry &amp; Mach. Co., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>150, 176, 406 A.2d 140 (1979)). In a failure-to-wam case, the defect consists of the absence of a warning concerning the product\u2019s potential for injury, and the plaintiff must prove that the warning\u2019s absence was a proximate cause of the harm. <em>Coffman v. Keene Corp., </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 593-94, 628 A.2d 710; <em>see N.J.S.A </em>2A:58C-2. Where the failure-to-warn case involves a prescription drug, the issue is whether the warning should have been given to the prescribing physician; there is no requirement that the manufacturer warn the patient herself. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The plaintiff in a product defect case also has the burden of showing that the product was not misused or, if it was, that the misuse was objectively foreseeable. <em>Jurado v. Western Gear Works, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>375, 386, 619 A.2d 1312 (1993). Evidence of a plaintiffs misuse of a product is relevant to the issue of proximate cause because it may establish that the plaintiffs conduct was the cause-in-fact of the injury. <em>Johansen v. Makita U.S.A., Inc., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>86, 92, 102, 607 A.2d 637 (1992); <em>see also, Jurado, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 387, 619 A.2d 1312. In a non-drug case, the relevant evidence of \u201cmisuse\u201d would include a showing that the plaintiff either disregarded an adequate warning or would have done so had the warning been given. <em>See Coffman, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 604, 628 A.2d 710; <em>Calderon v. Machinenfabriek Bollegraaf Appingedam BV, </em>285 <em>N.J.Super. </em>623, 631-636, 667 A.2d 1111 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>174, 675 A.2d 1122 (1996); <em>Strumph v. Schering Corp., </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>309, 328, 606 A.2d 1140 (App.Div.1992) (Skillman, J.A.D., dissenting), <em>rev\u2019d on dissent, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>33, 626 A.2d 1090 (1993). In a prescription drug warning setting, a defendant drug manufacturer may not be held liable where the doctor testifies unequivocally that his or her decision to prescribe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the drug would not have been affected by the warning. <em>Strumph, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 328, 606 A.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The jury\u2019s response to interrogatory number four indicates that it believed the doctor\u2019s issuance of the prescriptions on those dates constituted a misuse of tetracycline: he had not used, the drugs for its intended purpose or in a way reasonably foreseeable to Lederle. However, Dr. Pierce prescribed Squibb and Pfizer tetracycline on those dates, not Lederle products.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Interrogatory nine neglected to provide the jury with a proper framework to consider the doctor\u2019s conduct because it contained the word \u201ctetracycline,\u201d in lieu of \u201cLederle\u2019s product.\u201d The broad wording of question nine could be read as asking if the doctor, after Lederle\u2019s warning, would have prescribed tetracycline to plaintiff at any age, under any circumstances. The jury determined in question one that Lederle had become aware of the dangers of tetracycline in 1958-59, at the very time plaintiff began to receive the first of her many prescriptions. The doctor also testified that, during the times he was prescribing Lederle\u2019s drugs, plaintiff had never faced an illness so serious that he could not have used other drugs. The interrogatory as worded, however, did not ask the jury to answer the real question: whether Dr. Pierce would have prescribed the drugs to a one year old child for relatively minor ailments, and whether he would have continued to do so throughout her childhood if he had received the warning at the time Lederle knew of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the danger. Instead, the question invited speculation. A more appropriate interrogatory might have read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">Had an adequate tooth staining warning been given by Lederle in [1958/59], would Cathy London\u2019s treating physician have prescribed Achromycin and Dedomycin to plaintiff at the times he did, and for the ailments he diagnosed on those occasions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The jury never passed judgment on the issue of whether Dr. Pierce would have prescribed the drug in the manner he did, the manner that actually caused the harm, if he had received the warning. The jury therefore never rendered a verdict on the issue of whether the absence of a warning regarding defendant\u2019s products was the proximate cause of plaintiffs harm. Since a jury verdict on an essential ingredient of plaintiffs cause of action is lacking, we must reverse and remand on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\n<em>b.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">In awarding plaintiff $86,000 compensatory damages in question ten, the jury also determined that the amount should be \u201cless 50% per question <em># </em>8.\u201d In question eight, the jury responded that 50% \u201cof the tooth staining existed while the product manufactured by Lederle was defective.\u201d It is unclear exactly what question eight asked the jury to determine. Was the jury being asked whether some of the tooth staining occurred after the warning, or before the time Lederle became aware of the dangers and therefore was required to provide the warning? If so, the jury\u2019s response appears inconsistent with its responses to other questions. Only two of the relevant fourteen ingestions occurred after the warning, and those were from other manufacturers. The jury had determined that all the ingestions of defendant\u2019s products were a substantial factor in causing the harm (question six), and it had replied that defendant had knowledge of the danger in 1958/59 (question one). Giving defendant the benefit of the doubt on the imprecise dates by excluding the 1958 dosages, still leaves defendant as having supplied a total of nine out of the remaining twelve ingestions from 1959 to 1964 (including those given after the warning), or nine out of ten ingestions from 1959 to 1964 (excluding those given after the warning). The amount of the reduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>is therefore inconsistent with the jury\u2019s answers to other interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The answer could be explained by the jury\u2019s finding that the condition was progressive, with the final two doses having far greater effect than the earlier ten and thus being responsible for half of the damages. Defendant suggests this in its brief. It should be noted, however, that defendant mischaracterizes Dr. Haupt\u2019s testimony as suggesting that the later doses were \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201d In fact, Dr. Haupt testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">It is somewhat akin to, gosh, the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. You know, you can\u2019t say any one particular straw did it but when you have enough of it one on top of the other then you have the effect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>regarding the elements that define each [claim] and the evidence that may be considered in support of, on the one hand, strict products liability and, on the other, the damages that liability can support by way of punishment of the defendant manufacturer or distributer of the defective product. The jury must not be misled into believing that the distinct elements of either are a requirement or necessarily relevant to the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>At no point does Dr. Haupt say, as defendant does in its brief, that \u201cthe addition of the staining from the late ingestions disproportionately increases the visibility of the stain.\u201d Instead, the doctor testified that a \u201cshort course may indeed escape clinical staining.\u201d However, plaintiff had eleven prescriptions for defendant\u2019s products over the first six years of her life, and there was no testimony that such a pattern constituted a \u201cshort course.\u201d Thus, it was more likely that one of defendant\u2019s doses was the proverbial straw. In fact, Dr. Haupt testified that, after initial formation, teeth develop from the outside in, so that earlier ingestions of the drug between the ages of one and five would have had greater effect. Perhaps the jury found that the earlier doses created one-half of the total staining, including even the portion attributable to later silver/amalgam fillings, but we cannot tell from this interrogatory answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Finally, in halving the award in question ten, the jury definitely misunderstood or disregarded the judge\u2019s charge. He had explicitly told them not to apply any percentages to the award, but he did so in language that repeatedly referred to reducing the award by fifty percent. While it is clear that the jury in its answer to interrogatory number ten took a step the judge had told them not to take, stating that the award should be halved, that small error is harmless as it is an expected result of our giving juries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u201cultimate outcome\u201d charges. <em>See Roman v. Mitchell, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>336, 345-347, 413 A.2d 322 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The judge is permitted to comment on and assess evidence, \u201cas long as he leaves to the jury the ultimate determination of the facts, and rendering of the verdict on the facts as it finds them.\u201d He did so here. <em>State v. Ward, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>75, 79, 270 A.2d 1 (1970); <em>see also Weed v. Casie Enters., </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>517, 529-30, 653 A.2d 603 (App.Div.1995); <em>Graves v. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc., </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 467, 631 A.2d 1248 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>566, 636 A.2d 523 (1993); <em>Dafler v. Raymark Indus., Inc., </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>17, 37, 611 A.2d 136 (App.Div.1992), <em>aff'd o.b., 132 N.J. </em>96, 622 A.2d 1305 (1993). However, his repeated references to the fifty percent figure had a potential to influence the jury in this case because the jury had heard testimony that silver/amalgam fillings in half of plaintiffs teeth may have stained those teeth irrespective of the tetracycline use. The jury\u2019s response simply may have been an expression of its acceptance of that testimony. But, once again, the imprecise wording of the interrogatories leaves us unable to determine the jury\u2019s verdict on an issue. A more accurate interrogatory number eight might have asked the jury, \u201cWhat portion, if any, of plaintiffs tooth staining was caused by, or, can be attributed to plaintiffs use of Achromycin and Deciomycin during the period when Lederle\u2019s product lacked adequate warnings?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The judge explained his denial of additur on the fifty percent reduction by saying that the jury was \u201cvery clear.\u201d We, however, do not see this clarity and remain confused. Interrogatory eight as written and answered was so ambiguous that the fifty percent figure itself must be rejected. On remand, if damages are awarded, allocation should be made pursuant to a properly worded special interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">\n<em>c.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Plaintiff next argues that the jury\u2019s $15,000 award for past and future pain and suffering is so \u201cshockingly insufficient\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>that it requires that this court grant additur or a new trial on damages, both of which were denied by the trial court. A trial court should not interfere with a jury\u2019s damage award unless the award is so disproportionate as to \u201cshock the conscience\u201d and the result therefore \u201cmanifestly unjust.\u201d <em>Ryan v. KDI Sylvan Pools, Inc., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>276, 297, 579 A.2d 1241 (1990); <em>Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 603-604, 379 A.2d 225 (1977). Under <em>R. </em>4:49-1(a), it must \u201cclearly and convincingly appear that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d \u201cThe same standard applies to an appellate court reviewing a trial judge\u2019s determination, except that the trial court\u2019s opportunity to develop a \u2018feel of the case\u2019 is entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Amaru v. Stratton, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 21, 506 A.2d 1225 (App.Div.1985) (quoting <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. 2, </em>7, 258 A.2d 706 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Acknowledging that the verdict was low, the trial judge observed that plaintiff \u201cwas such a stoic ... the sad thing is there might have been by virtue of the fact that she \u2014 these green teeth warped her for life____\u201d The judge said the verdict \u201calmost\u201d shocked him and he was \u201cnot comfortable\u201d with the decision, but he was not inclined to change it.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Plaintiff had held several low-paying jobs with periods of unemployment. Although she had trained to be a physical education teacher, she testified that she had had difficulty teaching classes because she was very self-conscious about her appearance and her teeth. At the time of the trial, plaintiff worked in a factory job in Maine. Unfortunately, much of the evidence plaintiff presented regarding her general shyness could have applied to many people. She also did not show any evidence regarding the salary difference between a teacher and someone doing her job. Her condition was not physically painful, nor are the future treatments she would have to endure. We have examined all New Jersey cases dealing with tetracycline to see if there is a range of damages to which we can compare this award. We have found none. From out-of-state authority there is only one case that discusses the subject. In <em>Kliebert v. Upjohn Co., </em>915 <em>F.</em>2d 142 (1990), <em>vacated and dis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>missed on settlement, </em>947 F.2d 736 (5th Cir.1991), the court was concerned with whether a plaintiffs damage claim of $10,000 was reduced to frustrate defendant\u2019s efforts to transfer the matter to the federal court under its diversity jurisdiction that required an amount in controversy over $10,000. The plaintiff had, however, offered to settle for that amount. The defendant made a survey of awards for tetracycline tooth-staining, and found a range of recovery from $65,000 to $110,000, depending upon the severity of the discoloration. <em>Id. </em>at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Here the total award was $101,400 before the damages were halved. Even considering the inflationary factor between the 1990 decision in <em>Kliebert </em>and the 1994 trial in this case, plaintiffs award was on the high side of the range described in <em>Kliebert </em>and therefore not so shockingly low as to satisfy the additur or new trial standards of <em>R. </em>4:49-1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\n<em>d.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Plaintiff lastly contends that because <em>Herman v. Sunshine Chemical Specialties, Inc., </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>329, 346, 627 A.2d 1081 (1993) required that she present her claims for compensatory and punitive damages in bifurcated trials, she had not attempted during the trial to present complete evidence on the punitive damages issue. Defendant argues that plaintiff nevertheless had presented evidence which she hoped would support a punitive damages claim and so she is not entitled to a separate trial on the issue. The trial court mistakenly believed that separating the claims would eventually require three trials, and it allowed the jury to consider the liability portion of both the punitive damage and compensatory damage issues at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Plaintiff acknowledges that, since her claim was filed in 1986, her case arises prior to the July 22, 1987 effective date of the Products Liability Act which would have statutorily required a bifurcated trial. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-5 (amended by Punitive Damages Act, <em>L. </em>1995, c. 142, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-5.9 to 5.17, to encompass all punitive damage claims). However, in argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>before the trial court, plaintiff pointed to the language in <em>Herman, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 346, 627 A.2d 1081, directing that \u201cthose requirements [for a bifurcated trial should] govern all claims, even those that arise outside the [Products Liability Act].\u201d <em>See also Perth Amboy Iron Works v. American Home Assur. Co., </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>200, 227 n. 23, 543 A.2d 1020 (App.Div.1988), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>249, 571 A.2d 294 (1990). Although the Legislature set a later specified date for the applicability of the new Punitive Damages Act, the bifurcated trial provisions were largely declarative of the then-existing common law under <em>Herman, </em>but in addition to other prospective changes added a new \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The judge incorrectly combined the two aspects of the trial. We find, however, that this alone was not reversible error. The bifurcation is for the defendant\u2019s benefit and defendant has not raised this issue. Were this the only problem with the punitive damage claim, we would not disturb the verdict. However, plaintiff claims that she had not presented her full proofs concerning punitive damages during the liability and compensative damage phase of the case. She was forced to argue for punitive damages based on only a fraction of the proof she intended to present.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Prior to <em>Herman </em>and the Products Liability Act, liability issues and punitive damage issues were regularly litigated together. <em>See, e.g., Fischer v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>643, 655, 512 A.2d 466 (1986). However, the Court cautioned that a jury considering both claims must receive specific instructions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 672, 512 A.2d 466].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>The instructions are necessary because, in order to support a punitive damages claim, a plaintiff must show a \u201ca great deal ... about a defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d that is unnecessary or irrelevant to the warning defect claim. Id. at 654, 512 A.2d 466. Therefore, the trial court must \u201ccarefully\u201d explain \u201cthe purpose and nature of punitive damages\u201d and provide the jury with relevant factors to consider such as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">the seriousness of the hazard to the public; the. degree of the defendant\u2019s awareness of the hazard and of its <em>exeessiveness; </em>the cost of correcting or reducing the risk; the duration of both the improper marketing behavior and its cover-up; the attitude and conduct of the enterprise upon discovery of the misconduct; and the defendant\u2019s reasons for failing to act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 072-73, 512 A.q2d 466],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">In contest, here, the court\u2019s entire charge on punitive damages was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">In addition to the claims of damages already mentioned, you should consider whether plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages which are awarded in exceptional eases as the punishment of the defendant and as a deterrent to others from following his or her example. You may award such damages if you determine that the defendant\u2019s acts or omissions were actuated by one[,] actual malice, which is nothing more or less than intentional wrongdoing, an evil minded act, or two, an act accompanied by a wanton and lawful disregard of the rights of another. In other words, a deliberate act <em>or </em>omission with nods [sic] of a high degree <em>of </em>probability of harm to another and reckless indifference to the consequences of his or her or its omission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Therefore, even if we agree <em>arguendo </em>that defendant\u2019s position is correct that plaintiff had sufficiently presented the jury with all available evidence relating to punitive damages, the jury was not given the necessary tools to evaluate the punitive damage evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">\n<em>e.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">The matter must be remanded for a new trial on the issues of (1) whether defendant\u2019s failure to warn was a proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries, and if the jury so determines, (2) how the compensatory damages should be allocated, and (3), applying the procedures dictated by <em>Herman v. Sunshine Chemical Specialties, Inc. </em>and the appropriate jury instructions, whether punitive dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ages are to be awarded to plaintiff. The balance of the jury\u2019s findings shall stand and be incorporated in the new judgment, if any, against defendant. As we have noted in the companion case of <em>Batson v. Lederle Laboratories, </em>the two cases are to be consolidated for the trial in <em>Batson </em>and the retrial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Reversed and remanded for a limited new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\">A third case, <em>Robert London v. Lederle Laboratories, </em>was decided by this court in 1992 when we dismissed the claim on statute of limitations grounds. A-4840-90T1 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>14, 611 A.2d 652 (1992). Robert recently attempted to reopen his claim after the decisions in <em>Savage v. Old Bridge-Sayreville Med. Group, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>417, 616 A.2d 1307 (App.Div.1992), <em>aff'd, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>241, 633 A.2d 514 (1993). We rejected the application earlier this term. <em>London v. Lederle Laboratories, </em>A-4010-94T1 (App.Div.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\"> She also received a prescription for a tetracycline manufactured by Lederle when she was sixteen years old. This latter prescription, however, has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>bearing on this case because, at sixteen, plaintiff was beyond the age of the drug\u2019s adverse effects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-5\"> While the jury had no way of knowing what information Squibb and Pfizer conveyed to Dr. Pierce, the doctor testified that the three products were essentially similar. In fact, we note that the Physicians' Desk Reference for 1964 shows warnings for both the Squibb and Pfizer drugs similar to that included in Lederle\u2019s 1964 warnings for Achromycin. (Lederle failed to include Declomycin in the 1964 book because it had already gone to press, but a letter was sent directly to physicians). There was no reference to the tooth-staining problem for any of these drugs in the 1963 edition of the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference. Dr. Pierce\u2019s answer to the deposition question concerning Lederle\u2019s product cannot in fact be differentiated from his knowledge of the Squibb or Pfizer products. There was evidence, therefore, that he knew of their tooth-staining propensities when he wrote the 1964 prescriptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
