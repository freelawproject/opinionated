We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>For purposes of this appeal, as on the motion, we accept plaintiffs deposition testimony that he was injured by stepping into a pothole in a parking lot as he was walking towards his car with key in hand, right arm extended, reaching for the lock. His wife had \u201cjust about\u201d gotten to the passenger door. Plaintiff first made contact with his car \u201c[o]n my way down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">As amended by <em>L. </em>1983, <em>c. </em>362, \u00a7 7, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 requires that every automobile liability insurance policy \u201cshall provide personal injury protection coverage ... to the named insured and members of his family residing in his household who sustained bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile.\u201d Plaintiff argues that this language must be interpreted to provide coverage on the above facts. Neither party has favored us with the text of the actual insuring agreement, but as the arguments center upon the quoted statutory language, we may safely assume that the policy follows the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Relying upon <em>Morgan v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>638, 577 A.2d 1300 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>370, 585 A.2d 377 (1990), and <em>Kordell v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>505, 554 A.2d 1 (AppDiv.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>43, 563 A.2d 813 (1989), the motion judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">Pursuant to the wording, and the purpose of the statute at issue, the Court is satisfied that the plaintiff in this case, is not covered by the statute, when the vehicles doors were closed, and locked, and the keys have not yet been inserted in the keyhole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">The plaintiff, under these circumstances, cannot be deemed to be entering, under <em>[N.J.S.A.] </em>39:6A-4. The Court is also satisfied that there is no causal link between the vehicle and the accident to allow for PIP benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">The mere fact that an automobile is in the vicinity of an accident, does not transform that accident into one for which PIP benefits are available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Plaintiff urges on appeal that this analysis is faulty because the clear intent of the Legislature in using the words \u201centering into ... an automobile\u201d was to broaden the statute to include people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>entering into a vehicle. The prior language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 required payment of PIP benefits to an insured who sustained bodily injury as a result of an accident \u201cinvolving an automobile.\u201d <em>See Vasil v. Zullo, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>572, 576, 570 A.2d 464 (App.Div. 1990). Plaintiff says that it was his intention to reach out his hand for the purpose of opening the door to the vehicle and that this intent, coupled with proximity of the automobile, is sufficient to provide a nexus supportive of PIP coverage. He points out that he would not have been at the location except to enter his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In <em>Lindstrom v. Hanover Insurance Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>242, 649 A.2d 1272 (1994), the Court recognized the statutory admonition that the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act must be \u201c \u2018liberally construed so as to effect the purpose thereof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247, 649 A.2d 1272 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-16).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Necessarily, however, <em>Lindstrom </em>also recognized that the 1983 amendment to section four of the Act was intended to restrict coverage, particularly as to the earlier broad judicial readings given to the words \u201cinvolving an automobile.\u201d The Court set out as an appropriate test the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations concerning first party coverage, but recognized that \u201c[a]ccidents that do not arise out of the use of an automobile or are not of the type that are within the contemplation of the parties do not fulfill the test\u2019s requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251, 649 A.2d 1272. It is significant that the Court also cited with favor the <em>Morgan </em>and <em>Kordell </em>cases relied upon by the motion judge, as well as our decisions in <em>Vasil, supra, </em>and <em>Uzcatequi-Gaymon v. New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Co., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>71, 472 A.2d 163 (App.Div.1984). Earlier cases, such as <em>Purdy v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>123, 445 A.2d 424 (App.Div. 1982), and <em>Vicari v. Nationwide Insurance, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 416 A.2d 977 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>464, 427 A.2d 562 (1980), decided before the 1983 amendment to section four, had afforded PIP benefits where an automobile influenced the actions of the injured party without contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>In <em>Ingraham v. Travelers Cos., </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 524 A.2d 1319 (App.Div.1987), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>67, 539 A.2d 733 (1988), we recognized that the legislative intent of <em>L. </em>1983, c. 362, \u00a7 7 \u201cmost certainly was to reverse the results of then-recent cases broadly construing the phrase \u2018involving an automobile,\u2019 \u201d such as <em>Purdy </em>and <em>Vicari. Ingraham, supra, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 129, 524 A.2d 1319. Contrary to plaintiffs assertion, the amending words \u201coccupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile\u201d were not intended to broaden the reach of section four, but to limit it. As we noted in <em>Vasil, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 576, 570 A.2d 464, the Introductory Statement to Assembly Bill 3981, later enacted as chapter 362, read: \u201cThese provisions mainly are designed to tighten statutory eligibility requirements for personal injury protection coverage so as to comport with the original intent of the no-fault law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Judge Brody summarized the statutory change in <em>Morgan, supra, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 642, 577 A.2d 1300, saying: \u201cthe Legislature ... did not intend that PIP coverage provide protection to people injured in accidents for which there would not have been automobile liability coverage even if fault could be established.\u201d This case involves interpretation of a statute, not resolution of an ambiguous policy provision dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We believe, given the clearly restrictive intent of the 1983 amendment, that its language precludes a judicial interpretation that the insured\u2019s fall in this case was legislatively intended to be covered by the personal injury protection provisions of the statute. We accept as true plaintiffs contention that he only encountered the pothole because he was about to enter his car. Practically everyone who traverses a parking lot, however, has just alighted from a car or is heading for a car with the intent to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The statute uses the words, \u201cwhile occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile.\u201d The word \u201centering\u201d is alone sufficient to denote the process of crossing some threshold, not merely approaching it. It was legislatively coupled with the words \u201cwhile\u201d and \u201cinto\u201d with the announced purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>tightening eligibility. The word \u201cinto\u201d is described by <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>634 (1987) as \u201cused as a function word to indicate entry, introduction, insertion, superposition, or inclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">If mere proximity to the intended point of entry, coupled with a demonstration of intent to enter, were to be deemed sufficient under the statute, highly subjective and indefinite assessments would have to be made. What distance would be deemed sufficiently close? How much intent to enter would have to be manifested? A \u201cbright line\u201d is preferable.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">We hold that \u201cwhile entering into\u201d was intended by the Legislature to denote a process of entry which begins, at the earliest, when physical contact with the vehicle is made with intent to enter. Here, the accidental fall occurred prior to that point in time. The later incidental contact with the vehicle came about not during entry, but as a result of the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">We believe that our decision is consistent with <em>Lindstrom. </em>That decision, it must be remembered, concerned a \u201cstranger\u201d pedestrian, not, as here, a named insured. This distinction and a history of the restrictive legislative purpose in enacting the 1983 amendment was carefully set forth in <em>Darel v. Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association Insurance Co., </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>416, 422-23, 555 A.2d 570 (1989), by Justice Clifford, author of the majority opinion in <em>Lindstrom.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">The judgment of the Law Division is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-16\"> Defendant\u2019s brief asserts that plaintiff has also filed a separate action against the parking lot in which he fell. As both parties filed R. 4:5-1 certifications, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the record provided does not furnish support for the assertion, we do not address the <em>R. </em>4:30A entire controversy issue implicitly raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b605-10\">HUMPHREYS, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag5\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Plaintiff testified in his deposition that he was in the process of entering his car. He had his car key in his hand. It was dark, and he was trying to find the keyhole in the car door. As he was about to insert his key, he fell in a pot hole. As he fell, he came into contact with his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">The majority holds that even when \u201cviewed in the light most favorable\u201d to the plaintiff and granting the plaintiff \u201call the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>favorable inferences,\u201d <em>see Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 536, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), a rational fact finder could not conclude from these facts that the plaintiff was injured while \u201centering into\u201d his automobile. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A. 39:6A-A This holding is contrary to fundamental principles governing the construction of this statute as well as to the reasonable expectations of an insured as to his insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The underlying principles of our New Jersey no fault insurance statutes were set forth by Justice Clifford in <em>Lindstrom v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>242, 247-248, 649 A.2d 1272 (1994) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">We begin by setting out the basic principles that guide our deliberation. New Jersey\u2019s no-fault compulsoiy automobile-insurance scheme, found in the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>29:(sic)6A-l to -35 (the Act), must be \u201cliberally construed so as to effect the purpose thereof____\u201d This Court has characterized PIP coverage as \u201c \u2018a social necessity that should be given \u2018the broadest application consistent with the statutory language----\u2019 \u201d Such a broad application represents public policy favoring coverage____ Insureds are entitled to coverage in accordance with their objectively-reasonable expectations that are supported by any fair interpretation of the law____ In respect of the occurrence, the Legislature sought to ensure \u201cthe broadest coverage possible so long as an automobile was involved in that which happened----\u201d Accordingly, \u201cwhere the Legislature has \u2018made a choice of language [that] fairly brings a given situation within a statute, it is unimportant that the particular application may not have been contemplated by the legislators____\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-17\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-18\">The Court in <em>Lindstrom </em>said: \u201cThe 1984 amendment tightened PIP eligibility requirements generally, ... but broadened coverage for family-member pedestrians. <em>Moreover, section four continued to provide the broadest protection consistent with its language.\u201d Id. </em>at 248, 649 A.2d 1272 (emphasis added). Section four contains the \u201centering into\u201d language construed in this appeal; thus that language should be construed to provide the \u201cbroadest protection consistent with its language.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-19\">The Court in <em>Lindstrom </em>described the broad scope of Section four as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-20\">After the restrictive language of the 1983 amendment, the trend in the development of section four has been to broaden family-member pedestrian coverage somewhat. Although to trigger PIP coverage the automobile must provide more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>than merely the setting for the accident, <em>no amendment has changed the requirement that the Act be liberally construed to give the broadest application consistent with its language. The guiding principle remains intact: to accommodate the public interest behind the Act, courts must favor the insured and find coverage if possible.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\"><em>[Lindstrom, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 249, 649 A.2d 1272 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The Court in <em>Lindstrom </em>held that the facts there revealed a substantial nexus between the accident and the use of the automobile. PIP coverage was therefore found for a \u201cdrive-by\u201d shooting of a person attending an outdoor party. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 649 A.2d 1272. <em>See also Burns v. Market Transition Facility of New Jersey, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 309-311, 657 A.2d 472 (App.Div.1995) (good Samaritan rendering aid to injured driver has substantial nexus with use of the car and therefore is entitled to PIP coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The principles set forth in <em>Lindstrom </em>compel a finding of coverage here. A liberal and broad construction of the statute is plainly contravened by a holding that because the plaintiffs key did not quite reach the keyhole, he is as a matter of law not entitled to coverage from his insurance company. Such a mechanistic approach does not accord with the \u201cguiding principle\u201d that \u201ccourts must favor the insured and find coverage if possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 649 A.2d 1272. Moreover, the ordinary and reasonable expectations of an insured would be that when he is about to insert his key in the keyhole of his car, he is \u201centering into\u201d his car and therefore entitled to PIP coverage by his insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The majority fashions a bright line test. Did the key hit or not hit the keyhole? The proper test, however, is whether a trier of fact could reasonably find that the injury had a substantial nexus with the use of an automobile. <em>Lindstrom, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 246, 649 A.2d 1272. Summary judgment on this fact sensitive issue should not have been entered against the insured. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 523, 666 A.2d 146; <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67, 74, 110 A.2d 24 (1954). The majority opinion in this ease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>is out of step with New Jersey\u2019s no fault insurance law. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
