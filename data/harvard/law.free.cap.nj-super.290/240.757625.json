The State failed to move for forfeiture under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21(d)(l) within 45 days and defendant demanded return of the guns. The State claims that 18 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8) of the federal firearms statute prohibits return of the guns. We agree that defendant has no immediate right to the guns and reverse the order of the Family Part judge requiring their return to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">A.V., of Jersey City, was involved in a romantic relationship with defendant for about ten months in 1993-1994. During this period, defendant had the keys to A.V.\u2019s apartment, where he kept some clothes and stayed overnight on a few occasions each month. A.V. claimed that on several occasions defendant threatened that he \u201cwas gonna put drugs in me, he was gonna shoot me or he was gonna burn my car down.\u201d A.V. also testified that defendant hit her on one occasion and slapped her son, age four, in the face with an open hand, apparently in April 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">On the evening of June 20, 1994 defendant became upset. On the day before, A.V. had said she could not go to the beach with him because she had to care for her son who was ill. Defendant was friendly with A.V.\u2019s brothers and he went to the beach with them instead. When defendant returned from the beach, he cursed repeatedly at <em>AN., </em>cut the cord on her air conditioner, broke her car radio, ripped and burned personal photographs, broke her picture frames, and took her dining-room furniture and most of her clothes. A.V. testified at a later proceeding that defendant \u201cwanted to hit me [during the beach argument] and I did not let him hit me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>A.V. testified that she was afraid of defendant \u201cbecause he\u2019s really crazy,\u201d but admitted she waited two months before seeking a domestic violence restraining order because she \u201cthought that he was only talking.\u201d A.V. believed defendant was following her to her work. He told her over the phone that he knew where she was working at a new job in Hoboken. As a homemaker for Health Force, A.V. assisted patients at various locations; she testified that defendant knew all of them. A.V. first stated, unambiguously, that \u201cI know that he\u2019s following me to my job,\u201d but then moments later stated, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that he\u2019s following me,....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">At the time of the August 17, 1994 hearing on the temporary restraining order (TRO), A.V. said she had not seen or spoken with defendant for three weeks but that defendant always asked her brothers and brother-in-law about her. A.V. stated that she \u201cbeeped\u201d defendant in July and he told her to call him \u201cto continue talking about these things.\u201d They also argued over whether defendant would compensate A.V. for her car radio which he broke. She refused to accept $100 which defendant sent through her brother because the radio cost more. A.V. testified in general terms that \u201che used to say to me,\u201d including when they last spoke three weeks before the hearing, \u201cthat whenever he sees me, he\u2019s gonna do something to me.\u201d She later testified, at the final hearing on the restraining order, that defendant had never threatened her with a gun. She did not believe he was going to shoot her with one of his guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">A.V. testified that defendant always carried, on his person or in a bag, at least one small gun. He once showed her what she understood was a permit to carry. Defendant carried the gun, A.V. said, because \u201che has a lot of problems, not only with me but with a lot of people.\u201d <em>AN. </em>said defendant was employed but she did not know what type of work he did. She thought perhaps he was a truck driver, as he had a trailer truck. He told her that he formerly was a police officer and had worked for the FBI. A.V. recalled that the police frequently came to her house and picked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>up defendant \u201cat any time.\u201d She could not identify whether the police who picked up defendant were Jersey City police, Hudson County police, or some other kind of police. She did not know where defendant went with them. <em>AN. </em>also said that the Jersey City police officers were \u201call very good friends with\u201d defendant. She did not believe that defendant was a police officer but remembered that he had a uniform and a badge which he never used. She did not say what kind of uniform, but she apparently meant a police uniform. Defendant remarked in his testimony that he knew the local prosecutor, Mr. Posner.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">On August 17, 1994 the hearing officer granted <em>AN. </em>a TRO under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-12(f) as necessary to protect her life, health or well-being. The TRO prohibited defendant from returning to A.V.\u2019s apartment; appearing in or around any of AV.\u2019s places of work; committing any future acts of domestic violence; having any contact with A.V. or any of her household members; and making any harassing communications to A.V. or her roommate or clients. The TRO also prohibited defendant from possessing any weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The return date of the August 17, 1994 TRO was August 26, 1994. Defendant did not appear. Notice had been sent to him at 47 Logan Avenue, Jersey City, which A.V. testified was his last known address, to the best of her knowledge. At the TRO hearing on August 17, A.V. testified that while defendant was dating her he lived and received his mail at 47 Logan Avenue, Jersey City, where his relatives lived. A.V. said the house at 47 Logan belonged to defendant\u2019s father but she did not know who actually lived there because his parents lived on a \u201cVan Ripen\u201d Avenue. She then said that in June 1994 defendant lived with his parents not at 47 Logan but at another address on \u201cVan Ripen.\u201d The hearing officer concluded, \u201cwe have no address on him----\u201d The State later conceded, \u201cWe\u2019ve checked with the post office and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>apparently the defendant has not been there [47 Logan] in the past five years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">At the August 26 continued TRO proceeding, the judge decided to send notice to defendant by certified mail at 47 Logan Avenue and continued the TRO hearing until September 2, 1994 because defendant was again not present. On September 2, 1994, at the final restraining order hearing, the judge made the order final and issued a warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest, relying on <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:33-4(a) (petty disorderly-persons offense, offensive communication to another). The order also provided that the police confiscate defendant\u2019s guns and firearm purchaser identification card.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">On September 6, 1994 defendant finally appeared in court. He claimed that he was not aware that a restraining order had been issued against him because the notice of hearing had been sent to his \u201cold address.\u201d He explained that he found out about the warrant for his arrest from his brother. The judge issued an amended TRO on September 6, 1994 making two changes from the September 2 order: first, it prohibited defendant from having contact with AV.\u2019s <em>family or </em>household members rather than just AV.; second, it prohibited defendant from making harassing communications to AV.\u2019s son also, rather than just AV. The judge\u2019s September 6, 1994 order recalled the warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest, with the understanding that he would arrange to turn his guns in to the police. The Hudson County Sheriff confiscated defendant\u2019s guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The final restraining order hearing originally scheduled for September 27, 1994 was rescheduled for October 12, 1994 at the request of defendant\u2019s attorney because of a conflicting trial obligation. The judge continued the restraining order against defendant until the new October 12, 1994 hearing date. On this date, defendant and AV. stipulated before the judge that each had committed acts of domestic violence against the other and that they sought mutual restraining orders. On September 8 defendant had filed a domestic violence complaint alleging that AV. had committed an act of domestic violence against him on August 25. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>AY. acknowledged that she \u201cbeeped\u201d defendant on his pager for no reason at all but denied that she had gone to his home uninvited. Defendant, in turn, admitted that he had threatened AV. with some unspecified consequence if she did not stop calling him on the beeper. The judge entered a restraining order against AV., prohibiting her from going either to defendant\u2019s home or to a car wash which he owned, and from contacting him by beeper, by phone, by mail, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">At this same hearing, the judge also denied defendant\u2019s application to return the guns. The judge stated, however, that the guns would be returned to defendant if the State failed to file a motion for forfeiture, as required by the statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25 \u2014 21(d)(3), within 45 days of the seizure. The Sheriffs inventory described the seized guns as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">Below weapons and firearms I.D.

Because the State had failed to move to forfeit defendant\u2019s guns within 45 days of seizure as required by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21(d)(3), the judge ordered the guns and firearms purchaser\u2019s identification card returned. The judge said that defendant might possibly be prohibited from possessing a firearm by both a state statute and a federal statute but left it up to defendant and the State to litigate the point if the State should later move under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:58-3(c)(6) for revocation of the purchaser\u2019s identification card because defendant was under a domestic violence order.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:58-3(e)(6) prohibits the issuance of a handgun purchase permit or firearms-purchaser identification card to a person who is subject to a domestic violence court order under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-29. The federal statute purportedly applicable is 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8), which forbids firearms possession by anyone subject to a domestic-violence order which meets certain criteria. The judge thought that 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8) is applicable only when the gun owner is charged with a federal offense, or perhaps when defendant is tried in a federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The judge stayed his order to return the guns to the defendant to permit the State to appeal the issue of whether 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8) applied. The prosecutor now contends that 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8) controls and preempts the New Jersey statutory scheme. The prosecutor asserts that even if New Jersey law is construed to require return of the guns, federal law prohibits their return.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The federal statute, 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">(8) who is subject to a court order that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">(A) was issued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice, and at which such person had an opportunity to participate; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">(B) restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-14\">(C) (i) includes a finding that such person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-15\">(ii) by its terms explicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-16\">to ... possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition;____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-17\">18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8) was added to the firearms law by \u00a7 110401(c) of Pub. Law 103-322, as part of the Violent Crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. That act amended Title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, <em>see generally </em>42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 13701 to \u00a7 14223. That comprehensive 1994 statute was enacted \u201cto allow grants to increase police presence, to expand and improve cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and members of the community to address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise to enhance public safety.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 324, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (Nov. 3, 1993), reprinted in 1994 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N. </em>1801 and at 1993 WL 452531.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The State statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21(d), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">d. (1) In addition to a law enforcement officer\u2019s authority to seize any weapon that is contraband, evidence or an instrumentality of crime, a law enforcement officer who has probable cause to believe that an act of domestic violence has been committed may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">(a) question persons present to determine whether there are weapons on the premises; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">(b) upon observing or learning that a weapon is present on the premises, seize any weapon that the officer reasonably believes would expose the victim to a risk of serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">(2) A law enforcement officer shall deliver all weapons seized pursuant to this section to the county prosecutor and shall append an inventory of all seized weapons to the domestic violence report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">(3) <em>Weapons seized in accordance with the above shall be returned to the owner except upon order of the Superior Court. </em>The prosecutor who has possession of the seized weapons may, upon notice to the owner, petition a judge of the Family Part of the Superior Court, Chancery Division, within 45 days of seizure, to obtain title to the seized weapons, or to revoke any and all permits, licenses and other authorizations for the use, possession, or ownership of such weapons pursuant to the law governing such use, possession, or ownership, or may object to the return of the weapons on such grounds as are provided for the initial rejection or later revocation of the authorizations, <em>or on the grounds that, the owner is unfit or that the owner poses a threat to the public in general or a person or persons in particular.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">A hearing shall be held and a record made thereof within 15 days of the notice provided above. No formal pleading and no filing fee shall be required as a preliminary to such hearing. The hearing shall be summary in nature. Appeals from the results of the hearing shall be to the Superior Court, Appellate Division, in accordance with the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">\n<em>If the prosecutor does not institute an action within 45 days of seizure, the seized weapons shall be returned to the owner.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>After the hearing the court shall order the return of the firearms, weapons and any authorization papers relating to the seized weapons to the owner if the complaint has been dismissed at the request of the complainant and the prosecutor determines that there is insufficient probable cause to indict; or if the defendant is found not guilty of the charges; or <em>if the mart determines that the domestic molenee situation no longer exists. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">As seen, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21(d)(8) clearly provides, \u201cIf the prosecutor does not institute an action [for forfeiture] within 45 days of seizure, the seized weapons shall be returned to the owner.\u201d But this sentence must be read together with the part of subsection (d)(3) which provides, \u201cweapons seized in accordance with the above shall be returned to the owner <em>except </em>upon order of the Superior Court.\u201d Subsection (d)(3) clearly contemplates a forfeiture proceeding designed to revoke ownership if the prosecutor moves within 45 days but also clearly contemplates that no weapon shall be returned if the court finds \u201cthat the owner is unfit or that the owner poses a threat to the public in general or a person or persons in particular,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25 \u2014 21(d)(3), unless \u201cthe domestic violence situation no longer exists.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">We interpret our state statute to permit the State to seize weapons owned by a person who violates the Domestic Violence Act. The State may then retain possession of the weapons as long as the court deems that person a threat to the victim of domestic violence. In addition, the State has the right, within 45 days of the seizure, to seek a forfeiture of title to the weapons. The State did not do this in the present case. But the failure of the State to seek a forfeiture does not give the defendant the automatic right under New Jersey law to the return of the seized weapon so long as the domestic violence restraining order is outstanding. <em>See State v. Solomon, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>618, 624, 621 A.2d 559 (Ch.Div. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">To this extent, the federal (18 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8)) and our State <em>(N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21(d)(3)) statutes are harmonious and not in conflict. If the defendant is no longer a threat, the restraining order can be modified or dissolved and the weapons can be returned. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-29d; <em>A.B. v. L.M., </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>125, 672 A.2d 1296 (App.Div.1996); <em>Mann v. Mann, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>269, 274, 637 A.2d 170 (App.Div.1993); <em>Torres v. Lancellotti, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 607 A.2d 1375 (Ch.Div.1992). However, since the prosecutor did not move within 45 days, the guns cannot now under this section of the statute, absent new circumstances permitting forfeiture, be forfeited. We conclude that because the State and federal statutes, as we construe them, are not in actual conflict, the issue of federal preemption does not arise. The State statute, as we construe it, is consistent with the federal statute and does not stand as an impediment to the accomplishment and execution of the purposes and objectives of Congress in enacting 18 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8). See <em>Michigan Canners and Freezers Ass\u2019n. v. Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Bd., </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>461, 469, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2518, 2523, 81 L.Ed.2d 399 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The restraining order against defendant clearly satisfied the criteria of 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8)(B) and (C) which conditions the bar to firearm possession on whether the court order in question \u201crestrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person,----\u201d The second amended FRO against defendant, issued on September 6, 1994, states that defendant is \u201cprohibited from making harassing communications to ... [plaintiff A.V.] \u2014 and her Son \u2014 .\u201d (citing authority of N.J.S.A 2C:25-29b(7)). An earlier amended FRO, issued September 2, 1994, was replaced, apparently because it neglected to include A.V.\u2019s son within its protection. 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8)(C) states that the restraining order must \u201c(i) include[ ] a finding that such person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child; ____\u201d The domestic-violence restraining order recites, \u201cThe Court, having considered plaintiffs complaint ... and having found good cause to believe the plaintiff\u2019s life, health and well-being have been and are endangered by defendant(s) acts of violence.\u201d AV.\u2019s testimony provided ample support for the judge to make this finding, which satisfies \u00a7 922(g)(8)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The restraining order against defendant also satisfies the criterion enunciated in 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8)(A) that firearm possession is forbidden only if the restraining order in question \u201cwas issued after a hearing of which [the person subject to the order] received actual notice, and at which such person had an opportunity to participate; ____\u201d 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8)(A). The September 2, 1994 proceeding culminated in the issuance of a FRO against defendant and a warrant for his arrest. Defendant was not present and did not have notice of that proceeding. Defendant did appear at the September 6 proceeding, though only because his brother informed him that a warrant had been issued for his arrest pursuant to the September 2 amended final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The operative \u201ccourt order\u201d is the third amended final order. That order was issued after the October 12, 1994 hearing, a proceeding of which defendant had actual notice and at which he was present and represented by counsel. While it would have been better if defendant had received notice of the earlier hearings, he had actual notice of the October 12, 1994 hearing, which led to the issuance of the third and last FRO. He also had actual notice of and was present at the September 6,1994 hearing, which led to the issuance of the second amended FRO. He was present and represented by counsel and had an opportunity to participate fully in the October 12 hearing. In fact, the judge postponed the hearing from September 27 to accommodate other obligations of his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The restraining order to which defendant is subject satisfies all the criteria of 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8)(A) \u2014 (C). Consequently, at the time the judge ordered the State to return defendant\u2019s firearms to him, it was illegal under federal law for defendant to possess those firearms. The judge should not have so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The order of May 9, 1995 requiring the return of the guns and the firearm\u2019s purchaser identification card to defendant is reversed as a violation of 18 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8). The guns may not be returned to defendant so long as the domestic violence restraining order is outstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The cross-appeal is dismissed as untimely and clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:4-1; <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Reversed on the appeal; cross-appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-11\"> We note that defendant has presented no constitutional challenge to 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8).
