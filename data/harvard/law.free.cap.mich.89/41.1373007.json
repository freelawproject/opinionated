The defense outlined and followed was to show by parol evidence that the writing did not express the contract made by the parties, and this defense was admitted against the objections of plaintiff\u2019s counsel that it was immaterial, irrelevant, and tended to vary the terms of a written contract by parol evidence. There was no offer to show fraud or mistake, without which the evidence could not be considered; citing <em>Whitten v. Wright, </em>34 Mich. 94; and fraud will never be presumed; citing <em>Miller v. Finley, </em>26 Mich. 249; <em>Robert v. Morrin Estate, </em>27 Id. 306; <em>Cranson v. Smith, </em>37 Id. 309; <em>Darling v. Hurst, </em>39 Id. 765; <em>Allison v. Ward, </em>63 Id. 128.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-8\">2. This evidence showed that plaintiff and defendant had done no-business with each other for two years past, and it was a new contract, and stood entirely unrelated to any prior transaction: citing <em>Brady v. Insurance Co., </em>11 Mich. 443.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-10\">3. Defendant did not inquire what rights he would have under the new policy as to cancellation. All witnesses substantially-agree that he merely asked, \u201c Suppose the other company comes along and wants to cancel this policy, how will it come out?\u201d to which the agent replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think they will; this is as low as it can be written without loss;\u201d and defendant replied, \u201cIf that is the case, I will take out a policy.\u201d It was <em>rate </em>alone that the parties were considering, and the reply of the agent contained nothing to deceive or mislead the-defendant. It was simply an expression of his opinion that the rate he had given was as low as could be made without loss, and the expression of such opinion was not such a representation as would entitle the defendant to rely upon it. and did not constitute fraud; citing <em>Buck v. Sherman, </em>2 Doug. 182; <em>Berringer v. Cobb, </em>58 Mich. 561; <em>Allison v. Ward, </em>63 Id. 128, 137; <em>Lewless v. Railway Co., </em>65 Id. 292.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-12\">4. The court erred in permitting the defendant to answer the question, \u201c Had you read this policy?\u201d against plaintiff\u2019s objection that the same was immaterial and irrelevant, defendant being equally bound by the policy whether he had read it or not; citing <em>Cleaver v. Insurance Co., </em>65 Mich. 532, 71 Id. 417; Wood, Ins. \u00a7 503; <em>Pindar v. Insurance Co., </em>47 N.

The policy contained the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201cThis policy may also be canceled, at the request of' the assured, in case' of the sale, lease, transfer, or destruction of the boilers insured, or the buildings containing the same, or if the boiler or boilers shall cease to be used for a period of more than three months, provided the premium has been paid, in which case the company, after deducting the charges, for inspection and the customary short rates for the time the policy has; been in force, will return to the assured the remaining portion of the premium. But if this policy is delivered to or presented for cancellation through, by, or in the interest of any other boiler insurance company, no return premium will be paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The paragraph of the policy that contains the cancellation clause is in fine print</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The application was solicited by plaintiff\u2019s agent, was made out in the presence of and delivered to the agent,, and is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">\u201cApplication for Insurance to the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection <em>&amp; </em>Insurance Company, of Hartford,.

Cartier,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201cLudington, Mich.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The following appears on the back of the application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\u201c N. B. <em>To Agents: </em>Indicate form of policy desired by its designating letter in the space provided below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">\u201c Policy form: Special.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">On the 4th day of March, 1890, defendant wrote to plaintiff, requesting it to cancel the policy, and plaintiff refused to comply. No reason was assigned for the request. The policy was sent to the company, but the \u25a0 company refused to treat it as surrendered. It appeared .that this policy had been substituted for a policy which defendant held in another company, which is designated .\u2022as the \u201cAmerican.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s agent, one Brace, took the American policy, and allowed defendant $66.66 as its \u2022surrender value, and defendant agreed to pay the balance of the premium on the new policy of $133.33 on May 1 following.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">Defendant\u2019s version of the transaction is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\"><em>*\u2018Q. </em>Could you state how many policies you have \u00a1taken out in this company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-13\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Three.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-14\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now you may state what became of those policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-15\">\u201cA. The first policy that I took out with Mr. Brace .here, the Hartford Insurance Company, he induced me to surrender the policy I had with the American company, which I did, because he gave me a better rate than I was getting with the American. Well, it wasn\u2019t but a little while after the Hartford got this policy from me, the agent of the American come around, and offered me a better rate I had got from them. So I canceled with the Hartford, and got the American.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-16\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>How did you cancel; by letter, or in what way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The American Company, Mr. Brace took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>policy, and he wrote something on the face of it, stating that this policy was canceled, and the Hartford will take my risk, \u2014 something to that effect, \u2014 and then gave me credit. It was credited to pay on this policy, and it was. changed back and forth two or three different times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Was that the course of business in each case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir; it was with me. And this last policy that Mr. Brace got there he gpt me to take out, he says:. T will insure you for the same amount you carry on the five boilers, and will give you the same rate on eight boilers.\u2019 I says: \u2018If you get this policy out for me the American agent will come back and give me a better rate to cancel.\u2019 He says: \u2018They will not bother you, because we have got the best price; and, they will never see you again.\u2019 I says: \u2018If that is the case, I will take out a policy.\u2019' I took out a policy, and let him have the other policy, and it wasn\u2019t but a little while when the American agent came, and I insured with them, and wrote the company to cancel this policy, and they refused to do it on some ground they had in this policy, that I didn\u2019t know anything about, which they never had before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Had you read this policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, I never had. I merely read the face of it. Never read the by-laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Was there anything else said in regard to the policy, \u2014 any particular thing called to your attention in regard to the policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">\u201cA. At that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, there was nothing more said then. There was previous to that, \u2014 that he would give me as good a policy, and in fact a better one, than I had before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>He said he would give you as good and in fact better than what you had before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-13\">\u201cA. Yes, sir; even what I had with the Hartford previous to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-14\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Better than the policies you had had with the-Hartford?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-15\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-16\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did he show you his form of policy with the fine print?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir; he didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t believe he had a form of the policy there. He had some form that was to paste on the face of the policy. I don\u2019t remember seeing the-policy, \u2014 that is, the form of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you ask Mr. Brace for the form of policy \u25a0with the fine print in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I did not. I supposed the policy was the same .as the old one all the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Mr. Brace showed you this form of policy, this .special form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>He showed me that form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>He said this was even better than the old ones you had had before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>He said the policy itself would be better than that what the policy I had from the company bel ore was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>This was what he had and was showing you at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>That is certainly what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>This policy was in your safe, that was received from the Hartford Company, was it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-13\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir; I received it. I don\u2019t know whether I \u25a0can place the date. I know I received it after Mr. Brace was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-14\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Along about the 18th, wasn\u2019t it, Warren said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-15\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I couldn\u2019t say about the time; somewheres about the forepart of the month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-16\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You had access to that safe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-18\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Could get at it whenever you liked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-19\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-20\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You had some talk with the agent of the American \u25a0Company about insuring your property when he was there in March?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-21\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-22\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And determined to take a risk with the American ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-23\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I had not come to any conclusion to take any risk with him, but he gave me a better figure, and I told him I would cancel the Hartford policy, and when he came back I would probably take out a policy with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-24\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>That was your reason for ever canceling the policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-25\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir; that was my intention, \u2014 in dollars and cents. * \u2022 * * There was nothing said about the cancellation clause any more than I said to Mr. Brace: 'If you take up this policy to-day, the American agent will be here by and by and take up yours.\u2019 He says: \u2022'We have got down where they can\u2019t get down any more.\u2019 'This is the reason he gave me for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>What did he say about making the policy better?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>He said it was better. He didn't say there was a clause there to prevent me from canceling it. If he had, I wouldn't have changed my policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Didn't say anything about that canceling clause?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>When did you first discover there was a \u25a0difference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I never discovered it until this suit was brought on. I wrote to the company to cancel my policy. At first they said they would cancel it. I wrote to them again, and they said they would cancel my policy by paying $133. I wrote back to them, and said I wouldn't pay them anything, because I had overpaid them for what time they had had my risk. Finally they \u25a0offered to cancel it if I paid them $50.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>How many policies had you had with this company before this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I think this was the third policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Did you cancel those policies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir; that is, through the agent of the American Company. They canceled them, wrote something about canceling the policy on the face of the policy, and I signed my name to it, and the agent took it and sent it to the company, \u2014 to the Hartford, \u2014 and they canceled the policy, and gave me credit on the policy they had given me, as a premium that is paid in .advance; and the Hartford has done the same thing three times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You say you never read the fine print over in this policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you ever read the fine print in any of your policies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, I have in some insurance companies, where we insure on property not on steam-boilers.''</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-17\">The agent Brace was called for plaintiff, and admitted \u25a0the former dealings; that 'the other policies were cancel-.able; that he did not inform defendant of this change in the policy; and when defendant said to him, <em>\u201c\u2018 </em>Suppose the other company come along and want to cancel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>it,\u2019 I says, CI don\u2019t think they will. This is as Tow as it can be written, and save themselves.\u2019\u201d This was a suppression of the truth. This agent had with him, and exhibited to defendant, a special type-written clause which the old policy did not contain, and which was to be pasted as a rider upon the new policy. This clause contained no reference to the cancellation clause. The clause which is relied upon by the company was in fine print, and was new matter. When defendant suggested the probability that the agent of the American would offer a better rate to cancel, the agent did not say to-him that the new policy could not be surrendered and its surrender value recovered, but misled him, by giving' as a reason that the rates were so low that they could, not he cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Conditions and restrictions in insurance policies, to be-binding upon the insured, must be inserted without fraud, misrepresentation, or concealment. In order to charge the insured with the duty of an examination of' his policy with reference to new matter introduced into it, he must be left free to discharge that.duty unaffected by the company\u2019s representations, and not be led to neglect it by the conduct of the company itself. The company cannot be allowed to evade his questions, mislead him, suppress the truth, and lull him to sleep regarding new restrictions which it has injected into the-policy, and thereafter charge him with constructive-knowledge of those restrictions. The company obtained this very policy by- inducing defendant to cancel a policy in the American; and, presumably to prevent the American from doing just what plaintiff was then doing, it introduces into the new policy a clause taking away a privilege which defendant had exercised under the old policies. Not only was defendant\u2019s attention not called to this change, but, when asked with reference to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>exercise of the right of cancellation, plaintiff\u2019s agent neglects a plain duty, conceals the fact of change, and misleads and deceives the defendant. The question here is not as to the effect of a naked acceptance of a policy without examination, but as to whether, in the absence of actual notice, a party can be bound by a new restriction in a policy concerning the existence of which he, has been lulled to sleep, and actually misled and deceived. In <em>Gristock v. Insurance Co., </em>87 Mich. 430, Justice Grant, speaking for this Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\">\u201cPlaintiff had a right to rely upon the assumption that his policy would oe in accordance with the terms of his oral application. If the defendant desired to make it anything different it should, in order to make it binding\u2019 upon plaintiff, under the authorities in this State, have called his attention to those clauses which differed from the oral application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The same principle is applicable to the present case. There was no occasion for a stipulation in the written application that the new policy should contain this privilege. This application contained no reference to the subject. The form of the policy was determined by the-agent by endorsement upon the back of the application. The agent\u2019s knowledge was the company\u2019s knowledge. The agent knew from the conversation had that defendant expected to get a policy similar in this respect to the policies which the company had already issued to him. Not only this, but the agent actually misled defendant when the subject of cancellat on was referred to. The policy in this case contained no restrictions upon the authority or powers of the agent. The defendant set up fraud, misrepresentation, and concealment, and the testimony objected to was admissible under that plea. The court very properly left the questions raised by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>plea to the jury. The jury found for the defendant, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b92-4\">Morse, Long, and Grant, JJ., concurred. Champlin, &lt;C.
