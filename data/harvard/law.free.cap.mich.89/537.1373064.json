The court is not warranted in directing a verdict for the defendant where there is a conflict in the evidence, under any view of which the defendant would be liable; for this Court has said that, before verdict can properly be directed for the defendant, all of the testimony in favor of the plaintiff, bearing upon the issues given by him and his witnesses, and all making a case for him given on the part of the defendant, if accepted as true, must fail to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case, after the most favorable construction that can possibly be given to such testimony for the plaintiff; citing <em>Gibbons v. Farwell, </em>63 Mich. 348.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-6\">2. Under the evidence of plaintiff and his witnesses, there was a case made for the jury. We are willing to admit that plaintiff was a trespasser, and had no right to go upon defendant\u2019s ground, but this was not the proximate cause of the injury, because if he had been left to himself, and no invitation to come on had been given him by the conductor, he would have gone off the track, and out of the way, but the conductor beckoned him to come on and into a dangei'ous iflace, and then started the train down rapidly upon him with full knowledge of the danger, which was a complete and intervening cause between the original trespass and the accident; and the defendant, having knowledge of the dangerous position of the plaintiff, owed him the duty of using ordinary care and skill to prevent an accident; citing <em>Beems v. Railway Co., </em>58 Iowa, 150 (6 Amer. &amp; Eng. R. R. Cas. 222); <em>Guenther v. Railway Co., </em>95 Mo. 286 (34 Amer. &amp; Eng. R. R. Cas. 47); <em>Hays v.

The east end of the freight-house is about 300 feet from the east end of the depot building. Plaintiff came by rail from Chesaning on the morning of the day on which the accident occurred, and desired to take the east-bound train for Corunna, on defendant\u2019s road. Plaintiff knew all about the location of the depot, and the usual route thereto, but, instead of taking the street leading to the depot, he came down Washington street to the defendant\u2019s right of way, and, seeing defendant\u2019s train at the depot, started west, facing the train, on said right of way, on a run to take the train. He claims that he ran towards the depot between the main track and side track No. 12, which adjoined the main track on the north. This side track started east of Washington street, and continued west to a point about 150 feet east of the passenger depot. He further claims that there were cars at intervals upon track No. 12; that, as he reached an opening between two of these side-tracked cars, he saw the passenger train start, and move from three to five feet, whereupon he halted, intending to get between the cars on the side, track out of the way; that the conductor then observed him, called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>upon the engineer to hold on, and beckoned plaintiff to come on; that plaintiff then started on a run towards the train, and then observed that the train had started again; that the train met him at one of these side-tracked cars, which he was trying to get west of so as to avoid injury; that the suction of the train drew him towards it, and he caught hold of the hand-rail of one of the cars, and was thrown under the car. He says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">\u201cThe last I remember, the end of the car was just passing me as I stood facing the south, when the handrail struck me across the arm, here. I believe I gripped that rail. I can\u2019t swear I did. That is the last I remember. * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>I want to ask you whether you were trying to catch on that train?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I was not. I never have said so; never had any such idea in my mind. * * * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">\u201cI was on the north side of the main track. There were freight-cars on the first side track. \u2022 They were in two sections. I can\u2019t state the number in each. I should say four to eight in each section. Part of them were box-cars and some fiat-cars. The flat-cars had a railing standing up about that high (illustrating). There was a box-car opposite where I was hurt, and I was very near the west end of the box-car; I don\u2019t think to exceed five feet. I was trying to get to the west end of the box-car that was standing there when the train came along. There was nothing further on west of the boxcar on that side track. I was still running. I couldn\u2019t stop. I was under motion. When these cars passed me, I was still running west. * * * <em>I can\u2019t tell whereabouts on this track I was injured. I don\u2019t know how far the train may have rolled me or tumbled me. </em>* * * While the train was starting towards me, I was in motion all the time. Just, where I was at that time I can\u2019t say. I was trying to get to that point as the train was starting up. I was not at that point when the train started. I was running. * * * The conductor motioned and hallooed to the engineer to hold on. The engineer stopped his engine, and I immediately started again. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now, as I understand you to say, you didn\u2019t catch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>hold of the handles, the. platform of the cars, as they went past?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Not to my knowledge. I had no intention to catch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>I ask you if you will swear you did not catch hold of the rails of the platform of those cars that day as they went past you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I will not swear I did or did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Will you swear you did not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Will you swear you didn\u2019t have hold of the rails of the platform of that car as it went by you, and were hanging on to it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Not to my knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Will you swear, when the train reached you at that point, you didn\u2019t spring and grasp the rails of the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir; I will. * * * It was a question whether my hand would strike the car or go between the coaches. The last I knew, the railing struck me there (illustrating). This hand was not showing any marks of gripping. This hand, especially these three fingers, and the whole arm, and my side indicated a severe wrench; black and blue on the inside of my hand. I must have caught hold of the rail as it passed me with these fingers. It jerked, me, and threw me, and whirled me around. I was facing the west \u2014 running west \u2014 when the train passed me, and the train going east.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-14\"><em>\u201c </em>When the train started up the second time, I was between the break in the cars and the point where the train struck me. I was less than one freight-car length west of the break when he signaled me. I still continued to advance towards the west. When he signaled me I kept on. There was the break in the cars, \u2014 the space between the cars standing on the track. Just about as I passed the east end of that car, I heard the steam escaping, and saw the drive-wheels move a trifle, and the train moved. My motion carried me by. I was endeavoring to stop, and come back, and go into that space out of the way; and, when I was two-thirds or three-fourths the length of a freight-car that way, the signal was given to come on. Then I continued to run, thinking I could get there. * * * I can\u2019t locate exactly how far I was from the station at the time this train <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>passed me. I don\u2019t know whether it was 150 feet or not. I don\u2019t know how much speed that railroad train would have reached at the time' it got to me. There was suction enough so that I had to grab my hat to keep it from going. I think it was the suction that drew me</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">* * * * * \u00dc: * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">\u201cI can\u2019t say how many seconds it was after the train started before it was upon me. It was a very short time. I can\u2019t say how many feet I had an opportunity of traveling while that. train was coming down on me. If I expressed an opinion on that matter, I should say perhaps 20 or 30 feet; possibly 35 feet; I was under good headway; possibly 40, \u2014 paces, I mean. I didn\u2019t go across to the south side of the track, because I did not think there was any better chance on the south side. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You say, after the train left the depot, you still continued to run towards it some 30 or 40 feet, or paces. Which did you mean to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>About the length of two cars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You went right along by the place where the two cars broke open?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I didn\u2019t go by more than one such place. I supposed I could get to the end. My judgment told me to go on, and get to the end, and out of the way, as the safest way to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You went by an opening that you could have stepped into?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I didn\u2019t see it or think about it. * * * I did not notice any opening at the right of me between the cars after the train started. I did not think of it. The way I was going seemed to be the only safe way to get out. That was my judgment, which I acted upon. I think I must have passed one of these openings, but I didn\u2019t notice it at the time. I believe now I did, but I didn\u2019t know it. My judgment told me to get there, where I could get over here; and I tried, and failed in it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">Plaintiff was recalled after dinner, and, being examined by Mr. Chapman, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-13\">\u201cI remember this forenoon of stating that I thought I ran 30 or 40 feet after the train started. This noon I procured a tape-line, and measured 30 feet. I think I said 20 to 30 feet. I am positive I did not go that far. That is a longer distance than I thought. I don\u2019t know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>how far I traveled before the train started down on -me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>What do you say about it now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I say, as I said this forenoon, I am no hand to estimate distances. I think I-said 20 to 30 feet. I am positive I did not go that far. That is a longer distance than I thought. The distance I had in my mind was all right, but I didn\u2019t guess the distance right. That is something I can\u2019t do. Some people are experts at that, and can guess at distances, but I never could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>Have you any idea at the present time how far you traveled after that train started down on you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I can\u2019t say. I would not make an estimate. I was mistaken in trying to make an estimate. I know I went a very short distance. I hadn\u2019t time to go but a very short distance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Plaintiff was recalled at the close of defendant\u2019s case, and testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>Did you make a leap to catch that train, as described by the witness Gray and these other two witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I had in my mind no intention\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>I don\u2019t care about what you had in your mind. I didn\u2019t ask you your mind. I asked you if you made any attempt to reach that train.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-13\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>Did you make any effort to catch on the train?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-15\"><em>Cross-examination: </em>\u201cI was facing the west when the train passed me. The engine had passed me, s\u00f3 I was at the time about the center of the baggage-car. I grabbed at my hat just about the time the latter part of the tender passed me!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-16\">\u201c Q. Will you swear to it that you did or did not grab or grasp at the handles of that car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I stated I believed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-18\"><em>\u201c Q. </em>Answer the question \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No.\u2019 Will you swear to it that you did or did not grasp at the handles of the car as it went by you?'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-19\">\u201c <em>A. </em>I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-20\">Plaintiff\u2019s witness Cole says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-21\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>Now, when the train came down on French, what did he do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>\u201cA. </em>He looked as though he was leaning right back against the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>What next did you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I saw him just as though he plunged right into the cars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s witness Warren says that French was picked up west of the cars on track 12, and just east of the freight-house; and plaintiff\u2019s witness Wright says there were no cars on track 12 at the point where French fell. Cole is the only one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses who saw plaintiff before he fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Defendant\u2019s witnesses Lehman, Chipman, Burk, Knight, Wikes, Finch, and Gray testify that plaintiff was picked up 100 feet west of the last car on the No. 12 track, and several of them say that he was carried east from 15 to 20 feet by the train.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Kipp, a carpenter, who happened to be at the depot, says tha,t plaintiff had passed the cars on track 12, when he grabbed the train to catch on; that there were no cars on No. 12 at that point; and that the train had got about twice its own length from the depot.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Gray, flagman at the crossing, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">\u201cThe train started up, and he started to run. When the engine passed him, he squared himself, and made a dive right for the train, \u2014 reached for the cars, \u2014 and the next thing I saw was somebody thrown over, and his hat thrown away across the 12 track. It appeared to me that there was one flat-car on the 12 track between me and him, and one beyond me, but near to my crossing. He was 20 or 30 or 40 rods past that. I saw him pass the car. He ran until he met the train. I saw the train start from the station. She started, and came right along. It did not stop anywhere. There were no ears on that 12 track near where he caught on to the train. Mr. Kipp was sitting by me when French passed by the track. When the train started, I got up off the bench. My attention was called to him to see whether he would attempt to get on the train or not, at the speed she was coming. He kept in the space between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the main track and the 12 track until he got past the flat-car and opposite the engine. Then he stepped to the north side of that space, and kept on. There was nothing to hinder Mr. French from stepping away from the train instead of stepping towards it, when he attempted to get on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Burk, a butcher, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">\u201cI saw French clinging to the passenger-car, and saw him when he fell. He fell from the step from where he was clinging, at the side of the car, to the ground between the first track and the main track, opposite the east end of the freight-house platform. The ground about him was clear, I think, of cars, for as much, I should say, as 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 feet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Chapman says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u201c When I first saw French, he was running to catch the train. He was right about just ready to make for the train when I saw him. He was down about opposite the east end of our new platform. He was running to catch the train, \u2014 running towards it. He ran a few feet towards me, and turned, and jumped, and caught the train either on the rear end of the baggage-car or on the front end of the smoking-car. He jumped for the railing. As soon as I saw the man make for the cars, I saw his foot slip. He was carried, I should say, 15 or 20 feet by the train as he grabbed it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Knight says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">\u201cWhen the passenger car was at the station, I stood about the rear end of the baggage-car, from four to six feet from the main track. The train started out in the usual way. As the rear end of the train pulled by me, there was no one on the rear steps. At the same time as the rear end of the train pulled by me, \u2014 it was almost in a direct line east of me, \u2014 I saw Mr. French come running down the track. I didn't know who it was at the time.. I saw him coming running down the track between the two tracks. He was about 25 or 50 rods down the track, running west, between the 12 track and the main line. He continued to run until he met the train. Then he stopped running. He had hardly stopped when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>grabbed at the front end of the smoking-car. He seemed to hang a minute. He did hang there for a few minutes. He was taken some 10 or 20 feet. I thought to myself, cHe is going to succeed in getting on/ and then I saw him fall to the ground.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The conductor and engineer both testify that the train started but once; that the engineer was not signaled to stop; that neither saw the plaintiff; that the only signal given was that to start; and that the only words spoken aloud by the conductor were the usual \u201cAll aboard!\u201d And these witnesses are corroborated by others; but there was a conflict of testimony upon these points. It is undisputed, however, that the conductor immediately boarded the train after giving the signal, and that the train started at once. Plaintiff testifies that the train started again immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The plaintiff's theory, that he was drawn into the train by the suction of the train while he was opposite the car on track 12, is an improbable one, to say the least, and was clearly dispelled, not only by the testimony as to the probablp speed of a train that had but just started, by the testimony of men of long experience about moving trains, but by the circumstances, which unmistakably indicate that plaintiff had passed the car on track 12, and that he was endeavoring, at the time of the injury, to board this train.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Plaintiff was guilty of negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">1. In attempting to reach the depot along defendant's right of way in the face of a train which he' knew was liable to start at any moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">2. In keeping on after the train had started, and attempting to make a given point in advance of the train.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Immediately after the signal given by the conductor, plaintiff saw the train start. He says he saw the drive-wheels move. At this time he must have been at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>500 or 600 feet from the locomotive. An ordinarily prudent man would have realized either that he had mistaken the signal, or that the conductor intended to disregard it, and would have got out of the way; but he kept on running in the face of the moving train and the cars on track 12, and met the train about 35.0 feet from the depot. He says that he ran by an opening between the cars on track 12, into which he could have stepped and been out of danger; that his judgment was that he could make the next opening. Why make it unless he intended to attempt to board the train? He was in no imminent peril when he saw the train start towards him, nor while he was passing the opening in the' cars on track 12; neither- does it appear that there was any obstruction on the south side of the main track. When he saw the train start after the signal, he was 500 or 600 feet from the train, and he ran at least 200 feet to meet it. His judgment, or want of judgment, led him into imminent peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">3. In attempting to board a moving train.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">He does not deny that he caught on to the hand-rail, but attempts to explain the act by saying that he was confused. His own conduct led him to the point where he became confused; and the fair and only reasonable inference that can be drawn from his testimony is that he made that point intending to board the train. All the circumstances, and the testimony of all the other witnesses, point in that direction. When he took hold of the hand-rail, he was in an open space. No cars prevented his stepping to the north, out of the way of the train. The only testimony offered to negative the existence of a purpose on the part of plaintiff to board the train was his own statement (1) that the suction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the train drew him towards it; and (2) that he was confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The effect and force of cl\u00bfar and positive testimony, coupled with corroborative circumstances, cannot be broken by the bare announcement \u00f3f a highly improbable theory, which is itself dispelled by competent and uncontradicted testimony, nor by the naked statement that he was confused by surroundings which he had contributed to produce. There is a lack of clearness, and a remarkable indefiniteness, which characterizes plaintiff\u2019s entire testimony. The plaintiff\u2019s conduct in running some distance towards an approaching train, and neglecting to avail himself of avenues of escape which were open to him in every other direction, cannot be relieved of its negligent character by the statement that he thought he could reach a given point before the train did; nor can the defendant be held liable for an injury, resulting from his grasping the hand-rail of a moving car, by the bare statement that he was so confused, when he reached the position into which his own judgment had led him, that his act was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The court erred in refusing to direct a verdict for defendant, and the judgment must therefore be reversed, with costs of both courts, without a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b590-6\">Morse, Long, and Grant, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
