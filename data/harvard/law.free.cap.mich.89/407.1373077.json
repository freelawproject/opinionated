P. Coulter was the secretary of the defendant company, and solicited and took the application, which was filled out partly by Mr. Carrington, the secretary and treasurer of the plaintiff company, and partly by Mr. Coulter. It appeared that Coulter applied to Carrington for the application, saying that he had looked the property over, and wanted a policy .thereon; that, in filling out the application, Carrington, referring to the question regarding the use of open lights on the premises, told Coulter that he (Carrington) had been connected with saw-mills for 20 years, and that a mill could not be repaired without the use of torch-lights, and that they were necessary for use, and Coulter replied, \u201cWhy, in our policies we give you permission to make repairs at all times;\u201d that these torch-lights were in use by plaintiff at that time, and Coulter knew that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The fire occurred on Saturday, .the 5th of April, 1890, at about 9 o\u2019clock at night, before the mill commenced operations for the season, and while they were engaged in making repairs and fitting the mill out for the. season\u2019s work. On the date named, the engineer and fireman had been engaged at the pony engine, a part of which had been taken out and sent away for repairs, and they were putting the parts together. They were at work under the engine-room floor, putting the pipes together, and used a torch or flambeau. It appears that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>this light was lighted when the use of that particular kind of light was necessary, and,, when not needed, was extinguished; that its use was occasional; that it was used where, on account of a spray of water, or by reason of the inability to throw the light on the point desired, a lantern could not be used; that certain of the repairs that were being made upon that day could not have been made with an inclosed light; that it was safer to use the torch than a lantern, under some circumstances; that on the day in question no lights were left by those making the repairs; that for general lighting purposes an electric light was used in the mill; that the torch-light was used in the engine-room only, or around the belts or hot boxes while a spray was being put on. One of the witnesses, when asked why it was necessary to use the flambeau, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\"><em>\u201c </em>Because you have to get so - close to any particular piece of machinery that you cannot use a lantern. In shifting a belt, if the belt runs off a pulley part way, it takes two men; one holds the lantern or the flambeau, and the other drives the wedge until the belt- runs perfectly true on the pulley; and you could not use anything else there, because it would be dangerous if you should strike the lantern with the belt; you have got to get close to it, and it might make an explosion. Then, another thing is, you can put your hand over it in a second, and crush the light out of it. It is just like a tallow candle, that you can put your hand over it in an instant and put it 'out. * * * Where there is a hot box, where you put water on it, put a spray on, you cannot use a lantern for it. \u25a0 You hold this right next to it, and water does not affect it any. The spray of water flying' into it does not affect it.- * * * It certainly was necessary, because you cannot get'any thing else close, and you can push this right into a piece of machinery, and get a perfect light right where you cannot use a lantern. <em>\u2019&gt;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">This testimony came from defendant\u2019s witnesses, and \u2022 was in the main drawn out by defendant, and was uncontradicted. The watchman went on duty a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>minutes before 6 o\u2019clock, after those engaged in repairing had left, and closed up the mill. It was not claimed that there was any connection between the use of this torch-light and the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The facts, then, are that the policy itself gives permission to make necessary repairs, and to use refined kerosene (the article used in this torch) for lights, and it further appears without contradiction or dispute that it was necessary to use the torch-light in making the repairs. The granting of permission to make repairs naturally presumes increased hazard in the doing of the thing permitted, and that permission must be deemed to have included all the incidents of that privilege, or the right to do whatever was usual and necessary in the course of such repairs. The agreement, therefore, not to use open, movable lights must be construed to relate to the general and ordinary use of lights in and about the mill, and not to the special and necessary use in making the repairs permitted by the express terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">As to the keeping of the watchman, it appeared that the mill had been shut down, in December of the previous year; that in the mean time, and up to the time of the fire, a night watchman had been employed, who went on shortly before 6 o\u2019clock p. m., and remained there until the next morning; that from December,up to the time of the commencement of the repairs, in the latter part of February, there had been no person about the mill in the day time who was denominated a \u201cwatchman,\u201d but from the time the watchman left in the morning until he came on again in the evening the mill was in charge of the book-keeper, and barn man, whose duty it was to look after and care for the property; that, after the repairs were commenced, other persons were also about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the mill. These facts were undisputed. The object of the agreement respecting the watchman was the care and supervision ,-of the mill property, and, if the' care and supervision was exercised by any, one, it cannot be material that such person was not called a \u201cwatchman.\u201d The functions of a watchman need not necessarily be performed by a person called a \u201cwatchman,\u201d in order to protect both parties. If performed by the proprietor himself, it cannot be said that the agreement has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">But this mill was destroyed during the presence of a watchman in the actual performance of his duties, and not in the absence of a watchman. The policy does provide that if certain specified articles are kept upon the premises without permission, or if the insured shall make any false representation of the condition, situation, or occupancy, or shall conceal any fact material to the risk, or in case of overvaluation, etc., the policy shall be void, but it does not provide that it shall be void if the agreements are not observed. It simply provides that,\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\u201cIf the insured shall fail to keep any of the agreements therein contained, this company shall not be liable in case of loss under this policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">This provision differs from the other provisions referred to. If it was intended that any failure to keep a watchman rendered the policy void, the parties would have so declared. If they had, and no watchman had been kept, and the watchman's duties had not been performed, the policy could not have been subsequently validated, without the consent of both parties, or something equivalent to a waiver of the breach. The agreement here was reciprocal, and this clause in the policy must be construed as though the words, \u201cduring such failure\u201d followed the word \u201cpolicy.\u201d The use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>words \u201cin case of loss\u201d in this connection are unnecessary, unless they refer to a case of loss during, such failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\">But it is insisted that the watchman was absent from the mill when the fire occurred. It appears that the watchman went on duty a few minutes before 6 o\u2019clock p. m.; that he went through the mill,^ and then closed and fastened the doors; that he then visited the machine-shop and other buildings about the premises, and closed them; that, observing that the oat-bin at the barn was not locked, he recollected that he had taken the padlock and key to get it fixed, and had left it at the hoarding-house, and had forgotten to bring it with him when he came to go on duty; that the boarding-house was about 300 feet from the mill, and he went over there, was not in the house but a minute or so, got the lock and key, and came back; that, as he came out of the boarding-house, he heard the cry of \u201cFire!\u201d whereupon he hastened to the mill, opened the door, and discovered that it was on fire. This temporary absence of the watchman cannot be regarded as a violation of the terms of the agree-men contained in this application. The watchman contemplated by the agreement was the one usually kept upon mill premises, having the usual and ordinary duties of watchmen upon such premises, and the watchman here was engaged in the performance of these duties. His trip to the boarding-house was directly in the line of his duty. There was no dispute as to the facts, and no error in the court\u2019s direction to the jury to find for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
