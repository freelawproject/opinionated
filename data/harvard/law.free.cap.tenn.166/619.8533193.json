It was not necessary to prove a specific sale, since none was charged in the indictment as the basis of the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">No evidence was offered by the plaintiff in error; and, if he was operating under a ten-day temporary permit, as authorized in Code, section 1231, we think the burden was on him to establish the fact. There is no evidence that he had been operating the restaurant only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ten days at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Code, section 1250, authorizing \u201cdestitute\u201d persons to \u201csell taxable articles without paying a tax,\u201d is obviously not applicable to the operator of a mercantile establishment. And see <em>Forrest </em>v. <em>State, </em>154 Tenn., 13, 285 S. W., 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
