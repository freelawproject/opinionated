Gaut.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b685-5\">Mr. Justice Swiggar.t</author>\n<p id=\"ALz\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Private Acts 1929, ch. 528, created the \u201coffice of Deputy-Tax Assessors\u201d in Washington County, with a \u201cterm of office\u201d coextensive with that of the county tax assessor, and fixed the salary of the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Complainant, A. S. Miller, was designated in the statute as such deputy tax assessor \u201cto serve during the remainder of the term of office of the present tax assessor;\u201d his successors to he appointed by the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Private Acts 1931, ch. 285, reciting that the said A. E. Miller had become permanently incapacitated by illness, amended the act of 1929 \u201cby striking out the name of A. S. Miller\u201d and \u201cinserting in lieu thereof the name of Frank B. Gaut,\u201d the defendant in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">The original bill asserts the invalidity of Miller\u2019s removal as being an unconstitutional effort by the Legislature to legislate him out of office. <em>Malone </em>v. Williams, 118 Tenn., 390, 467-480, 103 S. W., 798, 121 Am. St. Rep., 1002; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Sells, </em>156 Tenn., 539, 3 S. W. (2d), 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">The chancellor ruled that complainant had jeo far recognized the validity of the act of -1931, by turning over the office to Gaut, that he had estopped himself from asserting its unconstitutionality. The case is before us on complainant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">The term of office to which Miller was appointed by the Legislature had expired before the case was presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">The office created by the act of 1929 is a county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>office, which the act directs shall he filled by an election of the quarterly county court. The power of the Legislature to fill the office by appointment was limited by the Constitution to an appointment for the period elapsing between the passage of the act and the first meeting of the county court thereafter. <em>Grindstaff </em>v. <em>Carter County, </em>152 Tenn., 605, 279 S. W., 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The designation of Miller for a term of years was therefore beyond the constitutional power of the Legislature, and was-ineffective to invest him with a <em>de jure </em>right to the term. His subsequent removal by an act, likewise unconstitutional for the same reason, did not deprive him of any right under the Constitution. The decree of the chancellor dismissing the bill is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
