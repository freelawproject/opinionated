R. Galloway.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">\u201c(Jurat) W. H. Howell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">The Chancellor was of opinion that (1) the provision made in Item One for payment of a class of debts from the insurance fund in the contingency recited did not destroy the exemption in favor of the wife and children; and (2), also, that the individual indebtedness of Howell to the partnership was not within the class payable from the proceeds of this insurance, but was excluded therefrom, and denied recovery. The Court of Appeals first rendered an opinion reversing the Chancellor, holding that the testator had so diverted the proceeds of his insurance as to subject it to the payment of his debts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>without regard to classification. In response to a petition to rehear, however, that Court, following the opinion of this Court in <em>American Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Sperry, </em>157 Tenn., 43, reconsidered that question, and held that the disposition of the insurance by the will did not subject the fund to claims of creditors generally, or to strictly partnership obligations; hut the Court of Appeals was of opinion that the debts shown by the record to be withdrawals in the nature of loans, or advancements, by Howell from partnership funds were his \u201cpersonal debts,\u201d within the meaning of the terms used by him in his will, and were not debts \u201carising from partnership transactions.\u201d expressly excluded from payment out of his insurance by the language of the will. So holding, and it appearing that these obligations would consume the entire fund, the decree was reversed, and, incidentally, payment of compensation out of this fund to the solicitor for his services in this litigation was denied. Petition for <em>certiorari </em>has been granted and argument heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We think it clear, as held by the Court of Appeals on the rehearing, that the first question is concluded by the opinion in <em>American Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Sperry, supra. </em>It must be conceded that the second question is in more doubt. But, recognizing the right of the testator to classify his indebtedness- and limit application of this insurance fund, exempt by operation of law for the benefit of his wife and children, so as to leave them that protection which he evidently contemplated by creation of the trust for their benefit, can it be said that it was his intention to divert this fund to these obligations to his partnership, with the effect, which it is obvious from this record he might reasonably have foreseen, of leaving these dependents wholly without provision for their necessities? The in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>tent of the testator, expressed by the will as a whole, must he given effect. What was this intent?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Looking to the pertinent language of item one of the will, hereinbefore quoted, it will be seen that the testator first directs the payment of his just debts from his \u201cpersonal estate, exclusive of the proceeds from any insurance policies on my life.\u201d This exclusion required no expression from him, being provided for by statute, and his expression of it was' an emphasis of the desire on his mind to preserve to his dependents this fund. He next authorizes encroachment on this insurance fund. \u2018 \u2018 All of my just debts\u201d had first been directed paid out of his general personal estate, but now he suggests a limiting classification to \u201cmy personal debts,\u201d and provides that, if any one of these remain unpaid, <em>\u201cthen </em>my said Executor shall apply <em>enough </em>of the proceeds from my life insurance to <em>finish </em>the.payment of my said <em>personal and individual </em>debts.\u201d We italicize words apparently having significance, indicating clearly that only \u201cenough\u201d was to be taken from this fund to take care of this limited \u201cpersonal and individual\u201d class. Quite obviously he purposed including a limited class only in this special provision. In order that there might be no misunderstanding he expressly directs the payment from this fund of \u201cdebts <em>except </em>those arising from partnership transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The learned Court of Appeals stresses, and supports with authority, that a partner\u2019s unauthorized withdrawals for his own use and account of partnership funds is beyond the scope of partnership authority and concludes that such transactions are not \u201cpartnership transactions,\u201d and therefore not without the express exception made by the testator. We are constrained to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>conclusion that this gives to the language, in its context and under the circumstances as a whole, too narrow or technical a meaning. \u201cArising from partnership transactions,\u201d in a commonly used and understood sense, would seem to cover all obligations growing out of such a business connection and association; whatever accounts were incident to the partnership relationship. The fund for his dependents was not to he subject to depletion or destruction contingent on the outcome of an accounting between the partners after he was gone. He must have realized and had in mind, in view of the volume of the partnership business, that this special fund, exempt by law, would otherwise be subject to too serious a contingency. And, particularly significant, in view of the rule that the will speaks as of the date of the death of the testator, is the obvious fact that he <em>then </em>well knew of his large indebtedness to the firm, and that if this insurance fund should be so applied, absolutely nothing would remain for his dependents, with the result that his creation of the trust for their benefit was an idle gesture. This fact <em>de hors </em>the instrument must be given full weight in arriving at the intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">This view is consistent with the requirement of <em>clear </em>intention to divert, which limits this power under our cases which recognize the right to divert at all. Such an intention or purpose \u201cmust be explicitly declared.\u201d It \u201cmust be clearly expressed in apt words.\u201d See <em>American Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Sperry, supra, </em>at pages 51, 52, quoting from <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>110 Tenn., 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The decree of the Court of Appeals must be reversed, and the cause remanded to be proceeded with in accordance with the decree of the Chancellor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
