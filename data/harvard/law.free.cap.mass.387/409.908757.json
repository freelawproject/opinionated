The lane provides the only access.to their parcel. Parcels owned by Sybil Goldsmith and Robert Ep-ple are across Wyer\u2019s Lane from each other and abut Wyer\u2019s Lane and the Cumbies\u2019 parcel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At trial, the parties stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>lated that the Cumbies \u201chave, as appurtenant to their property, a prescriptive right over the whole of Wyer\u2019s Lane from their property to North Center Street, that right being to pass and repass.\u201d The Cumbies now seek to extend their prescriptive use by placing utility lines under Wyer\u2019s Lane. Goldsmith and Robert Epple seek to enjoin the extension of the Cumbies\u2019 prescriptive use. Two separate actions to resolve this dispute were consolidated for trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The trial judge permanently enjoined the Cumbies from installing the utilities, because \u201cunder the common law as it presently exists, they have no legal right to install underground utility lines beneath the surface of Wyer\u2019s Lane.\u201d In a summary order, the Appeals Court affirmed <em>(Cumbie </em>v. <em>Goldsmith, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 1014 [1981]) on the ground that \u201c[t]he Legislature has recently dealt with the problem and has not afforded any such privilege as that now sought by G. L. c. 187, \u00a7 5, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 610, and as thereafter amended by St. 1980, c. 251, with respect to a right of ingress and egress gained by prescription and not by deed.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We granted the Cumbies\u2019 application for further appellate review to consider whether the owner of a right of way by prescription may lay utility lines under a portion of the way. However, before we decide that issue, there is a question as to the standing of Epple and Goldsmith to object to the installation of underground utilities. Since the judge made no findings on that issue, we remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">At trial, the Cumbies contested Epple\u2019s and Goldsmith\u2019s standing to object to the extension of the utility lines because neither Epple nor Goldsmith has a fee interest in the lane. At oral argument before this court, Epple and Goldsmith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>claimed that they owned, as abutters, a fee interest to the middle of Wyer\u2019s Lane. However, the trial judge found \u201c [t]he state of the title as to Wyer\u2019s Lane is far from clear, and no evidence was offered as to the present fee ownership of same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Neither party brought to the judge\u2019s attention the provisions of G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 58,\u00ae which might support Epple\u2019s and Goldsmith\u2019s claim of ownership to the middle of Wyer\u2019s Lane. Thus, the judge made no findings as to whether Epple\u2019s and Goldsmith\u2019s grantor had a fee in Wyer\u2019s Lane, or whether any of the exceptions in \u00a7 58 are applicable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since \u201c [Epple and Goldsmith] must recover on the strength of [their] own title, not on the weakness of the [Cumbies\u2019]\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>(Stefanick </em>v. <em>Fortona, </em>222 Mass. 83, 87 [1915]; see <em>Quincy Oil Co. </em>v. <em>New England Road Mach. Co., </em>274 Mass. 419, 427 [1931]), we vacate the judgments and remand the cases to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-16\"> Barbara Chapin, whose property also abuts Wyer\u2019s Lane, has not objected to the Cumbies\u2019 installation of underground utilities. The judge found that there were utility lines in Wyer\u2019s Lane servicing Chapin\u2019s property, but they did not extend beyond Chapin\u2019s property. The parties stipulated that Chapin agreed to let the Cumbies connect up to the existing lines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\"> The Cumbies commenced this action by filing a \u201cPetition for Declaratory Relief.\u201d G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 1. Robert Epple and Sybil Goldsmith filed a complaint seeking to enjoin the Cumbies from extending the utility lines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\">In G. L. c. 187, \u00a7 5, the Legislature extended to owners of a grant of way by <em>deed, </em>the authority to lay underground utilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b425-6\"> General Laws c. 183, \u00a7 58, as amended by St. 1973, c. 185, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cEvery instrument passing title to real estate abutting a way, whether public or private, watercourse, wall, fence, or other monument, shall be construed to include any fee interest of the grantor in such way, watercourse or monument, unless <em>(a) </em>the grantor retains other real estate abutting such way, watercourse and monument, in which case, <em>(i) </em>if the retained real estate is on the same side, the division line between the land granted and the land retained shall be continued into such way, watercourse or monument as far as the grantor owns, or <em>(ii) </em>if the retained real estate is on the other side of such way, watercourse or monument between the division lines extended, the title conveyed shall be to the center line of such way, watercourse or monument as far as the grantor owns, or <em>(b) </em>the instrument evidences a different intent by an express exception or reservation and not alone by bounding by a side line.\u201d See <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>371 Mass. 489, 492 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> There is some indication in the record that Wyer\u2019s Lane may have been reserved as \u201ca passageway,\u201d and, therefore, no party has more than an easement in the way. Since the deeds are not a part of the record on appeal, we cannot make that determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> For example, if Epple and Goldsmith merely own a right of passage in the lane, the court may not enjoin the Cumbies unless Epple and Goldsmith prove that \u201ctheir rights [of passage] have been so interfered with as to be entitled to equitable relief.\u201d <em>Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Finkelstein, </em>230 Mass. 17, 19 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Relying on <em>Nantucket Conservation Found., Inc. </em>v. <em>Russell Management, </em>380 Mass. 212, 219 (1980), the Cumbies ask (assuming that Epple and Goldsmith have a fee interest in the lane) that we overrule the common law and permit an owner of a prescriptive easement to install underground utilities. Their request goes far beyond our suggestion in <em>Nantucket, </em>that, in an appropriate case, we may reconsider \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>common law rule that the <em>general grant of a right of way </em>does not carry with it the right to make reasonable use of the way in order to gain underground access to utility services\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>We note that a prescriptive easement is unrecorded, while a general grant of right of way puts a purchaser on notice of the existence of the easement. Further, \u201c[t]he extent of an easement arising by prescription, unlike an easement by grant... is fixed by the use through which it was created. . . . \u2018[T]he use under which a prescriptive interest arises determines the general outlines rather than the minute details of the interest.\u2019 [Nevertheless,] the variations in use cannot be substantial; they must be consistent with the general pattern formed by the adverse use.\u201d <em>Lawless </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>343 Mass. 561, 562-563 (1962), quoting Restatement of Property \u00a7 477 comment b (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
