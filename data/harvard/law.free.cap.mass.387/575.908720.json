The plaintiffs, seeking to recover for negligence, breaches of warranty, and violations of G. L. c. 93A, brought suit against Mark IV. At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the trial judge allowed Mark IV\u2019s motion to dismiss the c. 93A claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs on the remaining counts. The plaintiffs appealed claiming that the judge had erred in dismissing their c. 93A counts. Mark IV also appealed alleging various errors of law. We transferred the case here on our own motion. We affirm the judgment against Mark IV on its counterclaim. We conclude, further, that the exemption relied on by Mark IV, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 3 (1) <em>(b), </em>does not apply, and consequently remand for further proceedings as to this aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The jury verdict established that Mark IV breached the implied warranty of merchantability. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314. In the circumstances, that breach was a violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. The plaintiffs, therefore, are entitled to recover their reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (4), which the judge shall determine on remand. We remand the case also for him to determine whether, upon demand, Mark IV refused to grant relief to the plaintiffs in bad faith with knowledge or reason to know that the act or practice complained of violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, and for him to assess damages if appropriate in accordance with that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The evidence tended to prove the following. Eugene Kapper, doing business as Snow\u2019s Modular and Mobile Home Sales (Kapper) from his place of business in Winchester, New Hampshire (a few miles north of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Massachusetts border), sold modular homes manufactured by Mark IV as Mark IV\u2019s dealer. The plaintiff Stone purchased at least six Mark IV homes from Kapper over a period of several months beginning in November, 1973. He first looked at a model of these homes located on Kapper\u2019s lot, and then placed orders for the units to be delivered in Massachusetts. Stone paid a deposit to Kapper\u2019s agent, who was located in Massachusetts. Stone had Kapper transport the units to Orange and assemble them on foundations prepared by Stone. Within one year of his first purchase from Kapper, Stone had sold five of the units to other plaintiffs in this action, retaining one for his own use.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs Heath, Chaisson, and Garbiel purchased their modular units directly from Kapper, after viewing models of those units at Kapper\u2019s lot in New Hampshire. These plaintiffs also had Kapper transport their units to sites in Massachusetts and assemble them on foundations here.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">At various times within a few months of installation, the roofs of the plaintiffs\u2019 units began to leak. During the winter, snow built up on the relatively flat roofs of their units and, since these roofs did not overhang the sides of the units, melted snow ran down their outside walls, saturating the walls and occasionally covering walls, windows, and doors with sheets of ice. Water pipes in some of the units also froze in the winter, allegedly due to improper placement and insulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Employees of Kapper and, eventually, the plaintiffs themselves, attempted to solve the leakage problems by applying liquid sealers to some of the roofs. These attempts did not prevent leakage for any significant length of time. Other plaintiffs had new roofs laid over the old, which stopped the leakage. By letters dated September 3, 1975, an attorney representing Stone and the five households that had purchased units from him notified both Kapper and Mark IV of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the problems with their units, and of their intention to file suit if those problems were not remedied. Mark IV sent two workmen who made attempts at repairing some of the units by caulking and coating the roofs. The workmen, however, did not replace any of the plaintiffs\u2019 roofs. Leakage problems continued, Mark IV declined to make further repairs, and this suit resulted. At trial, Mark IV asserted that the flaws in the plaintiffs\u2019 units (at least those involving leakage through the roofs) were the result of improper installation, for which Stone allegedly was responsible in part.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>We will discuss other evidence as it is relevant to the issues raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">2. <em>Exemption from, G. L. c. 93A liability. </em>Mark IV based its motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 c. 93A claims solely on its entitlement to the exemption from liability created by c. 93A, \u00a7 3 (1) <em>(b).</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Since the judge granted Mark IV\u2019s motion without making findings of fact, we assume (with the parties) that he accepted Mark IV\u2019s argument. The plaintiffs argue that the judge erred in granting Mark IV\u2019s motion. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The parties stipulated at trial that the only issue raised by the judge\u2019s granting of Mark IV\u2019s motion to dismiss is whether the transactions and actions complained of by the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>occurred \u201cprimarily and substantially within the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 3 (1) <em>(b) </em>(i). Section 3 (2) states that \u201cthe burden of proving exemption from the provisions of this chapter shall be upon the person claiming the exemption.\u201d In order to prove its entitlement to the exemption from liability contained in \u00a7 3 (1) <em>(b), </em>a defendant in a c. 93A claim must prove, not only that it derives twenty percent or more of its gross revenue from interstate commerce, but also that the \u201ctransactions and actions\u201d complained of did <em>not </em>occur \u201cprimarily and substantially within the commonwealth.\u201d The Legislature\u2019s use of the terms \u201cprimarily and substantially,\u201d precludes, at a minimum, a construction of \u00a7 3 that would allow a c. 93A action in every instance in which the defendant\u2019s transactions and actions \u201cwithin the commonwealth\u201d would subject him to the jurisdiction under our long-arm statute, G. L. c. 223A. The facts of the case before us do not require us to define the outer boundaries of those transactions and actions which may be held to have occurred primarily and substantially within the Commonwealth, because the evidence was insufficient to warrant a finding that Mark IV\u2019s actions and transactions constituting violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, did not occur primarily and substantially within the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judge erred in granting Mark IV\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 G. L. c. 93A claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">One of the theories on which the plaintiffs\u2019 case was submitted to the jury was that Mark IV had breached the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>plied warranty of merchantability set forth in G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314. The Attorney General, pursuant to the authority granted him by G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (c), has promulgated a regulation declaring that \u201c[i]t shall be an unfair and deceptive act or practice to fail to perform or fulfill any promises or obligations arising under a warranty.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Breach of an implied warranty of merchantability therefore constitutes an unfair and deceptive act or practice under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Original Gunite Aquatech Pools, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 813, 821 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The sales of the modular homes to the plaintiffs constituted \u201ctransactions in goods\u201d under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-102, because those units were \u201cmovable at the time of identification to the contract for sale\u201d and hence are \u201cgoods\u201d as defined in c. 106, \u00a7 2-105 (1). <em>Fuqua Homes </em>v. <em>Evanston Bldg. &amp; Loan, </em>52 Ohio App. 2d 399, 403-404 (1971). Mark IV does not dispute that it is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (1). Lack of privity between Mark IV, a manufacturer, and the plaintiffs, is no longer a defense. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-318. Mark IV therefore impliedly warranted that the modular home units sold to the plaintiffs would be \u201cfit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used\u201d (G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 [2] [c]), i.e., for residential purposes. See <em>Performance Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>280 N.C. 385, 394 (1972) (mobile home). Based on the evidence introduced at trial, the conclusion was warranted that the modular units manufactured by Mark IV and sold to the plaintiffs were not fit for residential purposes at the time of sale because the roofs of those units were not watertight.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The question dispositive of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is whether Mark IV presented evidence warranting a finding that its breach of the implied warranty of merchantability did not occur \u201cprimarily and substantially within the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 3 (1) <em>(b) </em>(i). The evidence is un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>disputed that the sales of Mark IV units to the plaintiffs included delivery to sites in Massachusetts and installation on foundations here. As Mark IV\u2019s owner\u2019s manual makes clear, the defendant intended that delivery and installation of its units would be the responsibility of its dealers. Each of the plaintiffs\u2019 units was delivered and installed by Kap-per, a dealer of Mark IV units. The sales of the plaintiffs\u2019 units could not have been completed until delivery and installation had taken place. The transactions and actions of Mark IV constituting a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability therefore occurred, not only \u201cprimarily and substantially,\u201d but entirely, in Massachusetts. Hence, the judge erred in holding that Mark IV had met its burden of proving its entitlement to the exemption from c. 93A liability found in \u00a7 3 (1) <em>(b). </em>On the contrary, the uncontro-verted evidence establishes that, with respect to the implied warranty of merchantability, Mark IV\u2019s actions and transactions occurred within the Commonwealth and, based upon the jury verdict, were unfair or deceptive acts or practices under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a result, Mark IV is liable to the plaintiffs under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">3. <em>Multiple </em>damages, <em>attorney\u2019s </em>fees, <em>and costs. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, entitles them to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in asserting their rights. G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (4).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, while conceding that their actual damages have been established by the jury\u2019s verdict, assert that they are entitled, in addition, to multiple damages under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3). Under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3), as amended through St. 1979, c. 406, \u00a7 2, the judge may award up to three but not less than two times the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 actual damages if he finds that \u201cthe use of employment of the [unfair or deceptive] act or practice was a willful or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>knowing violation of [c. 93A, \u00a7 2], or that <em>the refusal to grant relief upon demand was made in bad faith with knowledge or reason to know that the act or practice complained of violated [\u00a7 2]\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Nothing in the record suggests that Mark IV\u2019s conduct constituted a wilful or knowing violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 <em>2, </em>nor do the plaintiffs make such an assertion. They rely instead on the italicized clause quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">This alternative basis for an award of multiple damages \u201cis an attempt to promote prelitigation settlements by making it unprofitable for the defendant either to ignore the plaintiff\u2019s request for relief or to bargain with the plaintiff with respect to such relief in bad faith. The knowledge or reason to know is that which exists after receipt of the complaint and not at the time of the alleged violation. The standard is objective and requires the defendant to investigate the facts and consider the legal precedents.\u201d <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., </em>376 Mass. 621, 627-628 (1978). In this case, the demand for relief referred to in the statute is the demand letter the plaintiffs sent to Mark IV on September 3, 1975.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In response to that letter, Mark IV sent two workmen who attempted to remedy the conditions which resulted in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. By letter dated November 10, 1975, Mark IV informed the plaintiffs that its repairs were nearly completed. That letter concluded as follows: \u201cOur repairmen reported that in every case where there were leaks, it was a result of improper set-up. Considering those facts, if [the plaintiffs] expect any further remedy ... it should come from the dealer who sold the homes to them.\u201d At trial, Mark IV took the position that the transactions and actions complained of by the plaintiffs occurred primarily and substantially in New Hampshire, where Kapper\u2019s dealership was located, and that Mark IV therefore was immune from G. L. c. 93A liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The judge would have been warranted in finding that Mark IV had \u201creason to know\u201d that certain of the allegations stated a claim of violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and that Mark IV\u2019s decision not to make a written offer of settlement before trial<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was made in bad faith. The statute provides that these questions be answered by the judge. We remand this aspect of the case for such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">4. <em>Grant of directed verdict. </em>In its appeal, Mark IV argues that the judge erred in granting a directed verdict in favor of Ronald Stone with respect to a counterclaim made by Mark IV against Stone. In that counterclaim, Mark IV had alleged that Stone \u201ccaused, or . . . permitted, said mobile home units to be improperly erected and improperly placed on site prior to sale,\u201d and that the damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 property resulted from this improper placement and erection. Mark IV failed to sustain its burden of proof in regard to this claim. There is no dispute that each of the units in which the plaintiffs resided was erected by employees of Kapper, a dealer of Mark IV homes, or that Mark IV homes always were erected by the dealer. The defendant directs us to no evidence from which a trier of fact reasonably could conclude that Stone erected the homes or that Kapper, in erecting the six homes originally sold to Stone, was acting as Stone\u2019s agent. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">5. <em>Admission of testimony relevant to notice. </em>Mark IV claims error in the admission of the testimony of Lowell Baldwin who, as a New York dealer of homes manufactured by Mark IV, had sold three such modular homes with roofs substantially similar to those of the plaintiffs\u2019 units. Baldwin testified, over Mark IV\u2019s objection, that in March, 1974, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>had notified a sales manager employed by the subsidiary of Mark IV (Homes by Dunhill), which manufactured the units sold to the plaintiffs, of problems with leakage through the roof of the first Mark IV home he sold, and later informed him of leakage problems involving other Mark IV units. The judge offered to give the jury a limiting instruction regarding the purpose of Baldwin\u2019s testimony. Mark IV, insisting that Baldwin\u2019s testimony was inadmissible, declined the judge\u2019s offer. Nonetheless, after dismissing the c. 93A claims the judge restricted the jury\u2019s use of Baldwin\u2019s testimony to the issue of whether Mark IV had notice that there were leakage problems with its units. On appeal, Mark IV argues that notice was not at issue in the case, and that to admit Baldwin\u2019s testimony therefore was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Evidence was introduced from which a trier of fact reasonably could conclude that Stone bought two Mark IV units in April, 1974, and later resold one of them to the Burnhams. The plaintiffs alleged that Mark IV negligently tested, inspected, marketed, advertised, and sold the homes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Whether Mark IV reasonably should have known of these leakage problems at the time of the sale of its units to Stone in April, 1974, is relevant to the issue whether Mark IV was negligent in the testing, inspection, marketing, and sale of the homes. Baldwin\u2019s testimony regarding complaints he made to Mark IV\u2019s employee in March, 1974, bears on that issue. Since notice was therefore an issue in the case, the defendant\u2019s claim of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">6. <em>Jury instructions. </em>Mark IV objected to the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury that, with respect to mitigation of damages, \u201ca plaintiff cannot sit idly by and let damages increase without doing something about it. . . . [T]he plaintiffs, however, are not obligated to expend more than a nominal sum to repair the damages. . . . [I]t\u2019s the law <em>that the plaintiffs . . . must take all reasonable means to mitigate the dam</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>ages. But that they are not required to expend more than a </em>nominal amount of money. Nominal in this case being more than <em>trifling amount of money to repair the damages\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Mark IV now asserts that the judge\u2019s use of the word \u201ctrifling\u201d requires us to reverse the judgment against it. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The general rule with respect to mitigation of damages is that a plaintiff may not recover for damages that were avoidable by the use of reasonable precautions on his part. <em>Fairfield </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>213 Mass. 296, 297 (1913). The United States Supreme Court has phrased the rule, with respect to contract actions, as follows: \u201c[Wjhere a party is entitled to the benefit of a contract, and can save himself from a loss arising from a breach of it at a trifling expense or with reasonable exertions, it is his duty to do it, and he can charge the delinquent with such damages only as with reasonable endeavors and expense he could not prevent.\u201d <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Stoddart, </em>105 U.S. 224, 229 (1881).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cThe word \u2018trifling\u2019 in this passage has reference to the situation of the parties. It means a sum which is trifling in comparison with the consequential damages which the plaintiff is seeking to recover in the particular case.\u201d <em>Bear Cat Mining Co. </em>v. <em>Grasselli Chem. Co., </em>247 F. 286, 288 (8th Cir. 1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">While the judge perhaps should have explained the law regarding mitigation of damages more clearly, emphasizing the factor of reasonableness and laying less stress on the amount of money expended which a trier of fact might find to have constituted a reasonable effort at mitigation, we do not comprehend how his use of the term \u201ctrifling\u201d could have misled the jury. It appears that all plaintiffs took some measures, ranging from coating all or parts of their roofs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>with various substances, to replacing those roofs, in response to their leakage problems. The first of these measures was the remedy most often tried, both by the plaintiffs and by Mark IV\u2019s workmen. It was Mark IV\u2019s normal remedy for such problems, and was relatively inexpensive. In so far as Mark IV argues that only those plaintiffs who replaced their roofs took reasonable measures to mitigate their damages, the record does not support this assertion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In any event, we do not comprehend how, on the facts of this case, the instruction on damages could have prejudiced Mark IV. That instruction certainly does not require reversal of the judgment against Mark IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Mark IV also asserts that the judge erred in instructing the jury on the assessment and measure of damages, in that his instructions allegedly led the jury to believe that, if they found for the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the amount it would cost them to have their roofs replaced. The judge instructed the jury that the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery, if any, with respect to the problems with their roofs, should be \u201ca sum of money that would place them back in the position that they were. In other words, [with] a good leak-proof roof.\u201d He further instructed them that because, as \u201cwe are all aware of the fact that inflation has swept the country, . . . the amount of damages [awarded should] be based upon [the amount necessary] to fix the roof, at a reasonable time after the damage has occurred.\u201d This was clearly not an instruction that the jury should find in an amount that would enable the plaintiffs to replace the roofs. Taken in its entirety, the charge left to the jury to decide what constituted a reasonable remedial measure and what the cost of that measure would be. This claim of error is therefore groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Mark IV argues, finally, that the judge erred in instructing the jury, if they found for the plaintiffs, to deliver a verdict granting a single award of damages. This instruction was based on the judge\u2019s belief that the complaint was so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>structured as to preclude the jury from returning verdicts for each individual plaintiff. The defendant objected to the instruction, and requested that the judge instruct the jury to answer written interrogatories regarding the amount of damages awarded to each plaintiff. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 49 (b), 365 Mass. 812 (1974). That rule states that the judge <em>may </em>submit such interrogatories to the jury. The judge has wide discretion as to whether or not special questions should be submitted to the jury. <em>Viaux </em>v. <em>John T. Scully Found. Co., </em>247 Mass. 296, 301 (1924). In any event, Mark IV has not suggested how the denial of its request for jury interrogatories, or the instruction to return an undifferentiated verdict, could have resulted in prejudice to it. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">7. <em>Disposition. </em>The case is remanded to the Superior Court where the judge shall determine the amount of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs which are to be awarded to the plaintiffs. The judge shall also determine whether Mark IV refused to grant relief upon demand to the plaintiffs in bad faith with knowledge or reason to know that the act or practice complained of violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, and, if he determines that to have been the case, shall fix the amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiffs. G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3). The judgment in favor of the plaintiffs entered on October 27, 1980, is to be modified in accordance with these determinations. The judgment in favor of Stone on Mark IV\u2019s counterclaim, entered on October 24, 1980, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\"> These homes were designed to be transported in two sections to a homesite, and placed on permanent foundations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\"> Doing business as Homes by Dunhill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b591-9\"> Since the motion was filed during trial and pressed by the defendant at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, it was not error for the judge to rule on the motion at that time, although it would have been preferable for him to have heard all the evidence before disposing of the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\"> Stone sued Mark IV solely in his capacity as the \u201cconsumer\u201d of the home he retained, and not as a purchaser of homes for resale.

The Attorney General notes that, in the context of suits brought by businessmen under \u00a7 11 of G. L. c. 93A, several Federal courts have used what appears to be a variant of such an analysis, and concluded that recovery under c. 93A was barred by the provisions of \u00a7 3 (1) (\u00a3&gt;). See, e.g., <em>Boston Super Tools </em>v. <em>RW Technologies, </em>467 F. Supp. 558 (D. Mass. 1979); U.S. <em>Broadcasting </em>v. <em>National Broadcasting, </em>439 F. Supp. 8 (D. Mass. 1977). Our resolution of the issue raised by the plaintiffs in this case does not require us to consider the Attorney General\u2019s suggestions in depth at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Regulation VII B, 20 Code Mass.
