We conclude that the judge correctly denied the motion to suppress. However, we also conclude that the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury on the issue of voluntariness, in excluding the testimony of the defense psychiatrist and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>admitting the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s psychiatrist. We therefore reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We summarize the facts. On April 9, 1978, an apartment building at 39 Chelmsford Street, Lawrence, burned down. Seven people died in this fire. The defendant was at the scene of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">On April 9, 11, and 13, 1978, the defendant gave detailed statements to the police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On each occasion, an officer of the Lawrence police department advised the defendant in Spanish, his native language, of the Miranda warnings. Prior to giving each of these statements, the defendant signed a card indicating that he understood these warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">On April 8, 1978, the defendant attended a party. At that party he told one witness that \u201che was going to set fire on Chelmsford Street.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At approximately 5 a.m., on April 9, 1978, the fire broke out at 39 Chelmsford Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">After his arrest, the defendant was taken to the Essex County house of correction. While there, the defendant bragged to a fellow inmate that he set the fire at 39 Chelms-ford Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the statements he made to the police and these private citizens. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>judge denied this motion, and the trial proceeded. The main issue at trial was criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">1. <em>Motion to Suppress.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">a. <em>Statements to police. </em>The defendant claims that his statements to the police were inadmissible, because they were not the product of a rational intellect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u201c[Bjefore any statement by a defendant to law enforcement officers or their agents may be placed before the jury, the Commonwealth must prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt. If the judge concludes that [a] defendant\u2019s statements are voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt, that conclusion \u2018must appear from the record with unmistakable clarity.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 152 (1982), quoting <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>385 U.S. 538, 544 (1967). Moreover, the judge\u2019s decision as to the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements involves a consideration of the defendant\u2019s mental condition. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>378 Mass. 451, 456-457 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>373 Mass. 21, 25 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 690 (1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976). See <em>Eisen </em>v. <em>Picard, </em>452 F.2d 860 (1st Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 950 (1972). \u201cIf the defendant comes forward with evidence of insanity at the time of his [statements], the judge is obliged initially to determine whether the statements given were the \u2018product of a rational intellect as part of the issue of voluntariness.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chung, supra </em>at 457, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnston, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>380 Mass. 30, 40 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">At the suppression hearing, the judge considered the defendant\u2019s mental state. He gave special attention to the expert testimony presented by two psychiatrists.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>because the statements to the police were \u201cchronological,\u201d \u201ccoherent,\u201d and exculpatory, the judge determined that the defendant \u201cunderstood his position.\u201d He therefore concluded that these statements were a \u201cmeaningful act of volition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">These findings are amply supported by the record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was evidence at the suppression hearing that when the police began their interrogation, the defendant was \u201ccalm,\u201d \u201ccoherent,\u201d and \u201ccooperative.\u201d Moreover, the clarity and detail of the defendant\u2019s statements to the police suggest a normal memory and a lack of confusion. When questioned about the fire, the defendant denied that he was responsible. This attempt at exculpation is evidence from which the judge could find that the defendant was aware that his statements to the police could have adverse consequences, and therefore the statements were voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Although there was evidence that the defendant was suffering from intermittent schizophrenia or toxic psychosis at the time he gave his statements, the judge was not required to allow the motion to suppress. \u201c[Tjhere is no per se rule holding inadmissible [statements] given by individuals suffering severe psychotic conditions. Rather, a [statement] is inadmissible if it would not have been obtained but for the effects of the confessor\u2019s psychosis. There is nothing unfair about using the admissions of a psychotic individual where the giving of the admissions is not substantially related to the effects of the psychosis. In such a case, no advantage has been taken of the individual\u2019s disability.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Gibbs </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Warden of Ga. State Penitentiary, </em>450 F. Supp. 242, 244 (M.D. Ga. 1978), aff\u2019d 589 F.2d 1113 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">b. <em>Statements to civilians. </em>The defendant made two statements to civilians, which he sought to suppress. On April 8, 1978, he told one witness that he was going to set fire to Chelmsford Street. After his arrest, he boasted to a fellow inmate at the Essex County house of correction in Salem that he set the fire. Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662 (1975), the defendant claims that the judge erred in admitting these statements, because he failed to consider whether these statements were the product of a rational intellect. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, 368 </em>Mass. 662, 679-681 (1975), we held that a judge must determine the voluntariness of statements extracted by private coercion unalloyed with any government involvement. We reached this result because \u201ca statement obtained through coercion and introduced at trial is every bit as offensive to civilized standards of adjudication when the coercion flows from private hands as when official depredations elicit a confession. Statements extracted by a howling lynch mob or a lawless private pack of vigilantes from a terrorized, pliable suspect are repugnant to due process mandates of fundamental fairness and protection against compulsory self-incrimination. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Berve, </em>51 Cal. 2d 286, 290 (1958).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, supra </em>at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">But that rationale does not apply to this case. At the suppression hearing there was no evidence that the defendant\u2019s statements to private citizens were the product of coercion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, supra, </em>did not require the judge to determine whether the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ant\u2019s statements to private citizens were a meaningful act of volition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge acted properly in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">2. <em>Failure to Instruct the Jury on the Issue of Voluntariness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The defendant claims that the judge erred because he failed to instruct the jury on the issue whether the defendant\u2019s statements to the police were the product of a rational intellect. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\u201cOur \u2018humane practice\u2019 requires that \u2018when [a defendant\u2019s incriminating] statements . . . are offered in evidence, the. question whether they were voluntary is to be decided at a preliminary hearing by the presiding judge in the absence of the jury. If he is satisfied that they are voluntary, they are admissible; otherwise they should be excluded.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>380 Mass. 30, 39-40 (1980), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>338 Mass. 460, 461-462 (1959). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vick, </em>381 Mass. 43, 45 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>378 Mass. 451, 456 (1979). If the judge decides that they are admissible, he should then \u201cinstruct the jury that the Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements] [were] voluntary and that the jurors must disregard the statement^] unless the Commonwealth has met its burden.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 152 (1982). \u201cWhile there is no duty to ask the jury to pass on voluntariness unless it is made a live issue at trial, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alicea, </em>376 Mass. 506, 522-523 (1978), \u2018if credible evidence of insanity at the time of the [statements] is presented to the jury, our practice requires jury reconsideration as to the question of the defendant\u2019s rationality, . . . \u201cas part of the issue of voluntariness.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>380 Mass. 30, 40 (1980), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>378 Mass. 451, 456-457 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">At trial, there was substantial evidence before the judge that the defendant was suffering from a psychotic episode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>for one month before the crime, and for a short time after the crime. Thus, \u201cthe judge had an independent obligation to instruct the jury to consider the voluntariness of the [defendant\u2019s statements to the police].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>380 Mass. 30, 41 (1980), quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Chung, </em>378 Mass. 451, 458 n.8 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vick, </em>381 Mass. 43, 45 (1980). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 150 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s psychiatrist relied on the statements to the police in arriving at his opinion on criminal responsibility. The statements were a critical part of the Commonwealth\u2019s case both on the issue of guilt and on the issue of criminal responsibility. In these circumstances, we conclude that there is a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>380 Mass. 30, 38-39 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>378 Mass. 451 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>373 Mass. 21 (1977). Thus, the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the issue of voluntariness requires reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions of murder in the second degree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">3. <em>Exclusion of Testimony by the Defense Psychiatrist.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The defendant claims that the judge erred in excluding the testimony of the defense psychiatrist as to whether his statements to a fellow inmate were the product of a rational intellect.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The defense psychiatrist characterized the defendant\u2019s statements to the inmate as suggestive of psychosis, and used these statements as one basis for his conclusion that the defendant lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>nality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544 (1977). The excluded testimony on the question whether the statements to the inmate were the product of a rational intellect might have added support to that conclusion. Since criminal responsibility was the main issue at trial, the exclusion of the defense psychiatrist\u2019s testimony requires reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction of arson as well as his convictions of murder in the second degree. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>373 Mass. 21 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">4. <em>Admission of Testimony hy the Commonwealth\u2019s Psychiatrist.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s expert to testify that the defendant was criminally responsible. The defendant argues that the admission of the expert\u2019s opinion in this form was error. We agree. An expert may only express his opinion concerning a defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility in accord with the standard set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544 (1967). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laliberty, </em>373 Mass. 238 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The judgments are reversed, the verdicts set aside, and the cases are remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-10\"> At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for required findings of not guilty to so much of the indictments as charged murder in the first degree. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for required findings of not guilty to so much of the indictments as charged murder in the second degree, and manslaughter, and to the indictment for arson. The defendant does not claim error in these rulings, and we deem the defendant\u2019s failure to argue these issues as a waiver. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 150 n.22 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981); Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975). However, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we consider the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion. See note 11, <em>infra. </em>We conclude that there is ample evidence to withstand that motion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, </em>379 Mass. 117, 134-135 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-11\"> The defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment on the murder convictions, and a concurrent sentence of eighteen to twenty years on the arson conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\"> On April 9, 1978, the defendant told the police that he walked by 39 Chelmsford Street on his way home from a party. Arriving at 39 Chelmsford Street, he saw flames coming out of the house. When the police pointed out that 39 Chelmsford Street was not on his way home, the defendant said that he was going to see a girl friend on Center Street. However, the defendant refused to disclose the name or address of this girl friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">During this interview, the defendant also admitted that he had entered the building and that he had a lighter in his hand when he left the building. The defendant said that he went inside to warn people to leave the building. Because of all the smoke, the defendant said that he needed his lighter to see.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">On April 11,1978, the defendant did not deny that he had told a person at the April 9 party that he was going to burn Chelmsford Street. Instead, he said that he did not remember making this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">On April 13, 1978, the defendant admitted that a friend drove him to Chelmsford Street fifteen minutes before the fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b112-14\"> The defendant had lived at 39 Chelmsford Street with one of the tenants and her two children. Prior to the fire, the tenant ordered the defendant to leave the premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b113-9\"> The defendant concedes that the police fully apprised him of the Miranda warnings. Thus, the defendant does not argue that the judge should have suppressed the statements to the police because they violated the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b113-10\"> The defendant\u2019s psychiatrist and the Commonwealth\u2019s psychiatrist testified at the suppression hearing. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert examined the defendant\u2019s statements to the police and determined that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>was criminally responsible. Relying in part on the statements to the inmate, the defense psychiatrist concluded that the defendant lacked criminal responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b114-10\"> Other evidence presented at the suppression hearing supports the judge\u2019s findings. Two newspapermen who were present at the scene of the fire testified that they spoke with the defendant, and that he was responsive to their questions and gave them a coherent story.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b114-11\"> Courts do exclude statements by individuals suffering from mental illness if the disease rendered the individual incapable of understanding the meaning and effect of a confession or caused the individual to be indifferent to self-protection. See <em>Pea </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 F.2d 627, 634-635 (D.C. Cir. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 679-681 (1975), a judge must determine the voluntariness of statements to private citizens, if the defendant introduces some evidence of physical or psychological coercion. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>439 F.2d 553 (D.C. Cir. 1970); <em>People </em>v. <em>Haydel, </em>12 Cal. 3d 190 (1974). We leave open the issue whether a judge is ever required to determine the voluntariness of statements to civilians in circumstances that fall short of coercion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\"> Since the judge was not required to determine whether the defendant\u2019s statements to private citizens were a meaningful act of volition, it follows that he did not have to submit this issue to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b117-9\"> Although the defendant did not object to the charge on this ground, these crimes occurred before July 1,1979. We therefore review these convictions under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>380 Mass. 1, 12-17 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b117-10\"> The Commonwealth objected to the admission of this testimony. The basis of the Commonwealth\u2019s objections is not clear. The defendant made a timely offer of proof that the psychiatrist would testify that the statements to the inmate were not the product of a rational intellect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
