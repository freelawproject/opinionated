L. c. 231A and for relief in the nature of mandamus under G.

The action was fil\u00e9d in the county court. The plaintiffs, James J. Welch &amp; Co., Inc. (Welch), and a joint venture organization composed of The Volpe Construction Co., Inc.; Dimeo Construction Company; Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, Inc.; and Gutierrez Construction Co., Inc. (VDOG), were successful general bidders on contracts awarded by the Bureau of Building Construction (BBC), a State agency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Welch\u2019s contract, awarded in 1979, was for work on the Walter E. Fernald State School; VDOG was awarded a contract in 1980 for work on the State Transportation Building. At issue is whether former G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 441 (l),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> required the DCPO to allow the plaintiffs additional \u201cexpenses and profits\u201d based on adjustments to the general contract prices caused by the BBC\u2019s substitution of filed subbidders for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>allowances which it had required the plaintiffs to carry in their general bids.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The statutorily prescribed general bid form in use at the relevant times was divided into two parts to distinguish the amount allocated to the general bidder and that allocated to the subbidders it would use.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The general bidder was required to list in Item 2 the details of all the subbids it intended to use, as well as any allowances in lieu of subbids which the awarding agency had required. The general bidder was required to include in Item 1 the total cost of the \u201cwork of the general contractor, being all work other than that covered by Item 2.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44F, as amended through St. 1961, c. 604, \u00a7 5. In addition to the actual cost of labor and materials for such work, the general bidder would include in Item 1 his bond costs and his markup for expenses and profit. The \u201ccontract price\u201d would be the sum of the Item 1 price and the Item 2 price.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Former G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 441 (1), provided that, in the event the awarding agency caused a subbidder to be substituted for an allowance which it had previously required the general bidder to carry in Item 2 of its general bid, \u201cthe contract price shall be adjusted by the difference between the subcontract sum and the amount stated in the addendum. The general bidder shall include under Item 1 of the general bid form all expenses and profits on account of such adjustments.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>At the time the plaintiffs\u2019 bids were to be submitted, the BBC had not established a list of qualified subbidders for some of the subtrades. Accordingly, the BBC sent out addenda specifying the allowances to be made in Item 2 of the general bids for these categories. The plaintiffs incorporated these allowances in their successful bids. In each instance, the final subbid price which was substituted for these allowances was a figure in excess of the allowance. The BBC subsequently adjusted the plaintiffs\u2019 contract prices to reflect the differences. It also adjusted the Item 1 prices to account for increases in the bond premiums the plaintiffs were obligated to pay. When the BBC refused to allow increases in the Item 1 prices for \u201cexpenses and profits\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> resulting from the adjustments,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the plaintiffs brought this action before a single justice of this court who reserved and reported the case to the full bench.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">There is no disagreement about the purposes of the competitive bidding statute, former G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>As we have noted before: \u201cWe discern two fundamental, complementary legislative objectives underlying the competitive bidding statute. First, the statute enables the public contracting authority to obtain the lowest price for its work that competition among responsible contractors can secure. . . . Second, the statute establishes an honest and open procedure for competition for public contracts and, in so doing, places all general contractors and subbid-ders on an equal footing in the competition to gain the contract.\u201d <em>Interstate Eng\u2019g Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass. 751, 757-758 (1975). We must, of course, construe the statute to effectuate the objectives of its framers. <em>Id. </em>at 757. We are not free, however, simply to excise disputed language from its statutory context and interpret it according to those perceived objectives. \u201cIt is elementary that the meaning of a statute must, in the first instance, be sought in the language in which the act is framed, and if that is plain, . . . the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d <em>Caminetti </em>v. <em>United States, </em>242 U.S. 470, 485 (1917). While we think that the last sentence of \u00a7 441 (1), standing alone, is less than plain as to when expenses and profits are to be included in Item 1, any indefiniteness is clarified by reference to the statutory context.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 441 (1), mandated that the \u201cgeneral bidder shall include under Item 1 of the general bid form all expenses and profits on account of . . . adjustments.\u201d In the preceding sentence of the statute, the term \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d was used to describe the person who either was to contract with the \u201clowest responsible and eligible subbidder\u201d whom he found unobjectionable or was to negotiate with the awarding agency concerning the sum to be paid to a replacement subcontractor. Though the terms were not defined in the statute, the term \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d was consistently used to describe only that \u201cgeneral bidder\u201d whose general bid was selected. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A, as amended through St. 1977, c. 968 (\u201cIf the general bidder selected as the general contractor . . .\u201d); G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44B (3), as amended through St. 1961, c. 604, \u00a7 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>(same); G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44F (\u201c[T]he general contractor shall be selected on the basis of . . . general bids\u201d). Obviously, a general bidder could not be selected as the general contractor before he submitted his general bid.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, by requiring the \u201cgeneral bidder\u201d to include expenses and profits in his general bid, the Legislature indicated that this inclusion was to take place when the general bid was submitted. Otherwise, it would have used the term \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d as it did in the preceding sentence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">When we look to other specific provisions for adjustments to either the contract or item prices, a pattern emerges which we think further indicates that adjustments to Item 1 for \u201cexpenses and profits\u201d based on subsequent adjustments to the contract price were not intended. Section 441 (2) and (3) provided that, in the event it became necessary to substitute a new subbidder for one listed in the general bid,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>contract price would be adjusted by the difference between the new subbid price and the price of the one previously listed. There were no provisions for including in Item 1 the expenses and profits based on these adjustments. However, \u00a7 441 (5) provided that any new bond premiums resulting from the substitution of a subbidder would be added to the Item 1 price unless the general contractor had indicated in his general bid that the original subbidder would furnish the bond. In addition, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 441 (6), inserted by St. 1967, c. 884, stated that, in any of the instances enumerated in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of that section, \u201cthe Item 1 price shall also be adjusted by the amount of the change in the premium for the general contractor\u2019s performance bond and his labor and materials or payment bond caused by the substitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The pattern we perceive is that, where an Item 2 adjustment was anticipated before the general bids were to be submitted, the Legislature provided the general bidder a mechanism to include expenses and profits based on that adjustment as part of his general bid. But where the necessity of the Item 2 adjustment was not perceived until after the lowest responsible and eligible general bidder was selected, the Legislature did not provide for an adjustment to the contract based on expenses and profits. In either case, the Legislature did allow the successful general bidder to recoup any sum which represented his increased costs because of the substitution. Also, in either case, a general bidder did not lose all opportunity to build a reasonable profit into his Item 1 costs. Since a general bidder knew the extent of the work to be performed in the various subtrades for which allowances had been made before he submitted his general bid, even though he may not have known its final cost, he was free to include in his Item 1 costs a margin for expenses and profits based on the extent of that work. Of course, he bore the risk, as he would have in any event, that his over-all contract price would be higher than the next bidder\u2019s. Thus, all general bidders were on equal footing and the Commonwealth\u2019s objective of obtaining the lowest possible bid was still met.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>It may be that this system did not produce the lowest possible contract price in every instance. But it cannot be said that it was inequitable to the successful general bidder, for even if there were a substitution, the scope of his obligation to the awarding agency did not increase. He was still responsible only for that work which he had contracted to complete. It is not for us to decide whether this system best achieved the over-all objectives of the bidding laws. The Legislature may have contemplated a balance between the general bidder\u2019s expectation of profit based on total contract price and the public\u2019s interest in obtaining the lowest bid. Compare <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 101 (1982) (possible legislative balance between tenant protection and legitimate interests of landlord). Such an objective was within the Legislature\u2019s power, and the system it devised did no violence to the public good. Even if we were to decide that a better system could have been devised, we would not substitute our judgment for that of the Legislature. See <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701, 706-707 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lammi, </em>386 Mass. 299, 300 (1982). Accordingly, we remand the case to the county court where a judgment is to enter declaring that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 441 (1), did not require the Division of Capital Planning and Operations to allow the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for expenses and profits. Relief in the nature of mandamus is to be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b677-5\"> Statute 1980, c. 579, shifted to the DCPO responsibility for contracts previously awarded by the BBC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b677-6\"> General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 441 (1), inserted by St. 1956, c. 679, \u00a7 1, provided in full: \u201cIf no sub-bid is filed for a sub-trade designated in Item 2 of the general bid form or if a rejection of all sub-bids for such a sub-trade occurs pursuant to section forty-four D or section forty-four H, the awarding authority shall state, in an addendum issued with the list of sub-bidders required by section forty-four H, the amount to be included by a general bidder under Item 2 of the general bid form for such sub-trade; and without in any way affecting other sub-bidders who have conformed to the prescribed bidding procedure, new sub-bids for such sub-trade shall be requested forthwith by written invitation to three or more qualified sub-bidders and shall be publicly opened and read by the awarding authority at a time and place to be specified in such invitation.

Since the events giving rise to this suit occurred prior to July 1, 1981, the effective date of that act, this case will be decided under the provisions of former G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L, and all references will be to c. 149 as it existed prior to the 1980 amendment, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\"> The bid form was set out in G.

(except for changes pursuant to Mass. G. L. Chapter 149, Section 441).\u201d The adjustments were to be calculated according to three specified methods. However, the contracts entered as exhibits here provide four such methods, the last of which would allow the general contractor a seven percent markup on work performed by sub-bidders pursuant to an agreed change in the contract. The plaintiffs apparently draw their figures as to how much they should be allowed for expenses and profits from these provisions. The plaintiffs are not entitled to expenses and profits based on the contract because it excludes changes pursuant to \u00a7 441. Since we have determined that there is no statutory obligation in this case for the defendants to include expenses and profits, we need not reach the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the defendants cannot raise the contract as a defense to the statutory obligation to pay expenses and profits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\"> Prior to bringing suit, Welch requested the Commissioner of Labor and Industries, who was authorized by \u00a7 44K to enforce the bidding statute, to hold an informal hearing concerning this refusal. The hearing was held and a written decision directing the BBC to allow Welch\u2019s request was issued. The BBC did not comply with this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\"> We note also that the definition of the \u201clowest responsible and eligible bidder\u201d in \u00a7 44A did not equate that bidder with the general contractor. Even if a bidder was selected as the \u201clowest responsible and eligible bidder,\u201d he was not necessarily awarded the contract. If an adjustment to the contract price because of the agreed substitution of a subcontractor caused the general bid of the \u201clowest responsible and eligible bidder\u201d first selected to exceed the general bid price of the second lowest responsible and eligible bidder, the latter became the general contractor unless, by the same process, adjustments forced him to yield to the third lowest responsible and eligible bidder or to the first selected bidder. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 441 (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> The provisions of former \u00a7 441 (1) are now contained, with slight changes, in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44F (4) (a), which states that \u201cthe contract price shall be adjusted by the difference between the sub-contract sum and the amount stated in the addendum. The general bidder shall include in the cost of his own work on the general bid form all expenses and profits on account of such adjustments.\u201d While we realize that most of the change in language can be accounted for by the fact that a standard general bid form is no longer used, we think that the Legislature\u2019s continued use of the term \u201cgeneral bidder,\u201d despite other language changes, demonstrates that it meant to keep the distinction as to general bidder and general contractor clear. \u201cSubsequent legislation may be considered in the interpretation of prior legislation on the same subject.\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>322 Mass. 177, 180 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\"> Substitution may occur when a subbidder defaults or when the selected general bidder and the awarding agency agree to substitute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
