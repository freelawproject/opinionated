The single justice reserved and reported the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">\u201c1. Whether the Board of Registration in Medicine (board) had the right to revoke the plaintiff\u2019s license to practice medicine for conviction of a crime unrelated to the practice of medicine, in view of the 1977 amendment to the General Laws, as set forth in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5 (g), authorizing disciplinary proceedings against a physician who \u2018has been convicted of a criminal offense which reasonably calls into question his ability to practice medicine.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">\u201c2. Whether the board\u2019s revocation of the plaintiff\u2019s license to practice medicine unconstitutionally deprives him of liberty and property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">\u201c3. Whether the board\u2019s procedures were unlawful, in so far as members of the board, including the hearing officer designated by the board to preside over the disciplinary proceedings, brought charges against the plaintiff and thereafter sat in judgment to determine the validity of these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">\u201c4. Whether the board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and warranted by the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">\u201c5. Whether the board\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">We answer each question favorably to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">The board commenced an adjudicatory proceeding against Raymond by serving upon him an order to show cause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>The order to show cause, as subsequently amended, alleged in material part: (1) that Raymond had sold under \u201cclandestine circumstances\u201d two automatic submachine guns and four pistols on or about May 4, 1974, in North Bergen, New Jersey; (2) that Raymond had transferred, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861 (e) (1976), and sold, under \u201cclandestine circumstances,\u201d five unregistered pistols on or about May 15, 1974, in Newark, New Jersey; and (3) that Raymond had been convicted on June 25, 1975, in the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, of knowing possession of two unregistered automatic submachine guns, each equipped with a silencer, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861 (d) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The board assigned the case to a hearing officer, who conducted an evidentiary hearing. The hearing officer found that the allegations set forth in the order to show cause were proved. There was ample support in the evidence for these findings, and Raymond does not challenge them. The hearing officer recommended to the board that Raymond\u2019s license be revoked on the ground that he was not of such \u201cgood moral character\u201d as to warrant his continued practice of medicine in this Commonwealth. The board adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings, and concluded that Raymond \u201cha[d] been convicted of a criminal offense and ha[d] engaged in other unlawful acts which reasonably call[ed] into question his ability to practice medicine.\u201d The board revoked Raymond\u2019s license on three separate grounds: (1) conviction of a crime; (2) lack of good moral character; and (3) conduct undermining the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the medical profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">1. <em>The Board\u2019s Authority.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 5, as amended through St. 1977, c. 165, provides that the board may revoke the certificate of registration of a physician upon proof that the physician \u201c (g) has been convicted of a criminal offense which reasonably calls into question his ability to practice medicine.\u201d Section 5 further provides that \u201c[t]he board shall, after proper notice and hearing, adopt rules and regulations governing the practice of medicine in order to promote the pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>lie health, welfare, and safety and nothing in this section shall be construed to limit this general power of the board.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 28, 1976, pursuant to the authority vested in it by c. 112, \u00a7 5, the board promulgated a rule making conviction of any crime a basis for discipline. See Rules of Procedure Governing Disciplinary Proceedings, \u00a7 1.03 (5) (a) (7) (1979) (\u201cA complaint against a physician . . . may be founded on . . . conviction of any crime\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Raymond contends that \u00a7 5 (g), which was added to c. 112 by St. 1977, c. 165, invalidates the board\u2019s regulation which makes conviction of any crime a basis for discipline. He argues that the enactment of \u00a7 5 (g) demonstrates the legislative will that the board may discipline a physician for conviction of a crime only when the conviction reasonably calls into question the physician\u2019s ability to practice medicine. Raymond recognizes that in <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 526 (1979), we held, without consideration of \u00a7 5 (g), added by St. 1977, \u00a7 165, that the regulation in question was reasonably related to the legislative purpose of promoting the public health, welfare, and safety, and consequently was valid. The addition of \u00a7 5 (g) by St. 1977, \u00a7 165, did not demonstrate a change in legislative purpose. Its enactment served only to expand the list of reasons for discipline set out in \u00a7 5. The regulation continues to be reasonably related to the statutory purpose, and continues to be valid. The legislative will in this regard is made clear by the provision in c. 112, \u00a7 5, that \u201c[t]he board shall . . . adopt rules and regulations governing the practice of medicine in order to promote the public health, welfare, and safety <em>and nothing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number><em>in this section shall be construed to limit this general power of the </em>board\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Raymond could be disciplined for his criminal conviction under c. 112, \u00a7 5, as well as under the board\u2019s regulations. Section 5 (g) provides that a physician is subject to discipline if he is convicted of a crime which reasonably calls into question his ability to practice medicine. The board correctly found that Raymond\u2019s conviction reasonably called into question his ability to practice medicine. To be sure, the conviction did not arise out of Raymond\u2019s medical practice. That is not essential however. The ability to practice medicine requires not only technical competence, but also the unswerving dedication to employ it to preserve life, restore health, and alleviate suffering. See <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, supra </em>at 527-528; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>239 Mass. 424, 428-429 (1921) (\u201cMere intellectual power and scientific achievement without uprightness of character may be more harmful than ignorance. Highly trained intelligence combined with disregard of the fundamental virtues is a menace\u201d). It is difficult to conceive of an attitude more antithetical to a commitment to preserve life, alleviate suffering, and restore health, than the mentality demonstrated by knowing possession of unregistered automatic submachine guns. See <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 495, 497 (1981), appeal dismissed, 455 U.S. 931 (1982) (lack of substantial Federal question) (\u201cThe Legislature may well have inferred from common knowledge that the unlicensed possession of machine guns is almost always associated with the commission of violent crimes with the potential for mass killing\u201d). Raymond\u2019s conviction unquestionably calls into question his ability to practice medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The board\u2019s second and third grounds for revoking Raymond\u2019s license were that he lacked good moral character and that his conduct undermined the confidence of the public in the integrity of the medical profession. As we have noted, the board has authority to \u201cadopt rules and regula-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tians governing the practice of medicine in order to promote the public health, welfare, and safety.\u201d G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5. Lack of good moral character and conduct undermining the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the medical profession are not specifically included among the statutory or regulatory grounds for discipline.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board, however, need not adopt its rules and regulations by formal rule making. Although formal promulgation may be the best practice,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the board may adopt policies by adjudication as well. <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>383 Mass. 299, 312-313 (1981). The board did so here by announcing that lack of good moral character and conduct that undermines public confidence in the integrity of the medical profession are grounds for discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Raymond contends that these are proper disciplinary grounds only if the offensive conduct occurs in the course of, or is \u201crelated to,\u201d the practice of medicine. This is the same argument that he advances against the board\u2019s authority to adopt a rule making conviction of any crime a basis for discipline, and it fails for the reason stated in our discussion of that issue. Disciplining physicians for lack of good moral character, and for conduct that undermines public confidence in the integrity of the profession, is reasonably related to promotion of the public health, welfare, and safety, A physician\u2019s bad moral character may reasonably call into question his ability to practice medicine. In addition, conduct such as Raymond\u2019s, some of which led to criminal conviction, undermines the .public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the medical profession. The board has the authority to protect the image of the profession. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, supra </em>at 528, and its second and third grounds for revocation of Raymond\u2019s license are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>2. <em>Lawfulness of the Board\u2019s Procedure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Raymond argues that the board\u2019s procedures violated his constitutional right to due process, and his right to a \u201cfull and fair hearing,\u201d as required by the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 10. He contends that the combination of investigative and adjudicative functions performed by the board caused it to be a biased decision-maker. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The board\u2019s rules, promulgated pursuant to its authority under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 61, provide that complaints against physicians shall be reviewed by a complaint committee. 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.03(2) (1979). If, after the charged physician has had an opportunity to answer the complaint, 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.03(7) (1979), the committee determines that \u201cthere is reason to believe that the acts alleged occurred and constitute a violation for which a registrant may be sanctioned by the Board,\u201d the committee must forward the case to the board. 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.03(9) (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The board must review each case forwarded to it by the complaint committee and must \u201crequire an adjudicatory hearing if it determines that there is reason to believe that acts alleged occurred and constitute a violation\u201d for which a physician may be disciplined by the board. 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.03(10) (1979). At the adjudicatory hearing, the case against the physician \u201cmay be presented by a member of the Board or other person designated by the Board for this function.\u201d 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(4) (1979). The board may designate any board member to preside over any hearing held before it. 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(7) (1979). A final decision and order of the board requires the concurrence of at least four of its members. If the hearing officer is a member of the board, his vote counts in the event the board is not otherwise able to reach a final decision. 243 Code Mass. Regs. <em>\u00a7 </em>1.05(1) (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Raymond complains that the member of the board who moved that the order to show cause be served upon him was thereafter appointed hearing officer and conducted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>hearing, that complaint counsel was employed by the board, and that before the hearing all the board members, including the hearing officer, had access to the investigatory materials collected in the Raymond complaint file. In addition, he appears to assert that one or more of the board members who participated in the decision to issue the order to show cause also participated in the ultimate decision to revoke his license. We shall assume that these assertions are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Contentions similar to Raymond\u2019s were rejected by this court in <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>375 Mass. 227, 235 (1978). There, examiners employed by the Fraudulent Claims Board of the Division of Insurance challenged the procedure by which they were dismissed by the Commissioner of Insurance. The Commissioner had directed a deputy commissioner to conduct a study of the Fraudulent Claims Board. The deputy filed a lengthy report which concluded that the services performed by the Board did not justify maintaining it at its current level of personnel. <em>Id. </em>at 229. The Commissioner then notified fifty of the fifty-four bureau examiners that their employment was to terminate. However, he offered them the opportunity for hearings regarding their dismissal. The hearings were conducted by the Commissioner. The case presented to justify the dismissal consisted of the testimony and report of the deputy commissioner. After the hearings, the Commissioner rendered his opinions holding that the dismissals were justified. <em>Id. </em>at 230. The examiners challenged the procedure, alleging that the Commissioner was biased against them because of his role in prompting the investigation and because \u201che was evidently impressed by the report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235. We said, <em>id. </em>at 235, that the examiners\u2019 contention was answered by these words from <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 55 (1975): \u201cNo specific foundation has been presented for suspecting that the Board [the State examining board for physicians] had been prejudiced by its investigation or would be disabled from hearing and deciding on the basis of the evidence to be presented at the contested hearing. The mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>exposure to evidence presented in nonadversary investigative procedures is insufficient in itself to impugn the fairness of the Board members at a later adversary hearing. Without a showing to the contrary, state administrators \u2018are assumed to be men of conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>313 U.S. 409, 421 (1941).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court considered a due process challenge to the procedures used by the Wisconsin Examining Board in suspending a physician\u2019s license. A United States District Court had granted a preliminary injunction preventing the board from conducting a disciplinary hearing. The District Court had concluded that \u201cfor the board temporarily to suspend Dr. Larkin\u2019s license at its own contested hearing on charges evolving from its own investigation would constitute a denial to him of his right to procedural due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42. The Supreme Court disagreed with the District Court\u2019s assessment that the board \u201cdid not qualify as an independent decisionmaker and could not properly rule with regard to the merits of the same charges it investigated,\u201d and held that the District Court had abused its discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction. <em>Id. </em>at 46. The Court noted that \u201c[i]t is . . . very typical for the members of administrative agencies to receive the results of investigations, to approve the filing of charges or formal complaints instituting enforcement proceedings, and then to participate in the ensuing hearings .... The risk of bias or prejudgment in this sequence of functions has not been considered to be intolerably high or to raise a sufficiently great possibility that the adjudicators would be so psychologically wedded to their complaints that they would consciously or unconsciously avoid the appearance of having erred or changed position. Indeed, just as there is no logical inconsistency between a finding of probable cause and an acquittal in a criminal proceeding, there is no incompatability between [an] agency filing a complaint based on probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>cause and a subsequent decision, when all the evidence is in, that there has been no violation of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56-57. We are satisfied that the facts relied upon by Raymond do not demonstrate such a risk of prejudice or immutable adherence to a position unfavorable to him as to preclude a hearing that met the constitutional requirements of due process and the statutory requirements of fullness and fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In addition to his claim that the board\u2019s procedures were unlawful because they impermissibly mixed investigative and adjudicative functions, a claim which we reject, Raymond contends that before the commencement of the hearing, an individual who then was the secretary and a member of the board opined in correspondence that the case against Raymond \u201ccould probably be settled without going to full hearing,\u201d and expressed a \u201cfeeling that this case is becoming unnecessarily complicated.\u201d Although the combination of investigative and adjudicative functions in the board did not, without more, deny Raymond his constitutional or statutory rights, special circumstances in a particular case may demonstrate an unacceptable risk of unfairness. <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>421 U.S. at 58. The expressions of opinion on which Raymond relies, however, do not rise to that level. We also note that there is nothing in the record to show that, at the time of the board\u2019s decision, the author of the expressions of opinion was a member of the board or participated in its decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">We answer \u201cYes,\u201d to questions (1) and (4) reserved and reported by the single justice. We answer \u201cNo,\u201d to questions (2), (3), and (5). We remand the case to the single justice for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-14\"> Section 1.01.(2) of the rules of procedure governing the board\u2019s disciplinary proceedings defines an \u201corder to show cause\u201d as \u201ca paper served by the Board upon a registrant ordering the person to appear before the Board for an adjudicatory proceeding.\u201d 243 Code Mass.
