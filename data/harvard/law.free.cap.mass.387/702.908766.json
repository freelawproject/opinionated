G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (c), par. 3,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> inserted by St. 1980, c. 436, \u00a7 4. Marrone was sentenced to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Walpole, for a term of not less than fifteen nor more than twenty years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge reported questions to the Appeals Court concerning the correctness of the sentence and stayed the defendant\u2019s sentence. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>378 Mass. 489 (1979). We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We vacate the sentence and remand for further sentencing proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Marrone does not challenge the validity of his conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The reported questions are directed solely at the validity of the sentence imposed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In urging this court to uphold the sentence, the Commonwealth argues that we should construe G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (c), par. 3, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>as containing the word \u201cminimum,\u201d thus establishing a \u201cmandatory [minimum] term of fifteen years.\u201d The Commonwealth also urges that par. 3 should be construed so as to contain an implied maximum term of life. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>367 Mass. 655 (1975). The Commonwealth asserts that such a construction is consistent with G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24, see note 6, <em>infra, </em>which requires a minimum and maximum to be fixed for each State prison term, and with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Logan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The short answer to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument is that G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (c), par. 3, does not contain the word \u201cminimum.\u201d Hence, it would be sheer conjecture on our part to conclude that the Legislature meant the fifteen-year term to be either the maximum term or the minimum term. \u201cPlain omissions in the law to provide for exigencies which may arise cannot be supplied by <em>those charged with administering the law or by the courts in construing and interpreting the </em>statutes\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Thacher </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>250 Mass. 188, 190-191 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>(1924). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vickey, </em>381 Mass. 762, 765 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 354 (1974). See also <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>253 Mass. 247, 252 (1925).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">We conclude that the judge erred in construing the fifteen-year term in par. 3 of \u00a7 32E (c) as a minimum term. He also erred in concluding that he had authority to set a maximum term of twenty years. We \u201cwill not interpret a . . . criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what [the Legislature] intended.\u201d <em>Ladner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 169, 178 (1958). <em>Bifulco </em>v. <em>United States, </em>447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosscup, </em>369 Mass. 228, 234 (1975). Therefore, the minimum and maximum State prison terms imposed on Marrone must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">On remand, we think that the judge should sentence the defendant in accordance with G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (c), rather than par. 3 of that section. In reaching our conclusion, we necessarily reject the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that par. 3 should be construed as an implied repeal of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">A reading of St. 1980, c. 436, \u00a7 4, indicates that the vast majority of the 1980 provisions for drug related offenses are consistent with G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24, and require the judge to fix a minimum and maximum term for each State prison sentence. See, e.g., G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(a) </em>(not less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>one year nor more than ten years); \u00a7 32B <em>(a) </em>(not less than one and one-half years nor more than three years); \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(not less than three years nor more than ten years); and \u00a7 32E (c) (not less than five years nor more than fifteen years). Thus we conclude that St. 1980, c. 436, \u00a7 4, did not repeal by implication G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Further, since 1895<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (St. 1895, c. 504, \u00a7 1), statutes setting forth State prison penalties for criminal conduct have required the judge to set the minimum and maximum terms of imprisonment. Even if we were not \u201cloath to find that a prior statute has been superseded in whole or in part in the absence of express words to that effect or of clear implication,\u201d <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 585 (1981), we do not think that the Legislature would repeal by implication the Commonwealth\u2019s basic sentencing structure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The vice in all the Commonwealth\u2019s arguments is that they require us to resolve an ambiguity in a criminal statute in favor of the Commonwealth. \u201c[Ojrdinary rules of statutory construction require us to construe any criminal statute strictly against the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Aldoupolis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>386 Mass. 260, 267, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 864 (1982), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>366 Mass. 132, 137-138 (1974). Since \u201c [t]he words of a criminal statute must be such as to leave no reasonable doubt as to its meaning or the intention of the legislature,\u201d 3 C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>struction \u00a7 59.04, at 13 (4th ed. 1974), we hold that par. 3 of \u00a7 32E (c) is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Because par. 3 merely enhances the penalty for violation of \u00a7 32E (c), we conclude that Marrone still may be sentenced pursuant to the general provisions of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (c). \u201cWhenever various portions of a statute have independent force, thus justifying the inference that the enacting body would have passed one without the other, this court will uphold the remainder of the enactment after the offending portion has been struck.\u201d <em>Del Duca </em>v. <em>Town Adm\u2019r of Methuen, </em>368 Mass. 1, 13 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\"> General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (c), inserted by St. 1980, c. 436, \u00a7 4, provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who knowingly or intentionally manufactures, distributes, dispenses, or possesses with intent to manufacture, distribute, dispense or brings into this state in excess of 28 grams of any morphine, opium, or any salt, isomer, or salt of an isomer thereof, including heroin, or 28 grams or more of any mixture containing any such substance, shall be guilty of trafficking in heroin and shall be imprisoned for not less than five years and not more than fifteen years in the state prison. If the quantity is:</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">\u201c3. 200 grams or more, such person shall be imprisoned for a mandatory term of fifteen years in the state prison. A fine of not less than $50,000 and not more than $500,000 may also be imposed, but not in lieu of the mandatory term of imprisonment, as so authorized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-9\">The defendant was also convicted of possession of heroin with intent to distribute in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 (a), and was sentenced to M.C.I., Walpole, for a term of three to five years, concurrent with the sentence for violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E. The reported questions raise no issues concerning this conviction and sentence, and we therefore do not reach any issue as to this conviction. It is also not clear whether this indictment is based on the same conduct or different conduct from the indictment under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (c), par. 3. <em>Kuklis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>361 Mass. 302, 307-308 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\"> At trial, Marrone appears to have raised the issue whether the mixture of 200 grams or more, under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (c), par. 3, must be a mixture containing at least 200 grams of morphine, opium, or any salt, isomer, or salt of an isomer thereof, including heroin, and not a mixture of 200 grams or more containing such substance, irrespective of the quantity. Since none of the reported questions concerned the substantive offense, we do not reach or decide any issues concerning that portion of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\"> The questions as phrased in the report raise general issues of law concerning discretion in sentencing, the availability of M.C.I., Concord, as a sentencing alternative, and parole eligibility. The questions reported do not arise directly from the case. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979). We therefore have reframed the issues in an effort to answer the basic question of law raised by the report, namely, the validity of the sentence imposed on Marrone pursuant to G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (c), par. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\">If we were to supply the omitted word \u201cminimum,\u201d there would be a serious question of separation of powers. \u201c[I]t is for the Legislature to establish criminal sanctions and, as one of its options, it may prescribe a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Jackson, 369 Mass. 904, 922 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b719-9\"> General Laws c. 279, \u00a7 24, provides: \u201cIf a convict is sentenced to the state prison, except for life or as an habitual criminal, the court shall not fix the term of imprisonment, but shall fix a maximum and a minimum term for which he may be imprisoned. The maximum term shall not be longer than the longest term fixed by law for the punishment of the crime of which he has been convicted, and the minimum term shall not be less than two and one half years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b720-7\"> Prior to St. 1895, c. 504, \u00a7 1, the judge established the duration of a State prison sentence within tbe time limits set by the Legislature for the particular crime. The Legislature also established the minimum term for which persons could be sent to State prison. See, e.g., Rev. Sts. c. 139, \u00a7 9 (1836) (one year); Gen. Sts. c. 174, \u00a7 17 (1860) (one year); St. 1880, c. 15, \u00a7 1 (three years); Pub. Sts. c. 215, \u00a7 20 (1882) (three years).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b720-8\"> The Commonwealth also contends that the defendant is serving a flat fifteen-year sentence. We reject that argument because the judge imposed an indeterminate sentence (i.e., a maximum and a minimum) as required by G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24. Determinate sentences in this Commonwealth are confined to M.C.I., Concord. G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
