Her complaint alleged that her daughter\u2019s death was the result of respiratory suppression and other injuries proximately caused by the negligence of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">At the medical malpractice tribunal hearing held pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, the plaintiff submitted an offer of proof consisting of the following: an affidavit by her; a file review prepared for her attorney by a Dr. Baker, whose cur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>riculum vitae was included; abstracts of the birth and death records of her daughter; portions of hospital records, including a report of death; a postmortem report; a provisional anatomical diagnosis; office visit notes prepared by one of the defendants, Dr. Downey; and excerpts from the product information section of the Physician\u2019s Desk Reference as to the three drugs prescribed by Dr. Downey for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">After a hearing on December 13, 1979, the tribunal determined, in the words of the statute, that \u201cthe offer of proof and the evidence, if properly substantiated, is sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry.\u201d Prior to trial, the defendants submitted a motion in limine which sought the exclusion of the \u201cfinding\u201d of the tribunal from jury consideration. The trial judge held the statute to be unconstitutional in so far as it required the admission of such \u201cfinding\u201d in evidence. Hence, the motion was granted. Trial of the matter resulted in a jury verdict for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s subsequent, unsuccessful motion for a new trial was based, in part, on the exclusion of the tribunal \u201cfinding.\u201d Her notice of appeal incorporates that portion of her motion for a new trial in its sole claim of error. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We conclude that the exclusion from evidence of the determination of the tribunal was not error, but for reasons distinct from those stated by the trial judge. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In \u201c[ejvery action for malpractice, error or mistake against a provider of health care,\u201d a prospective plaintiff must, shortly after the filing of the defendant\u2019s answer, appear before \u201ca tribunal consisting of a single justice of the superior court, a physician licensed to practice medicine in the commonwealth [or a representative of the appropriate field of medicine] . . . and an attorney authorized to practice law in the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, inserted by St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 5. Upon being presented with the plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof, the tribunal, which is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>essence a screening body, is charged with determining whether \u201cthe evidence presented if properly substantiated is sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry or whether the plaintiff\u2019s case is merely an unfortunate medical result.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fifth paragraph of the statute provides, inter alla, that \u201c[t]he tribunal may upon the application of either party or upon its own decision summon or subpoena any such records or individuals to substantiate or clarify any evidence which has been presented before it and may appoint an impartial and qualified physician or surgeon or other related professional person or expert to conduct any necessary professional or expert examination of the claimant or relevant evidentiary matter and to report or to testify as a witness thereto. . . . The testimony of said witness and the decision of the tribunal shall be admissible as evidence at a trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In most respects, any challenges, constitutionally based or otherwise, to the tribunal procedure for medical malpractice suits were answered in <em>Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood Hosp., </em>373 Mass. 645 (1977). The question of the admissibility at a subsequent trial of the determination of the tribunal, which is argued before us in this case, was not, however, presented in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 652 n.9, 656. It is an issue which has been the subject of no small amount of controversy and criticism, since the probative worth of the finding is, on its face, minimal to be sure, while the potential for unfair prejudice arising from its admission is unquestionably great. See Cohen, Medical Malpractice Tribunals, Part II, Problems of Construction with a Proposal for Revision, 62 Mass. L.Q. 105, 107-108 (1977); McLaughlin, A Look at the Massachusetts Malpractice Tribunal System, 3 Am. J.L. &amp; Med. 197, 205 (1977); Note, The Massachusetts Medical Malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Statute: A Constitutional Perspective, 11 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 1289, 1307-1308 (1977); Barshak, The President\u2019s Page, 19 B.B.J. No. 9 at 3, 4-5 (1975).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">At the hearing on the motion in limine, the judge accepted the contention of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that the statute does not allow judicial discretion in the admission of the tribunal \u201cfinding.\u201d The judge apparently assumed that the words \u201cdetermination\u201d and \u201cdecision,\u201d found in the first and fifth paragraphs of the statute, refer to a \u201cfinding\u201d that no bond was required of plaintiff because the offer before the tribunal was \u201csufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry.\u201d His refusal, nevertheless, to admit the \u201cfinding\u201d was based in part on his belief that the admissibility provision of \u00a7 60B violates fundamental due process considerations in admitting a decision which is based on evidence not subject to cross-examination at the tribunal hearing. He ruled in addition that the tribunal decision is not evidence of negligence, that it has no probative value on the question, and that it therefore ought not to be presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The defendants, in challenging the validity of the statutory provision, argue that introduction of the tribunal finding violates the jury trial guarantees of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because the finding may be based on \u201csuspect evidence introduced at a nonadversarial, unilateral hearing which is not reviewable by the trial court before admission.\u201d Admission of such \u201cevidence,\u201d they claim, is likely to divert the jury from facts which should rightfully affect their verdict because of the undue deference typically given to a determination made by \u201cprofessionals.\u201d Alternatively, the defendants argue that the word \u201cdecision\u201d in the fifth paragraph of the statute does not apply to the tribunal\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d (described in the first paragraph) that the evidence presented to it, if properly substantiated, is sufficient \u201cto raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We begin with the proposition that it is our duty, if reasonably possible, to interpret statutes in a manner that avoids unnecessary decision of a serious constitutional question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Fazio </em>v. <em>Fazio, </em>375 Mass. 394, 405-406 (1978). <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>374 Mass. 744, 748-749 (1978). <em>Rugg </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Arlington, </em>364 Mass. 264, 268 (1973). See also <em>Ashwander </em>v. <em>TVA, </em>297 U.S. 288, 347-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). As construed by the judge, the language of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, raises a serious question of constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We have held that the introduction of an auditor\u2019s report as prima facie evidence at trial does not violate the right to a jury trial in a civil case. <em>Baldassare </em>v. <em>Crown Furniture Co., </em>349 Mass. 183, 189-190 (1965). <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>122 Mass. 505 (1877). Masters\u2019 reports are also admissible by virtue of Mass. R. Civ. P. 53 (e), as appearing in 386 Mass. 1236 (1982). Both such reports are \u201cmade after full hearing of both parties.\u201d <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Hunt, supra </em>at 519. And see <em>Lubell </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Stores, </em>342 Mass. 161, 163-165 (1961) (decision or finding by District Court for or against plaintiff after a trial is admissible). Similarly, statutes analogous to \u00a7 60B, which have been upheld in other jurisdictions, generally provide for a full hearing. See, e.g., <em>Seoane </em>v. <em>Ortho Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>660 F.2d 146, 148-149 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>DiAntonio </em>v. <em>Northampton-Accomack Memorial Hosp., </em>628 F.2d 287, 289-290 (4th Cir. 1980); <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>Akron City Hosp., </em>67 Ohio St. 2d 483, 487 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">If we assume the Legislature has mandated admission of the tribunal determination, it could be said that the Legislature has merely provided a means for allowing in evidence matter which would be otherwise inadmissible as hearsay. \u201cThe constitutional power of the Legislature to prescribe rules of evidence is well settled,\u201d and is often exercised \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>change the burden of proof, or to affect the question what shall be deemed <em>prima facie </em>evidence at the trial before the jury.\u201d <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Hunt, supra </em>at 516-517. See 1 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 7 (1940 &amp; Chadbourn rev. 1982). In this view of the statute, the Legislature would have blocked the application of both the hearsay and opinion evidence rules. At the same time, we would have to assume that, as regards relevance, a balance has been struck by the Legislature in favor of affording at least marginal probative value to the \u201cevidence.\u201d See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>369 Mass. 47, 59 (1975). McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 185, at 437 (2d ed. 1972); Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 401, 402. Were such \u201cevidence\u201d to be admitted and insulated from further comment by either the trial judge or opposing counsel, however, the likelihood of unfair prejudice flowing from this result might well reach constitutional limits. We do not construe the statute to require this result. <em>Lubell </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Stores, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">It could be argued further, however, that the findings of the tribunal would constitute something less than prima facie evidence; hence, a full hearing is not necessary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We, of course, are bound not to inquire into the wisdom or expedience of a statutory provision, <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701, 707 (1982); <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 33 (1971) (Tauro, C.J., concurring), even when that duty appears to us to require that we conduct ourselves like Lord Nelson at Copenhagen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a reviewing court, we instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>must \u201cpresume a statute\u2019s validity, and make all rational inferences in favor of it.\u201d <em>Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood Hosp., </em>373 Mass. 645, 650 (1977). But this principle does not mean that we should ascribe to the Legislature an intent to achieve an irrational result. Instead, we must read the statute in a way to give it a sensible meaning. <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562, 570 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The judge construed G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, as requiring that the \u201cdetermination\u201d made by the tribunal as to the plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof must be admitted at trial. To reach this result, he evidently read the language of the first paragraph, which directs the tribunal to \u201cdetermine\u201d if the evidence presented is sufficient, into the fifth paragraph, which provides that \u201cthe decision of the tribunal shall be admissible.\u201d Such a reading is contrary to the basic structure of the statute and violates the rule that where the Legislature has employed specific language in one paragraph, but not in another, the language should not be implied where it is not present. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Judge Baker Guidance Center, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 153 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Our review of the statute demonstrates that the Legislature addressed itself to distinct aspects of the tribunal in each individual paragraph. The first paragraph outlines the screening functions of the tribunal and establishes the standard by which its determination is to be made. The following paragraphs deal with various aspects of selecting the tribunal\u2019s members. Other paragraphs touch on the bond requirement and provide for the funding of the tribunal. The fifth paragraph dwells on what evidence may be introduced before the tribunal and at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Given this scheme, we do not believe that it is proper for us to read the first and fifth paragraphs together in order to achieve a result which the Legislature did not provide for in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>either paragraph. The Legislature could have said, in either the first or the fifth paragraph, that the tribunal\u2019s determination is admissible evidence. But it did not do so, and we decline to imply language which the Legislature has omitted, particularly where such a result seems less than rational. See <em>Boylston Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Tahanto Regional School Dist., </em>353 Mass. 81, 83-84 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Rather, we choose to follow the canon of statutory construction that where words are used in one part of a statute in a definite sense, they should be given the same meaning in another part of the statute. <em>Plymouth County Nuclear Information Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>374 Mass. 236, 240 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The function of the medical malpractice tribunal described in the first paragraph of \u00a7 60B is to screen potentially meritorious claims from those that merely involve \u201can unfortunate medical result,\u201d and to impose a requirement of a bond on claims in the latter category. See <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosen-thal, </em>376 Mass. 573 (1978). We have held that the task of the tribunal is comparable to that of a trial judge ruling on a defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>\u201cRulings\u201d are not evidence to be submitted to a jury for their consideration. Obviously, a ruling is distinct in function from a \u201cfinding\u201d such as that of a District Court judge which may be submitted to a Superior Court jury pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 102C. See <em>Lubell </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Stores, supra. </em>Consequently, the determination of the tribunal, referred to in the first paragraph of \u00a7 60B, is a \u201cruling\u201d not to be admitted before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Turning to the fifth paragraph, we find the word \u201cdecision\u201d used for the first time. The statute reads in part: \u201cThe tribunal may upon the application of either party or upon its own decision summon or subpoena any such records or individuals to substantiate or clarify any evidence which has been presented before it and may appoint an impartial and qualified physician or surgeon or other related professional person or expert to conduct any necessary professional or expert examination of the claimant or relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>evidentiary matter and to report or to testify as a witness thereto. Such a witness shall be allowed traveling expenses and a reasonable fee to be fixed by the tribunal which shall be assessed as costs. The testimony of said witness and the decision of the tribunal shall be admissible as evidence at a trial.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, inserted by St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 5. The word \u201cdecision\u201d here should be given one meaning. It refers to the decision of the tribunal to appoint an impartial expert. This reading is supported by the fact that the critical last sentence of the paragraph refers both to the testimony of the expert appointed by the tribunal and the decision of the panel to appoint him. We hold that only the \u201ctestimony\u201d of an expert who testifies before the tribunal and the \u201cdecision\u201d to appoint him need be admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s suggestion, the information that the expert was appointed by the tribunal is not irrelevant. It allows the jury to evaluate the testimony of the expert with the knowledge that he has not been retained by either party. The Federal Rules of Evidence explicitly permit a trial judge to authorize disclosure to the jury of the fact that an expert witness had been appointed by the court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Fed. R. Evid. 706(c). Thus the decision of the tribunal is quite relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Our construction also eliminates any constitutional objections to the statute. Only the decision of the tribunal to call an expert, and the testimony of the expert before the tribunal, would be admissible, and both parties would have had an opportunity to question and cross-examine the expert before the tribunal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> So construed, the statute suffers from no constitutional defects. Cf. <em>In re Screws Antitrust Litiga</em>tion, 526 F. Supp. 1316, 1319-1320 (D. Mass. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-6\"> The tribunal\u2019s task in evaluating the offer of proof is comparable to that of a trial judge ruling on a defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass. 573, 578 &amp; n.4 (1978). As to the offer of proof, see <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass. 186, 190 (1980); <em>Gugino </em>v. <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, </em>380 Mass. 464, 467-468 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\"> More than one-third of the States have created compulsory medical malpractice screening tribunals. See Redish, Legislative Response to the Medical Malpractice Insurance Crisis: Constitutional Implications, 55 Tex. L. Rev. 759, 792 n.205 (1977). In most of the legislation involved, provision is made for the introduction in evidence at a subsequent trial of the determination of the panel. In contrast to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, these other statutes require the respective malpractice tribunals to conduct a miniature trial, somewhat equivalent to a master\u2019s hearing under Mass. R. Civ. P. 53, as appearing in 386 Mass. 1236 (1982), and to render their view of the merits of the case, based on the evidence presented to that point. Compare the statutes cited in Cohen, Medical Malpractice Tribunals, Part II, Problems of Construction with a Proposal for Revision, 62 Mass. L.Q. 105, 107-108 (1977), with <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, supra </em>at 194 n.4; <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Glixman, </em>379 Mass. 60, 68-69 (1979); <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">By the terms of \u00a7 60B, the screening tribunal must hear the action \u201cwithin fifteen days after the defendant\u2019s answer has been filed,\u201d thus limiting discovery significantly. In addition, the standard for the introduction of evidence before the tribunal is not only significantly relaxed, see <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, supra, </em>but such evidence is ordinarily restricted to that contained in the plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof. See <em>Gugino v. Harvard Community Health Plan, supra </em>at 467-468; <em>McMahon v. Glixman, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\"> The parties did not raise, and the judge did not consider, the construction of the statute which we now consider. The plaintiff urges us to follow our practice of not considering issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>372 Mass. 86, 87-88 (1977) (issues not presented below \u201cneed not be considered on appeal\u201d). We conclude that this salutary rule of appellate procedure is inapplicable to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The issue of the constitutionality of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, was argued before the judge. The possibility that the statute might be interpreted in a manner which avoids passing on its constitutionality was open to the judge as it is to us. Thus, this question is not a \u201cclearly independent issue raised here for the first time.\u201d <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, supra </em>at 88. Rather, the instant case is one where we choose to affirm the ruling below on a ground not relied upon by the judge. <em>Alholm </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>371 Mass. 621, 625 (1976). <em>Greeley </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>350 Mass. 549, 551 (1966).

See <em>Fazio </em>v. <em>Fazio, </em>375 Mass. 394, 405-406 (1978); <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>374 Mass. 744, 748-749 (1978); <em>Rugg </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Arlington, </em>364 Mass. 264, 268 (1973). We note that the court usually decides not to consider constitutional issues raised for the first time on appeal in order to avoid an unnecessary constitutional decision, <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562, 567-568 (1979). The question whether this court should use its power to declare a statute unconstitutional is of wide public importance and extends far beyond the bounds of the instant case. In these circumstances, we cannot let the actions of private litigants force us to decide unnecessarily a serious question of constitutional law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\"> The use of limiting instructions explaining the nature of the tribunal proceedings and of the evidence before it, reminding the jury of their role as the finders of fact and notifying them that the determination itself is not binding on them and is not evidence of liability, might reduce the possibility of prejudice. Such an instruction would, of course, render the entire process meaningless.
