(A &amp; P), for a transfer of an off-premises beer and wine license. After a hearing, a Superior Court judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>made findings and rulings and entered a judgment declaring that the action of the commissioners was not arbitrary, nor capricious, nor based on an error of law. We affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Noting that a trial judge\u2019s findings of fact will not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous, Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974), we summarize the facts as found by the judge. On February 20, 1980, the plaintiffs applied to the commissioners for permission to transfer Cantwell\u2019s off-premises beer and wine license to the A &amp; P, and to transfer the location of that license from Cantwell\u2019s package store (the Emerald Package Store) at 749 Liberty Street, Springfield, to the A &amp; P supermarket at 655 Liberty Street. The distance between the two locations is approximately 600 feet. Cantwell\u2019s package store had ceased doing business before February 20, 1980. The commissioners held a hearing and heard statements from proponents of, and opponents to, the transfer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the hearing, the three-person board voted against the transfer by a margin of 2 to l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cantwell appealed the decision to the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (ABCC), which remanded the case to the commissioners with a recommendation that the license be granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Subsequently, the commissioners held a second hearing at which the same proponents of the transfer spoke before the licensing board. The pastor who spoke at the first hearing did not voice his opposition at the second hearing. However, the Springfield city planning department submitted a letter<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which stated that the transfer should be denied because the neighborhood where the proposed site was located was primarily residential and had an abundance of existing licensed stores to serve the area, and because the granting of an additional license in the area would compound the over-saturation problem.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the close of the meeting, the commissioners did not vote on the application, but postponed their decision for three or four days. According to Commissioner Blair, Commissioner Chernock indicated that he wanted to talk to \u201cthe man upstairs\u201d before making a decision. Although there was some question as to whether the statement referred to the mayor of Springfield, the judge found, upon the testimony of Chernock, that the phrase, \u201cthe man upstairs,\u201d referred to God.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Four or five days after the hearing, the secretary of the licensing board took a telephone poll of the commissioners. This poll indicated that the commissioners voted against the transfer by a vote of 2 to 1.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A notice was sent to the parties stating that the commissioners voted against the transfer because, \u201c[o]n the basis of this re-hearing and the consideration of the public need and the protection of the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>good as to an adequate number of places at which the public may obtain wine and malt beverages, it is the opinion of the Board of License Commissioners that the location to which the transfer is requested is presently served by an adequate number of places at which the public may obtain wine and malt beverages.\u201d The instant action followed, and the case was heard before a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The judge concluded that the commissioners\u2019 decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or based on an error of law, and dismissed the complaint. However, the Appeals Court reversed, holding that the decision of the commissioners was based on \u201can erroneous conception of the law.\u201d <em>Great Atl. </em>&amp; <em>Pac. Tea Co. </em>v. <em>License Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 268, 271 (1982). Further, the Appeals Court ordered the commissioners to approve the transfer of location and to issue a new license to the A &amp; P for the latter\u2019s supermarket at 655 Liberty Street in Springfield. 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 272. We allowed the commissioners\u2019 application for further appellate review. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 23, eighth par., any liquor license may be transferred from one location to another with the permission of the local licensing authorities. The ninth paragraph of \u00a7 23 provides that a license held by an individual \u201cmay be transferred to any individual, partnership or corporation qualified to receive such a license in the first instance, if, in the opinion of the licensing authorities, such transfer is in the public interest.\u201d G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 23, ninth par., as appearing in St. 1943, c. 542, \u00a7 12. Under paragraph four of \u00a7 23, if a licensing board denies an application for a transfer of location or a transfer between persons, the board shall send a notice of its decision, stating the reasons therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The first paragraph of \u00a7 23 sets the standard for the statutory scheme. It provides in part: \u201cThe provisions for the issue of licenses and permits hereunder imply no intention to create rights generally for persons to engage or continue in the transaction of the business authorized by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>licenses or permits respectively, but are enacted with a view only to serve the public need and in such a manner as to protect the common good and, to that end, to provide, in the opinion of the licensing authorities, an adequate number of places at which the public may obtain, in the manner and for the kind of use indicated, the different sorts of beverages for the sale of which provision is made.\u201d G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 23, first par., as amended through St. 1965, c. 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>334 Mass. 613, 618 (1956), we recognized that the ABCC possesses specialized knowledge of the problems affecting alcoholic beverages regulations. Cf. <em>Marchesi </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Winchester, </em>312 Mass. 28, 30 (1942) (licensing of bowling alleys is a matter with which local authorities are familiar). We now explicitly recognize the comparable degree of expertise possessed by local licensing authorities. In 1970, we set forth the standard to be applied by the courts on judicial review of a licensing board\u2019s decision. <em>Dixie\u2019s Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd., </em>357 Mass. 699 (1970). We stated in <em>Dixie\u2019s Bar </em>that a transfer of a license location is a matter entrusted to the sound discretion of the local licensing authorities, within the statutory standards, <em>id. </em>at 702, and that we will not substitute our judgment for that of the local authorities if the local authorities\u2019 decision had sufficient basis, <em>id. </em>at 703. In that case, we held that the record did not disclose an error of law or any arbitrary or capricious action. Thus, under <em>Dixie\u2019s Bar, </em>the test is whether the licensing board\u2019s decision was based on an error of law or whether the board took arbitrary or capricious action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">At the time of the <em>Dixie\u2019s Bar </em>case, the then current version of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 23, did not require a licensing board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>to disclose the reasons for its decision. However, in 1971, the Legislature amended \u00a7 23 to require licensing boards to state their reasons. St. 1971, c. 260, \u00a7 2. In light of this, we hold that the proper standard to be applied in reviewing license transfer cases is whether the court finds, giving reasonable deference to the discretion of the local authorities, that the reasons given by the local authorities are based on an error of law or are reflective of arbitrary or capricious action. We reiterate the principle that we will not substitute our judgment for that of the local authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">In the case before us, the commissioners denied A &amp; P\u2019s and Cantwell\u2019s application for a transfer of a license from Cantwell to the A &amp; P. Prior to February 20, 1980, Cant-well closed the doors of her store, the Emerald Package Store, and thus, that store ceased to do business. As a result, at the time of both the first hearing and the second hearing before the commissioners, the license issued to Cantwell did not represent an operational source of alcoholic beverages for the community. The commissioners stated that their reason for denying the transfer was that the area in question was \u201cpresently served by an adequate number of places.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The Appeals Court noted that, as there was an outstanding license to sell beer and wine at the Emerald Package Store, a transfer of that license to a location 600 feet away would not \u201cresult in any increase in the number of outstanding off-premises licenses in the area.\u201d 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 271. Therefore, the Appeals Court concluded that the stated reason was inconsistent with the facts. Protesting that the denial of the license transfer protected only other license holders against competition from the A &amp; P, the Appeals Court held that the commissioners\u2019 decision was based on an error of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">We disagree. The commissioners stated that they denied the transfer because the area was presently served by an adequate number of establishments. Such a conclusion is both reasonable and proper. There was evidence before the judge from which he could have inferred that the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>sioners\u2019 stated reason was not their actual reason. However, there was also evidence from which he could have inferred that the commissioners\u2019 stated reason was, in fact, the actual reason. The judge was not obliged to find that the commissioners\u2019 stated reason was not their actual reason. His finding as to the commissioners\u2019 reason is supported by the evidence; therefore, we will not disturb it. <em>Bridges </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>302 Mass. 239, 242 (1939). It is sufficient for us to state that, as the Cantwell package store was not operating at the time of either hearing, it was not erroneous for the commissioners to conclude that a transfer of that dormant license to the A &amp; P would not be in the public interest because there was an adequate number of establishments in the area at which the public could obtain beer and wine. See <em>Liggett Drug Co. </em>v. <em>License Comm\u2019rs of N. Adams, </em>296 Mass. 41, 53 (1936) (statute, \u201caccording to its true interpretation,\u201d authorizes licensing authority to decline to grant license on ground \u201cthat there already were enough common victuallers in the city\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Though the present case concerns the transfer as distinguished from the initial issuance or renewal of a license, we think the commissioners have a right to consider the existing facilities even in transfer cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Moreover, our examination of the record compels the conclusion that the commissioners\u2019 decision was not arbitrary or capricious. There was evidence before the commissioners that the area had a large number of establishments selling beer and wine, and that the public did not need an additional establishment. The commissioners stated the reason for their decision. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the decision was whimsical or not based on logical analysis. On the record, we can only con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>elude that the decision was founded on reasoned judgment, and was not arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Finally, A &amp; P and Cantwell argue that the commissioners\u2019 decision was based on anti-competitive motivation, and thus it must be set aside because it violates Federal antitrust laws. There was sufficient evidence on which the judge could find that the commissioners\u2019 decision was based on their determination that the public need was already being adequately served by the operating establishments in the area. Such a finding by the judge, being supported by the evidence, will not be disturbed. <em>Bridges </em>v. <em>Hart, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\"> The proponents consisted of lawyers for the A &amp; P and the Emerald Package Store, representatives of the A &amp; P, and at least one private citizen. In addition, a petition in favor of the transfer, consisting of over 1,500 signatures of persons not necessarily residing in the neighborhood, was introduced. The opponents to the transfer consisted of a representative of the neighborhood council, a pastor of a neighborhood church, and persons representing nearby package stores.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\"> Commissioners Chernock and Brennan voted against the transfer; Commissioner Blair voted for the transfer. The reason given by the commissioners is as follows: \u201c[T]he public and the Liberty Heights area of Springfield are more than adequately served by several Retail Package stores licensed by this Commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\">See generally <em>Largess </em>v. <em>Nore\u2019s, Inc., </em>341 Mass. 438 (1960) (ABCC is powerless to act on license application in manner contrary to decision of local authorities except to recommend to local board).

While we acknowledge that the judge was technically correct, as we discuss <em>infra, </em>we perceive the transfer at issue in this case as different in effect from other transfers, in that the transfer to the A &amp; P would result in an additional operating establishment for the purchase of beer and wine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\"> The judge found that the commissioners knew of the mayor\u2019s opposition to the transfer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\"> Commissioners Chernock and Brennan again voted against the transfer.
