Miles, age two months, died on October 26, 1977. On December 29, 1978, Damon\u2019s father commenced an action against the defendant for the wrong-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>fui death of his son. G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. In an amended complaint, Damon\u2019s mother sought damages from the defendant for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The jury returned verdicts for the plaintiffs on these claims. After trial, the defendant filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts on each claim. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 50 (b), 365 Mass. 814 (1974). The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the claim for wrongful death, but he allowed the motion on the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The parties filed cross appeals. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review and affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We summarize the facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lynne Miles became pregnant some time between November, 1976, and February, 1977. Miles selected Dr. Tabor as her obstetrician. He estimated the delivery date to be late October.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">On August 21, 1977, Dr. Tabor admitted Miles to a hospital in Lowell because she was bleeding. She was discharged three days later without giving birth. Dr. Tabor informed Miles that she was \u201conly seven months along.\u201d On August 27, 1977, Miles was again admitted to the hospital and, despite Dr. Tabor\u2019s continued assertion that she was only in her seventh month, she delivered a full-term baby the next morning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At some time before the child\u2019s birth, but certainly by 7 or 7:10 a.m., the baby\u2019s heart rate dropped from 132 beats a minute to 72 beats a minute. Damon was delivered at 7:38 a.m. on August 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Miles saw Damon after he was born. His body was a gray-blue color. Miles watched Dr. Tabor hand Damon to a nurse and instruct her to \u201csnap\u201d the baby\u2019s feet and to give it oxygen. The mother saw Dr. Tabor listen to the baby\u2019s heartbeat with a stethoscope and then walk away. He said to Miles, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good, I can\u2019t hear a heart beat.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Dr. Tabor then stayed on the opposite side of the delivery room from the baby for about ten minutes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Damon was eventually diagnosed as suffering from brain damage and asphyxia. Several experts, articles from medical journals, and the standards of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists indicated that the obstetrician is responsible for resuscitation, and that Dr. Tabor\u2019s efforts for Damon were not in accordance with proper medical standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Some time later, Damon was transferred to Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston, under the care of other physicians, where he remained for almost a month. During that time, a gastrostomy was performed to facilitate his eating, which was impaired because of his breathing problems. The baby died at home in his sleep on October 26, 1977, about two months after his birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">After Damon\u2019s death, Miles suffered a severe depression. Her husband testified that she \u201clost a considerable amount of weight,\u201d \u201cvery seldom had a full meal,\u201d and that there was \u201ca drastic change in her behavior compared to what she used to be.\u201d She cried a lot, ceased to care for her appearance, was not sleeping properly, and was extremely depressed. Dr. Bernard Yudowitz, a psychiatrist who examined Miles for the purposes of the litigation, testified that she was suffering \u201ca severe and chronic depression,\u201d a trauma that \u201ccan never really disappear.\u201d He noted that her severe depression \u201cled to the physical manifestations ... of weight loss, restlessness, sleeplessness, loss of sexual interest, and so forth.\u201d Although Miles showed no physical manifestations of her depression until Damon died, Dr. Yu-dowitz estimated that the onset of her severe depression dated from her observations of Dr. Tabor\u2019s actions in the delivery room.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">1. <em>Issue of causation. </em>\u201cIn reviewing the denial of [Dr. Tabor\u2019s] motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>[on the claim for wrongful death], the same standard applies as would apply to a review of a motion for a directed verdict, . . . namely, whether \u2018anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u2019 <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978), quoting from <em>Rau-nela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972).\u201d <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>383 Mass. 724, 727-728 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Dr. Tabor concedes that there was sufficient evidence before the jury to allow them to find that he did not act in accordance with proper medical standards,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but he argues that there was insufficient evidence of causation. He claims that, even if there were evidence that his negligence was causally related to one cause of death listed on the death certificate, namely aspiration pneumonia, there was no evidence linking him to the second cause of death on the death certificate, namely a congenital malformation of the G.I. [gastro-intestinal] tract. The defendant reasons that there was no way for the jury to find that aspiration pneumonia, rather than the G.I. tract malformation, was the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The flaw in the defendant\u2019s argument is that he views the death certificate as definitive on the issue of causation. However, a death certificate, like a birth certificate, is not conclusive, but is only \u201cprima facie evidence of the facts recorded.\u201d G. L. c. 46, \u00a7 19, as amended through St. 1976, c. 486, \u00a7 13. <em>\u201cPrima facie </em>evidence means evidence which not only remains evidence throughout the trial but also has up to a certain point an artificial legal force which compels the conclusion [by the jury] that the evidence is true,\u201d <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Farm Serv. Stores, </em>301 Mass. 564, 566 (1938), until it is rebutted. Once evidence is introduced contradicting the prima facie evidence, the prima facie evidence need be given \u201conly the weight that. . . [it] deserve[s] in the estimation of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number><em>Pauley, </em>368 Mass. 286, 290 (1975); P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 49-61 (5th ed. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In this case, there was ample evidence contradicting the death certificate. At trial, the physicians who examined Damon shortly after his birth concluded that congenital malformation of the G.I. tract was not a cause of death. No charts or hospital records indicated that Damon had a congenital malformation of the G.I. tract. Additionally, the birth certificate completed by Dr. Tabor indicated that Damon did not have any congenital malformations. Resolution of the conflict between the death certificate and the birth certificate raised a factual issue on causation for the jury. The jury could, therefore, disregard the statement on the death certificate that the malformation of the G.I. tract was a cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Once the death certificate is recognized as inconclusive on the issue of causation, Dr. Tabor\u2019s entire challenge to the ruling on his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict fails. Expert testimony linked Dr. Tabor\u2019s inadequate resuscitative techniques, to Damon\u2019s condition and subsequent death. The expert opinions at least showed \u201ca probability of causal relation rather than a mere possibility of such relation.\u201d <em>Berardi </em>v. <em>Menicks, </em>340 Mass. 396, 402 (1960). See <em>Haggerty </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>344 Mass. 136, 140-141 (1962). The \u201cplaintiff was not required to show the exact cause of [the] injuries or to exclude all possibility that they resulted without fault on the part of the defendant. It was enough if [he] showed that the harm which befell [his son] was more likely due to negligence of the defendant than to some other cause for which he was not liable.\u201d <em>Woronka </em>v. <em>Sewall, </em>320 Mass. 362, 365 (1946). <em>Samii </em>v. <em>Baystate Medical Center, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 911, 912 (1979). Since sufficient evidence of causation was before the jury, we affirm the judge\u2019s denial of the motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the claim for wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">2. <em>Negligent infliction of emotional distress. </em>Miles claims damages for the emotional distress she suffered due to Damon\u2019s injuries and death. Although the jury found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>her favor, the judge entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict for the defendant. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., 375 </em>Mass. 620, 627-628 (1978). The judge based his conclusion on the lack of evidence of \u201csubstantial physical injury\u201d suffered by the mother in response to her emotional distress over Damon\u2019s injuries. The judge determined that Miles\u2019s distress was otherwise reasonably foreseeable, and that it was for the jury to determine the credibility of the psychiatrist\u2019s evidence that Miles\u2019s trauma began in the delivery room.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">We need not pass on the correctness of the judge\u2019s ruling on the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, because we reach the same result, but for different reasons. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence of emotional distress experienced by Miles at the time of the doctor\u2019s negligence in the delivery room to permit her to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">On this record, there is no evidence that Miles suffered any symptoms of emotional distress until after Damon died. Miles\u2019s husband said that after Damon\u2019s birth, \u201cthere was no negative attitude at all, [Lynne] was just happy that we had Damon home with us so she could care for him, and she was very alert and happy as far as she could be under the circumstances.\u201d He further stated that after Damon\u2019s death, \u201c[t]here was a drastic change in her behavior compared to what she used to be, it was like night and day.\u201d Miles\u2019s relatives and friends corroborated the fact that Miles changed after Damon\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Miles told the jurors that her emotional and physical condition deteriorated after Damon\u2019s death. She grieved for the loss of her child and for the loss to the family circle. A wrongful death action is designed to compensate \u201cfor the loss of the reasonably expected net income, services, protection, care, assistance, society, companionship, comfort, guidance, counsel, and advice of the decedent to the persons entitled to the damages recovered.\u201d G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, as amended through St. 1981, c. 493, \u00a7 1. The damages awarded on a wrongful death claim are \u201ca statutory trust fund, held by the administratrix as trustee for distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>to the statutory beneficiaries [i.e., Damon\u2019s parents].\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Goulette, </em>344 Mass. 307, 311 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">A plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress must follow \u201cclosely on the heels of\u201d the negligent act. <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507, 518 (1980). <em>Dziokonski </em>v. <em>Babineau, </em>375 Mass. 555 (1978) (mother saw child in street immediately after a motor vehicle accident and died from shock).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The psychiatrist called by the plaintiff said that in his opinion Miles\u2019s depression originated with her observations of Dr. Tabor\u2019s actions in the delivery room. However, his opinion mainly focused on the grief Miles suffered from the death of Damon. The psychiatrist did not dispute the fact that Miles experienced no symptoms of emotional distress until after Damon\u2019s death. He did not say that Miles\u2019s emotional distress \u201cdirectly result[ed] from experiencing or witnessing the effects of [Dr. Tabor\u2019s] conduct\u201d in the delivery room, <em>Cimino </em>v. <em>Milford Keg, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 323, 334 (1982), rather than from the death of Damon. Thus, there was insufficient evidence that Miles suffered emotional distress at Damon\u2019s birth which was distinct from the claim of wrongful death.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge did not err in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the count for negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\"> Additional evidence will be set forth in our review of the substantive claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b798-9\"> In this appeal, there is no claim by Miles of Dr. Tabor\u2019s negligent treatment of her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\"> These observations are the basis of Miles\u2019s claim for damages from negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\"> This concession was made at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\"> In <em>Dziokonski </em>v. <em>Babineau, supra, </em>we left open the question whether the father could recover for his injuries due to negligent infliction of emotional distress, where there was a time lapse between the accident and the father\u2019s knowledge of the death of his wife and the injuries to his child, because the pleadings were incomplete.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b803-9\">This case is unlike <em>Cimino </em>v. <em>Milford Keg, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 323, 334 (1982), in which we held that a claim for emotional distress was distinct from a wrongful death action. In that case, a father suffered emotional distress, as well as physical injury, in the same accident which caused the death of his son. The emotional distress, therefore, was a separate cause of action which arose at the time of the defendant\u2019s negligence. There was no delayed response to the child\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Furthermore, unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs, </em>386 Mass. 540 (1982), and the father in <em>Cimino </em>v. <em>Milford Keg, Inc., supra, </em>Miles herself suffered no direct injury from the defendant\u2019s negligent treatment of Damon.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
