The defendant Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. entered into a group contract of insurance with Sun Oil Company (Sun Oil), effective January 1, 1970. Under the contract, the defendant agreed to pay eligible Sun Oil employees who become totally disabled fifty percent of their base monthly earnings<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> up to $5,000 a month. The contract also contained two coordination-of-benefits clauses. The first clause provided that the benefits under the contract would be reduced by certain other income benefits, including workers\u2019 compensation, and fifty percent of the amount of the employee\u2019s primary Social Security benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second clause stated that if the sum of the employee\u2019s benefits under the contract, other income benefits,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and benefits from Social Security<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> exceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>seventy-five percent of the employee\u2019s base monthly earnings, the benefits under the contract would be reduced until the sum of all benefits equals seventy-five percent of the employee\u2019s base monthly earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The plaintiff William F. Cody, an employee of Sun Oil, elected to purchase the coverage provided by this group contract. Through payroll deductions, the plaintiff paid a portion of the monthly premium for this coverage. The plaintiff never saw a copy of the insurance contract. The defendant did not distribute copies of the insurance contract to the employee-beneficiaries. Instead, the defendant sent a copy of the contract to Sun Oil. Sun Oil then distributed to its employees a booklet describing the benefits provided under the contract. The plaintiff testified that, after reading the booklet, he believed that he would receive seventy-five percent of his base pay in the event of a long term disability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">As an employee, the plaintiff trained new tractor-trailer drivers for Sun Oil. On March 1, 1971, a driver trainee hit an obstruction on Route 95 in Groveland and lost control of the truck he was driving. The plaintiff, a passenger in that truck, was severely injured as a result of this accident. From the date of the accident until April 15, 1981, the date of the trial, the plaintiff had not worked. The plaintiff received no benefits under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In February, 1977, the plaintiff sued the defendant in the Superior Court. The plaintiff alleged a breach of the insurance contract by the defendant\u2019s failure to pay him any benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At trial, the parties stipulated that the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>contract controlled this action. The parties also stipulated that if the judge interpreted the contract to allow the defendant an offset for fifty percent of the plaintiff\u2019s primary Social Security benefits, plus the full amount of workers\u2019 compensation payments received between September 1, 1971, and April 15, 1981, the plaintiff would not be entitled to any payments under the contract; if the judge interpreted the contract to allow the defendant to offset only fifty percent of the plaintiff\u2019s primary Social Security benefits, the plaintiff would be entitled to $27,168.05 under the contract; if the judge interpreted the policy to allow no offsets at all, the plaintiff would be entitled to $52,402.70 under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The judge submitted to the jury two special verdict questions (see Mass. R. Civ. P. 49 [a], 365 Mass. 812 [1974]): (1) whether the plaintiff was disabled at any time after September 1, 1973,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (2) if so, during what period of time. The jury found that the plaintiff was totally disabled from September 1, 1973, until April 21, 1981, the date of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Over the plaintiff\u2019s objection, the judge determined the amount of damages himself. The judge found that under the insurance contract the plaintiff was entitled to recover fifty percent of his base monthly earnings reduced by his Massachusetts workers\u2019 compensation benefits and by fifty percent of his primary Social Security benefits. Since these offsets reduced the plaintiff\u2019s benefits under the insurance contract to nothing, the judge entered judgment for the defendant. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The plaintiff appeals, claiming that the judge erred: (1) in failing to submit the issue of damages to the jury, and in entering judgment for the defendant; and (2) in enforcing the coordination-of-benefits clauses. We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>judge correctly determined the question of damages himself. We also believe that the judge did not err in enforcing the coordination-of-benefits clauses contained in the contract. We add, however, that coordination-of-benefits clauses will no longer be enforced if they are misleading or if they render the insurance contract as a whole without substantial economic value.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">1. <em>Damages. </em>The plaintiff claims that the judge erred in failing to submit the issue of damages to the jury, and in entering judgment for the defendant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The interpretation of an insurance contract is not a question of fact for the jury. <em>Biathrow </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>371 Mass. 249 (1976). See <em>Daley </em>v. <em>J.F. White Contracting Co., </em>347 Mass. 285, 288 (1964); <em>Hiller </em>v. <em>Submarine Signal Co., </em>325 Mass. 546, 549-550 (1950). The responsibility of construing the language of an insurance contract is a question of law for the trial judge, and then for the reviewing court. <em>Save-Mor Supermarkets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skelly Detective Serv., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 221, 226 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">When interpreting insurance contracts, courts are guided by several principles. Like all contracts, insurance contracts are to be construed \u201caccording to the fair and reasonable meaning of the words in which the agreement of the parties is expressed.\u201d <em>MacArthur </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Serv., Inc., 343 Mass. 670, 672 (1962), </em>quoting <em>Koshland </em>v. <em>Columbia Ins. Co., </em>237 Mass. 467, 471 (1921). \u201cA policy of insurance whose provisions are plainly and definitely expressed in appropriate language must be enforced in accordance with its terms.\u201d <em>Hyfer </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>318 Mass. 175, 179 (1945), quoting <em>Stankus </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>312 Mass. 366, 369 (1942). But, if the contract is ambiguous, \u201cdoubts as to the meaning of the words must be resolved against the insurance company that employed them and in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>August A. Busch &amp; Co. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 339 </em>Mass. 239, 243 (1959). See <em>MacArthur </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Serv., Inc., </em>343 Mass. 670, 672 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Consistent with these principles, the judge, rather than the jury, interpreted the insurance contract at issue in this case. The judge correctly concluded that the language of this contract was unambiguous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Enforcing this contract according to its terms, the judge rightly determined that the plaintiff was entitled to fifty percent of his base monthly earnings reduced by the offset for Social Security and workers\u2019 compensation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In addition, the parties stipulated to the amount of damages that the plaintiff could receive under each possible interpretation of the contract. After this stipulation, the only disputed issues involved the plaintiff\u2019s disability. Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 49 (a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974), the judge required the jury to return a special verdict on every issue of fact in dispute. Once the jury determined that the plaintiff had been totally disabled from September 1, 1973, to April 21, 1981, there were no other disputed factual issues for the jury to decide. Thereafter, the judge merely had to apply the law to the facts as found by the jury and as stipulated to by the parties. Specifically, he had to select, from the damage calculations to which the parties had stipulated, that calculation which was consistent with his interpretation of the contract. In line with his construction of the contract, the judge determined that the plaintiff was entitled to nothing under the contract. We therefore conclude that the judge properly entered judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>2. <em>Coordination-of-benefits clauses. </em>Relying on <em>Kates </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. </em>Co., 509 F. Supp. 477 (D. Mass. 1981), the plaintiff claims that the judge erred in enforcing the coordination-of-benefits clauses, because they violate public policy. We agree with the plaintiff that <em>Kates </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., supra </em>at 491, correctly states the public policy of this Commonwealth, that insurance contracts may not be misleading, and that coverages may not be \u201cunrealistically limited\u201d or so limited in scope as to be of no \u201csubstantial economic value.\u201d However, in this case, the insurance contract took effect, and the plaintiff\u2019s injury occurred, before the Legislature enacted the statutes that are the source of this public policy. We therefore believe that it would be unfair to apply this public policy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In the <em>Kates </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the judge correctly found one source of this public policy in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 110E.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Pursuant to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 110E, inserted by St. 1973, c. 1081, the Commissioner of Insurance may issue rules and regulations \u201cto establish minimum standards of full and fair disclosure, for the form and content of policies of accident and sickness insurance which provide medical, surgical, or hospital expense benefits . . . .\u201d Among the purposes of these rules and regulations are the \u201celimination of provisions which may be misleading . . and the \u201celimination of coverages which are so limited in scope as to be of no substantial economic value.\u201d G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 110E (b) <em>(e). </em>Although G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 110E, expressly does not cover \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cblanket\u201d disability insurance contracts like that at issue in this case, the <em>Kates </em>decision properly determined that the policies set out in that statute apply to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>contracts. Cf. <em>Mailhot </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>375 Mass. 342, 348 &amp; n.7 (1978); <em>Gaudette </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>362 Mass. 60, 70 (1972). Since G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 110E, was enacted after the effective date of the insurance contract at issue in this case, and after the injury giving rise to this claim,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we believe it would be unfair to apply the public policy set out in that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">However, we think it is appropriate to elaborate on this policy for future cases. In the <em>Kates </em>case, the insurance contract clearly provided that payments on account of workers\u2019 compensation and Social Security would be deducted from the benefits provided by the policy. Nevertheless, the judge concluded that the contract was misleading. \u201cIn view of the marketing of this coverage through the workplace, employees electing to participate could reasonably expect to receive lifetime benefits if totally disabled from an injury sustained in their employment. Even though one who has all the relevant information about social security and worker compensation benefits could ascertain by close analysis of the coordination-of-benefits provisions that . . . [under the policy he would receive few benefits for on-the-job injuries], it would not be reasonable to expect that this fact would be discovered by a person who was considering whether to apply for participation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 491-492. Thus, the <em>Kates </em>case demonstrates that a company\u2019s marketing techniques may make even a totally unambiguous insurance contract misleading.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Since mislead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ing insurance contracts violate the public policy of this Commonwealth, we believe that courts must limit the enforcement of these contracts to avoid unconscionable results. Cf. <em>Zapatha </em>v. <em>Dairy Mart, Inc., </em>381 Mass. 284, 293 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCotis, </em>366 Mass. 234, 242 (1974); <em>Lechmere Tire &amp; Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Burwick, </em>360 Mass. 718, 720-721 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">If the insurance contract is not misleading, we think that the court must go on to decide whether the contract as a whole is without substantial economic value.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>mination whether the contract is without substantial economic value is similar to an examination of the substantive, un-conscionability of a contract. A court must determine whether the contract terms are unreasonably favorable to one party. See <em>Zapatha </em>v. <em>Dairy Mart, Inc., </em>381 Mass. 284, 293-294 &amp; n.13 (1980). Hence, a court should find that an insurance contract like that at issue in this case has substantial economic value as long as the premiums reflect the anticipated effect of any coordination-of-benefits clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Finally, we note that coordination-of-benefits clauses serve the public purpose of avoiding duplicate recoveries for the same injuries. <em>Mailhot </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>375 Mass. 342, 347-348 (1978). These clauses enable insurance companies to charge lower premiums.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>643 F.2d 108, 109 n.1 (3d Cir. 1981); <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Craton, </em>405 F.2d 41, 47 (5th Cir. 1968). We therefore conclude that unless a company engages in misleading marketing practices, or an insurance contract as a whole is without substantial economic value, coordination-of-benefits clauses do not violate the public policy of this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\"> Coordination-of-benefits clauses allow a company to deduct benefits from other sources from the benefits otherwise provided by the insurance contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\"> The term base monthly earnings means (a) with respect to each hourly employee, his hourly rate of pay multiplied by 174 hours; and (b) with respect to each salaried employee, his gross monthly salary excluding overtime, bonuses, commissions, and other remuneration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> Before a disabled employee can receive any benefits under the contract, he must wait twenty-six weeks. Since the accident in this case occurred on March 1, 1971, the plaintiff was not eligible to receive any benefits before September 1, 1971.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\"> Other income benefits include any periodic cash payments on account of the employee\u2019s disability under (a) any employee sponsored group insurance coverage, toward which Sun Oil makes contributions, except benefit's paid under scheduled injuries or permanent partial awards; (b) any State or Federal government disability or retirement plan; (c) any State or Federal workers\u2019 compensation or similar law, except benefits paid under scheduled injuries or permanent partial awards; (d) the maintenance provisions of the Jones Act, as applicable to seamen employed by Sun Oil.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b157-10\"> These Social Security benefits include benefits payable to the employee\u2019s dependents on account of the employee\u2019s disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\"> The plaintiff may have based this belief on the coordination-of-benefits <em>clause </em>that provided that if benefits from all sources exceed seventy-five percent of the employee\u2019s base monthly earnings, the benefits under the contract will be reduced until benefits from all sources equal seventy-five percent of the employee\u2019s base monthly earnings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\"> The plaintiff also sued the defendant for deceit. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the deceit count. The plaintiff does not appeal this ruling. We deem the plaintiff\u2019s failure to claim that the judge erred in allowing the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>motion for a directed verdict on the deceit count as a waiver. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b159-10\"> The defendant conceded that the plaintiff was disabled from the date of the accident until September 1, 1973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\"> The plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he thought he would receive seventy-five percent of his base monthly earnings in the event of a long term disability does not create an ambiguity in the contract. See <em>Dekofski </em>v. <em>Leite, </em>336 Mass. 127, 129 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\"> The second coordination-of-benefits clause contained in the contract provides that if benefits from all sources exceed seventy-five percent of the employee\u2019s base monthly earnings, benefits under the contract will be reduced until benefits from all sources equal seventy-five percent of the employee\u2019s base monthly earnings. This clause operates as a ceiling on the benefits provided under the contract. Since the offsets for Social Security and workers\u2019 compensation under the first coordination-of-benefits clause reduced the benefits provided under the policy to nothing, the second coordination-of-benefits clause did not operate in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\"> There are other statutory sources for this policy. For example, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, inserted by St. 1967, c. 813, \u00a7 1, prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce,\u201d including insurance. See <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. </em>Co., 373 Mass. 72, 75-76 (1977). In addition, the Commissioner of Insurance must make sure that insurance policies are readable. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 2B, inserted by St. 1977, c. 801, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b163-6\"> The insurance contract in this case took effect in 1970 \u2014 three years before the enactment of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 110E. The injury on which this claim is based occurred two years prior to the enactment of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 110E.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\"> To avoid a claim that an insurance contract like that at issue in this case is misleading, a company should specifically inform the consumer that because of the coordination-of-benefits clauses, he may not be entitled to any benefits under the policy for certain injuries. We emphasize that a clear warning prevents an insurance contract from being misleading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\"> Because of the importance of marketing methods, courts relax the paroi evidence rule to admit evidence of oral or written assurances made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>by the agent who sells the policy. See 7 Williston, Contracts \u00a7 900, at 32-33 (3d ed. 1963), and cases cited. See also K.B. Hughes, Evidence, \u00a7 423 (1961), and cases cited; <em>Adzigian </em>v. <em>WORL Broadcasting Corp., </em>348 Mass. 777 (1964); <em>Tri-City Concrete Co. </em>v. <em>A.L.A. Constr. Co., </em>343 Mass. 425 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">At trial, the judge did not fully consider the defendant\u2019s marketing practices. He excluded the benefits booklet distributed by Sun Oil to its employees. We believe that the booklet is relevant to the issue whether the contract is misleading. But since we have concluded that the policies set out in <em>Kates </em>do not apply to this case, we need not decide whether the exclusion of the booklet is an error that requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In marketing this contract, the defendant did not make its policies available to the employee-beneficiaries. Instead, the defendant relied on Sun Oil to inform the employees about the benefits under the policy. The defendant chose this marketing technique and is therefore bound by the benefits booklet distributed by Sun Oil. Thus, if the question whether the contract is misleading were an issue in this case, the judge should admit the benefits booklet.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Further, in this case Sun Oil distributed the booklet in 1964, seven years before the plaintiff\u2019s disability. The record does not indicate that the defendant ever lodged an objection to the content of the booklet. In addition, the booklet described the policy so precisely that a reasonable person could conclude that someone from the insurance company prepared it. Since the probability is very high that the defendant at least tacitly approved the benefits booklet distributed by Sun Oil (cf. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>375 Mass. 620, 622 [1978]), it would not be unfair to hold the defendant to the terms of the booklet. Unless there were evidence that the defendant asked the employer to withdraw the booklet or to correct it, the judge should assume that the defendant acquiesced in its distribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b164-10\">In <em>Kates </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.
