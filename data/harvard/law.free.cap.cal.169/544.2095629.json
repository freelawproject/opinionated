He has heretofore applied to the district court of appeal of the second district for discharge on <em>habeas corpus, </em>and was by said court remanded to custody. In so remanding him the said district court of appeal filed a written opinion, which is reported in <em>Matter of Lapique, </em>26 Cal. App. 258, [146 Pac. 690], A consideration of the matters set forth in his petition addressed to this court has satisfied us that the opinion of said district court of appeal sufficiently disposes of the claims made by him for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">In view of our decisions referred to in the said opinion of the district court of appeal, no sufficient cause appears entitling petitioner to be discharged from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">The application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
