(a corporation),\u201d to recover on promissory notes made payable to \u201cGoldberg, Bowen &amp; Co., Ine.,\u201d is not demurrable for want of facts, notwithstanding the absence of allegations showing the identity of the plaintiff and the payee of the notes, or of any assignment of the notes to the plaintiff. Such names are practically identical, and the identity is aided by an averment that the notes were \u201cmade and delivered to the plaintiff.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b229-6\">Id.\u2014Immaterial Variance\u2014Judgment Against Surety.\u2014Such supposed variance between the name of the payee in the notes and that of the plaintiff is not sufficient to vitiate a judgment in favor of the plaintiff against a surety on the notes.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b229-7\">Id.\u2014Variance Between Name of Promisee and Plaintiff not a Defense.\u2014Even if such difference in the names constituted a variation, the rule is that where the parties to a contract can be ascertained and an action is prosecuted in the name of the real party, an error in the name of the promisee as described in the promise is not a proper basis of defense.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b229-8\">Id.\u2014Offer of Notes in Evidence\u2014Beading Notes Into Becord.\u2014The judgment against the surety cannot be attacked on appeal on the ground that the notes were not offered in evidence, where the record shows that they were read in evidence, and the judgment recites that \u201coral and documentary evidence was introduced and received in behalf of the plaintiff.\u201d A note read into the record is \u201coffered in evidence\u201d as effectually as if the paper upon which it is written were formally tendered and taken into the custody of the court.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b229-9\">Id.\u2014Sufficient Evidence of Plaintiff\u2019s Corporate Existence.\u2014In such action the corporate quality of the plaintiff is sufficiently established by the production of the notes sued on by the plaintiff\u2019s cashier, and his testimony that Goldberg, Bowen &amp; Co. was a corporation \u201cexisting under the laws of the state of California,\u201d and the evidence of another witness that he saw the defendant sign the instruments in which \u201cGoldberg, Bowen &amp; Co.\u201d is described as incorporated by the abbreviation \u201cInc.\u201d</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b229-10\">APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco.

Each note is fully set forth in the complaint. Each, as pleaded, is made payable to \u201cGoldberg, Bowen &amp; Co., Inc.,\u201d and purports to be signed by J. K. Dimick as principal and H. H. Blood as surety. Each count contains the allegation that Goldberg, Bowen <em>&amp; Go. </em>was at all times mentioned therein a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the state of California. It is also averred in the complaint that each note was made and delivered to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Defendant Blood demurred to each count for alleged want of facts and that it could not be determined therefrom if demand had been made upon J. K. Dimick. The demurrers were overruled and defendant Blood answered basing his denials upon information and belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">When the case was called for trial neither defendant Blood nor his counsel appeared. Testimony was taken in their absence by which it appeared that Goldberg, Bowen <em>&amp; </em>Company was a corporation existing under the laws of the state of California, but it did not appear when the incorporation had taken place. An employee of the corporation testified that it was still the owner and holder of each note and the witness read each note into the record where each appears in the exact words by which it is set forth in the complaint. It does not appear from the record that the plaintiff formally offered the notes themselves in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Appellant insists that 1 \u2018Goldberg, Bowen &amp; Co., Inc.,\u201d specified in the notes is not the same entity as \u201cGoldberg, Bowen <em>&amp; Co. </em>(a corporation), the plaintiff, and that as the complaint contains no allegation of their identity or of any assignment of the notes to the plaintiff, his demurrer for want of facts should have been sustained. There is no merit in this contention. The abbreviation \u201cInc.\u201d means \u201cincorporated,\u201d therefore \u201cGoldberg, Bowen <em>&amp; </em>Co., Inc.,\u201d is equivalent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u201cGoldberg, Bowen &amp; Co. (a corporation).\u201d This practical identity of names is aided by the averment that the notes were \u201cmade and delivered to the plaintiff.\u201d The demurrer to the complaint was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">It was shown that defendant Blood signed the notes in the office of the plaintiff and that the said notes had never been out of plaintiff\u2019s possession. It was not denied that Mr. Blood did sign the notes and that he had paid no part of the principal and furthef that only a small part of the interest had been paid, but upon the supposed variance between the name of the payee in the notes and that of plaintiff the defendant bases an argument that the record is insufficient to support the judgment. This contention is also without merit. There is, as we have seen, a practical identity of the name of the payee in the notes and the title of the plaintiff and even if there were a variation the rule is that where the parties to a contract can be ascertained and an action is prosecuted in the name of the real party, an error in the name of the promisee as described in the promise is not a proper basis of defense. <em>(Charitable Assoc, in Middle Granville </em>v. <em>Baldwin, 42 </em>Mass. 365; <em>Medway Cotton Manufactory </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>10 Mass. 360; <em>City of Lowell </em>v. <em>Morse, 42 </em>Mass. 475; <em>Commercial Bank </em>v. <em>French, </em>38 Mass. 486, [32 Am. Dec. 280].) It is true that in the second and third of the above citations the misnomers were aided by averment but this fact does not detract from the principle and the rule involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Appellant also attacks the judgment on the ground that none of the three notes on which plaintiff relies was offered in evidence. On the contrary, each note was read in evidence and the judgment recites that \u201coral and documentary evidence was introduced and received in behalf of the plaintiff. \u2019 \u2019 There can be no sort of doubt that the court had before it the notes upon which the signature of appellant duly appeared. A note read into the record is \u201coffered in evidence\u201d as effectually as if the paper upon which it is written were formally tendered and taken into the custody of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In his closing brief appellant for the first time asserts that the corporate quality of the plaintiff was not established. He says: \u201cIn the second paragraph of the answer filed to each of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged three causes of action . . . the defendant specifically denies that Goldberg, Bowen &amp; Co. were a corporation at the time of the alleged execution and delivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>of each note. No proof was introduced at the trial to controvert this denial.\u201d At the trial Mr. Denvir, cashier for the plaintiff, testified that Goldberg, Bowen &amp; Co. was a corporation 11 existing under the laws of the state of California.\u201d He did not state how long the corporation had existed but he produced the three notes here in suit and another witness swore that he saw Mr. Blood sign those instruments in which \u201cGoldberg, Bowen &amp; Co.\u201d is described as incorporated by the abbreviation \u201cInc.\u201d This is sufficient \"proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">From the foregoing discussion it follows that the judgment must be and accordingly it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Lorigan, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
