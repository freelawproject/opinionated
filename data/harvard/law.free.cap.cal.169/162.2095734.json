Thomas F.

The deceased and his wife occupied one of such apartments as their residence up to the time of his death, and since then she had continued to reside there. The other apartments were leased to various tenants both prior to and after his death. The deceased left no children surviving him and died intestate. No homestead had ever been selected or recorded by either spouse during the lifetime of the deceased. The appeal from the order setting apart the homestead was taken by the heirs at law of the decedent. The further facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-11\">Wilbur G.

Cas. 1913E, 1253, 41 L. R. A. (N. S.) 303, 124 Pac. 1016]. The decision of the lower court is sustained on that point on the authority of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">In regard to the proposition that it is community property, that, of course, is a matter of evidence, the presumption being, to start with, that it was community property. Taking the evidence as a whole, there is enough to sustain the finding of the lower court that it was community property. That being the case, the court was justified in setting it apart in fee as a homestead.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
