The notice of appeal states that they take the appeal \u201cbecause they are parties in interest and because the attorney-general declines to take an appeal in the name of the state.\u201d Under our law such an action may be brought and maintained only by the attorney-general in the name of the people of the state, and the relators are not \u201cparties\u201d to the action. An attempt to appeal by them alone is necessarily ineffectual for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
