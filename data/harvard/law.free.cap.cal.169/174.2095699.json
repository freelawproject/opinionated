Co. </em>v. <em>Fresno Flume etc. Co., </em>158 Cal. 626, was not an adjudication of the right in the defendant, by means of the dam and reservoir previously constructed by it across Stevinson Creek, to take water from such reservoir, although such taking decreases the amount of water naturally flowing in the creek below the reservoir, and decreases the amount in the river so that the plaintiff cannot obtain therefrom the quantity to which it is entitled under that judgment. The right of the defendant, determined by such prior judgment, was limited to the flood waters of such creek, and such judgment was not a bar to a cause of action subsequently arising from another taking which diminished the natural flow of the waters of the creek.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b216-5\">APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Fresno County.

Judgment was asked for damages and for an injunction to prevent future diversions.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">The record sets forth the complaint, answer, findings, and judgment in the former action. Said judgment was affirmed and the findings construed on appeal to this court. (See <em>San Joaquin etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Fresno Flume etc. Co., </em>158 Cal. 626, [35 L. R A. (N. S.) 832, 112 Pac. 182].) It appears further that the defendant had built a dam at Stevinson meadows, across said creek by which it formed a large reservoir in which it collected and retained the waters coming from the watershed thereto during times of unusual flood and rains and melting snows, and that the diversions which the defendant made, both before and since the former judgment, were of water taken directly from this reservoir. It is claimed in support of the demurrer that the former judgment establishes the right of the defendant to take water from the reservoir, although such taking decreases the amount of water naturally flowing in the creek below the reservoir and decreases the amount in the river so that the plaintiff cannot obtain therefrom the quantity to which it is entitled under that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The opinion of the court is that this complaint alleges a taking of water from this reservoir which, in its effect, diminishes the flow in Stevinson Creek below the reservoir from which the water is taken, and that it further shows that that water, thus taken from the stream and from that reservoir, would, if not taken, naturally flow down the stream into the San Joaquin River and into the plaintiff\u2019s canal, and that plaintiff is thereby deprived of its rightful quantity. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>former judgment was in favor of the defendants solely because of the fact found, that the taking there complained of, and there found to have occurred, was of flood waters and did not prevent this flow of the natural water of the stream down the creek and into plaintiff\u2019s canal. For these reasons the former judgment is not an adjudication of the injury here complained of, nor is it an adjudication of rights which prevents a complaint of the injury here alleged. The theory of the court below seems to have been that because the same reservoir is there and because the water is taken out by defendant at the same place as found upon the former trial; that there can be no other cause of action arising from another taking at a different time and after the rendition of the former judgment. That we think is a fallacy. The former judgment was rendered upon a disclaimer by the defendant of all right or claim to the natural flow of the creek and upon a finding that the former diversion from the reservoir did not decrease the natural flow of the stream as it had been accustomed to flow. It merely determined that the defendant was entitled to take water from that reservoir so long as its taking did not diminish the natural flow of the stream in its bed below. For these reasons we think the court below erred in its order sustaining the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
