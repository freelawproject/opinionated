Further, the application was made after five of the People\u2019s seven witnesses had testified, and defendant did not establish \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d warranting a mid-trial change of status <em>(People v McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d 10, 17). Defendant\u2019s conclusory and unsubstantiated attacks on his counsel\u2019s performance did not establish compelling circumstances. Concur \u2014 Rosenberger, J.
