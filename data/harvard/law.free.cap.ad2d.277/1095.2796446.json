Defendant rested, adduced no proof whatever, renewed the motion to dismiss, and thereupon the court dismissed the complaint and discharged defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-13\">In view of all the evidence adduced including plaintiff\u2019s exhibits, claimed to be defendant\u2019s handwriting, we think the judgment and order appealed from should be reversed and a new trial ordered. On retrial, steps should be taken to procure corroborative evidence if available including, e.g., hotel records, and to have issues concerning handwriting more adequately presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-14\">Whether the court on retrial will adhere to the determination originally reached after hearing additional testimony including any testimony of defendant or of any witnesses he may choose to call, is a matter that we leave entirely to the trial court as triers of the facts to determine; and we indicate no opinion of what the final result should be,</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">Peek, P.
