Co. v Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, </em>263 AD2d 368). The IAS Court properly relied on competent documentary evidence that had been prepared by plaintiff in connection vdth the underlying litigation demonstrating that plaintiffs settlement with the policyholder encompassed numerous distinct claims arising from unrelated polluting activities and damages at numerous sites throughout the United States that were not linked by a common origin.
