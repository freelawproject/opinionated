To this declaration defendant township of Byron interposed a demurrer in the following terms:</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-5\">\u201c(1) It is not alleged or shown by said declaration that the plaintiff sustained bodily injury or other damage upon any public highway or street within the corporate limits, or jurisdiction of the said township of Byron.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-6\">\u201c(2) It is not alleged or shown by said declaration that the construction of the temporary road referred to in said declaration was made by or under- the municipal authorities of the said township of Byron.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-7\">_ \u201c (3) The said township of Byron had no lawful municipal authority to construct the temporary road for the purposes for which it was alleged that said temporary road was constructed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-8\">The court having sustained the demurrer, a request was- filed by counsel for plaintiff that reasons be given by the trial court for sustaining the demurrer. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>learned circuit judge thereupon filed the following reason:</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-3\">\u201cI do not believe that a township is liable under the statute for injuries, sustained outside the established portion of the highway.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-4\">Plaintiff in this court now reviews the order sustaining the demurrer.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b615-5\">Brooke, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABG\"><em>(after stating the\u25a0 </em>facts). Plaintiff claims that the township became liable for injuries sustained by him upon this temporary highway, which he claims is a public highway within the meaning op the statute, for two reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">(1) Because it was connected with a public highway in such a way as to become part of it, the. opening and terminus being the public highway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">(2) Because it was held out to the public as a public highway, and the public were invited and induced to use it as a public highway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Many authorities are cited'by plaintiff, alleged by him to support his contention. With reference to those cited from this State, it is sufficient to say that the question, though presented in the recent ca,se of <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Township of Bangor, </em>182 Mich. 601 (148 N. W. 691), was undetermined, for the reason that plaintiff\u2019s recovery was there held to be barred upon the ground of contributory negligence. We have frequently held that the liability of municipalities for injuries upon highways is purely statutory, is in derogation of the common law, and cannot be enlarged by construction. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>City of Detroit, </em>156 Mich. 630 (121 N. W. 490, 132 Am. St. Rep. 537, 16 Am. &amp; Eng. Ann. Cas. 832), and cases cited. The statute under which plaintiff seeks to recover limits recovery to bodily injuries sustained\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">\u201cupon any of the public highways or streets in this State, by reason of neglect to keep such public high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>ways or streets, and all bridges, sidewalks, crosswalks and culverts on the same in reasonable repair, and in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel.\u201d 2 How. Stat. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 2462.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-3\">Public highways can be established in two methods only under the law of this State: (1) By proceedings instituted by the commissioner of highways of a township upon written application of freeholders and notice to landowners to be affected, appraisement \u2022 of damages, and the making of a proper record in the office of the township clerk. 2 How. Stat. (2d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 2174 to 2179. These proceedings must conform strictly to \u2019statute, or they are void. <em>Price </em>v. <em>Stagray, </em>68 Mich. 17 (35 N. W. 815); <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Highways, </em>75 Mich. 225 (42 N. W. 814). By the second method public highways may be established by user. 2 How. Stat. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 2193. It is clear that at the point where plaintiff was injured the defendant township of Byron had not established a \u201cpublic highway\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in the statute upon which liability is predicated. We are of opinion that one who travels outside of the limits of a legally established highway must be held to do so at his peril, so far as his statutory remedy against the township is concerned, even though the municipality has, without legal authority, either alone or in conjunction with others, constructed a temporary way for his accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b616-6\">Person, Kuhn, Stone, Ostrander, Bird, Moore, and Steere, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
