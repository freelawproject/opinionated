Bertrand.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-12\">Prior to the execution of either contract the plaintiff had performed two or more lumbering contracts for the defendant under oral agreements. Before the first of the contracts in question was. executed the plaintiff went over the ground to be lumbered with Mr. A. H. Blanchard, who was woods superintendent for the defendant company, and at whose request the first contract was. made. Subsequently Mr. Lobdell, president of the defendant company, Mr. Blanchard, and the plaintiff met in the office of the defendant corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>pany where, after a conversation, the first contract was executed. Plaintiff seems to have immediately prepared for operations, and started the shipment of timber under the contract early in August, 1911. There is no doubt that it was contemplated between the parties that the operation should be carried on as a \u201chot-logging\u201d operation. That is. to say, it was expected that the trees would be cut down, immediately thereafter \u201cswamped,\u201d \u201cskidded,\u201d and hauled to the Mc-Graw Branch for loading, where they were to be immediately loaded upon cars furnished by the railroad company for the purpose of transportation to Bay City, where the defendant had contracts of sale covering the product. From early in August to about the 8th day of January, the Michigan Central Railroad Company supplied sufficient cars to permit the operation to proceed under the \u201chot-logging\u201d practice. From that time forward the cars were not furnished in adequate numbers by the railroad company. When this situation arose, the plaintiff and Mr. Blanchard, defendant\u2019s woods superintendent, went to Bay City, and there interviewed the railway officials for the purpose of securing adequate car service. This, however, they were unable to accomplish. Whereupon, it is undisputed on the record that Blanchard directed plaintiff to continue the operations and deck all logs at the branch where they were to be loaded, and where they should lie until cars should be furnished later. In carrying out these instructions, plaintiff built 1,000 feet of extra side track, and thereafter decked about 1,500,000 feet of logs. These were not all decked at the same time, plaintiff loading from day to day such cars as were furnished with logs as they came from the cutting grounds. For extra labor in building the side track and decking these logs plaintiff claimed the sum of $750, being 50 cents per thousand. The record dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>closes that the value of the extra services performed in this behalf was from $1 to $1.50 per thousand, but plaintiff and Blanchard agreed that the compensation should be 50 cents per thousand. Blanchard, defendant\u2019s woods superintendent, as well as plaintiff, testified to this agreement. While defendant does not deny the making of this agreement between Blanchard and plaintiff, it does deny the authority of Blanchard to act as its agent and bind it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-3\">A second controversy, arising under the first contract, involves the question of the payment of the wages of a scaler. The total amount paid by the plaintiff as the wages of a scaler was $700, one-half of which, $350, plaintiff claimed from defendant. Touching this item, it was the claim of the plaintiff that after the first contract was entered into it was agreed between himself and Mr. Blanchard, in the presence of Mr. Lobdell, who consented to the arrangement, that a scaler should be employed, mutually satisfactory to the parties, whose scale should be used as a check upon the scaler of the Michigan Central Railway, and that the wages of said scaler should be borne one-half by each party to the contract. This arrangement, testified to by plaintiff and Mr. Blanchard, was denied by Mr. Lobdell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-4\">The third item of plaintiff\u2019s claim arises under the second contract, and grows out of the fact that on February 4th defendant ordered plaintiff to discontinue cutting on a portion of the so-called Montmorency contract. It is plaintiff\u2019s claim in this regard that he had built roads to the timber to be lumbered under the contract, and that he could have lumbered some 600,000 or 700,000 feet more timber had he not been unlawfully ordered to discontinue that operation. Plaintiff claims that by reason of defendant\u2019s unlawful act in ordering him to stop he lost a prospective profit of $1,200.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>A second dispute arose between the parties growing out of the second contract. That contract provides:</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-3\">\u201c$2.50 shall be paid for all logs delivered or skidded and the roads made to them, and the balance of $1.50 is to be paid when the logs are delivered at Rea\u2019s Landing and Hunt creek.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-4\">Early in the performance of this contract a dispute arose between plaintiff and defendant as to the location of Rea\u2019s Landing. It was the contention of plaintiff that Rea\u2019s Landing was located upon the river about a mile and a half above Hunt creek, whereas the defendant claimed that it was located at a place called the \u201cspout,\u201d very close to Hunt creek. Defendant held back a part of the contract price, thus compelling plaintiff to deliver the logs where defendant \u25a0claims Rea\u2019s Landing was. This necessitated the watering and driving of the logs from the place where plaintiff had banked them on the river to the point claimed as Rea\u2019s Landing by defendant. For the extra services plaintiff demanded the sum of $500.00.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-5\">Plaintiff made four other claims against defendant under the two contracts, but as these were not submitted to the jury by the trial court, they may be disregarded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s original bill of particulars was as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-7\">1911-1912. Building 1,000 feet railroad track, clearing ground for decking and decking 1,-500,000 feet logs at 50 cents per M........... $750 00</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-9\">1911-1912.

Going over grounds a second time.. 44 00</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-15\">Later an amended bill was filed in which the following items were claimed:</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Damage for profits on 6,000,000 feet hemlock at $2.00 per thousand..........................$1,200 00</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-4\">Driving logs................................. 500 00</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-5\">Defendant pleaded the general issue, and gave notices of set-off and recoupment, the general tenor of which was that the plaintiff had carelessly and incompetently. performed the contract to defendant\u2019s damage, the items of defendant\u2019s demand being as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-6\">1912. To damages account of logs left undelivered under contract of September, 1912... $269 49</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-7\">To improper cutting of logs, same being cut too long and too short.................... 1,000 00</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-9\">To balance of maple, beech and elm logs and standing trees left in woods on Otsego job.. 600 00</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-10\">$1,869 49</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-11\">After an exhaustive trial of the issues so framed, plaintiff recovered a judgment in the sum'of $1,580.42, which defendant now reviews in this court by writ of error.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b513-12\">Brooke, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aet\"><em>(after stating the facts). </em>The first item upon which the jury was permitted to pass was the sum of $750, the price agreed upon between Blanchard and plaintiff to be paid for the building of the 1,000 feet of side track, and the decking of the logs caused by the failure of the railroad company to furnish sufficient cars to permit plaintiff to conduct the operation after January 8th as a \u201chot-logging\u201d proposition, which it is clear was the method of handling the job contemplated by the parties at the time the contract was made. As pointed out in the statement of facts, Blanchard, defendant\u2019s woods superintendent, testified to the fact of making the agreement for the extra compensation exactly in accordance with the claim of plaintiff. On behalf of defendant it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>is urged that Blanchard was without authority, under the evidence, to modify the contract imposing an additional liability upon it. The contract provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201cThe second party further agrees that the work shall be done in a good workmanlike manner and that the instructions as to the manner in which this work shall be done shall be lived up to and carried out by thq second party in all its details.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">There can be no doubt under this section of the contract that the defendant, through its woods superintendent Blanchard, the contingency of the shortage of cars having arisen, ordered plaintiff to continue the operation and deck the logs at the siding. It should be borne in mind that the operation in question was being carried on in timber which had been injured by fire, and that it was necessary to have it cut and marketed speedily in order to prevent serious depreciation and loss. The authority of Blanchard to meet the exigency and to order a change in the method of the operation being unquestioned, it seems to us that plaintiff would have a clear right to recover the value of the extra services performed, under the common counts in his declaration, and under the uncontradicted testimony as to the value of such services contained in the record. Upon this question the court, charged in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201cAnd I charge you further, gentlemen, that if what Mr. Martindale claims for that service, that is to say, one-half dollar a thousand for 1,500,000 feet \u2014 if these services were fairly and reasonably worth that sum, he would be entitled to recover this sum of $750, which is his first claim in this case. Otherwise not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201cIf you do not find that Mr. Blanchard had this authority, which I have spoken of, to oversee, supervise, manage, and control the outside operations in the woods of this concern, then Mr. Martindale hasn\u2019t a look-in on that claim. But if he had, then I charge you equally as the law that he had a right to make this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>arrangement, which he says he made, to have Mr. Martindale put this excess of logs into these skidways and thereafter load them out. And if he promised that he should be paid for those services, then Mr. Martindale would be entitled to recover what those services \u2014 that is, the extra cost in loading out the skidded logs \u2014 what it was fairly and reasonably worth. He claims $750. It is for you to say whether he is entitled to that sum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-3\">The first paragraph quoted above would seem to permit a recovery on the <em>quantum meruit. </em>The second predicates the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover upon the authority of Mr. Blanchard to fix the value of the extra services and bind his principal to pay the agreed sum. As indicated, we believe the first paragraph above quoted states the law applicable to the case, but we are further of the opinion that no error was committed by the court in submitting the question of Blanchard\u2019s agency to the jury under the testimony contained in the record. From Blanchard\u2019s testimony it fairly appears, we think, that he had, on various occasions during the period of his service with defendant, assumed to direct the performance of similar contracts, and that his principal, the defendant, had recognized his authority so to do. The testimony of plaintiff and Blanchard as to the method of doing business and as to the exercise of authority by Blanchard in this as well as in other similar contracts was, in our opinion, quite sufficient to carry to the jury the question as to whether Blanchard had authority to agree to pay the extra compensation. <em>Marx </em>v. <em>King, </em>162 Mich. 258 (127 N. W. 841).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">With reference to the second item of plaintiff\u2019s claim, one-half the scaler\u2019s wages, it seems to be defendant\u2019s contention that the oral agreement to divide the expense testified to by Blanchard and plaintiff was made prior to the execution of the written contract, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\u201cThe official scale of the Michigan Central Railroad Company shall be accepted as final.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-3\">Plaintiff himself clearly testified that the arrangement was made subsequent to the execution of the contract, and we think a fair consideration of the entire record leads to the conclusion that the weight of the testimony is to that effect. Mr. Lobdell himself flatly denied the making of any such arrangement at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">As to the third item of plaintiff\u2019s damages arising from the closing down of the so-called Montmorency operation, defendant claims that it was acting within its legal rights in so doing in order to insure the delivery of ah the logs then cut to the piling grounds designated in the contract before the snow should vanish in the spring. Counsel for defendant say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s position, for the reasons indicated above, and to insure the delivery of the logs already decked, was- simply that Martindale should stop cutting any more timber until he had hauled this 1,500,-000 feet which was decked, and that he should use his dray haul force in hastening the delivery of these sleigh haul logs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Upon this point the learned trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">\u201cIf you find from the evidence, gentlemen, in this case, by a fair weight and preponderance, that if Grant Martindale had not been stopped by the defendant, that he could have hauled out his sleigh haul logs, and also could have cut and, put in this quantity of dead hemlock which he was using for his dray haul; that if he had not been stopped he could have completed the job on both kinds of timber \u2014 then I charge you that he would be entitled to such damages as I shall instruct you in a few moments. But, on the other hand, gentlemen, and from the different standpoint, I charge you expressly that if an honest, fair-minded lumberman, of ordinary intelligence, experience, and prudence, would not have believed that the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>under the circumstances then existing, could put his sleigh haul logs then on skids to the river before April 1, 1913, and\"also put in the remaining dray haul timber, and that the defendant did not so believe, then the \u2022defendant had the right to instruct the plaintiff to stop cutting dray haul logs and use his force to get all the logs ready cut to the river before cutting any more logs of either kind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-3\">\u201cNow, gentlemen, if under these instructions you find that the plaintiff would be entitled to recover damages for being prevented from continuing his operation in cutting and hauling the dray haul logs, I must tell you what you might award him. It is the claim of the plaintiff, and he has given evidence tending to show that state of facts, that before this time he had constructed all necessary or useful roads for the purpose of taking out the remaining standing, dead hemlock timber, standing and lying dead hemlock timber on section 28; that there was a quantity of that of about 600,000 feet; that he had built all necessary roads and landings; and that he could have done that work for $2 per thousand feet. The contract price was $4 a thousand, and he claims to recover, as the measure of damage, $2 a thousand, or the difference between the cost of putting in the logs and the contract price; and I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that if you believe he is entitled to recover under these instructions which I have just stated to you and repeated, that that would be the measure of his damage. Not $2 necessarily \u2014 I do not say $2. It is for you to say, first, how much timber there was there that he could have put in before the 1st of April. Not just 600,000 because he says so, unless you are convinced from the evidence that that is true \u2014 but he could recover the difference between the cost of putting in such timber as he could and would have put in and the contract price. That would be the measure of damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">This instruction we think correctly states the law applicable to the facts. <em>Atkinson </em>v. Morse, 63 Mich. 276 (29 N. W. 711).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The last item involves a pure question of fact, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>was submitted to the jury under appropriate instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b518-4\">Kuhn, Stone, Ostrander, Bird, Moore, and Steere, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b518-5\">The late Justice McAlvay took no part in this decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
