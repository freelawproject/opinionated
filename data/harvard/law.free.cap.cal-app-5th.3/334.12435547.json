City of Palos Verdes Estates </em>(9th Cir. 2009) 583 F.3d 716, 720 <em>(Palos Verdes Estates).) </em>We address here the scope of local government authority to adjust the balance of those interests, consistent with statewide regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Telephone and telegraph companies have long exercised a franchise under state law to construct and maintain their fines on public roads and highways \u201cin such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use.\u201d (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 7901 ;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> see <em>Pac. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. City &amp; County of S. F. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 766, <em>111 </em>[336 P.2d 514] <em>(Pacific Telephone I).) </em>State law also provides that local government maintains the right \u201cto exercise reasonable control as to the time, place, and manner in which roads, highways, and waterways are accessed. [\u00b6] . . . The control, to be reasonable, shall, at a minimum, be applied to all entities in an equivalent manner.\u201d (\u00a7 7901.1, subds. (a), (b).) In 2011, the City and County of San Francisco (City) enacted an ordinance requiring all persons to obtain a site-specific permit before seeking to construct, install, or maintain certain telecommunications equipment, known as \u201cPersonal Wireless Service Facilities\u201d (hereafter wireless facilities), in the public right-of-way.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this appeal, we consider whether the ordinance, on its face, is preempted by sections 7901 and 7901.1. We affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that portions of the ordinance that authorize consideration of aesthetics are not preempted by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">T-Mobile West LLC, Crown Castle NG West LLC,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and ExteNet Systems (California) LLC (collectively Plaintiffs) are considered \u201ctelephone corporations\u201d under California law. (\u00a7 234.) Plaintiffs\u2019 business requires installation and operation of wireless facilities, including antennas, transmitters, and power supplies, on existing utility poles in the City\u2019s public rights-of-way. These wireless facilities are considered \u201ctelephone lines.\u201d (\u00a7 233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In January 2011, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors adopted Ordinance No. 12-11 (Wireless Ordinance or Ordinance), which required Plaintiffs to obtain a wireless facility site permit (Wireless Permit) from the City\u2019s department of public works (DPW) before installing or modifying any wireless facility in the public right-of-way.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In adopting the Ordinance, the board of supervisors observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">\u201c(1) Surrounded by water on three sides, San Francisco is widely recognized to be one of the world\u2019s most beautiful cities. Scenic vistas and views throughout San Francisco of both natural settings and human-made structures contribute to its great beauty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">\u201c(2) The City\u2019s beauty is vital to the City\u2019s tourist industry and is an important reason for businesses to locate in the City and for residents to live here. Beautiful views enhance property values and increase the City\u2019s tax base. The City\u2019s economy, as well as the health and well-being of all who visit, work or live in the City, depends in part on maintaining the City\u2019s beauty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">\u201c(3) The types of wireless antennas and other associated equipment that telecommunications providers install in the public rights-of-way can vary considerably in size and appearance. The City does not intend to regulate the technologies used to provide personal wireless services. However, <em>the City needs to regulate the placement of such facilities in order to prevent telecommunications providers from installing wireless antennas and associated equipment in the City\u2019s public rights-of-way either in manners or in locations that will diminish the City\u2019s beauty.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) After the Ordinance was enacted, DPW adopted implementing regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The Ordinance required a showing of technological or economic necessity for permit approval and created three \u201cTiers\u201d of facilities based on equipment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>size. Tier I was defined to include only the smallest equipment (essentially, primary and secondary equipment enclosures, each less than three cubic feet in volume and no greater than 12 inches wide and 10 inches deep). Tier II was defined to allow equipment slightly larger in overall volume than Tier I (four cubic feet), but with the same limits on width and depth. Tier III was defined as any equipment larger than Tier II. The Ordinance conditioned approval of permits for equipment in Tiers II and III on aesthetic approval by a City department responsible for the proposed site.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Within Tiers II and III, three additional subdivisions were created, depending on whether the proposed wireless facility was in a location designated as (1) unprotected, (2) \u201cPlanning Protected\u201d or \u201cZoning Protected,\u201d or (3) \u201cPark Protected.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Each of those subdivisions, in turn, triggered different aesthetic standards for approval. For example, if a wireless facility was proposed to be installed near a historic building or in a historic district, the City\u2019s planning department needed to determine that it would not \u201csignificantly degrade the aesthetic attributes that were the basis for the special designation\u201d of the building or district. Additionally, for any Tier III facility, a \u201cnecessity\u201d standard required DPW to find that \u201ca Tier II Facility is insufficient to meet the Applicant\u2019s service needs.\u201d DPW would not issue a Wireless Permit unless the relevant City department determined the proposed wireless facility \u201csatisfie[d]\u201d the applicable aesthetic compatibility standard. The Ordinance also prohibits issuance of a Wireless Permit if the applicant seeks to \u201c[ijnstall a new Utility or Street Light Pole on a Public Right-of-Way where there presently are no overhead utility facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">If DPW approved a Tier III application after recommendation by the planning department, the approval from DPW was only \u201ctentative,\u201d and the applicant was then required to notice the public. \u201cAny person\u201d could protest tentative approval of a Tier III application within 20 days of the date the notice was mailed and then subjected the application to public hearing. After a final determination on a Tier III application, \u201cany person\u201d could appeal to the board of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">On May 3, 2011, Plaintiffs filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief. The operative second amended complaint asserted five causes of action: (1) violation of Government Code section 65964, subdivision (b);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>an unlawful taking of Plaintiffs\u2019 property without due process of law; (3) violation of and preemption by Public Utilities Code sections 7901 and 7901.1; (4) preemption of DPW regulations granting the planning department review authority under the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.); and (5) violation of and preemption by the then-newly enacted section 6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455). Plaintiffs\u2019 first and fourth causes of action were resolved by summary adjudication. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their second cause of action before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">During the bench trial on the remaining third and fifth causes of action, Plaintiffs and the City stipulated that Comcast, AT&amp;T, and PG&amp;E (Pacific Gas and Electric Company) have also installed certain equipment, including backup battery units, antennas, cutoff switches, power meters, and transformers, on utility poles in the City\u2019s public right-of-way. With respect to PG&amp;E, it was stipulated the City granted PG&amp;E a franchise to install its facilities in the public right-of-way and requires it to obtain temporary occupancy permits if the installation will take more than one day. The parties also stipulated that telephone corporations installing facilities on utility poles other than wireless facilities, such as AT&amp;T, and state video providers, such as Comcast, need only obtain utility conditions permits and temporary occupancy permits if the installation will take more than one day. Comcast, AT&amp;T, and PG&amp;E are not required to obtain any site-specific permit as a condition of installing such facilities on existing utility poles.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Following posttrial briefing and argument, the trial court issued its proposed statement of decision, to which both parties objected. On November 26, 2014, the trial court overruled the objections, issued its final statement of decision, and entered final judgment. The court ruled in favor of Plaintiffs on their fifth cause of action, holding that modification provisions of the Ordinance and DPW regulations violate section 6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. With respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 third cause of action, the trial court found portions of the Ordinance, conditioning issuance of a permit on economic or technological necessity, were preempted by Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Utilities Code section 7901. However, the court held the Ordinance\u2019s aesthetics-based compatibility standards were not preempted by sections 7901 or 7901.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">In concluding that sections 7901 and 7901.1 did not impliedly preempt the City\u2019s power to impose aesthetic conditions, the court rejected Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the public right-of-way is incommoded only by physical obstruction of travel. The court concluded <em>Palos Verdes Estates, supra, </em>583 F.3d 716 \u201ccorrectly viewed the public\u2019s right to the \u2018use of the road\u2019 as encompassing far more than merely getting from place to place.\u201d The trial court also agreed with the <em>Palos Verdes Estates </em>court that \u201cthe passage of [section] 7901.1 in 1995 codified and bolstered the right of local government to control and regulate construction of telecommunications facilities and for that reason ... the Wireless Ordinance is not pre-empted by [section] 7901.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The trial court found Plaintiffs\u2019 equipment and facilities installed in the public rights-of-way to be \u201cgenerally similar in size and appearance\u201d to equipment installed by \u201clandline\u201d telephone corporations, cable television operators, and PG&amp;E. Nonetheless, the trial court also rejected Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csecondary argument\u201d that the Ordinance directly conflicts with the equivalence requirement found in section 7901.1, subdivision (b). The court agreed Plaintiffs had failed to sustain their burden of proving the Ordinance was invalid on its face because of this lack of equivalency. The court further explained: \u201c[T]urning to the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 contention[,] the Court agrees that the term all entities means just that and is not limited to telephone and telegraph corporations. However, Plaintiffs have failed to provide reasoning or authority that justifies a finding that [section] 7901.1 requires that all entities, whatever or whoever they may be, must be subject to regulation under the Wireless Ordinance or something similar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After Plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal, the board of supervisors adopted Ordinance No. 18-15 (the Amended Ordinance) in order to comply with the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In relevant part, the Amended Ordinance retains the same basic permitting structure, but simplifies the standards applicable to proposed wireless facilities by removing the size-based tiers. (See S.F Pub. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Works Code, \u00a7 1502; <em>id., </em>former \u00a7 1503.) The Amended Ordinance continues to require compliance with aesthetics-based compatibility standards, but the applicable standard is now determined solely by the location of the facility. (See S.F. Pub. Works Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1502, 1508-1510.) All wireless facilities are now subject to the public notice and protest provisions formerly only applicable to Tier III facilities. (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1512-1513.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The question on appeal is whether the Ordinance, on its face, conflicts with and is preempted by sections 7901 and 7901.1. Plaintiffs contend the Legislature preempted local regulation by giving Plaintiffs the right to install telephone lines in the public right-of-way \u201cin such manner and at such points <em>cis not to incommode the public use of the road </em>or highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters.\u201d (\u00a7 7901, italics added.) Plaintiffs also argue the Ordinance violates the \u201cequivalent treatment\u201d requirement of section 7901.1, subdivision (b), because only wireless providers are required to obtain site-specific permits to install their equipment within the right-of-way. The City, on the other hand, maintains the Ordinance is not preempted by either section 7901 or section 7901.1.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, the City insists the plain meaning of the term \u201cincommode\u201d is broad enough \u201cto be inclusive of concerns related to the appearance of a facility\u201d and section 7901.1, subdivision (b), does not apply to the Ordinance. We agree with the City on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">We review questions of statutory interpretation and preemption de novo. <em>(Farm Raised Salmon Cases </em>(2008) 42 Cal.4th 1077, 1089, fn. 10 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 112, 175 P.3d 1170]; <em>Lewis C. Nelson &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Clovis Unified School Dist. </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 64, 69 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 715].) \u201c \u2018[T]he construction of statutes and the ascertainment of legislative intent are purely questions of law. This court is not limited by the interpretation of the statute made by the trial court . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bravo Vending v. City of Rancho Mirage </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 383, 391-392 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 164].)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u201cFacial challenges consider only the text of a measure, not the application of the measure to particular circumstances.\u201d <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. City of Carlsbad </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 785, 803 [75 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 534]; accord, <em>Tobe v. City of Santa Ana </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1069, 1084 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 402, 892 P.2d 1145].) \u201cFacial challenges to legislation are the most difficult to successfully pursue because the challenger must demonstrate that \u2018 \u201c \u2018no set of circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, the moving party must establish that the challenged legislation inevitably is in total, fatal conflict with applicable prohibitions.\u201d <em>(Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Napa County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 162, 173 [139 Cal.Rptr.3d 897].) \u201c[0]ur task is to determine whether the statute can constitutionally be applied. \u2018To support a determination of facial unconstitutionality, voiding the statute as a whole, [plaintiffs] cannot prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular <em>application </em>of the statute .... Rather, [plaintiffs] must demonstrate that the act\u2019s provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Arcadia Unified School Dist. v. State Dept. of Education </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 251, 267 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 545, 825 P.2d 438].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Preemption analysis \u201cconsists of four questions, which in order of increasing difficulty may be listed as follows: (1) Does the ordinance duplicate any state law? (2) Does the ordinance contradict any state law? (3) Does the ordinance enter into a field of regulation which the state has expressly reserved to itself? (4) Does the ordinance enter into a field of regulation from which the state has implicitly excluded all other regulatory authority?\u201d <em>(Bravo Vending v. City of Rancho Mirage, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 397.) \u201c \u2018[A]bsent a clear indication of preemptive intent from the Legislature,\u2019 we presume that local regulation \u2018in an area over which [the local government] traditionally has exercised control\u2019 is not preempted by state law. [Citation.] \u2018The party claiming that general state law preempts a local ordinance has the burden of demonstrating preemption.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Action </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>Apartment Assn., Inc. v. City of Santa Monica </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 1232, 1242 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 398, 163 P.3d 89]; see <em>Big Creek Lumber Co. v. County of Santa Cruz </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 1139, 1149 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 21, 136 P.3d 821].)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u201cA local ordinance <em>duplicates </em>state law when it is \u2018coextensive\u2019 with state law. [Citation.] [\u00b6] A local ordinance <em>contradicts </em>state law when it is inimical to or cannot be reconciled with state law. [Citation.] [\u00b6] A local ordinance <em>enters a field fully occupied </em>by state law in either of two situations\u2014when the Legislature \u2018expressly manifest[s]\u2019 its intent to occupy the legal area or when the Legislature \u2018impliedly\u2019 occupies the field. [Citations.] [\u00b6] When the Legislature has not expressly stated its intent to occupy an area of law, we look to whether it has <em>impliedly </em>done so. This occurs in three situations: when \u2018 \u201c(1) the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern; (2) the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action; or (3) the subject matter has been partially covered by general law, and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the\u201d locality.\u2019 \u201d <em>(O\u2019Connell v. City of Stockton </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 1061, 1067-1068 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 67, 162 P.3d 583].)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">A. <em>Implied Preemption by Sections 7901 and 7901.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Plaintiffs raise several discrete arguments for reversal. First, Plaintiffs urge section 7901 gave them a right to construct and maintain their facilities in public rights-of-way throughout the state \u2018\u201cwithout further discretionary approval by local governments.\u201d They do not claim \u201cthe City lacks all authority to regulate the telephone corporations\u2019 exercise of their [s]ection 7901 rights, rather Plaintiffs argue that the Wireless Ordinance is an act in excess of the limited [ministerial] authority the Legislature reserved to the City.\u201d In the alternative, Plaintiffs argue that section 7901\u2019s plain language indicates the Legislature impliedly sought to prohibit <em>any </em>local government regulation of aesthetics.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first argument appears to be premised on the mistaken understanding that local government has no authority to regulate Plaintiffs\u2019 installations unless specifically authorized to do so by statute. The relevant question is not, as Plaintiffs posit, whether section 7901 or section 7901.1 \u201cgrants\u201d the City discretionary regulatory power or the power to consider aesthetics. The question is really whether either section <em>divests </em>the City of its constitutional powers. Our review of the California Constitution, statutory provisions, and the relevant case law lead us to believe section 7901 is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>limited grant of rights to telephone corporations, with a reservation of local police power that is broad enough to allow discretionary aesthetics-based regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The California Constitution provides: \u201cA county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 7.) \u2018\u201cOften referred to as the \u2018police power,\u2019 this constitutional authority of counties or cities to adopt local ordinances is \u2018 \u2018\u201cthe power of sovereignty or power to govern\u2014the inherent reserved power of the state to subject individual rights to reasonable regulation for the general welfare.\u201d [Citation.] The police power extends to legislative objectives in furtherance of public peace, safety, morals, health and welfare.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cotta </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557 [69 Cal.Rptr.3d 612].) \u201cUnder the police power . . . , [municipalities] have plenary authority to govern, subject only to the limitation that they exercise this power within their territorial limits and subordinate to state law. [Citation.] ... [\u00b6] If otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law, it is preempted by such law and is void.\u201d <em>(Candid Enterprises, Inc. v. Grossmont Union High School Dist. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 878, 885 [218 Cal.Rptr. 303, 705 P.2d 876].) The local police power generally includes the power to adopt ordinances for aesthetic reasons. <em>(Ehrlich </em>v. <em>City of Culver City </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 854, 886 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 242, 911 P.2d 429] [imposition of aesthetic permit conditions \u201chave long been held to be valid exercises of the city\u2019s traditional police power\u201d]; <em>Disney v.

Co. v. Pasadena </em>(1911) 161 Cal. 265, 272-273 [118 P. 796] [discussing Civ. Code, former \u00a7 536]; <em>Pacific Telephone I, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at pp. 770-771.) That franchise, however, also has long been subject to regulation to ensure such lines do not \u201cincommode\u201d the public\u2019s use of those roads and highways. (Civ. Code, former \u00a7 536, as amended by Stats. 1905, ch. 385, \u00a7 1, pp. 491-492; Stats. 1951, ch. 764, pp. 2025, 2194, 2258 [reenacting Civ. Code, former \u00a7 536 as Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 7901].) Since 1951, section 7901 has provided: \u201cTelegraph or telephone corporations may construct lines of telegraph or telephone lines along and upon any public road or highway, along or across any of the waters or lands within this State, and may erect poles, posts, piers, or abutments for supporting the insulators, wires, and other necessary fixtures of their lines, <em>in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the road </em>or highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters.\u201d (Italics added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The Legislature later confirmed local government\u2019s \u201cright to exercise reasonable control as to the time, place, and manner in which roads, highways, and waterways are accessed\u201d in its enactment of section 7901.1.

(See \u00a7\u00a7 233, 234; <em>City of Huntington Beach </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 566, 587-588 [154 Cal.Rptr.3d 241]; <em>GTE Mobilenet of California, L.L.P. v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(N.D.Cal. 2006) 440 F.Supp.2d 1097, 1103 [\u201cwireless carriers are included in the definition of \u2018telephone corporation\u2019 in \u00a7 7901, and ... the definition of \u2018telephone line\u2019 in \u00a7 7901 is broad enough to reach wireless equipment\u201d].) It is undisputed that local government cannot entirely bar a telephone corporation from installing its equipment in the public right-of-way. <em>(Pacific Telephone </em>I, <em>supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at p. 774.) Furthermore, cities may not charge franchise fees to telephone corporations for the privilege of installing telephone lines in the public right-of-way. <em>(Huntington Beach, </em>at p. 587.) But section 7901 does not grant telephone corporations unlimited rights to install their equipment within the right-of-way. Rather, section 7901 clearly states that such installations must not \u201cincommode the public use of the road or highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters.\u201d (\u00a7 7901.) Furthermore, \u201csection 7901 grants [Plaintiffs] the privilege to construct infrastructure upon public rights-of-way, subject to a municipality\u2019s \u2018right to exercise reasonable control as to the time, place, and manner in which roads, highways, and waterways are accessed.\u2019 (\u00a7 7901.1, subd. (a)).\u201d <em>(Huntington Beach, </em>at p. 569, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In <em>Pacific Telephone </em>I, <em>supra, </em>51 Cal.2d 766, our Supreme Court held the construction and maintenance of telephone lines in public streets is a matter of state concern, not a municipal affair, under article XI of the California Constitution. <em>(Pacific Telephone I, </em>at p. 768.) It was, by then, \u201csettled that [former] section 536 of the Civil Code constitutes \u2018a continuing offer extended to telephone and telegraph companies . . . which offer when accepted by the construction and maintenance of lines\u2019 [citation] gives a franchise from the state to use the public highways for the prescribed purposes without the necessity for any grant by a subordinate legislative body.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 771.) Accordingly, the City could not require the telephone company to obtain a separate local franchise <em>(ibid.), </em>in addition to the state franchise, or in the absence of such a local franchise \u201cexclude telephone lines from the streets upon the theory that \u2018it is a municipal affair\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 774).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Plaintiffs suggest the <em>Pacific Telephone I </em>holding is determinative and that, if the construction and maintenance of telephone lines is a statewide concern, localities may not regulate Plaintiffs\u2019 access to the right-of-way by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>requiring a discretionary permit. Plaintiffs read the opinion far too broadly. The <em>Pacific Telephone I </em>holding is a narrow one: cities cannot exclude telephone lines from the public right-of-way on the basis that no local franchise has been obtained.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Opinions are not authority for propositions not considered. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Avila </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 491, 566 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 133 P.3d 1076].) Importantly, in <em>Pacific Telephone </em>/, the telephone company conceded the City retained the power to require it to obtain permits before installation or excavation in the right-of-way. <em>(Pacific Telephone </em>I, <em>supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at pp. 773-774.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u201cThe right of telephone corporations to construct telephone lines in public rights-of-way is not absolute. It has been observed by our Supreme Court that section 7901 grants \u2018a limited right to use the highways and [does so] only to the extent necessary for the furnishing of services to the public.\u2019 <em>(County of L. A. </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Tel. Co. </em>[(1948)] 32 Cal.2d [378,] 387 [196 P.2d 773].) The text of section 7901 provides that telephone lines may not \u2018incommode the public use of the road or highway . . . .\u2019 <em>(Ibid.) </em>Section 7901.1 states \u2018[i]t is the intent of the Legislature, consistent with Section 7901, that municipalities shall have the right to exercise reasonable control as to the time, place, and manner in which roads, highways, and waterways are accessed.\u2019 (\u00a7 7901.1, subd. (a).) \u2018The control, to be reasonable, shall, at a minimum, be applied to all entities in an equivalent manner.\u2019 (\u00a7 7901.1, subd. (b).) [\u00b6] In addition, section 2902 states that municipal corporations may not \u2018surrender to the [Public Utilities Commission] its powers of control to supervise and regulate the relationship between a public utility and the general public in matters affecting the health, convenience, and safety of the general public, including matters such as the use and repair of public streets by any public utility, the location of the poles, wires, mains, or conduits of any public utility, on, under, or above any public streets, and the speed of common carriers operating within the limits of the municipal corporation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Huntington Beach v. Public Utilities Com., supra, </em>214 Cal.App.4th at pp. 590-591.) Thus, \u201cthe Public Utilities Code specifically contemplates potential conflicts between the rights of telephone corporations to install telephone lines in the public right-of-way and the rights of cities to regulate local matters such as the location of poles and wires.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Instead of preempting local regulation, the statutory scheme (\u00a7\u00a7 2902, 7901, 7901.1) and the above authority suggest the Legislature intended the state franchise would coexist alongside local regulation. In arguing \u201c[t]here is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>no meaningful difference between regulating entry in a blanket fashion versus regulating entry on a case-by-case basis,\u201d Plaintiffs seek to divert our attention from the only question before us. Case-by-case regulation is meaningfully different. Requiring a local franchise, as the City did in <em>Pacific Telephone I, </em>has the immediate effect of prohibiting the telephone corporations\u2019 use of the public right-of-way, whereas local regulation on a site-by-site basis does not have the same impact. As stated by amici curiae, the exercise of local planning discretion \u201cis not used to prohibit the use of the public rights of way, or to abridge any state-conferred rights of [telephone corporations]. It is used to harmonize the interest and rights of [telephone corporations] with cities\u2019 and counties\u2019 other legitimate objectives . . . .\u201d Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden on a facial challenge by suggesting the City may apply the Ordinance so as to prohibit their use of the right-of-way altogether. <em>(Arcadia Unified School Dist. v. State Dept. of Education, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 267 [\u201c \u2018[t]o support a determination of facial unconstitutionality, voiding the statute as a whole, [plaintiffs] cannot prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular <em>application </em>of the statute\u2019 \u201d].) Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show local government can <em>never, in any situation, </em>exercise discretion to deny a permit for a particular proposed wireless facility. Thus, we turn to Plaintiffs\u2019 second argument\u2014that section 7901 implicitly prohibits <em>any </em>local government regulation of wireless facility aesthetics.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Plaintiffs appear to concede the Ordinance does not duplicate or contradict state law. Instead, they appear to focus on whether the Ordinance has \u201cmanifested its intent to \u2018fully occupy\u2019 \u201d any area of regulation exceeding that necessary to prevent physical obstruction of travel on the public right-of-way. <em>(Sherwin-Williams Co. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 893, 898 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 215, 844 P.2d 534].) Accordingly, the question is whether the Legislature impliedly preempted the City\u2019s power to condition approval of a Wireless Permit on aesthetics-based standards. \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s \u2018preemptive action in specific and expressly limited areas weighs against an inference that preemption by implication was intended elsewhere.\u2019 [Citations.] In addition, . . . \u2018[preemption by implication of legislative intent may not be found when the Legislature has expressed its intent to permit local regulations. Similarly, it should not be found when the statutory scheme recognizes local regulations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Big Creek Lumber Co. v. County of Santa Cruz, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 1157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u201cIn general, courts are cautious in applying the doctrine of implied preemption: \u2018[I]n view of the long tradition of local regulation and the legislatively imposed duty to preserve and protect the public health, preemption may not be lightly found.\u2019 [Citation.] Where local legislation clearly serves local purposes, and state legislation that appears to be in conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>actually serves different, statewide purposes, preemption will not be found.\u201d <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. City of Carlsbad, </em>supra, 64 Cal.App.4th at p. 793.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The Ordinance unquestionably allows the City to condition approval of a particular Wireless Permit on aesthetic considerations. Plaintiffs contend the Legislature impliedly preempted such local regulation by giving telephone corporations the power to install telephone lines in the public right-of-way \u2018\u201cin such manner and at such points <em>as not to incommode the public use of the road </em>or highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters.\u201d (\u00a7 7901, italics added.) Plaintiffs\u2019 position is that \u201cincommode\u201d means only physical obstruction of travel in the public right-of-way. The City, on the other hand, points out that the dictionary definition of \u201cincommode\u201d is broader and includes \u201cinconvenience, discomfort, and disturbance beyond mere blockage.\u201d (See Merriam-Webster Online Diet, &lt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ incommode&gt; [as of Sept. 15, 2016] [defining \u201cincommode\u201d as \u201cto give inconvenience or distress to: disturb\u201d]; Webster\u2019s Diet. 1828\u2014online ed. &lt;http://webstersdictionaryl828.com/Dictionary/incommode&gt; [as of Sept. 15, 2016] [defining \u201cincommode\u201d as \u201c[t]o give inconvenience to; to give trouble to; to disturb or molest in the quiet enjoyment of something, or in the facility of acquisition\u201d; denoting \u201cless than annoy, vex or harass\u201d; e.g., \u201cWe are incommoded by want of room to sit at ease\u201d].) We must construe the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u201cThe relevant principles that guide our decision are well known. \u2018 \u201cOur function is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citation.] To ascertain such intent, courts turn first to the words of the statute itself [citation], and seek to give the words employed by the Legislature their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citation.] When interpreting statutory language, we may neither insert language which has been omitted nor ignore language which has been inserted. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858.) The language must be construed in the context of the statutory framework as a whole, keeping in mind the policies and purposes of the statute [citation], and where possible the language should be read so as to conform to the spirit of the enactment. [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] [\u00b6] We also must endeavor to harmonize, both internally and with each other, separate statutory provisions relating to the same subject.\u201d <em>(Lewis C. Nelson &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Clovis Unified School Dist., supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at pp. 69-70.) \u201c \u2018 \u201cIt is an elementary rule of construction that effect must be given, if possible, to every word, clause and sentence of a statute.\u201d A statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant, and so that one section will not destroy another unless the provision is the result of obvious mistake or error.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rodriguez v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1269 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 120].)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u201cWhen attempting to ascertain the ordinary, usual meaning of a word, courts appropriately refer to the dictionary definition of that word.\u201d <em>(Wasatch Property Management v. Degrate </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1111, 1121-1122 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 262, 112 P.3d 647].) \u201cIf the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the Legislature (in the case of a statute) . . . .\u201d <em>(Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) \u201cWhen the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, however, we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1008 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154].) \u201cWe must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 234, 246 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 893 P.2d 1224].) \u201cThe court will apply common sense to the language at hand and interpret the statute to make it workable and reasonable.\u201d <em>(Wasatch Property Management, </em>at p. 1122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In contending the trial court erred by adopting the broader interpretation of \u201cincommode,\u201d Plaintiffs rely on <em>Western Union Tel. Co. v. Visalia </em>(1906) 149 Cal. 744, 750 [87 P. 1023] (Visalia) and <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>(1961) 197 Cal.App.2d 133, 152 [17 Cal.Rptr. 687] <em>(Pacific Telephone II). </em>In <em>Visalia, </em>a telegraph company challenged an assessment imposed on a purported local franchise to operate telegraph lines within the City of Visalia. <em>(Visalia, </em>at p. 745.) Our Supreme Court concluded there was no such local franchise because Civil Code former section 536 had already given the telegraph company \u201cthe right, of which the city could not deprive it, to construct and operate its lines along the streets of the city.\u201d <em>(Visalia, </em>at p. 750.) The court continued: \u201c[N]evertheless [the telegraph company] could not maintain its poles and wires in such a manner as to unreasonably obstruct and interfere with ordinary travel; and the city had the authority, under its police power, to so regulate the manner of . . . placing and maintaining its poles and wires as to prevent unreasonable obstruction of travel.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 750-751.)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In <em>Pacific Telephone II, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.2d 133, the City argued that the telephone company could not claim a franchise under former section 536 of the Civil Code without first proving that the construction and maintenance of its poles and lines in San Francisco streets would not \u201cincommode\u201d the public use thereof. <em>(Pacific Telephone II, </em>at p. 145.) Division One of this court rejected the argument, reasoning that the City\u2019s interpretation of Civil Code former section 536 was too restrictive. \u201cObviously, the Legislature in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>adopting section 536 knew that the placing of poles, etc., in a street would of necessity constitute some incommodity to the public use, but <em>the restriction necessarily is limited to an unreasonable obstruction of the public use. </em>[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] It is absurd to contend that the installation of telephone poles and lines, <em>under the control by the city of their location and manner of construction, </em>is such an \u2018incommodation\u2019 as to make section 536 inapplicable. Such a construction of that section would make it completely inoperable.\u201d <em>(Pacific Telephone II, </em>at p. 146, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Neither <em>Pacific Telephone II </em>nor <em>Visalia </em>considered the issue presented here\u2014whether the aesthetic impacts of a particular telephone line installation could ever \u201cincommode the public use.\u201d We decline Plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to consider the opinions as authority for propositions not considered. <em>(People v. Avila, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 566.) In fact, the <em>Pacific Telephone II </em>court stated, \u201cbecause of the state concern in communications, the state has retained to itself the broader police power of granting franchises, <em>leaving to the municipalities the narrower police power of controlling location and manner of installation.\u201d (Pacific Telephone II, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.2d at p. 152, italics added.) Thus, the case does not support Plaintiffs\u2019 position that section 7901 prohibits local government from considering aesthetics when issuing individual Wireless Permits. It simply leaves open the question\u2014what kind of control over location and manner can local government exercise?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Although California courts have not yet addressed this precise issue in any published opinion, authority from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is directly on point. In <em>Palos Verdes Estates, supra, </em>583 F.3d 716, the City of Palos Verdes Estates denied, for aesthetic reasons, two permits to construct wireless facilities in the public right-of-way. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 719.) A city ordinance authorized Palos Verdes Estates to deny such permit applications on aesthetic grounds. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 720-721.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">When the telephone company challenged the permit denials, the <em>Palos Verdes Estates </em>court found no conflict between the city\u2019s consideration of aesthetics and section 7901. The key to that conclusion was the court\u2019s observation that article XI, section 7 of the California Constitution grants local government authority to regulate local aesthetics and \u201cneither [section] 7901 nor [section] 7901.1 divests it of that authority.\u201d <em>(Palos Verdes Estates, supra, </em>583 F.3d at pp. 721-722.) The court construed the statutory language, \u201c[t]o \u2018incommode\u2019 the public use,\u201d as meaning \u201cto \u2018subject [it] to inconvenience or discomfort; to trouble, annoy, molest, embarrass, inconvenience\u2019 or \u2018[t]o affect with inconvenience, to hinder, impede, obstruct (an action, etc.).\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 723.) It also observed, \u201c \u2018public use\u2019 of the rights-of-way is not limited to travel\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is a widely accepted principle of urban planning that streets may be employed to serve important social, expressive, and aesthetic functions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Likewise, section 7901.1 did not preempt the local ordinance, as it \u201cwas added ... in 1995 to <em>\u2018bolster </em>the cities\u2019 abilities with regard to construction management and to send a message to telephone corporations that cities have authority to manage their construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Palos Verdes Estates, supra, </em>583 F.3d at p. 724, italics added, quoting Sen. Com. on Energy, Utilities and Communications, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 621 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 17, 1995.) \u201cIf the preexisting [\u2018incommodation\u2019] language of [section] 7901 did not divest cities of the authority to consider aesthetics in denying [wireless facility] construction permits, then, a fortiori, neither does the language of [section] 7901.1, which only \u2018bolsters\u2019 cities\u2019 control.\u201d <em>(Palos Verdes Estates, supra, </em>583 F.3d at p. 724.) The court concluded, \u201cthere is no conflict between [the city\u2019s] consideration of aesthetics in deciding to deny a [wireless] permit\u201d and sections 7901 and 7901.1. <em>(Palos Verdes Estates, </em>at p. 724.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Three years earlier, another panel of the Ninth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion in an unpublished decision <em>Sprint PCS v. La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge </em>(9th Cir. 2006) 182 Fed. Appx. 688, 689, 691 <em>(La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge). </em>The <em>La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge </em>court rejected the dictionary definition of \u201cincommode\u201d and, instead, relied on <em>Pacific Telephone IPs </em>narrow construction of \u201cincommode.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 690-691.) The court determined the city could only prevent \u201c \u2018unreasonable obstruction of the public use,\u2019 \u201d because \u201c[t]he text focuses on the function of the road\u2014its \u2018use,\u2019 not its enjoyment. Based solely on \u00a7 7901, it is unlikely that local authorities could deny permits based on aesthetics without an independent justification rooted in interference with the function of the road.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Plaintiffs ask us to rely on <em>La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, </em>contending that <em>Palos Verdes Estates </em>inadequately addresses California authority. Plaintiffs\u2019 criticism is not well taken. The <em>Palos Verdes Estates </em>court cites <em>Pacific Telephone I </em>for the proposition that a \u201ctelephone franchise is a matter of state concern but city still controls the particular location and manner in which public utility facilities are constructed in the streets.\u201d <em>(Palos Verdes Estates, supra, </em>583 F.3d at p. 723, fn. 3.) We have already expressed our disagreement with Plaintiffs\u2019 broader reading of <em>Pacific Telephone I </em>and thus cannot fault the <em>Palos Verdes Estates </em>court for implicitly reaching the same conclusion or not discussing <em>Viscalia, supra, </em>149 Cal. 744, <em>In re Johnston, supra, </em>137 Cal. 115, or <em>Sunset Tel. and Tel. Co. v. Pasadena, supra, </em>161 Cal. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Of course, we are not bound by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion on matters of state law. <em>(Campbell v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1317 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 385].) Although the <em>Palos Verdes Estates </em>opinion is not binding, we find it persuasive. <em>(Adams v. Pacific Bell Directory </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 93, 97 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 365]; <em>Mesler v. Bragg Management Co. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 299 [216 Cal.Rptr. 443, 702 P.2d 601].) We agree with the City and the <em>Palos Verdes Estates </em>court that Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201cincommode\u201d is too narrow and inconsistent with the term\u2019s plain meaning. Plaintiffs\u2019 other textual arguments, grounded in <em>La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, </em>are no more convincing. According to Plaintiffs, because the express language of section 7901 provides that telephone corporations may not install their equipment in a location or manner that \u201cincommode[s] the public <em>use </em>of the road or highway or <em>interrupt[s] the navigation </em>of the water,\u201d the Legislature must have intended \u201cincommode\u201d be limited to physical obstructions of travel.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 argument rests on the faulty assumption that \u201cuse\u201d of a public road means nothing beyond transportation thereon.  We agree with the <em>Palos Verdes Estates </em>court that public use of the right-of-way is not limited to travel and that streets \u201cmay be employed to serve important social, expressive, and aesthetic functions.\u201d <em>(Palos Verdes Estates, supra, </em>583 F.3d at p. 723.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">We believe the <em>La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge </em>court reached the wrong result through a cursory analysis, in which it interpreted \u201cincommode\u201d too narrowly and adopted a myopic view of the function of public roads. <em>(La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, supra, </em>182 Fed. Appx. at pp. 690-691.) Furthermore, although we are not precluded from considering unpublished federal decisions, we note that even within the Ninth Circuit <em>La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge </em>has no precedential value. <em>(Bowen </em>v. <em>Ziasun Technologies, Inc. </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th <em>777, </em>787, fn. 6 [11 Cal.Rptr.3d 522]; U.S. Cir.

In our view, \u201cincommode the public use\u201d means \u201cto unreasonably subject the public use to inconvenience or discomfort; to unreasonably trouble, annoy, molest, embarrass, inconvenience; to unreasonably hinder, impede, or obstruct the public use.\u201d (See <em>Palos Verdes Estates, supra, </em>583 F.3d at p. 723.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">We cannot agree with Plaintiffs that our construction of the term \u201cincommode\u201d is limitless and \u201ceffectively nullifies] the Section 7901 franchise.\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>can certainly imagine that a large wireless facility might aesthetically \u201cincommode\u201d the public use of the right-of-way, if installed very close to Coit Tower or the oft photographed \u201cPainted Ladies,\u201d but present no similar \u201cincommo-dation\u201d in other parts of the urban landscape.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also argue: \u201cEven if aesthetics were a theoretically proper basis for regulating the installation of telephone lines in the public rights of way under Section 7901, the City\u2019s treatment of other equipment in the public rights of way emphasizes that there are no legitimate grounds for claiming that wireless equipment may incommode the use of the public rights of way.\u201d Should Plaintiffs be denied a Wireless Permit in an area already cluttered with other electrical and telecommunications equipment, we again have no doubt they may pursue an as-applied challenge. Presented only with a facial challenge, we cannot assume the City will apply the Ordinance in this manner. <em>(Arcadia Unified School Dist. v. State Dept. of Education, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The trial court did not err in determining the Ordinance is not facially preempted by sections 7901 and section 7901.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">B. <em>Direct Conflict Preemption by Section 7901.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Plaintiffs also argue that the Ordinance directly conflicts with section 7901.1, subdivision (b), because the City \u201chas singled out wireless equipment\u201d by requiring providers of commercial mobile services alone to obtain site-specific permits while \u201cignoring the aesthetics of identical equipment installed by other right of way occupants.\u201d Plaintiffs assert the trial court\u2019s conclusion the Ordinance does not facially conflict with section 7901.1, subdivision (b), \u201cis inconsistent with its [other] factual and legal holdings\u201d\u2014 i.e., that other occupants\u2019 equipment is similar in size and appearance and that site-specific permitting requirements are not imposed on other occupants of the right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Section 7901.1 provides: \u201c(a) It is the intent of the Legislature, <em>consistent with Section 7901, </em>that municipalities shall have the right to exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>reasonable control as to the time, place, and manner in which roads, highways, and waterways <em>are accessed. </em>[\u00b6] (b) The control, to be reasonable, shall, at a minimum, <em>be applied to all entities in an equivalent manner. </em>[\u00b6] (c) Nothing in this section shall add to or subtract from any existing authority with respect to the imposition of fees by municipalities.\u201d (Italics added.) Plaintiffs and the City agree that section 7901.1, subdivision (b), applies only to construction activities. They use the term in different senses, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The City maintains: \u201c[TJhe use of the phrase \u2018time, place, and manner in which the roads, highways, and waterways are <em>accessed\u2019 </em>clearly refers to local authority to control <em>temporary </em>uses of the public right-of-way during construction. This term implies that the legislature intended to make clear local governments could prevent incommodations both through section 7901 and by controlling the use of the public right-of-way during construction\u2014 even if the facilities once constructed (i.e., underground utility facilities) could not themselves incommode the public right-of-way.\u201d (Italics added.) In other words, \u201c[t]he inquiry under section 7901 is whether, <em>once installed, </em>those facilities would \u2018incommode\u2019 the public right-of-way. Construction management regulations permitted under section 7901.1 . . . address <em>how </em>the applicant intends to install its facilities in the public right-of-way.\u201d Under the City\u2019s interpretation, subdivision (b) of section 7901.1 has no application to the Ordinance because it is not a regulation of \u2018\u201ctime, place, and manner of construction\u2014but is instead a regulation that permits Wireless Facilities to be installed in the public right-of-way subject to certain siting criteria.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Plaintiffs, in their opening brief, contend section 7901.1 defines the limited authority local governments have under section 7901. In their view, sections 7901 and 7901.1 give local governments limited construction management authority, but only to prevent physical obstruction of the roads, not aesthetic incommodation. In the alternative, they contend that, even if the City has the authority to impose discretionary aesthetic regulation, the City\u2019s application of such control must be equivalent for \u201call entities.\u201d (See \u00a7 7901.1, subd. (b).) In their reply brief and a petition for rehearing, Plaintiffs refine their position and contend that section 7901.1 does not relate solely to temporary construction access to the right-of-way. However, Plaintiffs continue to maintain that section 7901.1 \u201cdoes not expand [local government] authority,\u201d but defines the limited authority section 7901 reserved for local governments to regulate how the public right-of-way is accessed <em>and </em>occupied. \u201cIn other words, Section 7901.1 tells us that the way local governments can enforce the limits of telephone corporations\u2019 statewide franchise rights and ensure they do not \u2018incommode the public use\u2019 of the streets is to assert \u2018reasonable control\u2019 over the \u2018time, place, and manner\u2019 in which telephone corporations access the public rights of way.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) Plaintiffs maintain \u201c[sjection 7901 does not describe local authority, [sjection 7901.1 does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201cAccess\u201d means \u201ca way of getting near, at, or to something or someone\u201d; \u201ca way of being able to use or get something\u201d; \u201cpermission or the right to enter, get near, or make use of something or to have contact with someone.\u201d (Merriam-Webster Online Diet, &lt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ accessed&gt; [as of Sept. 15, 2016].) Although the plain meaning of the word \u201caccessed\u201d is ambiguous, the remainder of section 7901.1 and its legislative history make clear the section is concerned solely with \u201ctemporary access\u201d for construction purposes. (See <em>Palos Verdes Estates, supra, </em>583 F.3d at p. 725 [agreeing the Legislature\u2019s use of phrase \u201c \u2018time, place and manner\u2019 \u201d in which rights-of-way \u201c \u2018are accessed\u2019 \u201d \u201ccan refer only to when, where, and how telecommunications service providers gain entry to the public rights-of-way\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Enactment of section 7901.1 was premised on an understanding that the section 7901 franchise \u201cprovide[s] the telephone corporations with the right to <em>construct and maintain </em>their facilities. Local government has limited authority to manage or control that <em>construction. </em>[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . This bill is intended to bolster the [cities\u2019] abilities with regard to <em>construction management </em>and to send a message to telephone corporations that cities have authority to manage <em>their construction, </em>without jeopardizing the telephone corporations\u2019 statewide franchise.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Sen. Bill No. 621 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 3, 1995, pp. 1, 3, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The legislative history of section 7901.1 also provides: \u201cTo encourage the statewide development of telephone service, telephone corporations have been given state franchises to build their networks. This facilitates construction by minimizing the ability of local government to regulate construction by telephone corporations. Only telephone companies have statewide franchises; energy utilities and cable television companies obtain local franchises. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . Cities interpret their authority to manage telephone company <em>construction </em>differently. Telephone corporations represent their rights under state franchise differently as well, sometimes taking the extreme position that cities have absolutely no right to control <em>construction. </em>This lack of clarity causes frequent disputes. Among the complaints of the cities are a lack of ability to plan maintenance programs, protect public safety, minimize public inconvenience, and ensure adherence to sound construction practices. Cities are further concerned that <em>multiple street cuts caused by uncoordinated construction </em>shortens the life of the streets, causing increased taxpayer costs, as described in a recently commissioned study.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Utilities and Commerce, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 621 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 7, 1995, p. 2, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">If we were to accept Plaintiffs\u2019 construction of section 7901.1, we would necessarily ignore this legislative history and, more importantly, eliminate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>effect of section 7901.l\u2019s \u201cconsistent with section 7901\u201d language. Had the Legislature intended to narrow and restrict local government\u2019s existing authority under section 7901, we cannot imagine it would have included the \u201cconsistent with section 7901\u201d language. Nor would an enrolled bill report make clear that Senate Bill No. 621 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) \u201cwould not change current law, but would simply clarify existing municipality rights\u201d and \u201creduce disputes between telephone companies and cities, as well as result in fewer inconveniences to citizens without infringing on the telephone companies[\u2019] right to construct and maintain their facilities.\u201d (Off. of Planning &amp; Research, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 621 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 31, 1995, p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">We understand section 7901.1 as affirming and clarifying a subset of the local government powers, reserved under section 7901, to regulate telephone lines in the right-of-way. Even if the meaning of \u201call entities\u201d (\u00a7 7901.1, subd. (b)) is not limited to telephone and telegraph corporations, Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show the Ordinance is preempted because section 7901.1 applies only to construction itself. With respect to temporary access to the right-of-way for construction purposes, the record shows the City uniformly requires AT&amp;T, Comcast, PG&amp;E, and Plaintiffs to obtain temporary occupancy permits to access the right-of-way during construction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Of course, if the Legislature disagrees with our conclusions, or wishes to grant the wireless industry further relief from local regulation, it remains free to amend sections 7901 and 7901.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">III.

In suggesting we are compelled to apply a more lenient standard. Plaintiffs misplace their' reliance on facial challenges involving First Amendment and abortion rights.

Nor are we persuaded by Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on out-of-state tort cases that involved liability related to a utility company\u2019s actual physical obstruction of public roads. Neither these opinions, nor other inapposite out-of-state cases cited by Plaintiffs, address the question before us. Nor do they suggest the meaning of \u201cincommode\u201d is limited to physical obstruction of travel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> Plaintiffs claim this hypothetical assumes facts that are not possible under the Ordinance because all utilities are underground at the former locations. The Ordinance provides: \u201cThe Department shall not issue a [wireless permit] if the Applicant seeks to: [\u00b6] (1) Install a new Utility ... or Street Light Pole on a Public Right-of-Way where there presently are no overhead utility facilities.\u201d However, Plaintiffs simply ask us to assume there are no overhead utility facilities near Coit Tower or the Painted Ladies. Even if we can assume as much, the Ordinance\u2019s ban on new utility poles is itself a challenge, but seemingly reasonable, aesthetic restriction. By referencing Coit Tower and the Painted Ladies, we do not mean to suggest these are the only areas of aesthetic value where installation of a wireless facility could incommode public use. We merely seek to illustrate why a facial challenge is inappropriate. We decline Plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to assume the Ordinance\u2019s aesthetic restrictions will only affect proposed installation of wireless facilities on existing utility poles that are already cluttered with other electrical and telecommunications equipment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\"> In their petition for rehearing.
