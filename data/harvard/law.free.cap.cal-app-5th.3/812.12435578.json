(b)-(i)) and served two prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). On May 4, 1995, he was sentenced to a total of two years plus 25 years to fife in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>In 2012, the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (\u00a7 1170.126 et seq.) (hereafter the Act) created a postconviction release proceeding for third strike offenders serving indeterminate life sentences for nonserious and nonviolent felonies. An inmate who meets the criteria enumerated in section 1170.126, subdivision (e), is to be resentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines such resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (1); <em>People </em>v. <em>Yearwood </em>(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 168 [151 Cal.Rptr.3d 901].) Defendant\u2019s conviction was for a crime that was neither a serious nor a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">An inmate is ineligible for resentencing under the Act, however, if his or her current sentence is \u201cfor any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) Thus, an inmate is disqualified from resentencing if, inter alia, \u201c[djuring the commission of the current offense, [he or she] . . . was armed with a . . . deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii).)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">After the Act went into effect, defendant filed a petition for recall of sentence and request for resentencing under the Act. The People opposed the petition on the ground, inter alia, defendant was armed with (and actually used) a deadly weapon during the commission of his offense. Following a hearing, the trial court found defendant eligible for resentencing, and that resentencing defendant would not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. The court granted the petition and resentenced defendant as a second strike offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The People appeal, challenging the trial court\u2019s eligibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">We hold an inmate is armed with a deadly weapon within the meaning of clause (iii) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 and clause (iii) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of section 1170.12 (hereafter referred to collectively as clause (iii)) when he or she personally and intentionally uses a vehicle in a manner likely to produce great bodily injury. On the evidence found in the record of conviction, defendant used a vehicle as a deadly weapon. He is, therefore, ineligible for resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2). Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">\u201cOn March 17, 1994, at approximately 2 p.m., Fred Sanchez was working as a sales clerk at Grand Auto in Fresno. He observed [defendant] and a man, who hereinafter will be referred to as the \u2018passenger,\u2019 enter the store. The passenger raised a Club, an auto anti-car theft device, a couple of feet above the aisle and then lowered it. The passenger was wearing a Pendleton wool-type jacket and had his back to Sanchez. [Defendant] spoke briefly to the passenger and then went up to Sanchez and spoke to him about some tires. While this conversation was taking place, the passenger left the store. Sanchez could see the passenger go out into the parking lot of the store and wait at the passenger side of a Blazer-type truck. [Defendant] went to the driver\u2019s side and drove away. Sanchez suspected that the passenger had stolen the Club from the store and [defendant] had attempted to divert his attention away from the theft. However, he did not call the police over the incident nor did he check the store inventory to determine if any items were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">\u201cThe next day, March 18, 1994, around noon, Sanchez saw the same passenger from the day before enter the store. He was wearing the same jacket, even though the day was \u2018incredibly\u2019 hot. He appeared nervous and kept turning his back toward Sanchez. Sanchez asked the passenger if he needed assistance and then followed the passenger out of the rear of the store after alerting the other store employee that he needed assistance. He heard rustling in the passenger\u2019s clothing. The passenger had not paid for any item from the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">\u201cThe passenger entered the passenger side of the same Blazer as the day before. The passenger side window was rolled down. Sanchez was wearing a red smock shirt with the insignia of Grand Auto and his name tag. The passenger was in the Blazer less than a minute when Sanchez came up to its window. [Defendant] was the driver. Sanchez observed a bulge protruding from the passenger\u2019s clothing. Sanchez told the passenger to please give the merchandise back and he could leave. Sanchez then reached into the vehicle and grabbed at the package in the passenger\u2019s jacket. Sanchez identified the package as an Ultra Club which had a retail value of $59.55. Sanchez said, \u2018Give it up.\u2019 [Defendant] then looked toward Sanchez and said, \u2018Give it up.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">\u201c[Defendant] then drove the vehicle in reverse. The passenger grabbed Sanchez\u2019s left arm and pushed it down, which prevented Sanchez from pulling his arm out of the vehicle. Sanchez yelled, \u2018Stop the vehicle\u2019 three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>times as the vehicle was moving in reverse. He was dragged when the vehicle went into reverse. He had to run to keep his balance. [Defendant] then drove the vehicle forward. Sanchez was able to pull his arm free once the vehicle moved forward, but he was afraid if he fell he could be run over.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">\u201cSanchez estimated the speed of the Blazer to be 20 miles per hour, but admitted that at the preliminary hearing he had testified that the vehicle started at 10 miles per hour and was doing 15 when he pulled his arm free. He estimated the entire incident took a minute, his arm was in the vehicle after it was put in drive for 15 seconds, and that the vehicle traveled approximately 50 feet forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">\u201cAfter he broke free, Sanchez saw the vehicle leave the scene. Sanchez never recovered the merchandise from the passenger. The police arrived and Sanchez provided them with a description of the vehicle and the license plate number. The vehicle was registered to [defendant] and his wife. Sanchez\u2019s co-worker, Don Tatum, testified to seeing Sanchez run alongside the truck. He characterized the incident as Sanchez being dragged and \u2018running for his life.\u2019[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] Both Sanchez and Tatum picked out [defendant] from various photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">\u201c[Defendant] testified that he was not in the store on March 17. On that day he had gone with his father to the Sanger cemetery to visit the grave of his grandmother and then went to the father\u2019s house until 3:30 p.m. His father testified similarly. [Defendant] testified that on March 18, he was looking for a Universal Tire store when he met a woman friend, Elizabeth Ornelas. Ornelas offered [defendant] $5 to give her male acquaintance, Dan, a ride to an auto parts store to get a part to fix her vehicle which had broken down. [Defendant] testified he drove to the Grand Auto store but stayed in his vehicle and the passenger Dan went into the store. When Dan returned to the vehicle he was angry with another man. [Defendant] was not aware the man was a store employee. When [defendant] said, \u2018Give it up,\u2019 he was talking to his passenger and meant quit fighting.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">\u201c[Defendant] stated he was afraid and admitted driving one mile an hour in reverse and two-to-three miles an hour in drive. He stated at no time did Sanchez have to run. He admitted that Sanchez had his arm in the passenger side of his vehicle when he put his vehicle in reverse and forward. After he left the parking lot, he told his passenger to get out and returned the gas money to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>\u201c[Defendant] admitted telling the investigating officer that the man outside the vehicle was dressed \u2018like you and me.\u2019 [Defendant] just wanted to leave. He admitted not telling the investigating officer about Ornelas and never mentioned to the officer he had a witness that the police could contact. [Defendant] admitted he told the investigating officer that his passenger had told him to leave since the man outside the vehicle was trying to rob him.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">\u201cElizabeth Ornelas testified that she asked [defendant] to give a man she had recently met a ride to an auto parts store to help buy a part for the disabled vehicle they had been driving. Her trial testimony, that she made this request of [defendant] as he was stopped at a red light, differed from her pretrial statement that this conversation took place in a parking lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The jury was instructed pursuant to CALJIC No. 9.00 (1994 rev.), in pertinent part, that an assault required proof \u201c1. A person willfully committed an act that by its nature would probably and directly result in the application of physical force on another person; and [\u00b6] 2. At the time the act was committed, such person had the present ability to apply physical force to the person of another.\u201d Pursuant to CALJIC No. 9.02, they were told assault by means of force required proof of an assault committed by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. They were further told great bodily injury referred to significant or substantial bodily injury or damage and not to trivial or insignificant injury or moderate harm, and that while actual bodily injury was not a necessary element of the crime, if such bodily injury was inflicted, its nature and extent were to be considered in connection with all the evidence in determining whether the means used and the manner in which it was used were such that they were likely to produce great bodily injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury convicted defendant of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, former subd. (a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">On August 16, 2013, defendant petitioned the trial court for a recall of sentence pursuant to section 1170.126. Defendant represented he was eligible for such relief, in that neither his current conviction nor his prior serious or violent felony convictions (both of which were for first degree burglary) disqualified him. As previously stated, the People opposed the petition on the ground, inter alia, defendant was armed with (and actually used) a deadly weapon during the commission of his current offense and was, therefore, ineligible for resentencing. Defendant countered that the People\u2019s position was supported by neither the law nor the facts of the case. In pertinent part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>he argued the fact that because virtually any object could be used in a harmful way did not mean possession constituted arming or qualified the item as a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">On February 5, 2014, a hearing was held on defendant\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court characterized defendant\u2019s use of the vehicle during the offense as \u201cincidental,\u201d and found defendant \u201cnot ineligible to be resentenced, due to the method in which the motor vehicle was used . . . .\u201d It continued the hearing on the question whether defendant posed an unreasonable risk to public safety if resentenced and likely released.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">On February 21, 2014, the People filed further opposition to defendant\u2019s resentencing, again claiming defendant was ineligible therefor, and arguing he posed an unreasonable danger if released. Specifically, on the eligibility question, the People asserted defendant necessarily was armed with a deadly weapon during the commission of the aggravated assault of which he was convicted, having employed an automobile as the instrumentality of the assault. Defendant filed a response in which he focused on the dangerousness issue. At the March 7, 2014, hearing, the trial court reiterated its finding of eligibility. It further found defendant did not pose an unreasonable risk to public safety, recalled the previously imposed sentence, and resentenced defendant to the upper term of four years, doubled to eight years due to the prior strike offenses, plus two years for the prior prison term enhancements. Defendant was awarded custody credits and ordered to report to parole for placement on postrelease community supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">The People contend the trial court erred in finding defendant eligible for resentencing, because defendant was \u201carmed with a . . . deadly weapon\u201d\u2014to wit, a vehicle\u2014in the commission of the current offense within the meaning of clause (iii).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While we depart somewhat from the People\u2019s line of reasoning, we reach the same conclusion. The record of conviction reflects defendant committed assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. The facts show defendant personally and intentionally used a vehicle in the commission of that assault. When a vehicle is used as a means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, it is a deadly weapon. Defendant was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>therefore, \u201carmed with a . . . deadly weapon\u201d within the meaning of clause (iii). Accordingly, defendant is ineligible for resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">I. <em>Because the trial court made both factual and legal determinations, multiple standards of review apply.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The standard of review applicable to an eligibility determination depends on the nature of the finding or findings a trial court is called upon to make in a given resentencing proceeding. In the present case, the trial court necessarily made both factual and legal determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The eligibility criteria contained in clause (iii) refer to the \u201cfacts attendant to commission of the actual offense . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1322, 1332 [174 Cal.Rptr.3d 499].) In deciding whether a defendant\u2019s current offense falls within those criteria, a trial court \u201cmake[s] a factual determination that is not limited by a review of the particular statutory offenses and enhancements of which [the] petitioner was convicted.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The trial court makes this factual determination based on the evidence found in the record of conviction. <em>(People v.

[Citation.] Thus, [1] \u2018we turn first to the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary meaning.\u2019 [Citation.] [2] The statutory language must also be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme [in light of the electorate\u2019s intent]. [Citation.] [3] When the language is ambiguous, \u2018we refer to other indicia of the voters\u2019 intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018In other words, our \u201ctask is simply to interpret and apply the initiative\u2019s language so as to effectuate the electorate\u2019s intent.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arroyo </em>(2016) 62 Cal.4th 589, 593 [197 Cal.Rptr.3d 122, 364 P.3d 168].)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">II. <em>Defendant used his vehicle as a deadly weapon in commission of the assault.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">At the time defendant committed his current offense, section 245, subdivision (a)(1) prescribed the punishment for \u201c[a]ny person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>It is apparent assault by means of force can be committed without the involvement of any sort of weapon or the intent to cause great bodily injury. Accordingly, it does not automatically disqualify an inmate from resentencing under clause (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Nevertheless, the use of a deadly weapon does not preclude a conviction for assault by means of force. <em>(McGee, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 109 [the defendant convicted of assault by means of force after he stabbed the victim with a knife].)</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">\u201cAs used in section 245, subdivision (a)(1), a \u2018deadly weapon\u2019 is \u2018any object, instrument, or weapon which is used in such a manner as to be capable of producing and likely to produce, death or great bodily injury.\u2019 [Citation.] Some few objects, such as dirks and blackjacks, have been held to be deadly weapons as a matter of law; the ordinary use for which they are designed establishes their character as such. [Citation.] Other objects, while not deadly per se, may be used, under certain circumstances, in a manner likely to produce death or great bodily injury. In determining whether an object not inherently deadly or dangerous is used as such, the trier of fact may consider the nature of the object, the manner in which it is used, and all other facts relevant to the issue. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aguilar </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1023, 1028-1029 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 655, 945 P.2d 1204] <em>(Aguilar).)</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Although a vehicle is not a deadly weapon per se, it can become one, depending on how it is used.

When the jury convicted defendant of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, they necessarily found the force used by defendant in assaulting Sanchez, the victim, was likely to produce great bodily injury. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Armstrong </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1060, 1065-1066 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 839].) The sole means by which defendant applied this force was the vehicle he was driving. Thus, the record of conviction establishes defendant used the vehicle in a manner capable of producing, and likely to produce, at a minimum great bodily injury\u2014i.e., as a deadly weapon. (See <em>McGee, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at pp. 110, 115; cf. <em>People v. Bradford, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1342-1343.) Even under the deferential substantial evidence standard of review, the record of conviction does not support the trial court\u2019s contrary findings that defendant\u2019s use of the vehicle during the offense was merely \u201cincidental,\u201d or that Sanchez was \u201cdragged slightly, though the dragging wasn\u2019t anything more than keeping pace with the car.\u201d The vehicle was the instrumentality by which defendant committed the offense, and whatever speed defendant was driving, Sanchez was dragged and had to run to keep his balance to such an extent that a witness characterized Sanchez as \u201c \u2018running for his life\u2019 \u201d and expressed surprise Sanchez was able to run that fast.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Defendant argues the record of conviction must establish he intended to use the vehicle as a deadly weapon.

There are, first, those instrumentalities which are weapons in the strict sense of the word, and, second, those instrumentalities which are not weapons in the strict sense of the word, but which may be used as such. . . . The instrumentalities falling into the second class, . . . which are not weapons in the strict sense of the word and are not \u201cdangerous or deadly\u201d to others in the ordinary use for which they are designed, may not be said as a matter of law to be \u201cdangerous or deadly weapons.\u201d When it appears, however, that an instrumentality . . . falling within the [second] class is capable of being used in a \u201cdangerous or deadly\u201d manner, and it may be fairly inferred from the evidence that its possessor intended on a particular occasion to use it as a weapon should the circumstances require, we believe that its character as a \u201cdangerous or deadly weapon\u201d may be thus established, at least for the purposes of that occasion.\u2019 (128 Cal.App. at pp. 108-109.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Graham, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at pp. 327-328; see <em>People </em>v. <em>McCoy </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d <em>177, </em>188-189 [153 P.2d 315]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Page, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.4th at p. 1471; <em>People </em>v. <em>Moran </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 724, 730 [109 Cal.Rptr. 287].)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>In <em>D.T., supra, </em>237 Cal.App.4th at page 702, the Court of Appeal explained the foregoing \u201cdoes no more than establish that intent to use an item as a weapon can be sufficient, in some circumstances, to qualify the item as a deadly weapon.

Even assuming such an intent must be shown, however, it is established by the record of conviction in the present case. Sanchez yelled \u201cStop the vehicle\u201d three times as the vehicle was moving in reverse, yet defendant then drove the vehicle forward \u201cat a great speed.\u201d Sanchez only managed to pull his arm free shortly before defendant drove out of the store parking lot onto Blackstone without even stopping at the stop sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">III. <em>Because defendant personally used the vehicle as a deadly weapon in commission of the assault, he was armed with a deadly weapon during the commission of his current offense and so was ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">It has long been the law that \u201c[a] person is \u2018armed\u2019 with a deadly weapon when he simply carries a weapon or has it available for use in either offense or defense.

When the object at issue is a deadly weapon per se, simply carrying the object or having it available for use is sufficient to render a defendant ineligible for resentencing under the Act.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJY\">Concurring.\u2014I concur to express my view concerning the significance of certain facts underlying the conviction below.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The majority opinion cites several cases whereby motor vehicles were deemed dangerous weapons as a result of demonstrably intentional and threatening conduct calculated to place others at risk of injury or with reckless disregard for such peril. Clearly, assault requires an intentional act and actual knowledge of those facts sufficient to establish that the act by its nature will likely and directly result in the application of physical force. In this case, the purpose of the use of the vehicle was arguably not to inflict injury but to provide a means of escape. Indeed, the court\u2019s conclusion at the hearing on the petition for resentencing that the use of the vehicle was \u201cincidental\u201d was presumably based on that understanding. It seems clear that any determination regarding whether the vehicle was employed as a deadly weapon under such circumstances should take into account the element of speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">The evidence indicated that the path of the vehicle\u2019s movement involved a distance of roughly 50 feet. The passenger grabbed victim Sanchez\u2019s left arm and pushed it down, which prevented him from pulling his arm out of the vehicle as it was in motion. As the vehicle was moving in reverse, Sanchez yelled, \u201cStop the vehicle\u201d three times. While the defendant contended that the vehicle moved at the rate of one to three miles per hour during the episode, the victim stated that the vehicle was traveling about 20 miles per hour as he ran alongside. During the preliminary hearing, he had stated that at the time he pulled his arm free, the vehicle was moving at a speed of about 15 miles per hour and that the ordeal lasted one minute. Under the circumstances in which the victim\u2019s arm was apparently held as he ran alongside the moving vehicle, the speed suggested by the victim\u2019s testimony seems questionable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, that fact may have affected the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the victim was \u201cdragged slightly\u201d\u2014in contrast to a coworker\u2019s observation that Sanchez was \u201crunning for his life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Despite any misgivings about the accuracy of lay testimony regarding the speed of the vehicle, the coworker\u2019s observation about the peril presented is certainly relevant in assessing whether the vehicle was operated as a deadly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>weapon. It is also instructive that the jury found appellant guilty of assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury. When coupled with testimony that the passenger held onto Sanchez\u2019s extended arm while the vehicle was in motion, that Sanchez yelled for the driver to stop, that he presumably struggled to be released from the passenger\u2019s hold, and that he was finally able to free himself when Perez put the vehicle in drive after moving in reverse, I am satisfied with the conclusion that the vehicle was employed as a deadly weapon\u2014thus rendering the defendant ineligible for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-10\"> It is noteworthy that the winner of the 100-meter sprint in the 2016 Olympic Games won with a time of 9.81 seconds\u2014a rate of 22.8 miles per hour.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b854-5\">FRANSON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AaI\">Dissenting.\u2014The People appeal the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant Alfredo Perez, Jr.\u2019s petition to recall his sentence, contending Perez was armed with and used a deadly weapon during the commission of an assault. The majority agrees and reverses the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s petition. Based on the trial court\u2019s underlying factual findings and determination, I respectfully dissent and would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">The following summary of facts pertinent to this appeal come from the appellate opinion affirming Perez\u2019s current conviction, which is repeated verbatim in the majority opinion. At trial, Fred Sanchez testified he was working as a sales clerk at Grand Auto in Fresno on March 17, 1994, when Perez and another man (the passenger) entered the store midafternoon. The passenger, with his back to Sanchez, was seen holding a Club, an automobile anti-theft device. Perez spoke briefly to the passenger and then went up to Sanchez and spoke to him about tires. During this conversation, the passenger left the store and went to stand by the passenger side of a Blazer-type vehicle. Perez left the store, went to the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle, and the two drove away. Sanchez suspected the passenger had stolen the Club from the store and that Perez had tried to divert his attention away from the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The following day, Sanchez saw the passenger again enter the store. Sanchez approached the passenger, asked if he needed assistance, and, after alerting other store employees that he needed assistance, followed him out of the rear of the store. While following the passenger, Sanchez heard rustling in the passenger\u2019s clothing, although he had not paid for any items from the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Once out of the store, the passenger entered the passenger side of the same Blazer as the day before. Perez was again driving. Sanchez approached the open passenger window and observed a bulge protruding from the passenger\u2019s clothing. Sanchez told the passenger to give the merchandise back and he could leave. Sanchez then reached into the vehicle and grabbed the package under the passenger\u2019s jacket, which turned out to be an \u201cUltra Club.\u201d Sanchez said, \u201cGive it up.\u201d Perez looked toward Sanchez and said the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Perez then drove the vehicle in reverse while the passenger held onto Sanchez\u2019s arm. Sanchez implored Perez to stop the vehicle as it continued to move in reverse. Sanchez was dragged by the movement of the vehicle and had to run to keep his balance. Perez then put the vehicle in drive and the vehicle moved forward approximately 50 feet, when Sanchez was able to pull his arm free.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sanchez estimated the Blazer was going about 20 miles per hour, although he admitted that at the prelintinary hearing he estimated the vehicle started at 10 miles per hour and was going about 15 miles per hour when he pulled his arm free. Sanchez estimated that the entire incident took about a minute, 15 seconds of that with his arm in the vehicle as it was moving forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">After he broke free, Sanchez saw the vehicle leave. A coworker of Sanchez described Sanchez as \u201crunning for his life\u201d alongside the Blazer.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">A jury convicted Perez of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, former subd. (a)(1))<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and found true the allegations that Perez had sustained two prior strike convictions and suffered two prior prison terms. The trial court sentenced Perez to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life, plus two one-year enhancements for the prison priors.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">\n<em>Resentencing Under Proposition 36</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">The trial court\u2019s consideration of a petition for resentencing under Proposition 36 is a two-step process. First, the court determines whether the petitioner is eligible for resentencing. If the petitioner is eligible, the court proceeds to the second step, and resentences the petitioner under Proposition 36 unless it determines that doing so would pose \u201can unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">At issue here is the first step of the process\u2014the initial eligibility determination. Section 1170.126 grants the trial court the power to ultimately determine whether a third strike offender is eligible for resentencing <em>only </em>if, as an initial matter, the inmate satisfies the criteria set out in subdivision (e) of section 1170.126. Generally, for purposes here, those criteria are: (1) the inmate is serving a life term under the three strikes law for a conviction of a felony or felonies not defined as serious and/or violent under section 1170.126; (2) the inmate\u2019s current sentence was not imposed for an offense in which the defendant used or was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>(3) the inmate has no prior convictions for certain specified offenses. If the inmate does not satisfy each of the criteria, the trial court must deny the request for resentencing. Perez satisfies the first and third requirements. This appeal relates to the second criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">\n<em>Eligibility Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">The eligibility determination required by section 1170.126, subdivision (e) is not a discretionary determination by the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1322, 1336 [174 Cal.Rptr.3d 499].) The Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (\u00a7 1170.126 et seq.) (the Act) provides that \u201cthe court shall determine whether the petitioner satisfies the criteria in subdivision (e). . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (f).) And because the Act fixes ineligibility not on statutory violations or enhancements, but on \u201cfacts attendant to commission of the actual offense, the express statutory language requires the trial court to make a <em>factual determination </em>that is not limited by a review of the particular statutory offenses and enhancements of which petitioner was convicted.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford, supra, </em>at p. 1332, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Instead, \u201cthe trial court must make this <em>factual determination </em>based solely on evidence found in the record of conviction . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1331, italics added.) As stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Oehmigen </em>(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 1 [181 Cal.Rptr.3d 569], \u201c[Eligibility is <em>not </em>a question of fact that requires the resolution of disputed issues. The <em>facts </em>are limited to the record of conviction underlying a defendant\u2019s commitment offense; the statute neither contemplates an evidentiary hearing to establish these facts, nor any other procedure for receiving new evidence beyond the record of conviction. [Citation.] What the trial court decides is a question of law: whether the facts in the record of conviction are the proper subject of consideration, and whether they establish eligibility.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 7, original italics.) As stated recently in <em>People v. Newman </em>(2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 718, 721 [206 Cal.Rptr.3d 427], \u201cIn determining eligibility for Proposition 36 relief, a court is empowered to consider the record of conviction and to <em>make factual findings </em>by a preponderance of the evidence, even if those findings were not made by the jury or the trial court in convicting a defendant of the current offense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Italics added.) Simply put, the trial court takes the facts from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>record of conviction and determines, from its interpretation of those facts, whether a petitioner is eligible for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">\u201c[Disqualifying factors need not be pled and proved to a trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt; hence, a trial court determining whether an inmate is eligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 may examine relevant, reliable, admissible portions of the record of conviction to determine the existence of a disqualifying factor.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Blakely </em>(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1048-1049 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 70].) For this purpose, the record of conviction includes pleadings, trial transcripts, pretrial motions, and any appellate opinion. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Manning </em>(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1140-1141 [172 Cal.Rptr.3d 560]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Osuna </em>(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1027, 1030 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 55]; <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 512 [167 Cal.Rptr.3d 328].) \u201c[A] trial court need only find the existence of a disqualifying factor by a preponderance of the evidence.

Criminal Law (4th ed. 2016 supp.) Punishment, \u00a7 421C, p. 128.)

The court was provided with a copy of this court\u2019s 1996 opinion affirming Perez\u2019s conviction and the People\u2019s summary of the facts from that opinion. The court described its interpretation of the facts of the conviction, as the victim being \u201cdragged slightly, though the dragging wasn\u2019t anything more than keeping pace with the car.\u201d It further described the use of the vehicle as \u201cincidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>The People argued that Perez became armed with the vehicle for purposes of the statute, \u2018\u201c[t]he moment that Mr. Perez chose to use the vehicle as a weapon as a means of his assault.\u201d The trial court stated, in reviewing Perez\u2019s file, that he was never charged with assault with a deadly weapon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The People explained that, at the time Perez committed his crime, \u2018\u201cit would have had very little meaning to file an assault with a deadly weapon.\u201d The trial court acknowledged that it had previously ruled in earlier cases that, \u2018\u201cif there are facts that support use of a deadly weapon, even though they are not charged, and there is not a conviction, the person is still excluded from [resentencing] reconsideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The court then focused on the difference between a defendant who \u2018\u201cused\u201d a firearm or deadly weapon and a defendant who \u2018\u201cwas armed\u201d with a firearm or deadly weapon. The People agreed with the trial court that, when Perez was sitting in his vehicle and the vehicle was not moving, the vehicle was not a weapon. The trial court explained that, had Perez had a knife in a sheath under his shirt at the time, the court would find him ineligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The People continued, arguing that when Sanchez put his arm into the vehicle, Perez had an \u201celection\u201d to make: (1) to leave the vehicle as a vehicle by asking Sanchez to remove his arm from the vehicle, turn off the vehicle and resolve the issue; or (2) to use the vehicle as the mechanism of the assault, which would convert the vehicle into a weapon. According to the People, Perez chose the second option. As argued by the People, Perez was armed with a deadly weapon because \u201cuse\u201d encompasses \u201carmed,\u201d whereas \u201carmed\u201d does not encompass \u201cuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">In response, the trial court read from an order it had issued in earlier resentencing hearings, explaining its understanding of the rationale behind Proposition 36, which stated that it did not think the voters of Proposition 36 \u201cin any way were being told at that point, \u2018if an individual uses something that is not in and of itself a . . . deadly weapon, that they would not be eligible.\u2019 \u201d Following that line of reasoning, the trial court posed a hypothetical, asking the People what their argument would be if the passenger had gotten into the vehicle with the anti-theft device, Sanchez approached the vehicle and said \u201c[d]on\u2019t leave,\u201c Perez grabbed the anti-theft device, threw it at Sanchez and drove away. Under the People\u2019s argument, the trial court reasoned Perez would have converted the anti-theft device, which is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>inherently a deadly weapon, into the use of a deadly weapon, making him ineligible for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The People made the distinction between someone releasing a stolen item and giving it back, and throwing the item and hitting the victim in the skull or attempting to hit the victim with the item. The latter example, argued by the People, \u201cconvert[s] the Club into exactly that, a club, and it was being used then as an instrument for the assault and was a dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">With that, the trial court then issued its ruling, stating: \u2018\u201cOkay. I understand your position. I understand your argument. . . . [I]t is . . . very well-reasoned. ... I think your argument is clear, if you want to take this further, the fact [is] that the Court is going to deny it. I am going to finalize the order. For that purpose, <em>... I am finding that the defendant is not ineligible to be resentenced, due to the method in which the motor vehicle was used in this offense. </em>So I have tried to give you as clear language as I can.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">The trial court reviewed and weighed the facts, including the credibility of the estimated speeds and length of time for the incident<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and determined, based on <em>its review and interpretation </em>of the facts, that the method used by Perez in maneuvering his car to depart the scene did not convert an object otherwise not inherently a deadly weapon, into one. Utilizing this factual determination, Judge Conklin reached the legal conclusion that Perez was not armed with, or used, a deadly weapon and was therefore eligible for resentencing. This determination was not made because of any misunderstanding of Proposition 36. Based on the record, and the trial court\u2019s comments, he clearly understood the mandates of Proposition 36 and properly applied them to the facts, as he interpreted them, to reach his decision. The record supports the trial court\u2019s determination of eligibility, based on the method in which the vehicle was used in the offense Perez was convicted of. The trial court did not, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion (maj. opn. <em>ante, </em>at pp. 825-826, fn. 14), contradict the jury\u2019s verdict. It simply made factual findings that went beyond those made by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>While I agree that an object not inherently deadly may be made deadly by its use and all other factors relevant to the issue, the factual determinations made by the trial court in this case fail to support this legal conclusion. Examples of vehicles used as deadly weapons are cited by the majority in part II. of the Discussion, but are clearly much more egregious than the facts of this case, especially as interpreted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">As a further example, in <em>People v. Claborn </em>(1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 38 [36 Cal.Rptr. 132], a vehicle was found to be a deadly weapon within the meaning of a section 245 assault when the defendant, upset by a family dispute, got into his vehicle and, upon seeing an approaching police car, swerved and aimed his vehicle directly at the officer\u2019s car, causing a head-on collision. The defendant then got out of his vehicle and shouted, \u201c \u2018You son-of-a bitch, I didn\u2019t kill you this way, but I will kill you now,\u2019 \u201d and physically attacked the officer. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Claborn, supra, </em>at p. 41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">In determining whether a defendant is ineligible for resentencing under the Act, a trial court examines the \u201cconduct that occurs during the commission of an offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1333.) Here, the record does not show Perez sped away with Sanchez\u2019s arm trapped in the car; he did not ram him with his vehicle, nor did he aim for him while driving. Instead, the facts contained in the record, as interpreted and cited by the trial court, were that Perez assaulted Sanchez when, while he was in the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle, Sanchez reached into the passenger window in an attempt to retrieve the anti-theft device, the passenger grabbed Sanchez\u2019s arm and Perez then drove the vehicle slowly in reverse, to effect a getaway, while the passenger held onto Sanchez. Sanchez implored Perez to stop the vehicle as it continued to move in reverse. Sanchez was dragged by the movement of the vehicle and had to run to keep his balance. Perez then put the vehicle in drive and the vehicle moved forward. Sanchez was able to pull his arm free. Sanchez received no injuries other than a few scrapes. While Sanchez estimated the Blazer was going between 10 and 20 miles per hour and that the entire incident took about a minute, common sense dictates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Perez\u2019s section 245, former subdivision (a)(1) conviction was based on an assault by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, and does not come within section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23) use of a deadly weapon exclusion making him ineligible for resentencing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 911, 914 [272 Cal.Rptr. 212].) Nor does it come within the \u201carmed with a . . . deadly weapon\u201d exclusions pursuant to section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii) and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C)(iii), as referenced in section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s determination that Perez\u2019s use of the vehicle was not a deadly weapon within the meaning of the use of a deadly weapon exclusions and, thus, he was eligible for a recall of his life sentence and for resentencing under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was granted January 11, 2017, S238354.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-10\"> There is no indication Perez was injured as a result.

Defendant subsequently filed a Proposition 36 petition for recall and resentencing. In denying the petition, the court found the defendant, based on the facts of the case, intended to cause great bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>injury in the commission of the assault, disqualifying him from resentencing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Newman, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.5th at pp. 722-723.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b858-8\"> I note the jury was instructed only on the theory of \u201cby means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.\u201d (CALJIC No. 9.02) I take judicial notice of the record in the appeal of the underlying offense <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez, supra. </em>F023703) and also note that the prosecutor did not argue at trial that the use of the vehicle constituted use of a deadly weapon during the assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b859-9\"> As an aside, I take judicial notice of the fact that the world record for the 100-meter sprint is 9.58 seconds, a rate of 23.35 miles per hour.
