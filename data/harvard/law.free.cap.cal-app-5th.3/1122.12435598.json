Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 261.5, subd. (c)). The court placed him on formal probation and required him to register as a sex offender. Defendant now challenges four of the conditions to his probation: that he (1) not have photographic equipment; (2) not have toys, video games, or similar items that attract children; (3) obtain approval of his residence from his probation officer; and (4) submit to warrantless and suspicionless searches of his computers and recordable media. We conclude defendant forfeited his challenges to the conditions regarding toys and residence approval because he did not object to them in the trial court. His challenges to the remaining probation conditions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-10\">Defendant also contends the trial court erred by requiring him to register as a sex offender \u201cfor life\u201d because he may someday obtain a certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>rehabilitation that relieves him of the duty to continue registering. This argument also lacks merit. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">In April 2014, when defendant was 22 years old, he was placed on summary probation for having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, a 17-year-old girl. While on probation for that offense, defendant met the victim in this case, a 15-year-old girl. They met through a mutual friend, became friends on Facebook, and exchanged text messages. Several of defendant\u2019s text messages were sexually explicit and indicated he wanted to have sex with the victim. Some of the victim\u2019s responses were \u201cOMG,\u201d \u201cLOL,\u201d and that defendant was too old for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">The victim\u2019s parents are divorced and live down the street from each other. On September 14, 2014, the victim told her father she would be staying at her mother\u2019s house that night. Her mother was out of town. The victim and defendant arranged to meet at the mother\u2019s house, but she told him he could not stay too long because it was a school night. Defendant arrived around 8:00 p.m. and they tried to watch a movie in the victim\u2019s bedroom on her cell phone. When they were unable to do so, the victim asked defendant to leave. Defendant said he wanted to cuddle, but the victim asked him to come back another time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">Instead of leaving, defendant grabbed the victim\u2019s breasts; she asked him to stop. Defendant moved his hands toward the victim\u2019s pants; she attempted to push his hands away. Defendant removed the victim\u2019s shirt and fondled her breasts. He reached underneath the victim\u2019s pants and underwear and digitally penetrated her vagina several times; she continued to tell defendant to stop. Defendant removed the victim\u2019s pants and underwear, got on top of her, and penetrated her vagina with his penis. The victim asked defendant to stop and was eventually able to push him off of her. She asked defendant to leave, and he exited her bedroom. The victim believed defendant had left the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">The victim put on her clothes and informed a friend by text message that defendant had just raped her. The friend notified the victim\u2019s father, who notified law enforcement. When the victim left her bedroom, she saw defendant sleeping on the couch. When sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived, they found the victim crying on the driveway and defendant asleep on the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-10\">Deputies woke, arrested, and admonished defendant. He initially denied having any sexual contact with the victim, stating he knew it would be wrong because she was only 15 years old. However, during transport, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>admitted he digitally penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina and had sexual intercourse with her. He denied the victim ever told him \u201cno.\u201d Defendant said he was \u201c \u2018coming down\u2019 \u201d from having smoked methamphetamine before meeting with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">Defendant was charged in a four-count felony complaint with forcible rape (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2)); sexual penetration using force (\u00a7 289, subd. (a)(1)(A)); unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor more than three years younger (\u00a7 261.5, subd. (c)); and penetration by a foreign object (\u00a7 289, subd. (i)). Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to the unlawful sexual intercourse count and the remaining counts were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">The probation officer\u2019s presentencing report assessed defendant as having a moderate to high risk of committing another sexual offense if released on probation, but stated that his chances of success would likely improve if he were \u201cmanaged on formal probation with intensive monitoring and case planning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">The trial court sentenced defendant to 381 days in custody (which was set off by custody credits) and placed him on formal probation for three years. As relevant, the conditions of defendant\u2019s probation provide that he (1) not have photographic equipment; (2) not have toys, video games, or similar items that attract children; (3) obtain approval of his residence from his probation officer; and (4) submit to warrantless and suspicionless searches of his computers and recordable media.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">The court also exercised its discretion to require that defendant register as a sex offender.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court explained that although it understood the Act required that defendant register for life, and that the court thought requiring registration for \u201c10 years or something like that would be appropriate,\u201d the court nonetheless required that defendant register because of how quickly he reoffended after his prior offense. Both the order granting formal probation and the judgment state defendant is to \u201c[rjegister per . . . [Penal Code section] 290.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"apy-dedup-0\">I. <em>Probation Conditions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">A. <em>Applicable Legal Principles and Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">\u201cFollowing a defendant\u2019s conviction of a crime, the sentencing court may choose among a variety of dispositional options. One option is to release the offender on probation. \u2018Probation is generally reserved for convicted criminals whose conditional release into society poses minimal risk to public safety and promotes rehabilitation.\u2019 [Citation.] A grant of probation is \u2018qualitatively different from such traditional forms of punishment as fines or imprisonment. Probation is neither \u201cpunishment\u201d [citation] nor a criminal \u201cjudgment\u201d [citation]. Instead, courts deem probation an act of clemency in lieu of punishment [citation], and its primary purpose is rehabilitative in nature [citation].\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moran </em>(2016) 1 Cal.5th 398, 402 [205 Cal.Rptr.3d 491, 376 P.3d 617] <em>(Moran).) </em>Accordingly, \u201ca grant of probation is an act of grace or clemency, and an offender has no right or privilege to be granted such release.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cStated differently, \u2018[probation is not a right, but a privilege.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">Consequently, a sentencing court may impose conditions to further the rehabilitative and protective purposes of probation. <em>(Moran, supra, </em>1 Cal.5th at pp. 402-403.) Under <em>People v. Lent </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 481 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545] <em>(Lent), </em>\u201c \u2018[a] condition of probation will not be held invalid unless it \u201c(1) has no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted, (2) relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality <em>(People v. Olguin </em>(2008) 45 Cal.4th 375, 379 [87 Cal.Rptr.3d 199, 198 P.3d 1], quoting <em>Lent </em>at p. 486.) \u201cThis test is conjunctive\u2014all three prongs must be satisfied before a reviewing court will invalidate a probation term.\u201d <em>(Olguin, </em>at p. 379; see <em>Moran, </em>at p. 403.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">\u201c \u2018A probation condition that imposes limitations on a person\u2019s constitutional rights must closely tailor those limitations to the purpose of the condition to avoid being invalidated as []constitutionally overbroad.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The essential question in an overbreadth challenge is the closeness of the fit between the legitimate purpose of the restriction and the burden it imposes on the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights\u2014bearing in mind, of course, that perfection in such matters is impossible, and that practical necessity will justify some infringement.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Pirali </em>(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1341, 1346 [159 Cal.Rptr.3d 335].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\">\u201cAs a general rule, failure to challenge a probation condition on constitutional or <em>Lent </em>grounds in the trial court waives the claim on appeal.\u201d <em>(In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number><em>Antonio C. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1033 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 218]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Welch </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 228, 237 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 520, 851 P.2d 802]; <em>In re Sheena K. </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 875, 889 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 716, 153 P.3d 282].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">We generally review the imposition of probation conditions for an abuse of discretion, and constitutional challenges to probation conditions de novo. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Appleton </em>(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 717, 723 [199 Cal.Rptr.3d 637] <em>(Appleton).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">B\u201e C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">D. <em>Search of Computers and Recordable Media</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">Defendant contends the probation condition that requires him to submit his computers and recordable media to suspicionless searches is unconstitutionally overbroad. We disagree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">To support his position, defendant cites the Sixth District Court of Appeal\u2019s recent decision in <em>Appleton, supra, </em>245 Cal.App.4th <em>111. </em>The defendant in that case pleaded guilty to false imprisonment by means of deceit as part of a plea bargain after initially being charged with oral copulation with a minor, whom he had met via a social media smartphone application. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 719-720.) The defendant was placed on probation, one of the conditions of which provided that the defendant\u2019s electronic devices \u201c \u2018shall be subject to forensic analysis search for material prohibited by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 721.) The defendant appealed this condition on <em>Lent </em>and constitutional grounds. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 721-722.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-9\">The Court of Appeal found the electronics search condition did \u201cnot run afoul of the first <em>Lent </em>factor requiring \u2018no relationship to the crime\u2019 \u201d <em>(Appleton, supra, </em>245 Cal.App.4th at p. 724), but concluded the condition was unconstitutionally overbroad <em>(id. </em>at pp. 725-727). The court reasoned the condition \u201cwould allow for searches of vast amounts of personal information unrelated to defendant\u2019s criminal conduct or his potential future criminality\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 727), such as his \u201cmedical records, financial records, personal diaries, and intimate correspondence with family and friends\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 725). In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Appleton </em>court relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>rationale in <em>Riley v. California </em>(2014) 573 U.S. _ [189 L.Ed.2d 430, 134 S.Ct. 2473] <em>(Riley), </em>which held that a warrantless search of a suspect\u2019s cell phone incident to arrest implicated and violated his Fourth Amendment rights. <em>(Riley, </em>at p. _ [134 S.Ct. at p. 2493].) The Supreme Court emphasized the wealth of information contained in modern cell phones. <em>(Id. </em>at p. _ [134 S.Ct. at pp. 2489-2490].) The <em>Appleton </em>court struck the probation condition and remanded for the trial court to fashion one more narrowly tailored. <em>(Appleton, </em>at pp. 728-729.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-10\">More recently, in <em>In re J.E. </em>(2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 795 [205 Cal.Rptr.3d 28], our colleagues in the Court of Appeal for the First District, Division Four, concluded the <em>Riley </em>court\u2019s privacy concerns in the context of a search incident to arrest are inapposite in the context of determining the constitutional reasonableness of probation conditions allowing searches of electronic devices. <em>(In re J.E., </em>at pp. 803-804.) As the <em>In re J.E. </em>court explained, unlike the defendant in <em>Riley </em>\u201cwho at the time of the search had not been convicted of a crime and was still protected by the presumption of innocence,\u201d a probationer does not enjoy \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(In re J.E., </em>at p. 804.) That is, \u201c \u2018Just as other punishments for criminal convictions curtail an offender\u2019s freedoms, a court granting probation may impose reasonable conditions that deprive the offender of some freedoms enjoyed by law-abiding citizens.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Knights </em>(2001) 534 U.S. 112, 119 [151 L.Ed.2d 497, 122 S.Ct. 587].) The court recognized that although electronics may be a \u201c \u2018bottomless pit\u2019 \u201d of personal information, \u201ccourts have historically allowed . . . probation officers significant access to other types of searches, including home searches, where a large amount of personal information\u2014from medical prescriptions, banking information, and mortgage documents to love letters, photographs, or even a private note on the refrigerator\u2014could presumably be found and read.\u201d <em>(In re J.E., </em>at p. 804, fn. 6.) The court noted the absence of evidence in the record indicating the probationer\u2019s electronics contained any of these types of sensitive information. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court further noted that the Supreme Court in <em>Riley </em>clarified that although cell phone data is subject to Fourth Amendment protection, it is not \u201c \u2018immune from search.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re J.E., </em>at p. 804, quoting <em>Riley, supra, </em>573 U.S. at p. _ [134 S.Ct. at p. 2493].) The <em>In re J.E. </em>court thus concluded that although the probationer\u2019s right to privacy was <em>implicated </em>by the electronics search condition, the right was not <em>violated </em>under the circumstances. <em>(In re J.E., </em>at p. 805.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-13\">We find <em>In re J.E. </em>persuasive. As a defendant who has pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted probation in lieu of additional punishment, defendant has a diminished expectation of privacy as compared to law-abiding citizens or those subject to searches incident to arrest. Thus, we conclude the privacy concerns voiced in <em>Riley </em>are inapposite in the context of evaluating the reasonableness of a probation condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>We further conclude the probation condition is suitably tailored in light of the substantial protective and rehabilitative concerns demonstrated by the record. The condition is related to defendant\u2019s crime because he communicated with his victim via social media, sent her sexually explicit text messages, and intended to watch a movie with her on a mobile device on the date of the offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant reoffended with a younger victim within a matter of mere months, while already on probation. His psychological evaluation revealed he is sexually attracted to adolescents and \u201chas some emotional difficulties and anxieties regarding interpersonal relationships that place him at a higher risk for engaging in sexual acts with younger persons.\u201d And the probation officer reported defendant had a moderate to high risk of reoffending if released on probation, and his chances of success would likely improve if he were \u201cintensive[ly] monitor[ed].\u201d Under these circumstances, we conclude the probation condition allowing searches of defendant\u2019s computers and recordable media is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">E. <em>Residence Approval</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">II. <em>Sex Offender Registration</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1154-8\">Huffman, Acting P.
