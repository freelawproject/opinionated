Lieb appeals from an order of the District Court granting the United States an injunction against him for violating Executive Order 11615, and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, which imposed a 90-day stabilization period on prices, rents, wages, and salaries, effective August 15,1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-17\">Defendant Lieb owns the Antonian Apartments, a 104-unit complex comprising four classes of apartments (classes A, B, C, and D) in San Antonio, Texas. Each apartment within a class is identical to the others except for the color scheme. On April 1, 1971, Lieb increased the monthly rentals by $10.00 for all subsequently rented apartments, but did not increase the rent for apartments rented before that date. On July 28, 1971, and again on August 26, 1971, tenants whose rent had not previously been increased, \u201cold tenants,\u201d were informed by letter that their monthly rental rates would be increased $10.00 on September 1, 1971, in order to bring their rents in line with the higher rents charged \u201cnew tenants.\u201d The increase was effective 15 days after commence<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>ment of the stabilization, \u201cwage-price freeze,\u201d period ordered by the President pursuant to the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970. Lieb sought no exemption, exception or adjustment, within the purview of the existing regulations. On August 14, 1971, the day preceding the freeze, Lieb rented more than 10 percent of each class of apartments at the increased rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">After receiving complaints from old tenants about this rent increase, Internal Revenue Agent Russell Johnson met with Lieb, informed him that he was in violation of the Executive Order and the implementing regulations, and sought his voluntary withdrawal of the September 1 rent increases. Lieb refused on the basis of a differing interpretation of limitations imposed on rent increases by the Executive Order and the implementing regulations. Consequently the United States brought this action for injunc-tive relief to prohibit Lieb from increasing the rent for any apartment during the wage-price freeze and to require Lieb to return any increase in rent collected from old tenants during that period. After a full hearing on October 4, 1971, the District Court found for the United States and granted the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">The Economic Stabilization Act of 1970,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as amended as of August 15, 1971, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-7\">\u201c\u00a7 202.

Connally, 337 F.Supp. 737 (D.D.C.1971). Defendant does not question this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-15\">Lieb\u2019s major contention is that Executive Order 11615 permits a landlord to bring rents up to a ceiling established by the highest rent pertaining to a \u201csubstantial volume [10%] of actual transactions\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> during the base period, from July 16, 1971, through August 14, 1971.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This contention is based upon the language of Section 1(a) of the Executive Order and Section 2(c) of ES Reg. 1. If the substantial volume of actual transactions test applies to apartment house rents, the defendant had rented a sufficient percentage of his apartment units at the increased April 1, 1971 rates to establish those rates as a ceiling rent for all the units. However, the government cites Section 3(b) of ES Reg. 1 and paragraphs 601 and 602(1) and (4) of Circular No. 101 as precluding the use of the substantial volume of actual transactions provisions with respect to units with a prior rental history and, instead, basing the rent ceiling for each particular rental unit upon its own rent received for the base period. Lieb contends that OEP lacked the authority to deny the use of the substantial volume of actual transactions provisions in determining a rent ceiling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>and that the provisions cited by the government are invalid as being inconsistent with Executive Order 11615. The flaw in Lieb\u2019s contention is that it ignores the further provisions of Executive Order 11615 delegating \u201cto the Council all of the powers conferred on the President by the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, the Council \u201cmay (i) prescribe definitions for any terms herein, (ii) make exceptions or grant exemptions, (iii) issue regulations and orders, and (iv) take such other action as it determines to be necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Order.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The President has made the broadest delegation of power to the Council, allowing it to use its own discretion as to the best means of achieving the purposes of the Executive Order, which are \u201cto stabilize the economy, reduce inflation, and minimize unemployment [by stabilizing] prices, rents, wages, and salaries.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Council, in turn, delegated the specific powers quoted above to the Director of OEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Sec. 2(c) of ES Reg. 1, which is essentially a rewording of Sec. 1(a) of the Executive Order, is a general statement of the overall policy to stabilize rents. Sec. 3(b) of ES Reg. 1 provides a detailed explanation of this policy. A close reading of these sections reveals that a ceiling rent based upon a substantial volume of transactions during the base period is part of the policy, but is limited to rental units without a prior rent history. Units that have been previously rented may not have their rents increased on the basis of the rental history of other rental units. Obviously, the OEP has not abandoned the general policy announced in Executive Order 11615, but only refined it for implementation, in accordance with its delegated authority. OEP had not only the authority but the duty to \u201ctake such . actions as it determines to be necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Executive Order 11615. The method OEP has selected provides the most accurate measure of the highest rent received during the base period for units with a rental history. In contrast, commodities and services, like units without a prior rental history, whose prices fluctuated during the base period had no price per the same unit available to determine the price level during the base period, and so OEP justifiably stabilized prices on the basis of the highest price per similar unit in a substantial volume of actual transactions. Other justifiable reasons for OEP\u2019s selecting the individual unit rental history basis might include: (1) the prevention of using the rent of one unit as a lever to increase the rent of another unit and (2) the simplification of administration by reducing disputes over comparability of units. Although Sec. 3(b) of ES Reg. 1 and the information contained in Circular No. 101 are narrower than the generalized statement in the Executive Order, they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Executive Order; nor has OEP exceeded its authority in issuing these regulations and circulars. United States v. Intone Corp., 334 F.Supp. 905 (ND.Tex.1971); Huber Investment Corp. v. Connally, 337 F.Supp. 507 (S.D.Ohio 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-8\">In oral argument before this Court, Lieb first advanced the unrealistic contention that the term \u201csame property\u201d used in ES Reg. 1 Sec. 3(b) meant like or identical rather than the same apartment unit. In interpreting the specific wording of the regulation, the Court must place great weight upon an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation. Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 413-414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945). OEP\u2019s interpretation of \u201csame property\u201d is clearly shown in paragraph 602(4) of Circular No. 101: \u201cIf a tenant\u2019s lease expires during the freeze, his rent cannot be raised to the level which is being paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>by new tenants in similar units.\u201d Lieb argues that the information provided in Circular No. 101 should not be used in his case, since Circular 101 was published the day before the United States brought this suit against him in the District Court. However, Circular No. 101 was a compilation of guidelines previously set forth, and this particular guideline had remained unchanged since it was initially issued, on August 23, 1971, in Economic Stabilization Circular No. 1<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (which was subsequently superseded by Circular No. 101). The same information was also provided in Cost of Living Council Question and Answer List No. 5, published August 24, 1971,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and in Cost of Living Council Summary No. 1, dated August 29, 1971.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the official interpretation had been published prior to Lieb\u2019s September 1 rent increase, not just prior to the filing of this suit. Indeed, the record shows that Agent Johnson, in his discussions with Lieb, produced similar illustrations in an effort to obtain the defendant\u2019s voluntary cooperation. There can be no doubt that Lieb had known before the commencement of the suit that the implementing agencies interpreted the regulation to mean that each rental unit stood on its previous rental history. The weakness in Lieb\u2019s interpretation of \u201csame property\u201d is indicated by the late date at which he advances this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">Lieb\u2019s second significant contention is that he was denied due process because he was unable to obtain an administrative hearing upon his claim that ES Reg. 1, Sec. 3(b) exceeded the authority delegated by Executive Order 11615.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">In announcing \u201ca freeze on all prices and wages throughout the United States for a period of 90 days\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in his address to the nation delivered August 15, 1971, the President emphasized that this program was temporary and would not be accompanied by the establishment of a huge price control bureaucracy. If OEP had been required to hold administrative hearings on the advisability of the regulations and interpretations it adopted or planned to adopt, the delays encountered by such hearings would have destroyed the program scheduled to be in effect for only 90 days. Procedures were set up for handling requests for exemptions or exceptions, and Lieb was advised of these procedures. He elected to fprego the administrative procedures available to him. Furthermore, the Economic Stabilization Act, Sec. 205, requires that an application for injunction on the part <em>of </em>Any agency of the Government must be brought in the proper United States District Court, thus assuring that any alleged violator of the Act or Executive Order will be afforded a hearing before his acts or practices may be enjoined. Having obtained a full hearing before the District Court before the injunction was issued, Lieb has been afforded due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-11\">The Supreme Court, in Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S. 78, 92 S.Ct. 254, 30 L.Ed.2d 231 (1971), holds that federal statutes are consistent with the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment if they meet the rational basis test enunciated in Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-12\">\u201cIn the area of economics and social welfare, a State does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect. If the classification has some \u2018reasonable basis,\u2019 it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification \u2018is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u2019 . . . \u2018The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations \u2014 illogical, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>may be, and unscientific.\u2019 \u2018A statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At1\">It is apparent that a reasonable basis exists for the orders and actions of the Executive branch here attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">Defendant also raised the issue that the government\u2019s complaint did not affirmatively allege jurisdiction for failure to state that an agency authorized to bring the action under \u00a7 205 of the Economic Stabilization Act had brought the suit. The action was brought in the name of the United States by the Department of Justice upon the request of OEP.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The United States was the real party in interest, and the District Court had jurisdiction of the case. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345. Indeed, in oral argument to this Court, defendant\u2019s counsel admitted that this point was really a part of his complaint about the overall actions of the administrative agencies in depriving Lieb of the substantial volume of actual transactions test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">Defendant\u2019s last point is that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he violated the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, Executive Order 11615, or ES Reg. 1. It is undisputed that Lieb increased the rents of 58 apartments above the permitted ceiling rent on September 1, 1971. The evidence clearly supports the determination that Lieb violated the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, Executive Order 11615, and ES Reg. 1 promulgated thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">The judgment of the District Court is right, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">.
