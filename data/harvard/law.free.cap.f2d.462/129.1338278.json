We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"Asf\">I</p>\n<p id=\"A2U\">On May 6, 1965, Mrs. Browne obtained an unsecured loan of $3,675 from the San Luis Obispo National Bank (Bank). She signed a promissory note and a document titled \u201cAssignment of Rents and Agreement Not To Sell or Encumber Real Property\u201d covering a lot in San Luis Obispo which she owned. The Bank promptly recorded the document, which is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"acy-dedup-0\">On June 30, 1966, Mrs. Browne filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, listing the Bank as an unsecured creditor in the amount of $3,100 and claiming her property was exempt as a homestead under \u00a7 6 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 24, and California Civil Code \u00a7 1260. The homestead exemption was granted, and in due course Mrs. Browne was discharged from all debts and claims provable against her bankruptcy estate. The discharge included the $3,100 debt to the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Nearly two years after Mrs. Browne\u2019s discharge, the Bank brought suit in the California Superior Court to foreclose the equitable mortgage it claimed to hold on her property. The complaint alleged that as security and in consideration of the loan, Mrs. Browne had executed the assignment of rents and agreement not to encumber. Since she had failed to make the required payment under the promissory note, the Bank asked the court to declare Mrs. Browne\u2019s property subject to foreclosure as an equitable mortgage for the amount of the unpaid debt plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Mrs. Browne pleaded her bankruptcy discharge as a defense. The California Court nevertheless entered summary judgment for the Bank, and ordered the sheriff to sell her property, and awarded the Bank an attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Instead of appealing this state ruling, Mrs. Browne returned to the bankruptcy court and sought an injunction against the sheriff\u2019s sale. The referee held that he had jurisdiction to hear her petition, but that he was bound by the state court determination that her discharge had no effect upon the equitable lien the Bank held on her homestead. He therefore refused to enjoin the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The district court agreed that the referee had jurisdiction, but held that the state court determination, while correct, was not binding. It independently determined that the Bank had a valid lien against Mrs. Browne\u2019s property which had not been affected by her bankruptcy discharge. It also refused to enjoin the sale, although it disallowed the attorney's fees. Both parties appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The property in question is homestead property, the nature, existence, and extent of which is determined by state law, usually in the state courts. It has been settled since Lockwood v. Exchange Bank, 190 U.S. 294, 23 S.Ct. 751, 47 L.Ed. 1061 (1903), that the bankruptcy court has no jurisdiction over homestead property once it has declared the property exempt from creditors. Since the title to homestead property remains in the bankrupt and does not pass to his trustee, the property is not part of the bankruptcy estate and cannot be administered by the bankruptcy court. <em>Lockwood, supra, </em>at 299-300, 23 S.Ct. 751. Once the bankruptcy court has determined that property is exempt, it has exhausted its jurisdiction. In re Yungbluth, 220 F. 110 (9th Cir. 1915). See 1A Collier\u2019s on Bankruptcy, pp. 809-815. Thus, the bankruptcy court would ordinarily lack jurisdiction to determine the validity of the Bank\u2019s alleged lien on Mrs. Browne\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">However, Mrs. Browne\u2019s property is not totally exempt as a homestead. She listed the property\u2019s value at $25,-000; but as the head of a family, she may claim a homestead exemption not exceeding $20,000. California Civil Code \u00a7 1260(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The excess formed part of her bankruptcy estate and was not exempt. <em>Lockwood </em>does not oust the bankruptcy court from jurisdiction to determine the validity of a lien against this excess portion of Mrs. Browne\u2019s estate. Cf. In re Moore, 288 F.Supp. 887, 888 (C.D., Cal., 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">Under Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U.S. 234, 54 S.Ct. 695, 78 L.Ed. 1230 (1934), the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to hear what is essentially an ancillary and supplemental bill in equity to enforce a discharge granted to a bankrupt. However, the Supreme Court cautioned that this ancillary jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>should be limited to \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d; where the legal remedy afforded by state adjudication \u201cwould be inadequate to meet the requirements of justice,\u201d the bankruptcy court could and should exercise its ancillary jurisdiction. <em>Local Loan, supra, </em>at 241, 54 S.Ct. at 698. See 1 Collier\u2019s pp. 341-348 and 1A Collier\u2019s pp. 1728-1731.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The essence of the present controversy is the interpretation and effect of the discharge order. The Bank has no lien against Mrs. Browne\u2019s property, as is discussed in III below. Even if the Assignment and Agreement created a lien, Mrs. Browne has not breached the terms of either the agreement assigning her rents or the agreement not to encumber or convey her land. She does not rent the property. She has not sold it, and her homestead declaration is not an encumbrance. Tahoe National Bank v. Phillips, 4 Cal.3d 11, 21, n. 14, 92 Cal. Rptr. 704, 710, n. 14, 480 P.2d 320, 328, n. 14 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\"> Thus, the Bank\u2019s sole cause of action stems from the promissory note, which was listed on Mrs. Browne\u2019s schedule of debts. The bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to ensure that the discharge it granted to Mrs. Browne is not circumvented. <em>See, e. g., Local Loan, supra; </em>Beneficial Finance Company of Oklahoma v. Sidwell, 382 F.2d 275 (10th Cir. 1967). The requirements of justice require the exercise of jurisdiction in this case. Mrs. Browne\u2019s state remedy is inadequate. Major clarifications in the California law have rendered the state decision clearly erroneous. The cases discussed in part III below indicate that the Bank could not have a valid encumbrance which would allow it to comply with California Civil Code \u00a7 1241, which places restrictions upon forced sales of homestead properties. Finally, the Bank, a listed bankruptcy creditor, did not appear in the bankruptcy proceedings, but sat on its \u201clien\u201d for two years after the discharge before seeking to enforce it. Cf. In re Cleapor, 16 F.Supp. 481 (N.D., Ga., 1936). The integrity of the homestead law and the bankruptcy discharge require the bankruptcy court to assume jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">The Bank asserts that the document Mrs. Browne signed simultaneously with her promissory note created an equitable lien on her property. However, under California law the Bank has no interest whatsoever in any part of Mrs. Browne\u2019s property. In Tahoe National Bank v. Phillips, 4 Cal.3d 11, 92 Cal. Rptr. 704, 480 P.2d 320 (1971), the court held that an \u201cAssignment of Rents and Agreement Not to Sell or Encumber Real Property,\u201d which was in all material respects identical to the document Mrs. Browne signed, was not reasonably susceptible to the construction that it created a lien in the property identified. In <em>Tahoe, </em>as here, the document was executed simultaneously with a loan which the bank later sought to collect. The document was recorded. The property in question was homesteaded. The <em>Tcohoe </em>document, like the document here, contained no hint of any power of foreclosure. None of the covenants purported to create a lien; its language was inconsistent with that interpretation. Given <em>Tahoe </em>and the lack of any evidence that Mrs. Browne intended to create a security interest,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> there can be no doubt that the Bank never obtained any mortgage or lien, equitable or otherwise, upon Mrs. Browne\u2019s property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Without a lien the Bank must rest its claim upon the promissory note. This note and the debt it represented were discharged. Since the discharge released Mrs. Browne\u2019s personal liability, and no valid lien exists on her property, the sheriff\u2019s sale must be enjoined. It follows that the Bank is not entitled to the attorney\u2019s fees it obtained from the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A3R\">.

While factually correct, we cannot accept the Bank\u2019s legal conclusion. First, in the seventy years since it was decided, <em>Lockwood </em>has been severely criticized as \u201cthe result of overly technical construction of section 6 and . . . not in accord with the general philosophy of the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d 1A Collier\u2019s |[ 6.05, p. 815. Second, the fundamental question involved here is not the effect of the homestead exemption but rather the effect of Mrs. Browne\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy. Compare Sims v. Jamison, 67 F.2d 409 (9th Cir. 1933). <em>Local Loan </em>and not <em>Lockwood </em>controls this case. Whether or not Mrs. Browne\u2019s property is totally exempt as a homestead, the bankruptcy court has ancillary jurisdiction to prevent the Bank from circumventing its decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
