The decision and order are reported at 189 NLRB No. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-14\">We are convinced that the record as a whole does not support the Board\u2019s findings that respondent\u2019s conduct, through unreasonable delay and proscrastination in negotiations, or otherwise, was viola-tive of the Act prior to November 21, 1969, and that the Board further erred in not finding that the parties reached a legally cognizable impasse on that date. However the record amply supports the Board finding and its decision that respondent did thereafter violate Section 8(a) (5) of the Act by unilaterally threatening its employees and urging them to abandon the Union. We agree, therefore, with the result suggested by Chairman Miller in his special concurrence and the revision of the Board order accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-20\">As so revised, the order of the Board will be</p>\n<p id=\"Ax0\">Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
