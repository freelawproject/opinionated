We have carefully reviewed the record, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), and have found unquestionably that there was sufficient evidence upon which the jury could convict appellant Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-27\">Appellant\u2019s second point of error is that the district court erred in its in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>structions to the jury on the elements necessary to convict Cooper on counts 1 and 2 of the indictment. The court\u2019s charge on the essential elements of count 2 was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-5\">\u201cYou would have to find first that on or about October 20, 1971, at Orlando, Florida, the defendant did aid, abet, counsel, command, induce, or procure the taking from the person or presence of Susan Smith $5,030 i?i money belonging to and in the care, custody, control, management or possession of the College Park First National Bank, Orlando, Florida.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-6\">\u201cSecondly, you would have to find that if such taking took place of such money from the person or presence of Susan Smith was done by force or violence or by intimidation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-7\">\u201cThirdly, you would have to find that if the taking of the money from the person or presence of Susan Smith that the defendant did aid, abet, counsel, command, induce or procure the assaulting of Susan Smith as I shall define that term \u2018assault\u2019 for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-8\">\u201cFourthly, you would have to find that the defendant in so doing acted wilfully, unlawfully and with felonious intent as I shall define those terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-9\">\u201cFifthly, you would have to find that at such time, that on October 2b, 1971, the deposits of the College Park First National Bank was then insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-10\">Then the court later instructed on the term \u201cassault\u201d:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant contends that there is no mention in the charge that a deadly weapon is a necessary element to the obtaining of a conviction under count 2 of the indictment. Testimony at the trial indicated that a bomb used in the robbery was really a simulated one incapable of deadly destruction. Section 2113(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-13\">\u201c(d) Whoever, in committing, or in attempting to commit, any offense defined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, assaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty-five years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-14\">The question raised herein has created disagreement among various circuits. The Sixth Circuit, in United States v. Beasley, 438 F.2d 1279 (6th Cir., 1971), holds that in the statute the words \u201cassaults any person\u201d and \u201cputs in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device\u201d should be construed disjunctively and thus that it is unnecessary for the robber to possess an actual ability to inflict harm. The court therefore affirmed a conviction where a simulated bomb was used. The Eighth Circuit in Bradley v. United States, 447 F.2d 264 (8th Cir., 1971), took a contrary view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-15\">We are bound, however, by prior decisions of our own circuit. In Baker v. United States, 412 F.2d 1069 (5th Cir., 1969), we held that a gun used in connection with a bank robbery was a dangerous weapon and that it was not necessary to prove the gun was loaded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-16\">\u201cA gun is commonly known, regarded and treated by society as a dangerous device by both the reasonable man and the person at whom it is pointed, without pause to determine whether a round is in the chamber. The primary capacity of a gun to harm \u2014 by the discharge of a bullet from the muzzle \u2014 plus its apparent capacity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>carry out that harm, combined with a highly charged atmosphere and the possibility of action by employees or others to prevent the robbery, is a complex of circumstances in which the person on the scene is in jeopardy of harm which may occur in any one of various ways.\u201d 412 F.2d at 1071-1072.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">We thus hold that here the simulated bomb is much like an unloaded gun, and whether or not the statute is read disjunctively the \u201cbomb\u201d is a dangerous weapon which clearly puts life in jeopardy and may be the basis for an assault. See Thomas v. United States, 418 F.2d 567 (5th Cir., 1969). The district court, therefore, did not commit reversible error in its charge on the element of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-6\">Finding no merit in any other contentions raised by appellant, we affirm the conviction and the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"am9-dedup-0\">. This was the second count of a two count indictment. The first count charged a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1406-11\">. \u201cNow, assault is defined as any willful attempt or threat to inflict injury on the person of another, when coupled with an apparent present ability to do so, or any intentional display of force such as would give the victim reason to fear or expect immediate bodily harm, ^ constitutes an assault. An assault may be committed without actually touching, or striking, or doing bodily linrm to the person of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-18\">\u201cSo a person who has the apparent present ability to inflict bodily harm or injury upon another person and wil-fully attempts or even threatens to in-fict such bodily harm, may be found to have assaulted such person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
