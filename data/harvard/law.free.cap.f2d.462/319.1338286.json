Y., against the M. V. Farland, her owner A/S Vigra, and her time charterer, Seaboard Shipping Co., Ltd. (Seaboard), for damage to 142 coils of steel, part of a shipment from Wakayama, Japan, to New Haven, Connecticut, in December, 1964. The ship and her owner, contesting liability to Nichimen, sought indemnity from the charterer if liability should be imposed. Judge Bonsai awarded the consignee damages of $75,353.66 with interest against the charterer and the owner and directed the charterer to indemnify the owner for any sums paid by the latter, to pay the owner $3,664.70 with interest for charter hire wrongfully withheld, and to pay the owner\u2019s reasonable legal fees of $10,750 incurred in resisting Nichi-men\u2019s claim. Although we consider some of the issues more difficult than did the district judge and reach our results by different reasoning, we affirm the conclusions with respect to liability, and also with respect to indemnity and payment of the withheld charter hire. However, we hold that the defendants were entitled to the $500 per package limitation of \u00a7 4(5) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), and direct that the judgment be reduced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">With three small exceptions, which will be covered in the course of this opinion, it would be an exercise in futility to endeavor to improve on Judge Bonsai\u2019s statement of the facts, 333 F. Supp. 691, 693-696 (1971). Accordingly, we quote it <em>in extenso:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Plaintiff, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nichimen Co., Ltd., purchased 280 coils of steel from Nichimen Co., Ltd. (of Tokyo, Japan) by invoice dated December 15, 1964 and irrevocable letter of credit payable on presentation of clean on board bills of lading.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">On August 8, 1963, Vigra, as owner of the FARLAND, had entered into a time charter with Seaboard as charterer. Clause 8 of that time charter provided: \u201c8. . . . The Captain (although appointed by the Owners), shall be under the orders and directions of the Charterers as regards employment and agency; and Charterers are to load, stow, and trim the cargo at their expense under the supervision of the Captain, who is to sign Bills of Lading for cargo as presented, in conformity with Mate\u2019s or Tally Clerk\u2019s receipts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">On December 7, 1964, a \u201cFreight Contract\u201d was entered into between Seaboard as \u201cTime-chartered Owners\u201d and plaintiff as \u201cCharterers\u201d whereby Seaboard agreed to supply a minimum of two holds of the FARLAND for the transportation of plaintiff\u2019s steel coils from Wakayama, Japan to New Haven, Connecticut. The rate of freight was \u201c$9.00 (nine dollars) U. S. Currency per long ton F.I.O. fully prepaid in New York on telegraphic advice of completion of loading and signing Bills of Lading.\u201d The \u201cFreight Contract\u201d provided further that:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">\u201cThe carrier does not assume the care, custody, control or safety of, and shall not be liable for the cargo until after it is loaded on board the vessel, nor for demurrage, storage or any other charges that may accrue against shipment while awaiting delivery to vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>* -X- * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u201cSubject to provisions of carrier\u2019s bill of lading form currently in use in connection with shipments to destination named above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The coils consigned to plaintiff were loaded on board the FARLAND, a six hold self-trimming bulk carrier, at Wakayama, Japan, on December 14-15, 1964. The FARLAND had no \u2019tween deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The coils, which weighed from 3-9 tons each, were strapped by l<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>//' x <em>Vie\" </em>steel bands \u2014 two around the circumference and five passing through the eye at equal intervals. This is the usual manner of strapping steel coils, and the strapping was sufficient for this type of cargo. Edge protectors consisting of steel strips were also used.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">While plaintiff paid the cost of loading the coils on board the FARLAND under the \u201cFreight Contract,\u201d the coils were stowed and lashed under the supervision of a \u201cspecialist\u201d who was hired by Aall &amp; Co., Ltd. (\u201cAall &amp; Co.\u201d), Seaboard\u2019s port agent at Wakayama. One hundred forty-two coils were stowed in Hold No. 2 from the after bulkhead and forward in six rows, two tiers high. The forward row was not fully stowed, however, as there was an opening at the center which was shored off with heavy lumber. One hundred thirty-eight coils were stowed in Hold No. 4 from the after bulkhead and forward in three rows, three tiers high. In both Holds Nos. 2 and 4, the coils were stacked up at the after end and the remainder of the hold was left empty. All of the coils were stowed on the round with their ends facing fore and aft and were lashed with wire, turnbuckles and open turnbuckle hooks. The lashings were secured to pad eyes welded to the side bulkheads in Hold No. 2 and to pad eyes welded to the after bulkhead in Hold No. 4. According to the master of the FARLAND, \u201cvery little\u201d wood was used, but some wood, in dimensions of 1 x 2, 2 x 4, 2 x 5, and 1x6, was used between some of the coils as dunnage to prevent them from shifting. The wire, turnbuckles, hooks, pad eyes, and wood were provided by Aall &amp; Co., Seaboard\u2019s agent. The master testified in his deposition that Seaboard\u2019s \u201cspecialist\u201d directed that the coils be stacked at the after end of Holds Nos. 2 and 4 because the FARLAND was scheduled to stop at Vancouver, British Columbia, en route to New Haven to load Seaboard\u2019s lumber in all six holds and Seaboard desired as much space as possible in the bottom of Holds Nos. 2 and 4 to operate fork lifts when loading the lumber.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Nippon, Kaiji, Kentei, Kyokai, general marine surveyors, attended aboard the FARLAND on December 14-15, 1964, at the request of the shipper, Nichi-men Co., Ltd., and reported on December 21, 1964 that the stowage of the cargo was proper and done in the best possible way to ensure safe transportation and delivery. In a deposition, the master of the FARLAND expressed his opinion that the coils had been properly stowed and lathed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">Upon completion of the loading on December 15, 1964, a bill of lading on Aall &amp; Co.\u2019s form was issued with respect to the 280 steel coils consigned to plaintiff. The bill of lading was signed by Aall &amp; Co. \u201cFor and on behalf of the Master\u201d, and stated that the coils were shipped \u201cin apparent good order and condition\u201d by Nichimen Co., Ltd. on board the FARLAND for carriage from Waka-yama to New Haven. The master testified that he did not see the bill of lading but that the usual practice was for Seaboard, or its agent, to sign the bills of lading on his behalf. The bill of lading was endorsed on the face as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">\u201cFreight payable as per the terms and conditions of the Charter Party and/or the freight engagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">\u201cAll the terms and conditions of the governing Charter Party and/or the Freight Engagement are herewith incorporated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">The Chief Mate signed a mate\u2019s receipt for the 280 coils.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">The FARLAND sailed from Waka-yama on December 15, 1964 for Van<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>couver with approximately 2,000 metric tons of cargo aboard out of her carrying capacity of 16,220 metric tons. On the 18th of December, the FARLAND encountered a storm. According to the vessel\u2019s rough log, the winds increased during the day and by 2200 on the 18th, the winds had reached force 8 on the Beauford Scale (34-40 knots). The log entry for 2400 on the 18th states, \u201cShip is working heavily in the sea. Hull is shaking in trembling. Some water shipped.\u201d The log indicates that at 0120 on the 19th, the wind direction was east at force 10 (48-55 knots) and that the vessel\u2019s speed had been reduced; she was \u201clying on weather, pitching and some rolling.\u201d At 0500 on the 19th, the wind was E-NE and had reached force 11 (56-63 knots) and the vessel was \u201cLying in weather with steerage. Rolling and violent pitching.\u201d There follows an entry in the log which indicates that at 0815 on the 19th it was discovered that part of the cargo had shifted in Hold No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The master testified that at 0815 on the 19th \u201cthe whole cargo was shifted from the after end of the number 2 hold and spread all over the hold in one wave.\u201d He testified that this one wave, the height of which he estimated at 60 feet, lifted the FARLAND up, broke over her and dropped her \u201cjust like she fell off a rock.\u201d His inspection of the coils in Hold No. 2 shortly after 0815 on the 19th revealed that the lashings were broken. The master testified that the crew of the FARLAND had tightened the turnbuckles on the lashings in Hold No. 2 every day prior to the 19th.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">At 1030 on the 19th, the following radio-telegram was transmitted by the FARLAND to Seaboard in Vancouver: \u201cCARGO IN NO TWO HOLD SHIFTED AND DAMAGED STOP AT THIS POINT NO DAMAGE TO THE SHIP SECURING OF SHIFTED CARGO IMPOSSIBLE STOP HOVED TO STOP WIND.FORCE 11 VERY ROUGH SEA</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">MASTER\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">There is no reference to a 60-foot wave in either the log or in the radio-telegram sent approximately two hours after the time the log indicates that the coils had shifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">The FARLAND proceeded to Vancouver, arriving at the pier at 1900 on December 30. On arrival, the coils in Hold No. 2 were examined by Thomas W. Morgan, a marine surveyor, at the request of Seaboard, Vigra, and the cargo underwriters. Morgan\u2019s initial inspection revealed that approximately one-third of the steel coils had opened up to such an extent that the whole area of the lower hold was covered with unwound coils. The FARLAND was scheduled to load Seaboard\u2019s lumber in all six holds in Vancouver, and since Morgan determined that it was not practical to floor off the cargo in Hold No. 2 in its damaged and scattered condition, it was decided to cut some of the damaged steel and remove it to a scow placed alongside the vessel. Thereafter, part of the packaged lumber cargo was placed in Hold No. 2, the cut sections of steel coils were replaced in Hold No. 2, and all six holds of the FARLAND were filled with lumber. Morgan was of the opinion that this procedure was \u201cthe only practical method of tackling this situation.\u201d Seaboard paid all costs of cutting and re-stowing the steel sections in Vancouver.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The stowage of the lumber cargo was completed on January 15, 1965. It was snowing and raining throughout the loading operation, and the lumber stowed in Hold No. 2 with plaintiff\u2019s steel coils was soaking wet.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">On January 18, the FARLAND proceeded to Boston and Providence to discharge Seaboard\u2019s lumber. Due to a longshoremen\u2019s strike, the FARLAND did not arrive in New Haven until March I, 1965. On March 2, 1965, after the remaining lumber cargo had been discharged from the FARLAND, Captain Axel- Jelstrup, a marine surveyor representing the cargo underwriters, Captain J. Stave, a marine surveyor representing Vigra,- and George N. Axiotes, a marine surveyor representing Seaboard, inspected the steel coils in Holds Nos. 2 and 4. Their inspection of the coils in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Hold No. 4 revealed that the steel strapping had parted on three of the coils, which were partially unwound, but that there had been no apparent shifting of the cargo in that hold. Their inspection of the coils in Hold No. 2 revealed that some of the coils, originally stowed against the after bulkhead, were lying against the forward bulkhead. The coils, and loose sections of steel, were occupying the entire tank top area. Bands had broken on several coils, and the coils sprung or partly unwound. In some instances, the coils had telescoped causing considerable distortion of them. Excessive rust was present on all of the coils in Hold No. 2 which was attributable to moisture given off by the lumber which Seaboard loaded at Vancouver.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Plaintiff had arranged to sell 219 of the coils to The Eastern Steel &amp; Metal Co., West Haven, Conn., for $182,632.-80, and the remaining 61 coils to Bowring Company, New York, New York for $48,-644.93. On March 4, 1965, the day after the discharge of the FARLAND was completed, Captain Jelstrup examined the coils on the property of the New Haven Terminals, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Representatives from plaintiff and the Eastern Steel &amp; Metal Co., plaintiff\u2019s principal customer, were present. The other surveyors did not attend although they had been advised of the re-examination. Eastern\u2019s representative indicated that he would accept the cargo discharged out of Hold No. 4 as sound. Captain Jel-strup testified that following considerable negotiations with Eastern\u2019s representative concerning the coils discharged from Hold No.' 2, an agreemnt was reached on the following values of the coils:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u201c40% of 142 coils reduced to scrap value of $20.00 per metric ton.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">20% of 142 coils with agreed value of</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">$30.00 per metric ton.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">30% of 142 coils with agreed value of $40.00 per metric ton. 10% of 142 coils with agreed value of $60.00 per metric ton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">Captain Jelstrup was of the opinion that he made \u201ca rather good minimization of the loss.\u201d Surveyor Axiotes, who represented Seaboard at the initial inspection of the coils in Hold No. 2 on March 2, stated in his survey report that while he was not a party to the negotiations, \u201cconsidering all the factors ... it appears that the [depreciation] allowances are not unduly high.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">The resulting loss was $85,180.57.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">\n<em>Nichimen\u2019s Recovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"a-k-dedup-0\">The most basic controversy concerns the legal standard governing the liability of Seaboard and Vigra. Niehimen asserts, and the judge held, that the liability of Seaboard and Vigra was governed by COGSA, with the consequences that Nichimen established a prima facie case by proving receipt of the coils in good order and delivery in damaged condition; that the defendants then had the burden of establishing either that the damage was not due to their negligence, \u00a7 4(2) (q), or that it was the result of one of the \u201cexcepted causes\u201d in \u00a7 4(2), if they were to escape liability; and that this was not met. Seaboard asserts that COGSA is not applicable in this case, since the Farland was engaged in private carriage; that as a result it and Vigra were liable simply as bailees; and that with respect to the question of negligence Nichimen did not bear the burden of persuasion which it would then have throughout, see, e. <em>g., </em>Commercial Molasses Corp. v. New York Tank Barge Corp., 314 U.S. 104, 110-111, 62 S.Ct. 156, 86 L.Ed. 89 (1941); Kohlsaat v. Parkersburg &amp; Marietta Sand Co., 266 F. 283, 284-285 (4 Cir. 1920). Although we are by no means certain that acceptance of Seaboard\u2019s contention that it and Vigra were simply bailees would call for a reversal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court was correct in holding COGSA to be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Treating the applicability of COGSA as depending on whether the Farland was engaging in public or private carriage, the judge held she was engaged in the former \u2014 even on the Pacific crossing when she was carrying only Nichimen\u2019s coils \u2014 because the vessel was scheduled to take on at Vancouver lumber owned by Seaboard Lumber Sales Co., Ltd., an affiliate of the time-charterer. If the applicability of COGSA turned exclusively on whether Seaboard could properly have been found to have held out the Farland as a common carrier, we should have the gravest doubts that the evidence warranted such a conclusion. In a different yet highly relevant context, the Interstate Commerce Commission said long ago, Craig Contract Carrier Application, 31 M.C.C. 705, 708 (1941) <em>:</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiJ\">Both in its original conception, and consistently since, the essential attribute distinguishing common carriage from private (contract) carriage has been the presence, or lack, of an offer of holding out to serve the public generally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The Commission went on to say that the common element or characteristic negating a public offer was <em>\u201cspecialization, </em>either in the nature of the physical operation, or in respect of the shippers served. . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711 (emphasis in original). In United States v. Contract Steel Carriers, Inc., 350 U.S. 409, 76 S.Ct. 461, 100 L.Ed. 482 (1956), the Supreme Court, while giving qualified approval to the <em>Craig </em>requirement of a showing of \u201cspecialization\u201d to negate common carriage, reversed the Commission for finding common carriage with respect to a \u201cspecialized\u201d carrier which had served 69 shippers in three years. Here there was no evidence of a general holding out of the Farland and much of specialization. The mere addition of one or even two or three other large shipments would be an insufficient predicate for a determination of common carriage \u2014 if that were the decisive factor in resolving the applicability of COGSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">The private-public carriage distinction was introduced into the area of liability for loss of cargo when this was governed by non-statutory maritime law. At one time, the public carrier of goods by sea was \u201cabsolutely responsible for their safe arrival, unless loss or damage was caused by the Act of God or of the public enemy, or the inherent vice of the goods or the fault of the <em>shipper </em>\u2014 and (even where the loss was caused by one of these) the carrier was not negligent or otherwise at fault.\u201d Gilmore &amp; Black, The Law of Admiralty \u00a7 3-22, at 119 (1957) (footnote omitted). See also Liverpool &amp; Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Insurance Co., 129 U.S. 397, 437, 9 S.Ct. 469, 32 L.Ed. 788 (1889). In contrast, the private carrier has traditionally been liable, as a bailee for hire, only for the negligent loss or injury of cargo, see Commercial Molasses Corp. v. New York Tank Barge Corp., <em>supra, </em>314 U.S. at 108-109, 62 S.Ct. 156, and cases cited therein; Sumner v. Cas-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>well, 20 F. 249, 261 (S.D.N.Y.1884), and this is subject to any agreements made by the parties, see, e. g., The Fri, 154 F. 333 (2 Cir. 1907), cert. denied, 210 U.S. 431, 28 S.Ct. 761, 52 L.Ed. 1135 (1908); The Elizabeth Edwards, 27 F.2d 747 (2 Cir. 1928); Koppers Connecticut Coke Co. v. James McWilliams Blue Line, Inc., 89 F.2d 865, 866 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 302 U.S. 706, 58 S.Ct. 25, 82 L.Ed. 545 (1937); Knauth, The American Law of Ocean Bills of Lading 177-78 (4th ed. 1953). With the introduction of bills of lading as documents of title, public carriers increasingly used these as a means of contractually expanding upon the narrow set of common law \u201cexceptions\u201d to their other wise absolute liability. See Gilmore &amp; Black, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3-22, at 119-20. Ultimately, this process threatened to turn the general maritime law on its head, with English courts and some state courts \u2014 though not the courts of the United States \u2014 honoring even bill of lading provisions excepting public carriers from liability for loss due to their own negligence and that of their employees, see Knott v. Botany Worsted Mills, 179 U.S. 69, 71, 21 S.Ct. 30, 45 L.Ed. 90 (1900), Gilmore &amp; Black, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3-22, at 121-22. It was in response to these developments, see The Delaware, 161 U.S. 459, 471-473, 16 S.Ct. 516, 40 L.Ed. 771 (1896), that the Harter Act was enacted in 1893 to protect those shipping cargo \u201cfrom or between ports of the United States and foreign ports\u201d against insertion \u201cin any bill of lading or shipping document\u201d of any provisions either relieving the vessel or its owners \u201cfrom liability for loss or damage arising from negligence, fault, or failure in proper loading, stowage, custody, care, or proper delivery\u201d of the cargo, \u00a7 1, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 190, or lessening or abrogating their \u201cobligations ... to exercise due diligence [sic] properly equip, man, provision, and outfit\u201d the vessel, \u201cand to make [it] seaworthy . . . .\u201d, \u00a7 2, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 191. Primary responsibility for the perpetuation of the old public-private carriage distinction under the new statutory regime seems to rest on an early decision of this court which held, properly enough, that a charter party was not governed by \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Harter Act because a \u201ccharter\u201d is neither a \u201cbill of lading\u201d nor a \u201cshipping document\u201d within the meaning of those sections but, in so doing, reasoned that \u201csections [1 and 2] manifestly refer to common carriers . . . .\u201d, The G. <em>R. </em>Crowe, 2 Cir., 294 F. 506, 508, cert. denied, 264 U.S. 586, 44 S.Ct. 335, 68 L.Ed. 862 (1923).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See generally Knauth, supra, at 176-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The enacting clause of COGSA, adopted in 1936, provides that it shall regulate rights and liabilities under <em>\u201c[e]very bill of lading </em>or <em>similar document of title </em>which is evidence of a contract for the carriage of goods by sea to or from ports of the United States, in foreign trade . .\u201d (emphasis added), and \u00a7 1 (b) of COGSA defines \u201ccontract of carriage\u201d as applying \u201conly to contracts of carriage covered by a bill of lading or any similar document of title, insofar as such document relates to the carriage of goods by sea, including any bill of lading or similar document of title as aforesaid issued under or pursuant to a charter party from the moment at which such bill of lading or similar document of title regulates the relations between a carrier and a holder of same.\u201d Since the triggering terms in COGSA are much the same as those in \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Harter Act, it is understandable that courts, in determining the applicability of COGSA, have on occasion resorted to the public-private carriage distinction. See, e. <em>g., </em>Pacific Vegetable Oil Corp. v. M/S Norse Commander, 264 F.Supp. 625, 627 (S.D.Tex.1966); J. Gerber &amp; Co. v. S.S. Sabine Howaldt, 310 F.Supp. 343, 350 (S.D.N.Y.1969), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 437 F.2d 580 (2 Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Nevertheless, we have found no decision suggesting that for purposes of applying COGSA there exists an exact correlation between common carriage and carriage pursuant to a \u201cbill of lading or similar document of title which is evidence of a contract for the carriage of goods by sea.\u201d Put otherwise, no decision of which we are aware indicates that COGSA may not be applicable in particular instances of private carriage. This is true even if we assume \u2014 though w\u00e9 need not and certainly do not decide\u2014 that there is an exact correlation between private carriage and carriage pursuant to a charter party. Bills of lading are commonly issued in the context of charter parties, and thus while \u00a7 5 of COGSA provides that the \u201cAct shall not be applicable to charter parties,\u201d it goes on to say that \u201cif bills of lading are issued in the case of a ship under a charter party they shall comply with the terms of the Act.\u201d It is true that when there is a voyage or, even more clearly, a time charter, a bill of lading issued to the charterer-shipper, so long as it remains in his hands, usually is a mere receipt as between the parties to the charter and does not perform the additional function of a contract for the carriage of goods.

However, there is no apparent reason why even under a traditional voyage charter covering an entire vessel the parties should not be able to agree <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the bill of lading shall \u201cregulate the relations,\u201d \u00a7 1(b), between the charterer-owner and the charterer-shipper.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hence, the nature of the parties\u2019 agreement with respect to bills of lading may effectively dictate the applicability of COGSA even though the carriage is of a private nature under a charter party.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">In the unlikely event that Nichimen had done nothing more than enter into the \u201cFreight Contract\u201d and had received no bill of lading or similar document of title, COGSA could not have applied here by its very terms \u2014 even if there had been other shippers on the Farland \u2014 whether or not such a contract was deemed to be a charter party. However, Seaboard did not limit itself to the \u201cFreight Contract\u201d but issued a bill of lading, and, as noted earlier, the \u201cFreight Contract\u201d states that it shall be \u201c[sjubject to provisions of carrier\u2019s bill of lading form currently in use in connection with shipments to destinations named above [i. e., New Haven, Conn.].\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the parties to a tradition al voyage charter may agree that the bill of lading shall \u201cregulate [their] relations,\u201d this is <em>a fortiori </em>so under such a hybrid document as this \u201cFreight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Contract\u201d in which Nichimen\u2019s substantive position was little different from that of a shipper who had received a bill of lading but had not entered into such a contract. Since the parties made the bill of lading an integral part of the \u201cFreight Contract,\u201d COGSA applies and any provisions in the contract of carriage inconsistent with it would be void, \u00a7 3(8). Indeed, although we need not decide the point, we have some question whether in a case where a bill of lading or similar document of title was issued under a \u201cFreight Contract\u201d so unlike traditional charter parties,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> COGSA would not be applicable even in the absence of a \u201csubject\u201d clause; if not, carriers would have discovered a way to create a rather large loophole in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">If we had not come to the conclusion that COGSA applied by the force of its terms,, we would have been obliged to consider \u2014 and here we must add one fact to the district court\u2019s summary \u2014 the typewritten provision upon the reverse side of the bill of lading, to which the \u201cFreight Contract\u201d is subject, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">Paramount Clause: The Hague Rules contained in the International Convention for the Unification of certain rules relating to Bills of Lading, dated Brussels at the 25th August, 1924, as enacted in the country of shipment shall apply to this contract. When no such enactment is in force in the country of shipment, the corresponding legislation of the country of destination shall apply, but in respect of shipments to which no such enactments are compulsorily applicable, the terms of the said Convention shall apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">Japan enacted legislation \u201cvery similar to the Hague Rules\u201d effective January 1, 1958.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">The \u201ccorresponding legislation of the country of destination\u201d is COGSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">Little need be said to demonstrate the correctness of the court\u2019s conclusion that, Nichimen having made its <em>prima, facie </em>case, Seaboard and Yigra failed to carry the burden, imposed by \u00a7 4(2) (q) of COGSA, of showing freedom from negligence in the stowage of the cargo.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There was expert evidence that the cargo in Hold No. 2 should have been lashed down; that it should have been stowed only one tier high and spread over a greater area, rather than piled two tiers high at one end of the hold; that the cargo was secured only by wire rope poorly protected against cutting by edges of the coils; that the wire rope was made fast by turnbuckles with an open hook instead of a shackle at each end, with the consequence that a one-inch slackening in the lashing would al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>low unhooking; that the method of lashing in Hold No. 2, with pad eyes secured to the side of the vessel rather than to the after bulkhead as in Hold No. 4 was defective; and that the timber used to shore up the empty space in the first row of coils was not strong enough to hold the cargo. This was quite sufficient to overcome the expressed satisfaction of Nichimen\u2019s marine surveyors. The court\u2019s finding that the stowing was done by Seaboard rather than by Nichi-men\u2019s agent is beyond successful attack; in any event, under \u00a7 3(2) of COGSA, the carrier\u2019s duty to \u201cproperly and carefully load . . . [and] stow . . . the goods carried\u201d is non-delegable. As to defendants\u2019 further argument that they are not responsible for the damage to the cargo because it was the result of one of the exceptions to liability contained in COGSA, namely, perils of the sea, \u00a7 4(2) (c), we find it unnecessary to give detailed consideration to the court\u2019s rejection of the testimony of the master that the shifting of the cargo in No. 2 hold was due to a mammoth 60 foot wave, a phenomenon apparently unnoticed by anyone else on the Farland, since \u201calthough the loss occurs by a peril of the sea, yet if it might have been avoided by skill and diligence at the time, the carrier is liable.\u201d Clark v.

To be sure, stevedores, often under the direction of cargo specialists, rather than the crew frequently load and discharge the cargo. But, without more, use of such additional personnel by a ship, under time charter, to carry out her duties would not relieve her and the owners of responsibility for any consequent cargo damage. Compare Canadian Transport Co. v. Court Line, Ltd., <em>supra, </em>[1940] A.C. at 943 (Lord Wright).

Court Line, Ltd., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">Consistent with these decisions, the parties agree \u2014 as we think they must\u2014 that to some extent clause 8 shifts responsibility for stowage to the charterer; the difficult question is how far. Seaboard appears to make two arguments; (1) that in exercise of the Captain\u2019s supervisory responsibilities, he and his mates participated in the stowage of the coils to such an extent as to render the owner primarily liable; and (2) that in performance of the owner\u2019s responsibility for the seaworthiness of the vessel, the Captain was obligated to correct any improper stowage where, as is alleged to have been the case here, such improper stowage threatened the seaworthiness and safety of the vessel. We will consider these arguments in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">Seaboard\u2019s second argument is premised on testimony by the Far-land\u2019s Captain that the breaking loose of the 3 to 9 ton coils could have resulted in the piercing of the ballast tank tops, thereby endangering the vessel \u2014 apparently because this would have made her unstable. At first impression, Seaboard\u2019s argument is not without attraction. Under the time charter, the owner bears continuing responsibility for the seaworthiness of the vessel. See Gilmore &amp; Black, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4-14, at 204. In performance of this responsibility, the Captain acts on behalf of the owner who \u201cruns and mans the ship,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 205. It might seem reasonable then that the Captain\u2019s failure to correct improper stowage of cargo which poses a threat to the safety of the vessel, should it become unstowed, is the owner\u2019s responsibility. It must be remembered, however, that the only issue here is primary liability for cargo damage. In this respect, the position urged by Seaboard would drain too much meaning from clause 8\u2019s delegation of responsibility for the cargo to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the charterer. Many heavy items of cargo can threaten the safety or stability of a ship if they become loose; serious threats to seaworthiness also may be posed by cargo that may cause fire or explosion unless properly stowed. To hold the shipowner primarily responsible in all such cases would effectively undermine the charterer\u2019s obligation under clause 8. The charterer\u2019s prime responsibility for loading and stowage is not destroyed by the qualification that this shall be \u201cunder the supervision of the Captain,\u201d a phrase doubtless intended to make plain the master\u2019s right to veto a plan that might imperil the seaworthiness of the vessel, see fn. 14 <em>infra </em>\u2014not to impose on him a duty, as the owner\u2019s agent, to supervise the charterer\u2019s stow. Had the stowage in this case been properly designed by the charterer\u2019s agent, no damage would have occurred. The primary negligence was of the charterer\u2019s agent, and we can discern no valid reason why the charterer should now be allowed to shift the cargo damage to the owner on the theory that the Captain, on behalf of the owner, should have corrected its improper stowage. Rather, under clause 8, the safety of the stowage, insofar as cargo damage<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is concerned, generally is the primary responsibility of the charterer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>The Thomas P. Beal, 11 F.2d 49, 52-53 (3 Cir. 1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">This is not to say that under clause 8 the owner may <em>always </em>avoid liability for cargo damage vis-\u00e1-vis a charterer so long as the Captain does not interfere in the stowage process. One essential aspect of seaworthiness is that the vessel must be fit for the purpose intended under the charter party. See, e. g., Oxford Paper Co. v. The Nidar-holm, <em>supra, </em>282 U.S. at 685, 51 S.Ct. 266; The Southwark, 191 U.S. 1, 9-12, 24 S.Ct. 1, 48 L.Ed. 65 (1903). If cargo damage were to occur because of some defect in the vessel which the Captain had failed to discover and correct, primary liability would rest with the owner; the cause of the damage would not be within the scope of the responsibilities which clause 8 was intended to shift from the owner to the charterer. See, e. g., United States v. S.S. Wabash, 331 F.Supp. 145 (S.D.N.Y.1971). Likewise, if some inherent vice of the vessel would make otherwise proper stowage hazardous and the Captain and owner failed to reveal this to the charterer or his stevedore, we doubt whether clause 8 would relieve the owner of primary liability for cargo damage. Cf. Oxford Paper Co. v. The Nidarholm, <em>supra, </em>282 U.S. at 684, 51 S.Ct. 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Seaboard\u2019s first argument, which is premised upon the active involvement of the Captain, and his mates, in the stowage of the coils, requires consideration of the capacity in which the Captain was acting. As we have already seen, when taking action that involves the seaworthiness of the vessel the Captain acts on behalf of the owners.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under clause 8, though, the Captain is un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>der the \u201corders and directions of the Charterers as regards employment and agency.\u201d When this provision is considered together with the charterer\u2019s further responsibility for stowage under clause 8, it is evident that the Captain may be acting either on behalf of the owner or the charterer when he actively intervenes in the stowage process. Horn v. Cia de Navegacion Fruco, S.A., <em>supra,, </em>404 F.2d at 433; cf. The Thomas P. Beal, <em>supra, </em>11 F.2d at 53; The Santona, 152 F. 516, 518 (S.D.N.Y.1907). Whether in any particular case he acts on behalf of the owner or the charterer must be determined by looking to the purpose for which he acts. Cf. The Santona, <em>supra, </em>152 F. at 518. Thus, in light of what has already been said, we think the owner\u2019s liability for cargo damage due to improper stowage is limited to instances in which the Captain intervenes in the stowage process to protect the vessel\u2019s safety and ability to withstand the perils of the sea; to the extent that he acts merely to protect the cargo, the charterer is responsible.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As to this case \u2014 and here we must add two further facts to the district judge\u2019s statement\u2014 while the ship\u2019s mates, and occasionally the Captain, were down in the holds observing the stowage of the coils, it does not appear that, with one exception, they actively intervened in the stowage which was directed by the charterer\u2019s agent. Insofar as the owner\u2019s liability is concerned, such mere observation is consistent with performance, by the Captain and his mates, of its responsibility for the seaworthiness of the vessel itself but, without more, it is not sufficient to render the owner liable. The one exception is that the Captain vetoed a plan that would have included stowage in a third hold, Hold No. 6, because this would have adversely affected the trim of the vessel, certainly an action directed at ensuring the seaworthiness of the vessel itself. There was, however, no evidence either that this action was improper or that it had any causal relation to the damage.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Seaboard argues that even if it is held bound to indemnify Vigra from liability to Nichimen, the liability should not extend to attorneys\u2019 fees. We fail to see why. If Seaboard breached its duty to Vigra under clause 8 of the charter, it is bound to make good the expectable consequences of its breach, of which the incurring of attorneys\u2019 fees in defending against a claim by Nichimen was surely one. Seaboard\u2019s contention that the admiralty recognizes attorneys\u2019 fees as recoverable by an indemnitee only in the familiar triangle of the land-based harbor worker <em>versus </em>the ship <em>versus </em>his employer is sufficiently an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>swered by David Crystal, Inc. v.

Central Gulf Steamship Corp., <em>supra, </em>323 F.Supp. at 1033. In United States v. S.S. Wabash, <em>supra, </em>331 F.Supp. at 148, attorneys\u2019 fees were awarded a time charterer in the situation, opposite to that here, where cargo damage had been caused by unseaworthiness for which the owner was responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\n<em>The Package Limitation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">This appeal vindicates our prediction that Leather\u2019s Best, Inc. v. S.S. Mormaelynx, 451 F.2d 800, 814 (2 Cir. 1971), would \u201chardly be the last\u201d case presenting the problem of what constitutes a \u201cpackage\u201d within \u00a7 4(5) of COGSA. Initially the district court rejected the contention of Seaboard and Vigra that each coil constituted a \u201cpackage\u201d, so that liability would be limited to $500 for each of the 142 damaged coils, or $71,000. Upon reargument the court concluded that 87 coils which had been wrapped in burlap constituted \u201cpackages\u201d and accordingly reduced the damages from $85,180.87 to $75,353.66. While Nichimen accepts that determination, Seaboard and Vigra press their claim that the 55 unwrapped coils also constituted packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The dictionary, a source of interpretation not to be wholly disregarded although by no means controlling, includes within the meaning of packages both \u201c[a] bundle made up for transportation\u201d and \u201c[t]hat in which anything is packed.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1960). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951) defines \u201cpackage\u201d as a \u201cbundle put up for transportation or commercial handling; a thing in form to become, as such, an article of merchandise or delivery from hand to hand,\u201d also \u201ca thing in form suitable for transportation or handling.\u201d In Aluminios Pozuelo Ltd. v. S.S. Navigator, 407 F.2d 152, 155 (2 Cir. 1968), after a careful review of the cases, Judge Moore, this court\u2019s principal spokesman on this elusive subject, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">The meaning of \u201cpackage\u201d which has evolved from the cases can . be said to define a class of cargo, irrespective of size, shape or weight, to which some packaging preparation for transportation has been made which facilitates handling, but which does not necessarily conceal or completely enclose the goods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Applying this standard, we fail to see why the unwrapped coils were not packages as much as those the customer desired to have enclosed in burlap. Each of the coils consisted of a thin steel sheet which had been rolled, strapped, and tied with steel bands. There had thus been \u201csome packaging preparation for transportation . . . which facilitates handling.\u201d Nichimen makes much of the fact that this procedure was useful for warehousing as well as for transportation. But the manufacturer was not making steel simply to keep it in a warehouse; this was only the beginning of a route that would lead, by way of transportation in some form, to the fabricator. Bringing the steel sheets to a ship, loading and unloading, and delivering them to the customer, cf. Waterman S.S. Corp. v. United States Smelting, Refining &amp; Mining Co., 155 F.2d 687 (5 Cir.), cert. denied, 329 U.S. 761, 67 S.Ct. 115, 91 L.Ed. 656 (1946), would have been a different and presumably a much more difficult process than handling the coils. In short, the fact that the act of rolling and banding facilitates storage does not necessarily negate the possibility that it is also packaging preparation made to facilitate handling in transportation. Nichimen stresses also that its customers ordered \u201cHot Rolled Steel Sheet in Coils.\u201d But this specification of \u201cCoils\u201d too reflected a concern for convenience in delivery and handling. It was the Hot Rolled Steel Sheet which was wanted in the last analysis; no one fabricates steel products from banded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>coil itself. More significant is the reference in the Sales Contract between Nichimen and its principal customer, Eastern, to \u201cPacking: Bare but bundled by iron hoop\u201d for coils of plain steel and \u201cPacking: Wrapped by oil paper and hessian cloths\u201d for coils of steel that had been \u201cpickled and oiled.\u201d Under the dictionary definitions a \u201cbundle\u201d is a package. Also the bill of lading, under the heading \u201cNumber of Packages,\u201d stated \u201c280 coils.\u201d While the description on the bill of lading is not controlling, Middle East Agency, Inc. v. The John B. Waterman, 86 F.Supp. 487, 491 (S.D. N.Y.1949) it is important evidence of the parties\u2019 understanding, see Standard Electrica, S. A. v. Hamburg Sudamerikanische Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft, 375 F.2d 943, 946 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 831, 88 S.Ct. 97, 19 L.Ed.2d 89 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Nichimen argues that our recent decisions have gone far beyond Judge Clark\u2019s explanation that the purpose of \u00a7 4(5) is \u201cto prevent \u2018excessive claims in respect of small packages of great value,\u2019 but not to permit carriers to escape liability for just claims.\u201d Stirnimann v. The San Diego, 148 F.2d 141, 143 (2 Cir. 1945) (citations omitted). We have indeed discerned a further purpose in the statute, namely, as said by Chief Judge Lumbard, to describe \u201ca unit that would be fairly uniform and predictable in size, and one that would provide a common sense standard so that the parties would easily ascertain at the time of contract when additional coverage was needed, place the risk of additional loss upon one or the other, and thus avoid the pains of litigation.\u201d Standard Electrica, S. A. v. Hamburg Sudamerikanische Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft, <em>supra, </em>375 F.2d at 945 (footnote omitted). If Nichimen wanted coverage over $500 per coil, it could either use the statutory alternative of declaring a higher value or cover itself by insurance. Most cargo-damage actions are really battles between insurers, see Leather\u2019s Best, Inc. v. S. S. Mormaclynx, <em>supra, </em>451 F.2d at 815, and there is thus no need for shedding crocodile tears on behalf of the shipper or consignee. The \u201cpackage\u201d provision in \u00a7 4(5) has indeed become unsatisfactory, as we have frequently noted, but, pending a new resolution, courts do best to apply it in light of the parties\u2019 probable intention. We have little doubt, in light of the Sales Contract, the bill of lading, and common understanding, that the parties here considered each coil, whether wrapped or unwrapped, to be a \u201cpackage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The judgment is modified accordingly, and as so modified, is affirmed. Nichi-men may recover two-thirds of its costs and Vigra all its costs against Seaboard.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\">. Under federal bailment law, the bailor, Nichimen, still made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence merely by showing delivery of the coils in good order to the Farland and return in a damaged condition.

At that point, while, unlike under COGSA, the defendants would not have had to establish their freedom from negligence, they would had to have gone \u201cforward with evidence sufficient to persuade that the non-existence of the fact [of negligence was] as probable as its existence,\u201d Commercial Molasses Corp. v. New York Tank Barge Corp., <em>supra, </em>314 U.S. at 111, 62 S.Ct. at 161, if they were to escape liability. The facts surrounding the stowage of the cargo aboard the Far-land, see <em>infra, </em>strongly suggest the defendants failed to do even the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">. The ICC was speaking in the context of a case concerned with the regulation of an interstate motor carrier. The extent of the IOC\u2019s regulatory authority was dependent on whether the motor carrier was a \u201ccommon carrier by motor vehicle,\u201d a class of carrier defined in the first instance in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(a) (14), or was a \u201ccontract carrier by motor vehicle,\u201d a class of carrier defined in the first instance in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(a) (15). In the course of determining the motor carrier to be a common carrier, the ICC affirmed the conclusion that the statutory definitions \u2014 which at that time had just been amended \u2014 were \u201cessentially declaratory of the common law,\u201d 31 M.C.C. at 710, and its remarks fully reflect this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b389-5\">. Some earlier suggestion of this reasoning can arguably be found in Knott v.

Indeed, the rule that, as between the parties to a charter party, a bill of lading is a mere receipt and not also part of the contract of carriage, has long been recognized to be a flexible one, i. e., subject to contractual modification by the parties. Thus, in Crenshawe v. Pearce, 37 F. 432, 434 (S.D.N.Y.1889), rev\u2019d on other-grounds, 43 F. 803 (C.C.1890), the general rule was stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">[I]t has been long settled, not only that the bills of lading do not supersede the provisions of the charter-party in so far \u25a0 as they differ from it, but that they are controlled by the charter-jrarty, <em>in the absence of any proof of authority and intention to malee a new eontraet.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7N\">(emphasis added).

In urging that this provision of the \u201cFreight Contract\u201d is without force in this case, Seaboard argues that since it had previously carried no shipments from Japan to the United States and the bill of lading form used was that of Aall &amp; Co., the form was not the \u201ccarrier\u2019s bill of lading form currently in use\u201d on this particular route. Since Aall &amp; Co. which issued the bill of lading was the carrier\u2019s agent at the port of embarkation, we consider Seaboard\u2019s argument to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">. The specimen voyage and time charters printed in Gilmore &amp; Black, <em>supra, </em>at 796-809, are detailed contracts occupying six and eight printed pages, as compared with the one sheet \u201cFreight Contract.\u201d While the voyage charterer is a shipper, he is something more. COGSA\u2019s reference to charter parties, \u00a7 5, must be read in light of the common understanding, expressed in The New York, 93 F. 495, 497 (E.D.N.Y.1899), aff\u2019d 113 F. 810 (2 Cir. 1902), where the court said, \u201cA charter party is a specific contract, by which the owners of a vessel let the entire vessel, or <em>some principal part </em>thereof, to another person, to be used by the latter in transportation for his own account, either under their charge or his.\u201d (emphasis added).

The legislation applies, <em>inter alia, </em>to shipments from Japan to a foreign port. <em>However, were it not </em>for our conclusion as to the applicability of COGSA, we would have to consider the Japanese \u201cpackage\u201d limitation of 100,000 yen, which is lower than COGSA\u2019s limitation of $500. See Part IV <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b391-16\">. In contrast to the situation under federal bailment law where the burden of persuasion remains throughout on the bailor-shipper, see <em>supra </em>&amp; note 1, \u00a7 4(2) (q) imposes on the carrier \u201cno mere burden of going forward with the evidence, but a real burden of persuasion, with the attendant risk of non-persuasion,\u201d Gilmore &amp; Black, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 3-37, at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"AUlm\">It is not disputed that \u00a7 4(2) (q), rather than \u00a7 4(2) (a), is the controlling provision.

The same principle applies in the context of voyage charters since, as in the case of a time charter, the owner\u2019s crew mans and navigates the vessel, see Gilmore &amp; Black, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4-1, at 170, which is the factual premise underlying the responsibility placed upon the owner, see <em>infra. </em>The principle does not extend, however, to a demise, or bareboat, charter since there the charterer, takes complete control of the vessel, mans it with his own crew, and is hence treated by the law as owner <em>pro hac vice. </em>See <em>e. g., id. </em>at 117; Munson S. S. Line v. Glasgow Nav. Co., <em>supra, </em>235 F. at 67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\">.

Whether the charterer would also be responsible for any damage to the <em>vessel </em>as a result of improper stowage is a different question which we need not decide here since there was none.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">. In Oxford Paper Co. v. The Nidarholm, <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court declined to decide whether a charter party provision which also specified that the charterers were to \u201cload, stow, and trim the cargo at their expense under the supervision of the captain\u201d relieved the owner of responsibility to the charterer for improper stowage of cargo where only the safety of the cargo was imperiled. We find nothing in that decision contrary to our conclusion here. At most, it suggests that such a clause would not relieve tlie owner, through the Captain, of responsibility \u201cfor damage to cargo exposed, by bad stowage, to sea perils peculiarly within the specialized knowledge and experience of the master.\u201d 282 U.S. at 684-685, 51 S.Ct. at 268.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\">. For this reason, we have no doubt that the provision for supervision by the Captain of the charterer\u2019s stowage would necessarily be implied, even if it were not expressly stated, in order that the Captain might intervene, on behalf of the owner, in any stowage which might adversely affect the vessel\u2019s safety and ability to withstand the perils of the sea.

Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Line, Ltd., <em>supra, </em>[1940] A.C. at 937-38, 944 (Lords Atkin and Wright).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\">. This appears. to be the same test as that employed by the Fifth Circuit in Horn v. Cia de Navegacion Fruco, S.A., <em>supra, </em>404 F.2d at 433, although we are not certain we would agree with its application to the facts of that case. There the shipowner was deemed to be liable for damage to a load of bananas on the grounds that the vessel was unseaworthy because it was not adequately and competently manned at the beginning of the voyage and because the bananas had not been properly stowed by the Captain and his mate to allow necessary cooling and ventilation, thus affecting the capacity of the ship to transport the delicate cargo in the manner specified by the charter party.\u201d Insofar as the owner\u2019s liability rested on the improper method of stowage, we have some question whether, given clause 8, the owner bears responsibility for inability of tlie vessel to carry the cargo safely not as a result of any defect or vice in the vessel, see <em>supra, </em>but only as a result of the method of stowage itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b395-11\">. Seaboard argues that if the stowage had been in three holds instead of two, the height of the stow would have been reduced. While it is true that the coils were stowed two tiers high in Hold No. 2, according to the testimony of the Far-land\u2019s Captain only about half of the hold was covered with coils. It appears that this was done for Seaboard\u2019s convenience in loading lumber in Vancouver, not out of necessity. Additionally, it is of interest that the coils in Hold No. 4 which were lashed to the after bulkhead, rather than to the side bulkheads, did not break loose, although they were tiered three high.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
