Primary standards are those \u201crequisite to protect the public health,\u201d while secondary standards are those \u201crequisite to protect the public welfare,\u201d which is defined<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as including, but not limited to, \u201ceffects on soils, water, crops, vegetation, manmade materials, animals, wildlife, weather, visibility, and climate, damage to and deterioration of property, and hazards to transportation, as well as effects on economic values and on personal comfort and well-being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">This appeal involves the non-health-related \u201csecondary\u201d standards for sulfur oxides, which are more stringent than the \u201cprimary\u201d standards, though greater time flexibility is provided for attaining secondary standards.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In particular, this appeal has come to focus on the requirement in the secondary air quality standard limiting the annual arithmetic mean amount of sulfur oxides (sulfur dioxide) to: \u201c60 micrograms per cubic meter \u2014 annual arithmetic mean.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Sections 108 and 109 of the Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> reprinted in the Appendix, are the key sections for present purposes. The statute requires air quality criteria, if not issued prior to the 1970 amendments, to be issued by the Administrator within 12 months after the listing of an air pollutant. The Administrator is required to publish and revise a list which includes each pollutant present in the ambient air, from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources, which in the judgment of the Administrator \u201chas an adverse effect on public health or welfare.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">Section 108 makes clear that the term \u201cair quality criteria\u201d is not used in the law with the conventional meaning of \u201ccriterion,\u201d as referring to a standard. What the term refers to is a document which \u201cshall accurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of all identifiable effects on public health or welfare which may be expected from the presence of such pollutant in the ambient air, in varying quantities.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">Section 109 of the Act provides for expeditious issuance of air quality standards \u201cbased on\u201d the criteria. They were required within 30 days after the 1970 enactment of P.L. 91-604, for each air pollutant for which air quality criteria had been issued prior to such enactment. As for criteria issued subsequent to the 1970 law, the Administrator is required, simultaneously, to publish proposed national air quality standards. In either event the air quality standards prescribe a level of air quality \u201cthe attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator, based on such criteria\u201d is requisite to protect the public interest \u2014 in the case of primary standards, \u201crequisite to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>public healthin the case of secondary-standards, \u201crequisite to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects associated with the presence of such air pollutant in the ambient air.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Congress provided for informal rule-making, for proposed standards, written comments thereon, without any general necessity for evidentiary submissions, culminating in promulgation by regulation of standards based on the criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">In the case before us the air quality criteria were published in January 1969, prior to the 1970 law, by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> No contention is made that they were not adequate to serve the function contemplated of criteria under the 1970 law, of reflecting pertinent scientific knowledge concerning effects that may be expected from the presence of the pollutant. The complaint is that there is no adequate indication of the basis of the 1971 standard of 60 micrograms per cubic meter. It is particularly stressed that the summarizing \u201cResume\u201d paragraph, reproduced in the footnote,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the 1969 Criteria refer to no effects at a level below 85 micrograms per cubic meter. While the statement of the purpose and nature of the regulation set forth the basis for the primary standards, simultaneously adopted, in some detail, as to secondary standards the Administrator said only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"adz-dedup-0\">National secondary ambient air quality standards are those which, in the judgment of the Administrator, based on the air quality criteria, are requisite to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects associated with the presence of air pollutants in the ambient air.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">In support of the EPA\u2019s annual standard of 60 micrograms per cubic meter, the Government and intervenor, National Resources Defense Council,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> refer to lower figures in the material in the body of the Criteria, saying that the Resume is not conclusive. In the alternative they argue that the 85 figure in the Resume supports a 60 standard, on the basis of the Administrator\u2019s judgment as to anticipated effects and a margin necessary to avoid the adverse effects noted at the 85 level.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">We do not undertake to rule on these particular matters. This court has been assigned special responsibility for determining challenges to EPA\u2019s air quality standards.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This judicial review rests on the premise that agency and court \u201ctogether constitute a \u2018partnership\u2019 in furtherance of the public interest, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>are \u2018collaborative instrumentalities of justice.\u2019 The court is in a real sense part of the total administrative process.\u201d Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 444 F.2d 841, 851-852, cert. denied, 403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2233, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). Inherent in the responsibility entrusted to this court is a requirement that we be given sufficient indication of the basis on which the Administrator reached the 60 figure so that we may consider whether it embodies an abuse of discretion or error of law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">The provision for statutory judicial review contemplates some disclosure of the basis of the agency\u2019s action. Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416, 420, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). We are not to be taken as specifying that the agency must provide the same articulation as is required for orders or regulations issued after eviden-tiary hearings. Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, <em>supra, </em>444 F.2d at 851. We are keenly aware of the need to avoid procedural strait jackets that would seriously hinder this new agency in the discharge of the novel, sensitive and formidable, tasks entrusted to it by Congress. This concern is emphasized by the fact that in the 1970 Amendments Congress was significantly concerned with expedition<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and avoidance of previous cumbersome and time-consuming procedures in effect under prior law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>The provision by Congress of only informal rule-making, as a preliminary to the issuance of standards,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the contemplation of expedition, yield as reasonable corollaries some latitude in the requirement for delineation of approach. While the provision in \u00a7 4 of the APA for a \u201cconcise general statement\u201d of the basis and purpose of regulations is not to be interpreted over-literally, the regulation before us contains sufficient exposition of the purpose- and basis of the regulation as a whole to satisfy this legislative minimum.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Particularly as applied to environmental regulations, produced under the tension of need for reasonable expedition and need for resolution of a host of nagging problems, we are loath to stretch the requirement of a \u201cgeneral statement\u201d into a mandate for reference to all the specific issues raised in comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\"> There are contexts, however, contexts of fact, statutory framework and nature of action, in which the minimum requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act may not be sufficient.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the interest of justice, <em>cf. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106, and in aid of the judicial function, centralized in this court, of expeditious disposition of challenges to standards, the record is remanded for .the Administrator to supply an implementing statement that will enlighten the court as to the basis on which he reached the 60 standard from the material in the Criteria. It is contemplated that the Administrator may and should proceed with all reasonable expedition, just as the court has expedited the hearing of argument and issuance of this remand, in conformance to the legislative judgment as to need for reasonable expedition in achieving this important national goal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It is further contemplated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>that this remand will not halt or delay the on-going proceedings for state adoption of implementation plans to meet and maintain the national standards. To avoid any misunderstanding we state expressly that the Administrator has freedom to revise the Criteria on the basis of material in hand without any requirement of additional submissions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Furthermore, our remand is not to be considered as limiting the Administrator\u2019s discretion to enlarge the administrative process as part of his further consideration. Compare FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, 60 S.Ct. 437, 84 L.Ed. 656 (1940). The Administrator may also provide for receipt of additional material, and even, if he be so advised, may revise the standards without being limited to the procedure of presenting such revisions in the form of recommendations to this court.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">The record will be remanded to the Administrator for further action not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">APPENDIX .</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Excerpts from the Clean Air Act of 1963, 77 Stat. 392, P.L. 88-206, as amended by the Air Quality Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 491, P.L. 90-148, and the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1676, and codified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">\n<em>\u201cAir Quality Criteria, and Control T\u00e9chniques</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">\u201cSec. 108.

C. RESUME</p>\n<p id=\"Aqr1\">In addition to health considerations, the economic and aesthetic benefits to be obtained from low ambient concentrations of sulfur oxides as related to visibility soiling, corrosion, and other effects should be considered by organizations responsible for promulgating ambient air quality standards. Under the conditions prevailing in areas where the studies were conducted, adverse health effects were noted when 24-hour average levels of sulfur dioxide exceeded 300 wg/m3 (0.11 ppm) for 3 to 4 days. Adverse health effects were also noted when the annual mean level of sulfar dioxide exceeded 115 \u00abg/m3 (0.04 ppm). Visibility reduction to about 5 miles was observed at 285 \u00abg/m3 (0.10 ppm) ; adverse effects on materials were observed at an annual mean of 345 \u00abg/3 (0.12 ppm) ; and adverse effects on vegetation were observed at an annual mean of 85 i\u00edg/m3 (0.03 ppm). It is reasonable and prudent to conclude that, when promulgating ambient air quality standards, consideration should be given to requirements for margins of safety which take into account long-term effects on health, vegetation, and materials occurring below the above levels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b910-13\">. This intervention will be permitted to stand for purposes of the Council\u2019s presentation, on a basis different from that of the Government, of materials and argument in support of the annual standard. We do not find it necessary to rule at this juncture on any other aspect of the intervenor\u2019s standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b910-15\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857h-5(b) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b911-5\">. As to any agency approach based on \u201cmargin of error,\u201d the appellant concedes some latitude for a figure below the 85 level which was identified as in the criteria as producing harm to vegetation.

While a start has been made in controlling air pollution since the enactment of the Air Quality Act of 1967, progress has been regrettably slow. This has been due to a number of factors: (1) cumbersome and time-consuming procedures called for under the 1967 act * * *. Therefore, it is urgent that Congress adopt new clean air legislation which will make possible the more expeditious imposition of specific emission standards * * * and the effective enforcement of such standards by both State and Federal agencies.\u201d See also Sen. Muskie, 116 Cong.Rec. 32901 (9-21-70) : \u201c * * * we have learned that the air pollution problem is more severe, more pervasive, and growing faster than we had thought. Unless we recognize the crisis and generate a sense of urgency from that recognition, lead times may melt away without any chance at all for a rational solution to the air pollution problem.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b911-17\">. The President\u2019s proposal for national standards served to shorten the time period for controlling air pollution. Hearings in each region prior to adoption of regional air quality standards were to be eliminated. No longer could each State propose different sets of standards. No longer would the Government have to review 50 different sets of standards. Time would not have to be devoted to selecting regional boundaries; instead, States could concentrate on developing effective, enforceable implementation plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-18\">Congress not only was in accord, but further accelerated pollution control efforts. First, specific deadlines for proposal and promulgation of national ambient air quality standards (for pollutants, such as sulfur oxides, for which criteria had previously been issued) were written into the legislation. Second, a time limit for approval or disapproval of state implementation plans was established. Third, specific time limits were established by which the implementation plans had to achieve the national primary ambient air quality standards. Finally, to assure that the adoption of effective national ambient air quality standards would not be needlessly delayed by litigation in the courts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Congress required those who wished to contest the standards to do so within 30 days after their promulgation. Moreover, jurisdiction to review the standards was placed in this Court alone to avoid conflicting holdings by various federal courts of appeals and thus to assure a prompt and uniform determination on the validity of the standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b912-5\">. No public hearings are required to be held on proposed national ambient air quality standards under the Clean Air Act. Public hearings are required, however, prior to state adoption of implementation plans, to meet and maintain the national standards. Sections 110(a) (1) and (c) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. sec. 1857e-5(a) (1) and (e). The legislative history of the \u201cClean Air Amendments of 1970\u201d (Pub.L. 91-604) makes it clear that Congress felt public hearings on the national standards were unnecessary in light of the implementation plan hearings and would unduly delay achievement of air quality protective of the public health and welfare.

The EPA has notified the court that it has taken steps, to avoid any possible confusion on the part of the state officials responsible for air pollution control, by notifying them directly that the 24 hour standard is intended to serve as a nonenforceable guideline rather than a mandatory requirement such as the annual standard. Because the states\u2019 implementation plans were due on January 30, 1972, only a short time after the problem of possible confusion became apparent, states will upon request be given an \u201cadequate period\u201d during which to revise their implementation plans in light of the clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">While we do not say this is mandatory, we think it desirable to use the facilities of the Federal Register, available for interpretative rulings, to assure widespread <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>notice of administrative steps taken in the interest of clarification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b913-13\">. At oral argument, counsel for petitioner conceded that the criteria may be amended, on the basis of the record in hand, including comments, without providing for further comments on the amendments. <em>We </em>think that is an appropriate construction of \u00a7 108 in the context of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b913-15\">. The secondary standards promulgated April 30, 1971, remain in effect pending amplification of basis on remand and further review by this court. Following remand proceedings petitioner may supplement its petition to review without filing a new petition to review. In specifying that the Administrator may revise the standards, following the remand, without leave of court we do not speak to the procedures that may be requisite for issuance of revised standards, <em>of. </em>\u00a7 109(b) (2), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857(e)-4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
