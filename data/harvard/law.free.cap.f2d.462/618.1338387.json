He asserted that he was denied due process and that he was defamed and defrauded by the actions of the Rating and Appeals Boards. Although the complaint is in the form of a civil damage suit, the substance of the action is an attempt to obtain judicial review of a final determination by the Veterans\u2019 Administration. Title 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) forecloses judicial review, with exceptions not here material.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Fritz v. Director of Veterans Administration (9th Cir. 1970) 427 F.2d 154; Redfield v. Driver (9th Cir. 1966) 364 F.2d 812; Milliken v. Gleason (1st Cir. 1964) 332 F.2d 122, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 1002, 85 S.Ct. 723, 13 L.Ed.2d 703; <em>see </em>Lynch v. United States (1934) 292 U.S. 571, 587, 54 S.Ct. 840, 78 L.Ed. 1434.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-12\">\u201cWhen the United States creates rights in individuals against itself, it is under no obligation to provide a remedy through the courts. United States v. Babcock, 250 U.S. 328, 331, 39 S.Ct. 464, 63 L.Ed. 1011. It may limit the individual to administrative remedies Tutun v. United States, 270 U.S. 568, 576, 46 S.Ct. 425, 70 L.Ed. 738.\u201d (Lynch v. United States, <em>supra, </em>292 U.S. at 582, 54 S.Ct. at 845.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">Because the jurisdictional point disposes of the litigation, it is unnecessary to discuss appellant\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-10\">. In pertinent part \u00a7 211(a) provides: \u201c[T]he decisions of the Administrator on any question of law or fact under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration providing benefits for veterans and their dependents or survivors shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
