Appellant claims that the merchandise should be classified as unwrought platinum, under item 605.02, TSUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Platinum black is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">* * * a soft dull black powder of finely divided metallic platinum obtained by reduction and precipitation from solutions of its salts * * *.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ace\">The pertinent parts of the Tariff Schedules read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">Schedule 6, Part 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">Part 2 headnotes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-13\">\u00edf- * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">3.

Free</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-34\">The correct classification of the merchandise depends on whether it is \u201cun-wrought\u201d or \u201csemimanufactured.\u201d Appellant contends that the merchandise is \u201cprimary metal in powder form\u201d and cannot be \u201csemimanufactured\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Appellant also contends that the merchandise fits the above definition of \u201cunwrought,\u201d because the powder consists of very fine \u201cgrains\u201d or at least is in a primary form similar to \u201cgrains.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-35\">The Customs Court found that the definition of \u201cprimary metal\u201d estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>lished on the record was a metal which was \u201cwon directly from the ore,\u201d which \u201chas never been used in any commercial process,\u201d and was not made from scrap. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">Although there is no direct evidence that platinum black is ever produced from scrap, the customs classification carries with it the presumption that platinum black can be produced from scrap refined to a \u201cpure platinum solution\u201d. Our own research reveals that a significant proportion of the annual production of platinum metals comes from waste and scrap, and that \u201cprocedures\u201d applied to scrap material are essentially the same as those for refining concentrates and native metal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no proof, nor can we infer from the record, that all platinum black powder is a primary form of metal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The court overruled the protest on the basis that appellant had failed to overcome the presumption of correctness of the customs classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Appellant contends that the court erred in not following the rule of In re Eimer, 11 Treas.Dec. 705, T.D. 27363 (1906), in which the Board of General Appraisers held platinum black to be free of duty as unmanufactured platinum. Appellant points out that the parenthetical \u201c(other than primary metal in powder form)\u201d was apparently added to the definition of \u201csemimanufactured,\u201d <em>supra, </em>in response to concern that, without it, the definition would adversely affect the longstanding duty-free status of certain platinum imports.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to appellant, the record shows an unrebut-ted prima facie case that platinum black is a primary metal, even under the definition accepted by the Customs Court, since one of appellant\u2019s witnesses testified that it is obtained from \u201cvirgin ore,\u201d and there is also testimony to the effect that metal would be considered obtained \u201cdirectly\u201d from the ore even though there were numerous chemical refining steps utilized in obtaining it. Appellant also suggests an alternative definition of \u201cprimary metal,\u201d which it asserts is met by platinum black.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">* * * the term \u201csemimanufactured\u201d refers to wrought metal in the form of bars, rods, sections, plates, sheets, strips, wire, tubes, pipes, and hollow bars, and powder; Tariff Commission, Tariff Classification Study, Schedule 6, at 347 (1960). The parenthetical presently found in the statutory definition was proposed by the International Nickel Co., in order to continue duty-free treatment of primary platinum metal in powder and other forms. <em>Id., </em>at 758, 762-63.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\"> As the Customs Court pointed out, the mere fact that merchandise is a powder does not establish whether it is an unwrought powder or a semimanufactured powder. In order to classify the merchandise as semimanufactured, the classifier had to find that it was powder which was \u201cother than primary metal in powder form.\u201d To rebut this finding appellant must submit substantial evidence establishing that the merchandise was primary metal in powder form. United States v. New York Merchandise Co., 435 F.2d 1315, 58 CCPA 53, C.A.D. 1004 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">We agree with the Customs Court that a primary metal is one which was \u201cwon directly from the ore.\u201d Asked to define \u201cprimary metal\u201d one of appellant\u2019s expert witnesses replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-16\">Well, going to the literature, \u201cprimary metal\u201d \u2014 or, in metal literature they actually use \u201cvirgin metal\u201d as actually a preferred name- \u2014 that is, the encyclopedia, if you look up \u201cprimary metal,\u201d will refer you to \u201cvirgin metal\u201d for the definition \u2014 but this is metal which has been won directly from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>ore, and has never been used in any commercial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">That definition is also consistent with the following authorities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqq\">primary * * * A substance which is obtained directly, by extraction and purification, from natural raw material. (Chambers\u2019s Technical Dictionary, at 672 (1940) ). primary * * * ' (4) In the terminology of minerals, primary (in the ease of metals) refers to direct production from the ore * * *. This meaning contrasts with the term \u201csecondary,\u201d used to denote recovery of metal from scrap * * *. (The Condensed Chemical Dictionary, at 729-30 (8th ed. 1971)). virgin metal. Metal obtained directly from ore and not used before. (American Society for Metals, Metals Handbook, at 15 (1948 ed.) ).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-9\"><em>Cf. </em>Alloys &amp; Chemicals Co. v. United States, 54 CCPA 84, C.A.D. 912 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Thus, in order to prevail, appellant must show that the merchandise was obtained directly from the ore and not from scrap. This appellant has failed to do. Of appellant\u2019s three witnesses, only MacConnell knew anything about the commercial process used by the manufacturer of the merchandise to make platinum black. It was established on cross examination that even MacConnell\u2019s personal knowledge of the process was limited to the point where the material being worked on is a \u201cpure platinum solution.\u201d While he testified that the solution was obtained by dissolving virgin ore, he freely admitted that he was not personally familiar with this end of the process. We agree with the Customs Court that the pure platinum solution might reasonably have been obtained from scrap platinum, and find MacConnell\u2019s hearsay testimony insufficient to rebut the presumption that the classifier correctly determined the merchandise not to be primary metal in powder form.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Consideration of the legislative history referred to by appellants would not change the result here. In both the suggestions made by the International Nickel Co. concerning the platinum exception to the definition of \u201csemimanufactured,\u201d the exceptions were limited to <em>primary </em>metal. See Tariff Commission, Tariff Classification Study, Schedule 6, at 758, 762-63 (1960). Nor is the brief opinion in In re Eimer, <em>supra, </em>of any assistance to appellant. It is not clear what was established by the evidence before the Board of General Appraisers in that ease. At any rate, we cannot ignore the word \u201cprimary\u201d in the present statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">The judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-17\">. 65 Oust.Ct. 538, C.D. 4134 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-36\">.
