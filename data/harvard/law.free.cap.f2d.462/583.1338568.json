We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-19\">The principal error complained of concerns the manner in which the trial court instructed the jury on the question of value. During the trial, all parties stipulated as to value and the stipulation was read to the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-20\">\u201c[I]t has been stipulated that the purchase price of the two M-14 rifles \u2014Government\u2019s Exhibits 5-A and 6-A \u2014is in excess of $100 per each rifle. It has also been stipulated, your Hon- or, that the current purchase price of an M-14 rifle is in excess of $100.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-21\">\u201c[The Court]: Replacement price?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-22\">\u201c[Mr. Coffin]: Yes, your Honor, each rifle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>One of the defendants testified he was to be paid $50 for his guns, and another witness testified that M-14 rifles were given to popular forces in Vietnam.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The court gave an instruction requested by the defendants which told the jury that if it found that the total value of the two rifles did not exceed $100 then it must find the defendants not guilty. Later, however, the court recalled the jury and said it had given an instruction which was not a proper statement of the law. He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\u201c[I] now instruct you that you must find the defendants either guilty of the offenses, as charged, or not guilty; that the evidence is shown by way of stipulation that the cost to the-Government of the rifles involved was more than $100, so that there is no lesser offense. Either the defendants must be found guilty of the offenses, or not guilty of the offenses charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Thereafter a verdict of guilty was returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Appellants misread their stipulation. It states that the purchase price of the <em>particular </em>rifles in evidence, Exhibits 5-A and 6-A, <em>is </em>in excess of $100 per each rifle. As such it is conclusive on the question of value. H. Hackfeld &amp; Co. v. United States, 197 U.S. 442, 447, 25 S.Ct. 456, 49 L.Ed. 826 (1905) ; United States v. Wertz, 447 F.2d 451, 452 (9th Cir. 1971); United States v. 3,788.-16 Acres of Land, 439 F.2d 291, 294 (8th Cir. 1971). The authorities relied upon by appellants are clearly distinguishable and are neither conclusive nor persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The other issue raised is that the court should have instructed on the necessity of intent to steal goods having a value in excess of $100. No such instruction was proposed or requested. On the facts of this case it would not have been appropriate. <em>See </em>United States v. Bolin, 423 F.2d 834, 836-837 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 954, 90 S.Ct. 1882, 26 L.Ed.2d 297 (1970); <em>cf. </em>Magnolia Motor &amp; Logging Co. v. United States, 264 F.2d 950, 953 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 815, 80 S.Ct. 54, 4 L.Ed.2d 61 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">\u201cIf two . or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, . . . and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-14\">\u201cWhoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly converts to his use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys or disposes of any record, voucher, money, or thing of value of the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-23\">United States or of any department or agency thereof, or any property made or being made under contract for the United States or any department or agency thereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-24\">* :\u00a1: * -I. :!\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-25\">\u201cShall be fined not more than $10,-000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; but if the value of such property does not exceed the sum of $100, he shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-26\">\u201cThe word \u2018value\u2019 means face, par, or market value, or cost price, either wholesale or retail, whichever is greater.
