The statute doe\u00a7 not provide for notice to the debtor or a hearing prior to the seizure. To regain possession of the seized property pending trial, a debtor must furnish a bond in twice the value of the property seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-17\">Repossession under color of this statute was effected against appellant\u2019s household goods without a hearing and she was financially unable to arrange for the required double bond to obtain repossession pending trial in the state court. She brought an action in the District Court, as an individual and as a representative of a class of persons similarly situated, seeking a declaration that the South Carolina \u201cciaim and delivery\u201d statute violates the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, appellant requested an injunction restraining future claim and delivery actions against herself and members of the class she represents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-18\">The District Judge dismissed appellant\u2019s individual suit as moot because the state court action brought by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>creditor had gone to final judgment and, under the state court\u2019s ruling, the creditor became vested with the right to possession of the goods seized. In dismissing the federal complaint the District Judge also held that a class action was not proper because it would be impossible as a practical matter to determine who is included in the class so that notice under Rule 23(c) could be given to all members.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">When the appellant\u2019s complaint was filed in federal court on October 8, 1971, the case was not moot. At that time, appellant had been summarily deprived of her property in advance of a final judgment of the state court. Although the state court judgment was eventually rendered while this action was pending in federal court (on October 14, 1971), the controversy was not thereby mooted, because, due to her poverty, appellant will likely again be subject to the challenged statutory procedure. Indeed we are informed by counsel that she has already purchased furniture on credit to replace that taken earlier. We may take judicial notice of the fact that frequently in our credit economy persons in appellant\u2019s situation are subjected to deprivation of their personal property under statutes like the one challenged. Thus, the public interest in having this suit considered is substantial. <em>See </em>United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632-633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953); Washington v. Lee, 263 F.Supp. 327 (M.D.Ala.1966), aff\u2019d, 390 U.S. 333, 88 S.Ct. 994, 19 L. Ed.2d 1212 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">Moreover, this suit may properly be brought as a class action. At oral argument, appellant declared the class to be all citizens of South Carolina whose personal property has been subjected to \u201cclaim and delivery\u201d and those persons whose personal property will be claimed and delivered during the pendency of the federal action. As thus defined, the class is adequately delineated and appellant is clearly an appropriate representative of the class. <em>See </em>Thomas v. Clarke, 54 F.R.D. 245 (D.Minn. filed November 29, 1971) (three-judge Court) (holding adequately precise a class consisting of those persons who have had property seized under Minnesota\u2019s claim and delivery law since the pendency of the federal case). At the time of judgment the individual members of the class will be readily identifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-13\">Furthermore, since this class action plainly comes within the ambit of F.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b) (2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the notice requirement of Rule 23(c) (2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not apply. 3B Moore, Federal Practice |f23.55; <em>7A </em>Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1786.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>Since the complaint attacks the constitutionality of South Carolina\u2019s \u201cclaim and delivery\u201d statute \u2014 a statute of state-wide application \u2014 the convening of. a three-judge court is required. \u2022 The case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to petition the Chief Judge of the Circuit for the convening of a three-judge court. After the preparation of this court\u2019s opinion, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), holding unconstitutional a Florida pre-judgment replevin statute essentially identical to the South Carolina statute here under attack. When convened, the three-judge court should examine the South Carolina .statute in light of <em>Fuentes, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">. Appellant claims that the South Carolina statute is unconstitutional in that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-10\">1) It violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by providing for the taking of property prior to notice and hearing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-11\">2) It is violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since it discriminates against those whose financial eon-dition makes it impossible for them to file the double bond required to repossess the seized property prior to trial; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-20\">3) It provides for a search and seizure and resultant invasion of privacy, without a warrant, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">. Relying upon Weddle v. Director, Patux-ent Institution, 436 F.2d 342 (4th Cir. 1970), rev\u2019d 405 U.S. 1036, 92 S.Ct. 1318. 31 L.Ed.2d 577 (1972), the District Court dismissed this case also for lack of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) on the ground that appellant\u2019s claim is dependent upon a property right. In Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972), the United States Supreme Court held that there is no distinction between personal rights and property rights for the purpose of jurisdiction under \u00a7 1343(3). The appellees, in their appellate brief and oral argument, acknowledge the applicability of <em>Lynch </em>and no longer press the point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1117-15\">.
