A careful reading of the record convinces us that the <em>Miranda </em>proceedings were fully carried out and incriminating statements were made both before and after the appellant signed a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-34\">We have carefully considered the other grounds of appeal and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-35\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
