The Secretary declined to apply the presumption, and denied the benefits. The district court reversed. The Secretary has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Claimant filed an application on January 14, 1969, for surviving child\u2019s insurance benefits for her two minor children pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d) (1). Her application was denied initially on the ground that she had failed satisfactorily to establish the death of her previous husband, John W. DeMasse, the father of the two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">She requested a hearing, at which the following evidence was adduced: claimant was married to DeMasse in 1952, and had separated from him \u201cat least twelve times.\u201d Her numerous suits for nonsupport resulted in DeMasse\u2019s receiving several short jail terms culminating in a one-year sentence commencing in June, 1960. DeMasse telephoned claimant on the day of his release, June 8, 1961, but claimant has not heard from him since that date. Attempts to locate him through his friends and acquaintances proved fruitless; the authorities have been unable to find him as well. There has been no record of any activity whatsoever under his Social Security number. Claimant asserted that De-Masse had borrowed money from loan sharks but had not repaid it, and that they had come looking for him prior to his prison sentence but not after his release. Claimant obtained a divorce in 1962 to marry her present husband. On December 31, 1968, she obtained an <em>ex parte </em>decree from the Philadelphia Orphan\u2019s Court granting her letters of administration based on the presumed death of DeMasse by reason of his absence for seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">After reviewing the evidence, the Hearing Examiner expressly found that \u201c[t]he evidence shows that no direct or indirect evidence of any nature whatsoever, from any source, has been obtained from or about Mr. John W. De-Masse since 1961.\u201d He concluded that \u201c[t]he circumstances in. the case and all the evidence at hand support the legal presumption that Mr. John W. DeMasse is deceased, the time, place and manner of death being unascertainable by any known person.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">Reviewing the case on its own motion, the Appeals Council reversed, emphasizing that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.705 establishes a presumption of death after seven years only in the case of <em>unexplained </em>absences, and that there was an explanation for the wage earner\u2019s disappearance in this case. The Appeals Council reasoned :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-15\">Where the circumstances surrounding the departure of the missing person are such that his absence can reasonably be explained without inferring his death, his absence, notwithstanding its duration, is not \u201cunexplained\u201d within the meaning of the regulations. Death is not presumed where there is contrary evidence which reveals that a logical reason, other than death, exists to explain the absence of the missing individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">Claimant filed this action seeking review of the Secretary\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>The district court, correctly perceiving the sole issue to be one of law, reversed the Secretary\u2019s decision, holding that the Secretary had \u201capplied too strict a standard in this case.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cthe contention that a wage earner\u2019s disappearance for a period of more than seven years is explained by the suggestion that his absence was occasioned as the result of his attempting to avoid paying child support, is untenable.\u201d This appeal by the Secretary followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The Secretary contends that if he believes that there is a cogent explanation for the disappearance consistent with continued life, he can properly refuse to apply the presumption. Thus, in the Secretary\u2019s view, no affirmative evidence that the insured is alive is necessary. We disagree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The Appeals Council\u2019s rationale virtually creates a presumption of life rather than death. There is nothing in the regulation which requires the claimant to refute every reasonable theory or explanation which may be potentially present or which the Secretary may suggest. As the Ninth Circuit has noted, such an interpretation would \u201cplace an impossible burden of showing a negative upon an applicant. . . .\u201d Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare v. Meza, 368 F.2d 389, 392-393 (9th Cir. 1966). Thus, the <em>Meza </em>court reasoned that \u201c[t]he most that the applicant can be expected to do is to show . that the applicant has no explanation.\u201d The court went on to fashion the following rule: \u201c[W]hen the facts show that a person has been absent from his residence and unheard of for a period of seven years, a presumption arises that he is dead.\u201d 368 F.2d at 392. <em>See also, </em>Gardner v. Wilcox, 370 F.2d 492, 494 (9th Cir. 1966); Miller v. Richardson, 321 F.Supp. 157, 159 (W.D.Pa.1970).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-14\">The presumption is not irrebuttable. As the court noted in Gardner v. Wilcox, <em>supra, </em>370 F.2d at 494, once the presumption is established, \u201c[t]he burden of explanation then shifts to the Secretary, and the presumption can be dissipated \u2018by proof of facts that rationally explain the anomaly of the disappearance in a manner consistent with continued life.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>This standard clearly requires more from the Secretary than mere conjecture as to possible explanations for the wage earner\u2019s disappearance. <em>Meza, supra, </em>368 F.2d at 393. When the Secretary chooses to infer from a mass of conflicting facts surrounding an insured\u2019s disappearance an explanation therefor, he must support that conclusion \u201cby proof of facts\u201d which do \u2014 not merely may \u2014 \u201crationally explain the anomaly of the disappearance in a manner consistent with continued life.\u201d Thus, like the court in Christen v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 439 F.2d 715 (9th Cir. 1971), \u201cwe cannot go along with the Department\u2019s apparent view that one achieves immortality\u201d by disappearing under circumstances not free from doubt. Indeed, such a view would frustrate the purpose of the presumption and eternally render its effect nugatory in all but the clearest of cases. We therefore agree with the Hearing Examiner and the district court that \u201cthe \u2018presumption of death\u2019 [was] not overcome\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Viewing this case against the presumption as we think it should have been applied, we find no substantial evidence to support a contrary conclusion. Indeed, DeMasse was declared dead by the Orphan\u2019s Court in 1968. Of course, this <em>ex parte </em>finding was not binding on the Secretary<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> nor <em>res judicata </em>here. It is not to be completely ignored or discounted, however, for the reality is that this decree of the state court, although <em>ex parte, </em>operates as a profound and comprehensive declaration of rights under state and federal law not pertinent to our present purposes. Moreover, what, by force of time, seemed persuasive to a court in 1968 ought <em>a fortiori </em>to compel the same conclusion in subsequent years. That eleven years have now passed without word of or from DeMasse can only underscore the propriety of the presumption which the Hearing Examiner and the district court applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-9\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.705 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-10\">Whenever it is necessary to determine the death of an individual in order to determine the right of another to a monthly benefit or a lump-sum payment under section 202 of the act and such individual has been unexplainedly absent from his</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-17\">residence and unheard of for a period of seven years, the Administration, upon satisfactory establishment of such facts and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, will presume that such individual has died.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-6\">. The Secretary relies upon Dowell v. Gardner, 386 F.2d 809 (6th Cir. 1967). In Dowell, as here, the adduced facts suggested a plethora of possible explanations for the wage earner\u2019s disappearance. The Secretary speculated at the possible persuasive reasons why one in the insured\u2019s circumstances might choose to absent himself. Finding several such reasons, the Secretary concluded that the absence was not, therefore, unexplained. The Sixth Circuit merely held that the Secretary\u2019s \u25a0 decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Our quarrel is with the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the regulation, not with his analysis of the facts. But though the factual similarity between <em>Dowell </em>and the case at bar are urged on this appeal, we note that Dowell\u2019s animosity toward his family was far more manifest: \u201cAfter being served with process, Dowell burned the house trailer in which the family was residing, containing all the family\u2019s food and clothing.\u201d 386 F.2d at 810.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b846-10\">. The Hearing Examiner, who applied the presumption of death in the case at bar, articulated the rationale for the presumption :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-16\">It is worth noting that what is really at issue here is something which by definition is not provable with the degree of certainty that many facts are; otherwise there would be no reason for the law to provide for a presumption. This doctrine [arises] out of a perceived need for providing a means for settling the affairs of individuals with some finality, and when a length of time elapses which the law regards as reasonable, and seven years is surely that in this day of quick communication and travel, it is a recognized principle that from circumstances meeting certain standards, a presumption may be raised to take the place of a positively known fact.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b846-17\">. Thus, in Miller v. Richardson, 457 F.2d 378 (3d Cir. 1972), evidence at the hearing was held sufficient to explain the absence of claimant\u2019s husband. There, the husband left his family home shortly after a lady friend with whom he had been seen several times disappeared. He phoned his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>wife several days after bis departure, and indicated \u201che had left his home and intended to begin a new life in California.\u201d The court found that Miller\u2019s disappearance was not unexplained, \u201cand that implicit in his departure was an intention to continue living.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\">. The reason for this salutary rule is clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-9\">if he should so limit his consideration of what is the law to that type of adjudication, he might well be under a statutory duty, if various trial courts in <em>ex parte </em>proceedings made mutually exclusive determinations, to apply conflicting rules in identical cases within the same state. In this respect, his mandate is similar to that of the federal courts under the <em>Mrie </em>rule. King v. Order of United Commercial Travellers, 333 U.S. 153, 68 S.Ct. 488, 92 L.Ed. 608 (1948).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-19\">Cain v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 377 F.2d 55, 58 (4th Cir. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b847-13\">VAN DUSEN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AIAZ\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">I respectfully dissent because -of the majority\u2019s conclusion (page 785) that there is no substantial evidence to support the Appeals Council\u2019s decision, as opposed to that of the Hearing Examiner. This court has recently held in considering the application of the controlling regulation (20 C.F.R. 404.705), that its review of the administrative findings \u201cis limited to \u2018ascertaining whether on the record as a whole there is substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s findings of fact.\u2019 \u201d See Miller v. Richardson, 457 F.2d 378 page 379 (3d Cir.). The findings of the Appeals Council in this case, contained in these extracts from its opinion, are supported by substantial evidence:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-15\">\u201cThe claimant filed an application for surviving child\u2019s insurance benefits on January 14, 1969. In supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>statements dated January 14, 1969, the claimant indicated that she and the wage earner were married on August 2, 1952, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; that they had two sons, born in 1953 and 1955; that between August 2, 1952 and June 8, 1961, the date on which the wage earner disappeared and was last seen, they lived together only part of the time, and were separated at least 12 times; and that she sued the wage earner for nonsupport, and a court order for support was issued prior to his disappearance. The claimant further indicated on January 28, 1969, that the wage earner was always changing jobs in an effort to avoid her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-4\">\u201cThe wage earner served several short terms in the Philadelphia House of Correction for desertion and nonsupport. On June 8, 1960, he was committed to Holmesburg Prison to serve a one-year prison term for desertion and nonsupport. He was released on June 8, 1961, disappeared, and has not been seen or heard from since by the claimant, the two children, or any of the wage earner\u2019s known friends or relatives. The claimant stated that she last saw the wage earner when she visited him at Holmesburg Prison in [April 1961],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-5\">* -x- * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">\u201cIt is clear from the regulations that a presumption of death arises only when the wage earner is absent <em>without explanation </em>from his residence and unheard of for a period of 7 years. Where the circumstances surrounding the departure of the missing person are such that his absence can reasonably be explained without inferring his death, his absence, notwithstanding its duration, is not \u2018unexplained\u2019 within the meaning of the regulations. Death is not presumed where there is contrary evidence which reveals that a logical reason, other than death, exists to explain the absence of the missing individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ahr-dedup-0\">-X-\u201cIn the instant ease, the Appeals Council finds that the wage earner\u2019s absence from his former residence is not \u2018unexplained\u2019 within the meaning of section 404.705 of Social Security Administration Regulations No. 4. The wage earner\u2019s serious financial and domestic problems, possibly induced in part at least by gambling, together with the fact that he was a fugitive from justice, in combination, provide a very reasonable explanation for his disappearance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-12\">\u201cIt is further noted by the Appeals Council that at the time of the wage earner\u2019s disappearance he was 28 years of age, apparently in good health, and would now be only 37 years old, or well within a normal life span. Although there is no indication that any friend or relative heard from him during the 7 years after June 8, 1961, this, in itself, is not a sufficient basis for applying a presumption of death, since the regulations clearly do not contemplate that mere successful concealment for 7 years will justify such a presumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-13\">\u201cThe fact that no earnings are entered on his earnings record after June 1960 is not significant, since he may have secured a new social security number under an alias, or worked in jobs not covered by the Social Security Act, or in another country. The successful concealment of his whereabouts does not warrant a presumption that the wage earner has died. Moreover, the presumption of death by the Pennsylvania Court for intestacy purposes, on the basis of more than 7 years\u2019 absence is not a proper basis for presuming his death under the Social Security Act, which specifically requires that he be unexplainedly absent and unheard of for 7 years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>\u201cIt is the decision of the Appeals Council that the evidence of record does not support a presumption that the wage earner is dead . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The <em>Meza </em>opinion, relied on by the majority, points out that the presumption of death where the \u201cindividual has been unexplainedly absent . . . for a period of seven years\u201d (20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.705) may be \u201cdissipated ... by proof of facts that rationally explain the anomaly of the disappearance in a manner consistent with continued life. If evidence of such facts is presented, it is for the Secretary, not the courts, to decide whether to credit the proof, and if it is credited, whether, in light of the evidence, to draw the permissible inference that the missing person is alive\u201d (368 F.2d at 392). See also Dowell v. Gardner, 386 F.2d 809 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The record justifies the finding that the presumed decedent would have taken all steps possible to avoid his wife, particularly after serving his first substantial jail term for non-support (one year) and at a time when he was on probation which would be violated by non-support of his wife and children (R. 71).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A representative of the Social Security Administration summarized an interview with the former wife on January 28, 1969 (R. 74), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-8\">\u201cShe gave a short resume of her life with W/E. They were constantly separating, &amp; she was always battling for support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-9\">\u201cThe W/E was always changing jobs in an effort to avoid her. As soon as she discovered the location of his new place of employment, she would wait for him at the plant on pay days. She would also try to have the court ordered support attached from his wages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-10\">\u201cOn one occasion, she accidentally met W/E as he was entering a subway train with a female friend. She and a girl friend grabbed W/E by both arms, walked him up subway steps, found a police car and had him arrested for nonsupport.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-12\">\u201cIt does not appear likely that W/E would contact his wife if his disappearance was planned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">Since the majority has mentioned the <em>ex parte </em>finding by Pennsylvania trial court that DeMasse was presumed to be dead, even though conceding that such ex <em>parte </em>conclusion is not binding in federal courts (see note 4), it should be noted that under Pennsylvania law the court's function in evaluating the evidence is far more restricted than that of \u201cthe Administration\u201d in the applicable federal regulation (note 1 of majority opinion). In McNulty v. General American Life Ins. Co., 153 Pa.Super. 288, 33 A.2d 796, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-14\">\u201cThe presumption of death naturally depends upon the circumstances in each case. The sufficiency of the evidence to rebut the presumption, once it is shown to exist, is a question of law: . . . The truth, however, of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, upon which the presumption of death is predicated, and every inference fairly deductible therefrom must be assumed by the court in determining that question: <em>tr</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-17\">I would reverse the district court order and either direct the dismissal of the complaint or, at the least, direct remand of the case for reconsideration of the application of 20 C.F.R. 404.705, to this case in light of the interpretation placed on that regulation by this court. See Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 88 ff., 63 S. Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943); Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n v.
