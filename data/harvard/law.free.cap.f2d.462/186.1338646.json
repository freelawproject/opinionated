Union Oil Co. of California, 411 F.2d 897, 908 (9th Cir.), rev\u2019d, on other grounds, 396 U.S. 13, 90 S.Ct. 30, 24 L.Ed.2d 13 (1969). <em>See also </em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Guthrie, 186 F.2d 926, 932-933 (9th Cir.), cert. den., 341 U.S. 904, 71 S.Ct. 614, 95 L.Ed. 1343 (1951); Siebrand v. Gossnell, 234 F.2d 81, 94 (9th Cir. 1956). As stated in <em>Guthrie, supra, </em>186 F.2d at page 933: \u201cwe can not here reverse the action of the trial court unless the verdict can be said to be \u2018grossly excessive\u2019 or . \u2018monstrous.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-27\">The district court held that there was sufficient evidence to justify the giving of the punitive damages instruction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Even </em>assuming that the district court was in error in this regard, a point we need not reach, we hold that appellant was not prejudiced thereby <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>because the verdict in this case was neither \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d nor \u201cmonstrous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-18\">. Three blank forms of verdict were given to the jury: (1) a verdict for the defendant ; (2) A verdict for plaintiffs \u201cwith damages in the sum of $......\u201d ; and (3) A verdict for plaintiff \u201cwith damages in the sum of $.......... and punitive damages in the sum of $...........\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-28\">The jury were instructed to select the form which reflected their verdict, fill it in, sign it, and return it. They used the form of verdict mentioned in (2) above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-14\">. Appellant lias also argued that it was prejudiced by the remarks of appellee\u2019s counsel regarding the non-taxable status of a general damage award. This contention lacks merit for two reasons. First, as pointed out above, the verdict was not excessive. Second, appellant raised no objection to these statements at trial or in his motion for new trial. He therefore cannot urge the objection for the first time on appeal. <em>See </em>United States v. Machado, 457 F.2d 1372 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
