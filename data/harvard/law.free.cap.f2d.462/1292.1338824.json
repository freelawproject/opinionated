Such an order is ap-pealable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-23\">A prosecution for non-support of his minor children in violation of \u00a7 3113.01, Ohio Revised Code, was initiated in Municipal Court against Denman by his former wife. Denman undertook removal to the federal court on the ground that his civil rights are being violated by the Municipal Court. In remanding the case Chief Judge Frank J. Battisti correctly held that \u00a7 1443(1) has no application, no \u201cequal civil rights\u201d of Denman having been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-24\"> It is well settled that \u00a7 1443 is a statute of very limited application. Only when State laws violate \u201cequal civil rights\u201d based on racial grounds is \u00a7 1443(1) applicable. Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780, 792, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L. Ed.2d 925. Broad general allegations of deprivation of civil rights are not sufficient to permit removal. Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808, 827, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944. The action of the District Court in remanding this case to the Ohio Municipal Court is supported by the well-settled law of this Circuit. City of Cleveland v. Corley, 398 F.2d 41 (6th Cir.); Grubbs v. Pound, 374 F.2d 448 (6th Cir.); Townsend v. State of Ohio, 366 F.2d 33 (6th Cir.); Hull v. Jackson County Circuit Court, 138 F. 2d 820 (6th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
