Plaintiffs both appealed to the county court, where the case is still pending, and filed the present action in the federal district court on their own behalf and for all persons similarly situated. Named as defendants were not only the Texas Power &amp; Light Company and its parent and associated companies but also twelve other Texas electric utility corporations. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint attacked the Texas eminent domain laws, Articles 1435 and 1436, Vernon\u2019s Annotated Statutes of Texas, along with the procedure provided in Articles 3264 to 3271 of said Statutes, as violative of various sections of the Constitution of the United States, such as the due process and equal pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>teetion clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the part of Article 1, Section 10 providing that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. After full hearings, the district court entered an order and a supplemental order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. This appeal is from those orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\"> Of course, district court jurisdiction is a necessary pre-requisite to the convening of a three judge court. Further, no three judge court is required because the plaintiffs named no state officer against whom they sought an injunction: 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-5\">Passing by the questions of whether this is properly a class action; whether jurisdiction fails because the amount in controversy is less than $10,000.00; whether a stay of the state court proceedings is prohibited by the federal anti-injunction statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283; whether the decision in <em>Baber, </em>cited <em>supra </em>n. 1, constitutes a defense of collateral estoppel or res judicata as to plaintiffs\u2019 present constitutional attack ;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and indeed whether any substantial federal question is presented; we think that what was said in <em>Baber, supra, </em>applies with equal force to the present litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-6\">\u201cThe plain answer is that the state courts are as firmly bound by the Constitution of the United States as is this Court, and appellants\u2019 forum for the enforcement of any constitutional rights that may have been violated is in the Texas state courts with the right of ultimate determination by the Supreme Court of the United States. State of Georgia v. City of Chatanoo-ga, 264 U.S. 472, 44 S.Ct. 369, 68 L. Ed. 796; National Quarries Co. v. Detroit T. &amp; I.R. Co., 6 Cir., 10 F.2d 139; see also, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2283; Alabama Public Service Commission v. Southern Railway Co., 341 U.S. 341, 71 S.Ct. 762, 95 L.Ed. 1002.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-10\">228 F.2d 666.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-11\">We note also the closing paragraph of plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 original brief filed in this ease: \u201cParticular attention is drawn to the case No. 71-1166, Joiner, et al. vs. City of Dallas, now pending in this Court. The questions bear great similarity.\u201d That case has been much more succinctly disposed of by another panel:</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-12\">\u201cBefore <em>Coleman, Simpson </em>and <em>Roney, </em>Circuit Judges.</p>\n<author id=\"b1382-13\">\u201cPER CURIAM:</author>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-14\">\u201cPlaintiffs-appellants allege that the Texas eminent domain statutes, Vernon\u2019s Ann.Civ.St., Articles 3264-3271 and 6081e, are unconstitutional. They seek declaratory relief, damages and an injunction against condemnation of their property. For the reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal, the judgment of that court is affirmed. Joiner et al. v. City of Dallas, Texas, 329 F.Supp. 943 (N.D.Tex.1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-15\">\u201cAffirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-16\">Joiner et al. v. City of Dallas, 5 Cir. 1971, 447 F.2d 1403.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-17\">The judgment of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is</p>\n<p id=\"A24\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1381-12\">. Not the same tract in previous similar litigation. See Baber v. Texas Utilities Co., N.D.Tex.1955, 128 F.Supp. 753, aff\u2019d, 5 Cir. 1956, 228 F.2d 665.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1382-7\">.
