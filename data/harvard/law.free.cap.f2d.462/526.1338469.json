Defendant deducted the amount as a charge for plaintiff\u2019s unauthorized use of defendant\u2019s flatcar. For the reasons stated below, we hold that defendant is entitled to compensation for this use. However, since the parties disagree as to the amount of the damages that defendant has sustained, we refer the case to a trial commissioner for fact findings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-26\">The undisputed facts are that on July 21, 1966, the Naval Supply Depot tendered to plaintiff\u2019s predecessor, the Great Northern Railway Company, at Seattle, Washington, an empty flatcar owned by the United States Department of Defense. It was to be shipped to the Sharpe Army Depot at Lathrop, California, via Great Northern and Western \u25a0Pacific railroads, with an interchange between their lines to take place at Bie-ber, California. A notation on the bill of lading read, \u201cFREE UNDER MILEAGE TARIFF \u2014 SERIES 7.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-27\">Instead of complying with the transportation contract, represented by the uniform straight bill of lading, Great Northern somehow lost track of the flatcar. It was not until October 17, 1966, that defendant succeeded in locating the car in Canada and had it returned to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>possession at Granite City Army Depot, Granite City, Illinois. Great Northern\u2019s car mileage reports made to the Department of Defense during July, August, and September showed that the car (identified as Car DODX (USAX) 39554) had travelled 1,093 miles on Great Northern\u2019s tracks before making its way to Canada on September 4, 1966.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">On October 27, 1966, defendant presented a claim to Great Northern Railway in the amount of $4,350 which was based on a rental or lease rate of $50.00 per day for the 87 days that defendant was deprived of the use of its flatcar. Great Northern agreed to pay no more than four cents per mile, provided for flatcars in Hinsch\u2019s Mileage Tariff. After repeated efforts to collect from Great Northern proved fruitless, defendant, on May 29, 1968, set off against moneys owing Great Northern under Public Voucher 155874 the amount of $1,422.94. That final claim was based on the rental rate of an out-leased flat railroad car at $500.00 per month, or $16.66 per day, for the 87 days that defendant was deprived of the use of its flatcar, less the amount ($26.-48) remitted by the carrier for car mileage of 662 miles at four cents per mile.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">The plaintiff, a Delaware corporation and common carrier by railroad in interstate commerce, became entitled to all properties and franchises of the former Great Northern Railway Company by merger effective March 2, 1970. On May 12, 1971, plaintiff filed suit in the Court of Claims seeking recovery of the $1,422.94 offset by defendant against moneys owing to its predecessor, Great Northern Railway Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Plaintiff makes two arguments in support of its petition. First, it claims that defendant\u2019s deduction of the $1,422.94 is not authorized by the Interstate Commerce Act because that amount represents a claim for damages rather than an \u201covercharge.\u201d The Government is authorized by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 66 to deduct overcharges by any carrier from other amounts due that carrier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As is apparent from the definition given that term, an overcharge occurs only when the carrier submits a bill for services that is in excess of the amount properly due the carrier. This is quite different from a claim for damages. The defendant admits this, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>agree. See Chicago, M. St. P. &amp; P. R. R. v. Alouette Peat Products, 253 F.2d 449 (9th Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Plaintiffs second argument presents the real issue in this case. It claims that unless the deduction is authorized by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 66, <em>supra, </em>it is unlawful. In other words, plaintiff argues that the Interstate Commerce Act extinguished the Government\u2019s common law right of offset in the situation. We could not disagree more emphatically-</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The general rule of the Government\u2019s right of offset is clearly stated in United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947), wherein the Supreme Court stated at page 239, 67 S.Ct. at page 1602, \u201cThe government has the same right \u2018which belongs to every creditor, to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor, in his hands, in extinguishment of the debts due him.\u2019 \u201d This procedure has been followed in many areas,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> including transportation cases, C &amp; H Transportation Co. v. United States, 193 Ct.Cl. 872, 436 F.2d 480 (1971); Johnson Motor Transport v. United States, 137 Ct. Cl. 892, 149 F.Supp. 175 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Plaintiff relies on Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. Lindell, 281 U.S. 14, 50 S. Ct. 200, 74 L.Ed. 670 (1930), to support its argument that a setoff for damage claims is improper. We do not agree with plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of that case. The Supreme Court held that the practice of determining claims of shippers for loss or damage in suits brought by carriers to collect the transportation charges was not repugnant to the Hepburn Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 6(7), 34 Stat. 587, which prohibited carriers from accepting anything but cash in payment of their charges. The Court expressly stated that \u201c[t]he adjustment of defendant\u2019s demand by counterclaim in plaintiff\u2019s action rather than by independent suit is favored and encouraged by the law. That practice serves to avoid circuity of action, inconvenience, expense, consumption of the courts\u2019 time, and injustice.\u201d 281 U.S. at 17, 50 S.Ct. at 201. According to plaintiff\u2019s reading, there can be no deduction of a damage claim against transportation charges except by adjudication of a court. But that is exactly the situation we have here. Other courts have also approved this procedure, Yale Express System, Inc. v. Nogg, 362 F.2d 111, 114, n. 2 (2d Cir. 1966). We believe that this is an inherently sound procedure which contributes to efficient resolution of opposing claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">The foregoing conclusion then raises the next question of whether, after Great Northern\u2019s payment of $43.72 calculated according to Item 265 of Hinsch\u2019s Mileage Tariff 7-Y, I.C.C. H-29, defendant had any unsatisfied claim for damages which could be set off against the transportation charges owed. Plaintiff\u2019s view is that Hinsch\u2019s Mileage Tariff provided the appropriate measure of damages for Great Northern\u2019s use of the diverted railroad car.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">We believe that plaintiff\u2019s view of the measure of damages is incorrect. Hinsch\u2019s Mileage Tariff applies only to the authorized use of railroad cars. That tariff would provide the measure of payments owed to the Government if its car had been used by Great Northern to carry freight between Seattle, Washington, and Lathrop, California, in the course of returning it to Sharpe Army Depot as provided in the bill of lading. Instead, the ear was used in an entirely unauthorized manner. This question arose in Empire Refineries, Inc. v. Guaranty Trust Co. of New York et al., 271 F. 668 (8th Cir. 1921), in which a tank car owned by the shipper and filled with gasoline was delivered to the railroad company for transportation to a consignee under a bill of lading which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>entitled the shipper to payment for the use of the ear on a mileage basis. The car was not delivered to the consignee, but was diverted by the railroad and not returned to the owner for three months. The railroad argued that the owner was entitled to recover only the amount provided for in the mileage tariff. The court, however, noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">It does not appear from the record that the railway company had any authority to use the tank car except for the transportation of the gasoline to St. Louis. * * * We are of the opinion that the tariff provision of three-fourths of a cent per mile was not intended to apply and did not apply, except as the car moved pursuant to instructions of appellant; that is, from Cushing to St. Louis. <em>Id. </em>at 669.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The court went on to hold that the railroad was the bailee of the car, that the contract of bailment was for its use only in accordance with the bill of lading, and that the diversion of the car was a breach of contract which rendered the railroad company liable for all damages sustained by the owner, including the value of its use while detained. The value of the car\u2019s use in that case was determined by its fair rental value during the period that its owner was deprived of its use. See also, J. C. Francesconi &amp; Co. v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. R., 274 F. 687 (S.D.N.Y.1921); Gustafson v. Michigan Cent. R. R., 296 Ill. 41, 129 N.E. 516, cert. denied 256 U.S. 698, 41 S.Ct. 538, 65 L.Ed. 1177 (1921); New Orleans &amp; N. E. R. R. v. J. H. Miner Saw Mfg. Co., 117 Miss. 646, 78 So. 577 (1918); and Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Sun Drilling Co., 65 Okl. 239, 165 P. 1133 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Plaintiff points out that the <em>Empire Refineries </em>and <em>Gustafson </em>cases involved tank cars which carriers are not obligated to furnish shippers, whereas plaintiff would have been required by statute (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(11)) to provide defendant with a flatcar if one had been requested. Plaintiff thus \u2022 maintains that since the record lacks any proof of damages, the damages suffered by defendant are zero. We do not agree with this conclusion because the benefit to defendant of its ownership, i. e., the right to use its cars as it saw fit, was a valuable right. For example, if one owns a car, it may load or unload it at its pleasure without demurrage. Defendant under the circumstances of this case is entitled to payment for the reasonable value of the use of the car or similar cars. Monarch Refineries, Inc. v. Union Tank Car Co., 193 Okl. 110, 141 P.2d 556 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and grant defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim, limited however, to the issue of liability. Under rule 131(c) (2), we refer the case to a trial commissioner to determine the amount of damages to which defendant is entitled. If the amount of damages defendant is entitled is less than the amount withheld by the defendant as offset, plaintiff will be entitled to judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-5\">. It was used to carry freight during 662 miles, and it was carried empty during 431 miles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-6\">. This is in error, for Great Northern actually paid the mileage rate for both loaded and empty miles, a total of $43.72.
