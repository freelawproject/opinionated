B. Anders, Inc., formerly Service Industrial Cleaners, Inc. [Service]. Service was a Missouri corporation engaged in the business of renting cleaned and laundered towels, seat covers, fender covers, wiping materials and other textiles and apparels, as well as conducting a cleaning and laundering service of similar items, and in general, conducting an industrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>laundry business. For federal income tax purposes, Service charged the above rental items to its expense account at the time they were purchased. At the end of the taxable year, the expense accounts were credited with the cost of items not yet placed into use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">On May 12, 1961, Service\u2019s directors and stockholders passed resolutions approving the terms of a sale of the company\u2019s assets and adopting a plan of complete liquidation pursuant to Section <em>337</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 22 and 23, Service sold substantially all of its assets, including the rental items in question. Pursuant to the plan of liquidation, Service distributed all of its assets, in complete liquidation, to plaintiff within the 12-month period beginning May 12, 1961. The corporation was dissolved in March, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">In the terms of sale, Service agreed with the purchasers on specific consideration to be paid for the rental items ($117,000).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On its income tax return for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1961, Service reported a gain of $163,002.24 from the sale of all its assets, and claimed nonreeognition of the gain under Section 337. This gain included the $117,000 received for the rental items in use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-15\">The sole issue presented by defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is whether the amounts received from the sale of the previously expensed rental items, as part of the sale of all of Service\u2019s assets preceding a complete liquidation, were gain from the sale of property within the provisions of Section 337 for nonreeognition of gain to the corporation, or whether such amounts were taxable as ordinary income to the corporation under the tax benefit principle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-16\">We hold that the amount received was taxable as ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-17\">Plaintiff alleges that the transfer of the rental items to the buyer was a \u201csale\u201d of Section 337(b) (1) \u201cproperty.\u201d He contends that it must follow that the \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d provisions of Section 337(a) require that the gain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>from the transfer of these items <em>not </em>be recognized to the corporation and that the tax benefit rule is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-4\">We agree both that the rental items are \u201cproperty\u201d under Section 337(b) (1) and that the transfer to the buyer was a \u201csale.\u201d We further concur that if the \u201cgain\u201d had been realized from the <em>\u201csale,\u201d </em>it should not have been recognized. However, we feel that the \u201cgain\u201d was not realized from the \u201csale,\u201d but rather from reconverting the previously expensed items into \u201cproperty.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">As noted above, Service had previously expensed these rental items, so that they were no longer shown on Service\u2019s books and records as assets. \u201cThe expense deduction as permitted by regulation is intended to reflect the cost of [items] <em>actually </em>consumed during the taxable year * * Spitalny v. United States, 430 F.2d 195, 197 (9th Cir.1970). Normally, the advantage Service gained through the full expensing of these items in one year would have been balanced by the lack of deduction therefor in the following years. However, the effect of the liquidation is to destroy this balance. Plaintiff\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGJ\">assignment of a zero basis to expensed items is not in response to adjustments in valuation. It amounts, rather, to a present fictional conversion of that \u201cproperty\u201d into a consumed item of expense. If the [rental items] are to revert to \u201cproperty\u201d they should be reconverted. They should not at the same time be property and still retain attributes of a fictional nonentity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1211-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 198. <em>Accord, </em>Connery v. United States, 460 F.2d 1130 (3rd Cir., 1972); <em>see </em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Anders, 414 F.2d 1283 (10th Cir.) cert. denied, 396 U.S. 958, 90 S.Ct. 431, 24 L.Ed.2d 423 (1969); Murray, \u201cDeveloping Uncertainties in Section 337 Liquidations \u2014 The Tax Benefit Rule and Other Problems,\u201d 23 Tax Lawyer 181, 183 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-9\">This reconversion of an ex-pensed item into property is accomplished by use of the \u201ctax benefit rule.\u201d Simply stated, the \u201ctax benefit rule\u201d requires the inclusion, in taxpayer\u2019s income, of an amount which represents a recovery of an item previously deducted, to the extent that the previous deduction was of benefit to him. <em>See </em>Dobson v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 320 U.S. 489, 505-506, 64 S.Ct. 239, 88 L.Ed. 248 (1943); Estate of William H. Block, 39 B.T.A. 338 (1939), aff\u2019d, Union Trust Co. of Indianapolis v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 111 F.2d 60 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 311 U.S. 658, 61 S.Ct. 12, 85 L.Ed. 421 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-10\">Although the \u201ctax benefit rule\u201d usually has been applied where the deduction giving rise to the tax benefit and the recovery occur in different taxable years, it is equally applicable where the deduction and the recovery occur in the same taxable year. Spitalny v. United States, <em>supra, </em>430 F.2d at 198; <em>see </em>Commissioner v. Anders, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-11\">In this case, the \u201ctax benefit rule\u201d gives \u201cto the property sold its true basis as property and den[ies] to it the benefit of an adjusted basis which is false and distorting * * Spitalny v. United States, <em>supra, </em>430 F.2d at 198; <em>see </em>Bishop v. United States, 324 F. Supp. 1105 (M.D.Ga.1971); S. E. Evans, Inc. v. United States, 317 F.Supp. 423 (W.D.Ark.1970). The \u201ctax benefit rule\u201d requires Service to recognize as ordinary income the $117,000 received for the rental items, not as \u201cgain\u201d from the \u201csale,\u201d but as reconversion of the previously expensed items into \u201cproperty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-13\">We find that plaintiff is not entitled to recover. Therefore defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted and plaintiff\u2019s petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">.
