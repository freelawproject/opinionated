ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1241-20\">This appeal, from a conviction of robbery,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> challenges the validity of appellant\u2019s in-home arrest and the incidental seizure of evidence subsequently introduced at his trial. The evidence in question was money allegedly taken during the robbery and a shirt allegedly worn by the party who perpetrated it. Illegality of the seizure is urged on grounds that the arrest was unlawful for noncompliance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the seizure followed a search too broad in scope to satisfy constitutional demands. Concluding that neither the arrest nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>the search exceeded permissible bounds, either statutory or constitutional, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">About 4:45 on a May afternoon, Ethel D. Summers <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was attacked by a young man and robbed of her purse in the lobby of 1820 Clydesdale Place, Northwest, her apartment building.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The man, whom Miss Summers had ample opportunity to scrutinize,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> wore a brown shirt, and the purse contained an envelope enclosing $85 in currency, including a one dollar bill bearing a distinctive red mark.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After the misdeed, the robber made off and Miss Summers, in her words, \u201cwent behind him to see where he was going.\u201d Observing that he fled into 1860 Clydesdale Place, the adjacent apartment building, Miss Summers asked a friend to watch the front door to that building and hurried into her own building for help. Joe Taylor, Jr., informed of the incident, rushed to 1860 Clydesdale in search of the thief while another friend called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">Taylor reached the open rear exit from the basement of 1860 Clydesdale in time to see a man clad in a brown shirt scramble over the back fence and race through the abutting alley. Two police officers, Edward Dowling and Clark T. Smith, arrived on the scene, and were informed of what had transpired. All four then went to Ontario Place, the next street over, to look for the brown-shirted robber. After a brief stop at the home of the neighborhood newsboy,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> they came upon a witness on the sidewalk, Charlotte Filmore, who told them that \u201cthe man that I just seen running\u201d who had \u201calmost knocked me down\u201d \u201cran in this house.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The house to which Mrs. Fil-more directed them was 1884 Ontario Place, appellant\u2019s residence, located about a block from the point at which the robbery occurred.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-19\">To 1884 Ontario the foursome proceeded. Officer Dowling sought admittance at the front door while Officer Smith proceeded to the back door on a similar mission. The officer\u2019s shouts over a five-minute period failed to elicit a response at either door.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, Officer Smith entered the house through the closed but unlocked back door, opened the front door, and a floor-by-floor check of the interior was made.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>Appellant was eventually detected in the attic, nude from the waist up and lying prone in a three-foot crawl space beneath the eaves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>of the roof, and was arrested immediately. In the crawl space beside appellant was a short-sleeved brown shirt. On top of a chest a short distance across the attic was a red cloth wrapped around a wallet containing $85, including a red-marked dollar bill.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Miss Summers unhesitatingly identified appellant as her assailant, the shirt as the one worn by him, and the red-marked bill as part of the $85 in her purse. By Officer Dowling\u2019s estimate, the elapsed time from offense to apprehension was about 15 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">At trial, the Government fully established each of the foregoing events, and introduced the shirt and the money as part of its proof. Appellant presented no evidence whatsoever. The jury found him guilty of robbery as charged, and the judge committed him under the Federal Youth Corrections Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">As previously indicated, appellant advances two grounds for reversal of his conviction. The first is that the requirement of Section 3109 <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that police officers announce their purpose as well as their authority before breaking into a habitation was never met.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The second, predicated upon Ghimel v. California,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is that in any event the search uneov-ering the shirt and the money was too broad to withstand the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement of reasonableness. The record convinces us, however, that if, although only if, the entry into appellant\u2019s house and the ensuing arrest were lawful, so also was the seizure of those items.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-17\">To be sure, as appellant argues, he was arrested and handcuffed when he emerged from the crawl space, and probably could not thereafter have negotiated even the short distance across the attic room to the chest atop which the red cloth enfolding the $85 was. But whatever implications <em>Chimel </em>might have if it were applicable,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> it cannot affect the present situation. The arrest and seizure <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> antedated the <em>Chimel </em>decision and <em>Chimel </em>does not operate retroactively.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Since pre-CMmei doctrine governing the scope of a search incidental to a lawful arrest amply sustains the limited one here,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we cannot accept appellant\u2019s second ground as an independent basis for condemning the reception of the money in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-18\">We are, of course, left with appellant\u2019s Section 3109 grievance, and in that connection some preliminaries are necessary. His thesis is that there was no pre-entry announcement by the officers of their purpose in seeking admission into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>house, and that <em>in con </em>sequence the entry and subsequent arrest and discovery of the shirt and money were illegal. Appellant did not, however, take the course open to him under Criminal Rule 41(e) to move prior to trial for suppression of the use of those items as evidence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Instead, he first objected at trial to their introduction by the Government, and then only as the trial neared its close.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Government argues initially that appellant\u2019s objection was untimely, and that it should not be considered now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Rule 41(e) specifies that motions to suppress the use of evidence \u201cshall be made before trial or hearing unless opportunity therefor did not exist or the defendant was not aware of the grounds for the motion. . . . \u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> While nothing in the record indicates that opportunity to move for suppression was less than abundant if in fact appellant knew that the officers\u2019 pre-entry announcement was deficient, it is not entirely certain that he could have learned of the alleged shortcomings in the announcement until after hearing trial testimony on the transpirations preceding entry.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It was apparently for that reason that the trial judge felt compelled to rule on the merits of the objection rather than reject it as out-of-time. Moreover, the omission of a pretrial suppression motion \u2014 which, to say the least, is not to be recommended <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u2014is not necessarily fatal, for the Rule provides that \u201cthe court in its discretion may entertain the motion at the trial or hearing.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> And although a trial judge may disregard as untimely a suppression motion first presented at trial,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we will review his ruling on the motion if he exercises his discretion in the direction of entertaining it.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It follows, then, that the propriety of the introduction of the shirt and money into evidence is properly before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>We may, however, properly separate out and lay aside two superficially related issues which this appeal in no wise involves. There is no contention that the police officers did not have probable cause to arrest appellant for the robbery of Miss Summers. Nor is there any contention that in the circumstances the officers were obliged to seek an arrest warrant before undertaking to come into appellant\u2019s house. Neither of these points was raised in the trial court, with the result that the record is less than full in these respects. But even the as-is record portrays a chain of events pointing the finger of guilt strongly toward appellant.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It also reveals a serious crime of violence committed, the perpetrator at large bearing evidence of the crime \u2014 which expectably would soon be concealed \u2014 and the distinct probability that further flight would be attempted if his apprehension was appreciably delayed.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It is much too late, then, to indulge any assumption that the officers did not have ample cause to believe that the occupant of the house was the culprit and that his prompt arrest was imperative.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">Even the one point litigated- \u2014 that the officers did not comply with Section 3109 before entering appellant\u2019s house \u2014 -needs considerable sharpening. The record, though underdeveloped on the issue because of the way it arose and was disposed of in the trial-court, describes eloquently the magnitude of the officers\u2019 efforts to summon the occupant to the door. For some time prior to the entry \u25a0 \u2014 -five minutes, the testimony establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>\u2014Officer Dowling stood \u201cbeating, knocking on the [front] door loudly and shouting \u2018Police officer, open up; police officer, open up,\u2019 \u201d while Officer Smith was similarly \u201chollering at the back door. . . . \u201d By Miss Summers\u2019 description, the officers \u201cknocked and knocked and tried to get in for about five minutes and nobody answered . . . ; \u201d by Taylor\u2019s, the officers \u201cscreamed out as loud as they possibly could and no one answered.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> By no means, then, was this a ease of a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> or one effected on but an insubstantial attempt to avoid a breaking.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">Because appellant\u2019s objection to introduction of the evidence seized did not lead to a hearing on the Section 3109 issue, it is quite conceivable, as the Government states, that the record does not reflect all relevant details, including a possible announcement of the officers\u2019 purpose as well as authority.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Put another way, it cannot be said that the officers did not actually proclaim their purpose in seeking entry, but only that the record does not affirmatively demonstrate that they did. The trial judge made his ruling on the trial testimony, which was directed to trial issues and not the legality o.f the entry, in the apparent feeling that a separate investigation into the latter was unnecessary. For our part, while a remand 'for full development of the facts surrounding entry might well show that purpose as well as authority was declared, we think the as-is record supplies enough to demonstrate that under the circumstances even a failure to announce purpose did not vitiate appellant\u2019s arrest or the concomitant evi-dentiary discoveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-16\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-17\">Section 3109 imposes a general ban upon a federal officer\u2019s breaking into a habitation \u201cto execute a search warrant\u201d unless \u201cafter notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance. \u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> That command is central to the problem we now consider. For while, absent constitutional barriers,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> the legal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>ity of appellant\u2019s in-home arrest is to be tested by District of Columbia law,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> the criteria specified in Section 3109 \u2014 which has nationwide operation \u2014 are \u201csubstantially identical\u201d to judicially formulated District requirements.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Those criteria govern entries not only for warranted searches but also those contemplating warrantless arrests,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and they come into play even though the circumstances may be sufficiently exigent to dispense with need for a warrant.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s attribution of unlawfulness to his arrest from the assertedly unlawful entry into his house is thus to be measured by Section 3109 as an embodiment of the District law applicable at the time.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">Indubitably, Officer Smith\u2019s entry through the closed but unlocked back door was an intrusion to which Section 3109 would ordinarily apply.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The more so was his unlocking and opening of the front door to admit the others.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Although the record nowhere indicates just how much of the house appellant was privileged to occupy,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> we may assume that his entitlement extended to the attic wherein he was found.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> And while the officers\u2019 shouts identifying themselves as police officers was a sufficient announcement of their authority,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> notice of their purpose in seeking entry, unless excused, was in equal measure a statutory prerequisite.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>It is now well settled, however, that the announcement rule is not without exceptions.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has recognized that under some conditions strict observance of the statutory requirements may be excused,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and this court and those in other circuits have so held.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> We need not delineate the full panoply of judicially defined exemptions in this still developing area of the law.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> We do, however, examine one which we believe exonerated the officers here from serving notice of their purpose, if indeed they really did not do so.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">That a declaration of the purpose of an entry is unnecessary where the occupant already understands it appears as part of the American common law on the subject,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> including the common law of the District of Columbia <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> And in Miller v. United States,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> the leading Section 3109 case, the Supreme Court hypothesized the possibility \u201cthat, without an express announcement of purpose, the facts known to officers would justify them in being virtually certain that the [occupant] already knows their purpose so that an announcement would be a useless gesture.\u201d <footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Decisions since <em>Miller, </em>including one of our own, have held that express notice of purpose is unnecessary where from the officer\u2019s view of the situ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>ation the occupant must surely have known why admittance into a habitation was desired.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> And in Ker v. California,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> four members of the Supreme Court expressly subscribed to an exception to the Fourth Amendment notice mandate \u201cwhere the persons within already know of the officers\u2019 authority and purpose.\u201d <footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\">Additionally, in <em>Bosley v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>61</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we concluded that in particular circumstances <em>Miller\u2019s </em>\u201cuseless gesture\u201d exception <footnotemark>62</footnotemark> might come into play even though the occupant is oblivious to the presence, and so to the objective, of police officers seeking entry. In that case officers, after knocking at the entrance to a suspect\u2019s apartment and drawing no response, saw through the partially open door that he was asleep. We realized that prior application of the \u201cuseless gesture\u201d exception had involved instances where \u201cthe arresting officers were justified in being virtually certain that the person to be arrested knew their purpose. . . . \u201d <footnotemark>63</footnotemark> We reasoned, however, that \u201c[s]ince [the suspect] had not been awakened by their knocking, the officers could reasonably have concluded that further knocking or verbal announcement would be a \u2018useless gesture.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>64</footnotemark> To have stated their purpose \u201cbefore entry,\u201d we said, \u201cwould have been a useless gesture as the person the statute is designed to protect, the occupant, was asleep and the indications to the officers were that he was not capable of hearing them as he had not been awakened by their knocking.\u201d <footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-13\"> Our evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the entry in the case at bar<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> persuades us to the conclusion that it falls well within one or more variations of the \u201cuseless gesture\u201d exception. We may profitably summarize the relevant circumstances at this point. Miss Summers watched the brown-shirted robber as he ran with the snatched purse into the adjacent apartment building. Just a bit later, Taylor saw a brown-shirted man flee from that building over the back fence and through the alley in the rear. Mrs. Filmore, almost bowled over by a man racing along the next street over, saw him take refuge in a house on that street.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The offense was reported immediately, the officers arrived within minutes, and within another few minutes had followed the trail marked by eyewitnesses from the scene of the crime to appellant\u2019s very doorstep. The combination of events reported to the officers and the short time lapse from the offense to their arrival<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>the foundation for a conviction that their man was there.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">Before entering the house, Officers Dowling and Clark endeavored strenuously to elicit an answer at one or the other of its two exterior doors. Their knocking, their shouting \u2014 \u201cpolice officer, open up\u201d \u2014 continued in vain for five minutes. Plainly they gave notice, loudly and unambiguously,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> that they were police officers<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> and that they sought admittance.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> That notice resounded over and over but nothing happened. There was more than ample room for a natural deduction by anyone that the man inside was not going to respond.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">That, in sum, was the situation immediately prior to the officers\u2019 entry; there was, indeed, even more to the situation, as we shall later see.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The task at hand is to determine whether, upon a prudent calculation of the probabilities, an express announcement of the officers\u2019 purpose was destined to amount to more than an exercise in futility. By our appraisal, any hypothesis the circumstances might tolerate is intercepted by some branch of the \u201cuseless gesture\u201d exception to the announcement requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-17\">We turn first to the facet of \u201cuseless gesture\u201d suggested in <em>Miller </em>and accepted in other decisions \u2014 facts known to officers which generate a firm assurance that their purpose is already known.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Here the crucial inquiry is whether the circumstances the officers faced provided a high caliber basis for a judgment on their part that their purpose was already known to the occupant. In treating that facet, we must, of course, act on the appearances as they were portrayed to the officers themselves.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>most glaring of those appearances were the robber\u2019s flight from the scene of the crime into the house, his continued presence there when minutes later the officers arrived, and his adamant refusal to honor the entreaties of self-identified police officers to come to the door. We need not ponder a choice from among variations in judicial characterizations of the standard which the facts underlying an officer\u2019s belief in a suspect\u2019s awareness of his purpose must meet in order to render a declaration of purpose unnecessary.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Flight with fresh pursuit has long been the classic case pregnant with the probability that such a belief is fully warranted,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> and we think that upon any realistic view of the combination of circumstances confronting the officers here, even the highest test of justification was met.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-4\">We look next to the strand of \u201cuseless gesture\u201d doctrine incorporating the common law exception activated when the objective underlying a sought-after entry is actually known by the occupant.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> That exception depends upon the capability of the evidence to show that the occupant was in fact aware <footnotemark>81</footnotemark> and in that connection it would seem that all conduct of the occupant relative to the inquiry\u2014 post-entry as well as pre-entry \u2014 -is to be considered.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> So appraised, the evidence here leaves no room for doubt as to appellant\u2019s realization of the mission of the officers at his doors. The crucial fact is that after the officers\u2019 prolonged knocking and shouting while outside and their continued announcement of presence and authority as they combed the house inside, appellant sought to escape detection by hiding in the crawl space under the eaves of the roof. For that we find no plausible explanation other than his understanding of the officers\u2019 purpose all too well.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-11\">This case is unlike those in which the Supreme Court and this court have declined to apply the exception under discussion. In Miller,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> officers knocked at the door to the suspect\u2019s apartment, replied \u201cpolice\u201d in a low voice when asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>who was there, and barged in after the door was partially opened but almost simultaneously was sought to be closed.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> In Hair v. United States, <footnotemark>86</footnotemark> as three officers converged on the suspect\u2019s house, a man opened the door, started out but then turned and ran back in with the officers in close pursuit. Similarly, the suspect in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United </em>States<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> ran, and the one in Accarino v. United States <footnotemark>88</footnotemark> strolled, into his living quarters upon sight of officers who forced their way in moments later. The common difficulty in those situations was that the events relied on to demonstrate the officers\u2019 conviction of awareness of their authority and purpose were ambiguous, and consequently did not afford a sound basis for a conclusion that a proper announcement would have been useless.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> As we have indicated, however, we view the situation now before us very differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">It may be that, upon a full evidentiary exploration into the circumstances surrounding the officers\u2019 entry into appellant\u2019s house, the case at bar would merit a finding that Section 3109 was fully complied with, or would summon even more from recognized exceptions to the notice requirement.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Our call, however, is to avoid an unnecessary burden on the District Court. To us, the facts and circumstances already of record dictate but one result squaring with the precedents and consistent with common sense. The judgment of appellant\u2019s conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1241-21\">.

We believe that the determination to be made is objective \u2014 whether the circumstances warranted a reasonably confident conclusion by the officers that their purpose was already known. See Miller v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 34, 357 U.S. at 310, 78 S.Ct. 1190; Bosley v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 40, 138 U.S.App.D.C. at 269, 426 F.2d at 1263. <em>Cf. </em>Ker v. California, <em>supra </em>note 18, 374 U.S. at 63, 83 S.Ct. 1623 (opinion of Justice Brennan), stating the view of four members on the constitutional test. We note, however, that the record also supports an affirmative subjective determination on that score. The officers were led to appellant\u2019s house by information supplied by eyewitnesses and they arrived there very shortly after the offense was committed. Unlike their previous stop at the newsboy's residence, where they tarried but briefly, they persisted at appellant\u2019s house until they were finally able to bring him out. The din and clamor at appellant\u2019s door making it clear that they were officers of the law seeking entry met only with silence within. Yet the officers did not leave to search elsewhere, but rather made their way in. And once inside they combed the premises methodically and thoroughly, continually announcing their presence and authority, until they flushed appellant out of his hiding place under the eaves of the roof. Appraising the officers\u2019 inner thoughts by their outward manifestations, we perceive no lack of their confidence in the suspect\u2019s awareness of their purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"77\">\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">.
