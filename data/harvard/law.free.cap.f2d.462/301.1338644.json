ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Appellant was convicted by a jury on each of two counts of violation of the District of Columbia Code. One charged appellant with an assault on Willie Pel-zer with a dangerous weapon, an offense punishable by Section 22-502.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The other charged him with mayhem on Pelzer and maliciously disfiguring him, a crime for which Section 22-506 sets the penalty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s evidence showed that appellant threw lye on Pel-zer, burning his eyes and other parts of his body. The jury, under instructions not here in issue, rejected appellant\u2019s claim that he acted in self-defense. The trial judge imposed concurrent sentences of imprisonment, each within its statutory maximum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The conviction under Section 22-502 is not seriously challenged, nor hardly can it successfully be. We have long been wedded to the view that lye-throwing may constitute an assault with a dangerous weapon,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the evidence here was more than ample to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict that appellant unjustifiably had done just that. The main contention on appeal is that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction under Section 22-506. In support of that position, appellant urges that his act did not totally destroy Pel-zer\u2019s eyesight and that no permanent injury was caused. In our view of the facts of record and the applicable law, neither of these arguments can prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-16\">To be sure, mayhem in the early common law was committable only by infliction of an injury which substantially reduced the victim\u2019s formidability in combat. As a crime jeopardizing the King\u2019s prerogative to the aid and assistance of its subjects in battle,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> mayhem directed its focus toward physical disablement rather than comeliness or completeness in bodily functioning. By Blackstone\u2019s classic definition, the offense was \u201cthe violently depriving another of the use of such of his members as may render him the less able in fighting, either to defend himself, or to annoy his adversary.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus mayhem included \u201cthe cutting off, or disabling, or weakening a man\u2019s hand or finger, or striking out his eye or foretooth, or depriving him of those parts the loss of which in all animals abates their courage.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the other hand, \u201cthe loss of one of the jaw teeth, the ear, or the nose, is no mayhem at common law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>as they can be of no use in fighting.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In sum, \u201cif the injury be such as disfigures him only, without diminishing his corporeal abilities, it does not fall within the crime of mayhem.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">That body of ancient doctrine can hardly afford reliable guidance in the interpretation of a statute promulgated in an age and milieu in which individual and social values are vastly different. Indeed, at an early period English criminal law in mayhem-related fields underwent gradual expansion in consequence of a series of statutes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> By 1670, the best remembered \u2014 the Coventry Act<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 embraced particular malicious acts which disfigured one\u2019s body without necessarily decreasing his pugilistic might. That trend has influenced much of the widespread legislation on mayhem-type crimes now found in the United States.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">What, then, originated as the narrow common law offense of mayhem is generally today a statutory offense of considerably larger dimensions. The transition has been accompanied, if not induced, by a shift in emphasis from the military and combative effects of the injury to the preservation of the human body in normal functioning.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The statutory counterparts of nonstatutory mayhem doubtless include all that the common law proscribed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But what is important now is not the victim\u2019s capacity for attack or defense, but the integrity of his person.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">So, too, we think manifestly, is the character of Section 22-506. It prohibits not only \u201cmayhem\u201d but also \u2014 and much more broadly \u2014 \u201cmaliciously disfiguring another.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We take it that the offense under that section, like common law mayhem, requires permanence of injury or disfigurement in some appreciable form.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But Pelzer, appellant\u2019s victim, spent six days in a hospital after the offensive incident and underwent post-hospitalization treatment over a period of about a month. When, eight months after the incident, the case reached trial, Pelzer\u2019s vision in one eye ranged from \u201cpretty good\u201d downward to the point that at times he could see nothing at all. He also continued to bear scars on his face, neck and shoulders from the burns generated by the lye. The trial judge instructed the jury that appellant could be found guilty on the Section 22-506 count only in the event the evidence demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that he had sustained permanent injury. The verdict, then, implicitly incorporated such a finding and the evidence, in our view, adequately underpinned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\"> Not even at common law did the injury mayhem required need to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>completely destructive of one of the human senses.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Still less is the need under the statute. For whatever \u201cmayhem\u201d in Section 22-506 may be thought to cover,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> disfigurement is something else again. In laymen\u2019s language, to disfigure is \u201cto make less complete, perfect, or beautiful in appearance or character,\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and disfigurement, in law as in common acceptation, may well be something less than total and irreversible deterioration of a bodily organ.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We are unwilling to assume that Congress had less concern for a substantial and enduring diminution of eyesight than for loss of a front tooth,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> which dental science can readily rectify.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In our view, Section 22-506 may be infringed not only by an injury which renders an organ or member wholly useless but also by damage which leaves its usefulness greatly impaired.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And it goes without saying that the cosmetic effects of scarring may be sufficiently severe to bring the case within the ambit of the disfigurement that section condemns.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">In the ease 'at bar, the jury heard the evidence on the condition of Pelzer\u2019s eyes and his scars were exhibited to the jury. On the evidence, a determination that he was disfigured by appellant\u2019s wrongful act was well within the jury\u2019s province. The judgment of appellant\u2019s conviction is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-10\">. \u201cEvery person convicted of an assault with intent to commit mayhem, or of an assault with a dangerous weapon, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than ten years.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 22-502 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-11\">. \u201cEvery person convicted of mayhem or of maliciously disfiguring another shall be imprisoned for not more than ten years.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 22-506 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-12\">.
