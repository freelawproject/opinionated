He was brought to trial on the possession count and on only one of the importation counts. A jury found de Leon guilty on the possession count, and he was sentenced to a term of fifteen years imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The vehicle de Leon was driving was stopped by Immigration officers at a checkpoint on a main highway leading north from Laredo, Texas, approximately ten miles from the Mexican border. The purpose of the agents\u2019 action was to search for illegal aliens. De Leon was requested to open the trunk of his vehicle. The trunk contained a false bottom. When a small hole was punched in the false bottom, one of the officers detected what he thought to be the smell of marihuana. The agents opened the false bottom where they found three one-pound packages of heroin and a pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">On appeal, de Leon challenges the legality of the search of his vehicle and the admission of evidence seized as a result of the search. We conclude that the search was a reasonable and permissible \u201cborder search\u201d and that the evidence was properly admitted. <em>See </em>United States v. McDaniel, 5 Cir. 1972, 463 F.2d 129; United States v. Bird, 5 Cir. 1972, 456 F.2d 1023 [1972]; United States v. Maggard, 5 Cir. 1971, 451 F.2d 502; American Law Institute Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, Off. Dr. No. 1, \u00a7 260.2; Barnett, A Report on Search and Seizures at the Border, 1 Crim.L.Q. 36 (1963); Note, Search and Seizure at the Border, 21 Rutgers L.Rev. 513 (1967); Note, 10 Ariz.L.Rev. 457 (1968); Note, 77 Yale L.J. 1007 (1966); Note, 115 U.Pa.L.Rev. 276 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Stopping the automobile ten miles from the Mexican border to search for illegal aliens was reasonable. <em>See </em>United States v. McDaniel, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Warner, 5 Cir. 1971, 441 F. 2d 821; Marsh v. United States, 5 Cir. 1965, 344 F.2d 317, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1225, 1357; 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 482, 1581, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.1; 19 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 23.1(d), 23.11. Once the vehicle was reasonably stopped pursuant to an authorized border check the agents were empowered to search the vehicle, including the trunk, for aliens. <em>See </em>Ramirez v. United States, 5 Cir. 1959, 263 F.2d 385; United States v. Miranda, 9 Cir. 1970, 426 F.2d 283. Upon discovering the \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d false bottom in the trunk, the agents could reasonably search the cavity for illegally imported narcotics. \u201cBorder Patrol agents wear two hats, one as an immigration officer and the other as a customs officer.\u201d United States v. McDaniel, <em>supra. See </em>United States v. Bird, <em>supra. </em>The agent testified at trial that he had had a similar experience in a vehicle that contained a large quantity of marihuana. Given the suspicious false bottom on a vehicle near the Mexican border and the agent\u2019s awareness of the large quantity of narcotics smuggled across the border in that area, the officers had reason to suspect that the vehicle contained illegal narcotics. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 482; United States v. Valdez, 5 Cir. 1972, 456 F.2d 1140; United States v. Salinas, 5 Cir. 1971, 439 F.2d 376; United States v. Maggard, <em>supra. </em>Because the search was reasonable, the evidence as a result of the search was properly admitted at trial. Border searches are authorized \u201cirrespective of the existence of reasonable cause to believe that there are seizable things in the . vehicle\u201d provided that such searches shall be \u201cin accordance with reasonable legislative or administrative standards . . . and reasonable under the circumstances of the particular case\u201d. American Law Institute Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, Proposed Official Draft No. 1., \u00a7 260.2(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">De Leon also asserts that a traffic ticket, introduced at trial to prove, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, that de Leon had previously driven the vehicle in which the narcotics were found, was not furnished to him prior to trial. De Leon did not, however, secure a ruling on a motion for discovery which might have entitled him to production of the traffic ticket. The ticket was not, of course, \u201cevidence favorable to an accused . . . material either to guilt or to punishment\u201d so as to fall within the requirements of Brady v. Maryland, 1963, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed.2d 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Finally, de Leon argues that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal when it was discovered after the verdict that one of the jurors was under indictment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1865(b) (5). This contention would not entitle de Leon to a new trial, much less a judgment of acquittal. <em>See </em>Atlas Roofing Mfg. Co. v. Parnell, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F. 2d 1191; Ford v. United States, 5 Cir. 1953, 201 F.2d 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
