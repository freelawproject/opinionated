One hundred fifty-eight benzedrine tablets were found in the pocket of a jacket in the cab of the camper.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-18\">Questions raised on appeal are whether the search and seizure were lawful, whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the marijuana had been unlawfully imported by appellant and whether appellant knew it had been unlawfully imported when he transported it.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-19\">The search and seizure were plainly lawful. The circumstantial evidence of knowledge of unlawful importation on Count 2 of the Indictment, though not overwhelming, was clearly sufficient to support the jury verdict. The question of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the smuggling charge of Count 1 need not be reached since the sentences on Counts 1 and 2 were identical and concurrent. United States v. Aranda, 9th Cir., 1972, 457 F. 2d 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-20\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
