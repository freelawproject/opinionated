E. Bassett Co. (Bassett) established use and registration <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the mark TRIM and marks based on the word TRIM prior to the application for registration of TRIMLINE by appellant J. Wiss &amp; Sons Co. (Wiss). It was established that Bassett began using the mark TRIM on fingernail clippers in 1947 and the line of goods upon which that mark or marks based on that mark were used expanded considerably before appellant\u2019s first use of the mark TRIMLINE. Bas-sett has heavily advertised its marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>It was stipulated that appellant has sold grass shears under the mark QUICK-TRIM from 1939 to date, with the exception of the war years. At the time Wiss began using TRIMLINE on shears and scissors, it was well acquainted with Bassett\u2019s product line and trademark. Wiss\u2019 use of the mark includes use on personal grooming items such as barber shears and pocket scissors.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The board held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">There can be no doubt from the record that Bassett\u2019s use of \u201cTRIM\u201d on personal grooming items such as fingernail clippers, toenail clippers, tweezers, nail files and the like substantially antedate[s] Wiss\u2019 use of \u201cTRIMLINE\u201d on its shears and scissors. Furthermore, even though Bas-sett\u2019s use of \u201cTRIM\u201d on scissors was subsequent to Wiss[\u2019] use of \u201cTRIM-LINE\u201d on scissors and shears, Bassett has superior right in \u201cTRIM\u201d as to scissors by virtue of its prior use thereof on such closely related goods as fingernail and toenail clippers and other personal grooming items, [citing cases]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">In view thereof and since \u201cTRIM\u201d and \u201cTRIMLINE\u201d are substantially similar, the term \u201cLINE\u201d merely referring to a line of goods and therefore having no trademark significance, it is adjudged that there is likelihood of confusion and that the continued existence of Wiss\u2019 registration is inimical to Bassett\u2019s rights in \u201cTRIM\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Before us, appellant Wiss contends, based on the use of QUICK-TRIM, \u201c[i]t is appellant that has the superior right to use \u2018TRIM\u2019 in whatever form on any cutting implement, since it would be using its mark in the normal expansion of business, i. e., from grass shears to scissors and shears.\u201d Appellant also argues that TRIM, because of its descriptiveness, is a weak mark which \u201ccould not have acquired any secondary meaning due to appellant\u2019s long prior and concurrent use of its trademark \u2018QUICK-TRIM\u2019 and the existence of [certain] third party registrations for \u2018TRIM\u2019 and other marks including \u2018TRIM\u2019 * * For similar reasons appellant contends that appellee is not entitled to the protection given the owner of a \u201cfamily\u201d of trademarks. Finally, appellant asserts that there is no likelihood of confusion between the marks as applied to the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">Appellant\u2019s contentions that the mark TRIM is incapable of distinguishing goods is totally without merit. While the term may be highly suggestive of the functions of some of the goods on which it is used, such as nail clippers, it is not so as to other goods, such as nail files, to which it is also applied. More importantly, the record in this case solidly establishes that Bassett has developed a strong secondary meaning for the mark. Even appellant\u2019s President, Vice President and one of its Assistant Sales Managers have admitted that they identify TRIM with Bassett. See also W. E. Bassett Co. v. H. C. Cook Co., 156 F. Supp. 209 (D.Conn.1957); W. E. Bas-sett Co. v. Revlon, Inc., 147 U.S.P.Q. 309 (S.D.N.Y.1965), aff\u2019d 354 F.2d 868 (2d Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\"> When the identical marks are being used on different lines of goods, and the issue is whether the prior user\u2019s line of goods would normally or reasonably expand to include the other line of goods, the answer depends on whether the goods \u201cwere of such a nature that purchasers would generally expect them to emanate from the same source.\u201d J. C. Hall Co. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., 340 F.2d 960, 963, 52 C.C.P.A. 981, 985 (1965). We think that where the question of normal expansion of trade arises between <em>different </em>marks applied to different lines of goods, the differences between the marks must also be considered. Depending upon that difference, the prior user may not be \u201cexpanding\u201d an established trade under an established mark at all. Considering the differences between the marks and between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>the product lines in the present case, we are of the opinion that the use of QUICK-TRIM established in this record was not such that a customer seeing TRIMLINE on barber shears or pocket scissors would think that they came from the maker of QUICK-TRIM grass shears.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Under the facts of this case it is unnecessary to determine whether Bassett has established ownership of a family of marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">As to the issue of likelihood of confusion between Bassett\u2019s marks and TRIMLINE, we are unable to improve on the board\u2019s reasoning, quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-12\">. 162 USPQ 301 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-13\">.
