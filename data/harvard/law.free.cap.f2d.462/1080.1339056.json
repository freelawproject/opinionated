App. \u00a7 462 for his failure to notify his local draft board on or about January 12, 1967, of a fact that might have affected his draft status, specifically, that his wife and children were no longer living with him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Figurell appeals from this conviction, claiming that the evidence presented at the trial failed to establish an essential element of the charge, that is, that his violation of the Selective Service rule requiring him to notify his local board of this situation was done \u201cwilfully and knowingly.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons to be stated, we agree and reverse Figurell\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-22\">In order to convict Figurell of a violation of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462, the United States was required to prove not only that Figurell failed to perform his duty to report to his local board the fact that he was no longer living with his wife and children,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but also that Figurell knew of this duty and intended not to perform it. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>v. Williams, 421 F.2d 600 (10th Cir. 1970); United States v. Rabb, 394 F.2d 230 (3d Cir. 1968).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Ward v. United States, 344 U.S. 924, 73 S.Ct. 494, 97 L.Ed. 711, rev\u2019g 195 F.2d 441 (5th Cir. 1952). Furthermore, the United States was required to establish that Figurell\u2019s knowledge of this duty and intent to evade it existed \u201con or about January 12, 1967,\u201d when it was alleged in the indictment that Figurell violated his duty to report the fact that his wife and children were no longer living with him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was no direct evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>dence of Figurell\u2019s knowledge of this duty during this period. The district court, however, relied essentially on two sets of circumstantial evidence in finding that Figurell had the requisite knowledge: Figurell\u2019s good record of reporting to his local board information which was favorable to his III-A deferment status, and Figurell\u2019s delivery of a certain forged letter to the local board on May 25, 1967. After a careful consideration of these factors, as well as the other evidence in the record, we have concluded that there is insufficient evidence in the record to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Figurell knew, on or about January 12, 1967, that he had a duty to report the fact that he was not living with his wife and children and that he \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d failed to make such report within the prescribed 10-day period (see note 5, <em>swpra) </em>.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">The district court was certainly correct in concluding that it was reasonable to infer from Figurell\u2019s good record of reporting information favorable to his III-A status that he was aware of his duty to report unfavorable facts. Indeed, his Selective Service file reveals that by January 12, 1967, Figurell had already reported at least one unfavorable fact to his local board.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This record however, does not support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Figurell knew in January 1967 that he had a duty to report the particular fact involved in the instant case, that is, the fact that his wife and children were no longer living with him. The facts that Figurell had reported to his draft board prior to January 12, 1967, were all objective facts which were clearly relevant to a III-A deferment status. These facts included his marriage on June 18, 1963 (reported on July 22, 1963), his wife\u2019s pregnancies (reported on July 23, 1963, and December 3, 1964), his wife\u2019s miscarriage in. November 1963 (reported on April 8, 1964), and the births of his children on December 31, 1964, and December 7, 1965 (reported on January 8, 1965, and January 11, 1966, respectively).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This record indicates that Figurell was aware that his local board should be informed of changes in his \u201cmarital status\u201d in the sense of whether he was married or not, since he had reported the fact of his marriage to the Board.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But there is no substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>evidence in Figurell\u2019s Selective Service record from which it may be inferred that Figurell knew during January 1967 that the fact that his wife and children were not living with him must be reported to the local board.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the roughly three-and-one-half years of their marriage prior to January 12, 1967, Fi-gurell\u2019s wife had left him approximately six times for periods ranging from several weeks to several months.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> None of these separations had been reported to Figurell\u2019s local board,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and in each case Figurell\u2019s wife and children had eventually returned to live with him. Thus, as the district court acknowledged,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Figu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>rell\u2019s past record of reporting changes to his local board cannot sustain his conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1146-25\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>\u201cThe United States has shown that the defendant had a good record of reporting information favorable to maintenance of the preferred III-A deferment status, and claims one may infer from this that defendant knew of the duty to report those incidents unfavorable to his III-A status. Such an inference is a reasonable one, although not enough in and of itself to sustain a conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>The proof which the district court found justified Figurell\u2019s conviction included a May 15, 1967, letter contained in Figurell\u2019s Selective Service file. This letter, which purported to be from Mrs. Figurell but was in fact a forgery, stated that she and her children were now living with Figurell.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Apparently, as a result of this letter, Figurell was reclassified from I-A to III-A on June 8, 1967. Although Figurell denied ever having seen the forged letter or having anything to do with its writing (N.T. 76-77),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Miss Haggerty, the Executive Secretary of the local board, testified that Figurell personally delivered it to her (N.T. 32) ,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The district court apparently accepted Miss Haggerty\u2019s testimony and reasoned that Figurell\u2019s delivery of this letter on May 15, 1967, was sufficient under the circumstances <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to justify a finding that Figurell knew, on or about January 12, 1967, of his duty to report his separation from his wife and children.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We cannot agree. The only relevance which this forged letter has to Figurell\u2019s guilt is the light which it casts on the state of Figurell\u2019s knowledge on or about January 12, 1967.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Presumably the district court reasoned that if Figurell delivered the May 15, 1967, forged letter stating that he and his wife were living together, it could be inferred that he was aware of its contents and therefore knew that this fact was relevant to a III-A classification. From this knowledge it could then be inferred from his past record of reporting facts to the local board which he knew to be relevant to his III-A classification that Figurell knew, on or about May 15, 1967, that he had a duty to report the fact that his wife and children were no longer living with him. Even in the absence of additional circumstances, however, proof of this knowledge on May 15, 1967, would be at best weak evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>Figurell\u2019s knowledge of this duty on or about January 12, 1967, some four months earlier.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But in the instant case, Figurell\u2019s Selective Service file indicates that he was reclassified from III-A to I-A on February 17, 1967, apparently as the result of a report by his wife to the local board on February 9, 1967, that she and their children were no longer living with Figurell. Thus, at least by the time that he received notice of his reclassification on or about February 17, 1967,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Figurell became aware of the fact that he could not maintain or secure a III-A deferment if his wife and children were not living with him. In these circumstances, proof that he also had such knowledge on May 15, 1967, when the forged letter was brought into the local board, has slight, if any, additional probative value on the question of whether Figurell had such knowledge on or about January 12, 1967.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-13\">From the foregoing, we conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Figurell had knowledge on or about January 12, 1967, of his duty to report the fact that his wife and children were no longer living with him.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction will be reversed and the case remanded for entry of judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1143-11\">.

Neither the district court nor the parties have articulated the exact basis of Figurell\u2019s conceded duty to report this separation to his local board. This duty might arise because this was a change in his \u201cmarital status\u201d or \u201cdependency status\u201d within the meaning of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.1(b) or because it involved the termination of a \u201cbona fide family relationship [maintained with a child or children] in their home\u201d or a change in his wife\u2019s or children\u2019s \u201cdependen [cy] upon him for support\u201d within the meaning of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.30. In view of our disposition of the case, we assume, as Fig-urell has done, without deciding it, that Figurell had a duty to report the fact that his wife and children left him on January 12, 1967. We note, however, that we have not been directed by the parties to any case in which the failure to perform such a duty has been criminally enforced, nor have we discovered such a case in our research of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">. In <em>Babb </em>this court declared, in the context of a conviction under 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a), that \u201c[t]he Government must establish knowledge of the legal obligation and voluntary action or omission with the purpose of failing to perform such obligation.\u201d 394 F.2d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">In United States v. International Minerals &amp; Chemical Corp., 402 U.S. 558, 91 S.Ct. 1697, 29 L.Ed.2d 178 (1971), relied upon in the dissenting opinion, the Court held that in a prosecution for shipping sulfuric acid and hydrofluosilieic acid in interstate commerce and knowingly failing to show on the shipping papers the required classification of this property to wit, corrosive liquid, in violation of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.427, it was not necessary for the Government to prove that the defendant knew of the regulation involved. The rationale of the Court was succinctly stated by Justice Douglas in the last paragraph of the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-7\">\u201cIn <em>Balint </em>[United States v. Balint, 258 U.S. 250, 42 S.Ct. 301, 66 L.Ed. 604] the Court was dealing with drugs, in <em>Freed, </em>[United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356] with hand grenades, in this ease with sulfuric and other dangerous acids. Pencils, dental floss, paper clips may also be regulated. But they may be the type of products which might raise substantial due process questions if Congress did not require, as in <em>Murdoch, </em>[United States v. Murdock, 290 U.S. 389, 54 S.Ct. 223, 78 L.Ed. 381] <em>'mens rea\u2019 </em>as to each ingredient of the offense. But where, as here and as in <em>Balint </em>and <em>Freed, </em>dangerous or deleterious devices or products or obnoxious waste materials are involved, the probability of regulation is so great that anyone who is aware that he is in possession of them or dealing with them must be presumed to be aware of the regulation.\u201d 402 U.S. at 564-565, 91 S.Ct. at 1701.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1144-11\">There was no suggestion in the opinion that its reach extended beyond the case where the defendant has engaged in some active conduct and where \u201cthe probability of regulation is so great\u201d that those falling within its scope \u201cmust be presumed to be aware of the regulation.\u201d In particular, there is no suggestion that the Court intended to overrule its earlier decision in Lambert v. California, 355 U.S. 225, 78 S.Ct. 240, 2 L.Ed.2d 228 (1957), in which the Court vacated a criminal conviction based upon a convicted felon\u2019s failure to register as required by a municipal ordinance. In <em>Lambert </em>Justice Douglas, <em>writing </em>for the majority, noted that \u201cwe deal here with conduct that is wholly passive \u2014 mere failure to register. It is unlike the commission of acts, or the failure to act under circumstances that should alert the doer to the consequences of his deed.\u201d 355 U.S. at 228, 78 S.Ct. at 243. In these circumstances the Court declared :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-14\">\u201cWe believe that actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand.\u201d 355 U.S. at 229, 78 S.Ct. at 243.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1144-15\"><em>Cf. </em>Morisette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 260, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1144-16\">. Actually, since under the terms of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.1(b) (quoted, <em>supra, </em>note 3) Figurell had a duty to report this change in circumstances \u201cwithin 10 days,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>the actual violation of 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462(a) could not take place until 11 days after January 12, 1967, that is, not until January 23, 1967. Thus, the specific inquiry is whether there is sufficient evidence that by this date Figurell had knowledge of his duty to report the separation to his local board. Whether Fig-urell had such knowledge after January 23, 1967, and still failed to report to the local board is relevant only to the extent that it casts light on the state of Fig-urell\u2019s knowledge and intent on January 23, 1967, since Figurell\u2019s failure to report the change to the local board was not a continuing violation of 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462(a). <em>See </em>Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S. 112, 90 S.Ct. 858, 25 L.Ed.2d 156 (1970). Furthermore, even if there were a continuing duty to report the separation to the local board which could form the basis of a criminal conviction for some later period, since the indictment has charged Figurell with a violation only for the period \u201con or about January 12, 1967\u201d (see note 2, <em>supra), </em>conviction for a breach of his duty in some period later than a week or two beyond January 12, 1967, would constitute, at the least, an impermissible constructive amendment of the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1145-10\">. See United States v. Delerme, 457 F.2d 156 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1145-11\">. A note in his Selective Service file indicates that on or about April 8, 1964, Figurell reported that his wife had lost her baby and was no longer expecting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1145-12\">. We note that, although on several occasions Figurell reported relevant facts to his local board more than 10 days after they occurred, there is no indication in the record that Figurell was ever informed that these reports were untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1145-13\">. The United States contends that because Figurell admitted advising his local board of changes in his \u201cmarital status\u201d and the births of his children (N.T. 60), \u201cit may be inferred that Figurell also knew he was required to report to the Local Board that he was neither living with nor supporting his wife and children.\u201d Brief of appellee at 5. We see no reasonable basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>for this inference. There is no evidence in the record that Figurell understood that his \u201cmarital status\u201d was changed by the fact that his wife was not living with him; indeed, at the trial Figurell declared :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1146-5\">\u201cI made contacts [to the local board] of my marital status, <em>my getting married.\" </em>(N.T. 60) (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az9\">Furthermore, the ordinary meaning of the words \u201cmarital status\u201d would not suggest that his wife\u2019s departure under the circumstances was a significant change. \u201cStatus\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (3d ed. 1961) as \u201cthe condition . . . of a person that determines the nature of his legal personality, his legal capacities, and the nature of the legal relations to the state or to other persons into which he may enter.\u201d Thus, the most that can be inferred from the record is that Figurell knew of a duty to report a legal separation, since such a separation would involve a change in his legal relationship to his wife. But there is no substantial evidence in the record that during the period relevant to the indictment (see note 5, <em>supra) </em>Figurell knew or should have known that his wife\u2019s departure with the children was even the beginning of a legal separation, as in fact it proved to be.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>The following colloquy took place on the cross-examination of Figurell by the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1146-8\">\u201cQ.

Mrs. Figurell testified that there were \u201cquite a few separations\u201d and acknowledged that these separations were \u201cat least several weeks\u2019 duration and sometimes months\u2019 duration\u201d (N.T. 42). Figurell agreed that there were \u201cnumerous separations\u201d during the marriage and testified that the separations lasted \u201c[a]nywhere from two and a half weeks to two and a half months\u201d (N.T. 60).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1146-23\">. The contention that Figurell\u2019s failure to report these prior separations tends to support a finding that he knew of his duty to report the January 12, 1967, separation is rejected. Figurell\u2019s failure to report past separations to his local board \u2014-absent other circumstances which do not appear in the record \u2014 is as consistent with ignorance as with knowledge of a duty to make such reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1146-24\">.

At the trial, Figurell\u2019s attorney objected to the introduction of any records in Figurell\u2019s Selective Service file pertaining to incidents occurring after February 9, 1967, on the ground that such matters were \u201cjust irrelevant\u201d (N.T. 11). He did not, however, object to Miss Hag-gerty\u2019s testimony that Figurell personally delivered the May 15, 1967, letter to her (N.T. 32) and he has not pressed on appeal his objection to the introduction into evidence of the May 15, 1967, letter.

App. \u00a7 462(a), his conviction was infirm because there was insufficient proof that he \u201cwilfully and knowingly\u201d violated the law. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">Where the concept of \u201cwilfully and knowingly\u201d becomes central to the litigation, the inconsistency of the relevant case law becomes manifest. Reference to semantic explanations is rarely of great assistance. Often, recourse is made to legislative history for direction, but as regards the specific portion of the Selective Service Act before us, there is no help there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">In an attempt to bring some order out of the chaotic state of statutory and case law, the Commission for the Reform of the Criminal Law has proposed a new codification of the degrees of criminal culpability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 302 of the Proposed New Federal Criminal Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> would place \u201cintentionally\u201d on the highest rung of culpability; and then, in decreasing order, \u201cknowingly,\u201d \u201crecklessly,\u201d and \u201cnegligently.\u201d The Commissioners suggest: \u201cA person engages in conduct . . . (e) \u2018willfully\u2019 if he engages in the conduct intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.\u201d So construed, the proposed code seems to accept the language in United States v. Murdock, 290 U.S. 389, 394-395, 54 S.Ct. 223, 226, 78 L.Ed. 531 (1933): \u201cThe word [\u2018willfully\u2019] often denotes an act which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental. Aid in arriving at the meaning of the word \u2018willfully\u2019 may be afforded by the context in which it is used. . . .\u201d See also, United States v. Vitiello, 363 F.2d 240, 243 (3d Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-19\">Thus, the Code would suggest that what is critical for our analysis is not the equivocal \u201cwillfully\u201d ; rather we must concentrate on \u201cknowingly.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>general meaning is associated with conduct which is voluntary, and not inadvertent or accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">In any event, this elemental emphasis becomes important so there will be no unnecessary confusion between the statutory standard of \u201cknowingly\u201d and the expression \u201cknowledge\u201d which, regrettably, has crept into the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">I do not construe the majority opinion to suggest, nor do I understand this court to have ever held, that in a criminal prosecution under the Selective Service Act, the government must prove that the defendant had actual knowledge of the allegedly violated statute or regulation. Such an interpretation would run counter to orthodox traditions associated with prosecutions of those cases in which it is not necessary to prove specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">In United States v. International Minerals &amp; Chemical Corp., 402 U.S. 558, 563, 91 S.Ct. 1697, 1701, 29 L.Ed.2d 178 (1971), the Court had before it a conviction based on an information that the defendant \u201c \u2018did knowingly fail to show on the shipping papers the required classification of said property, to wit, Corrosive Liquid, in violation of 49 C.F.R. 173.427.\u2019 \u201d \u201cThe sole and narrow question [was] whether \u2018knowledge\u2019 of the regulation is also required,\u201d and, holding that such was not required, the Court, speaking through Justice Douglas, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae0\">The principle that ignorance of the law is no defense applies whether the law be a statute or a duly promulgated and published regulation. In the context of [this legislative history] we decline to attribute to Congress the inaccurate view that that Act requires proof of knowledge of the law, as well as the facts, and that it intended to endorse that interpretation by retaining the word \u201cknowingly.\u201d We conclude that the meager legislative history . . . makes unwarranted the conclusion that Congress abandoned the general rule and required knowledge of both the facts and the pertinent law before a criminal conviction could be sustained under this Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">Thus, in United States v. Rabb, 394 F.2d 230, 233 (3d Cir. 1968), when we said, \u201cThe Government must establish knowledge of the legal obligation and voluntary action' or omission with the purpose of failing to perform such obligation,\u201d it was not meant that the government prove actual knowledge by the defendant of the allegedly violated regulation. The court\u2019s statement was nothing more than re-assertation that prosecutions under the Selective Service Act required proof of the necessary <em>mens rea. </em>Any other interpretation would run counter to Justice Douglas\u2019 re-af-firmance in <em>International Minerals </em>of the principle that ignorance of the law is no defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-13\">But the problem does not disappear when we conclude that \u201cknowingly\u201d relates only to <em>mens rea, </em>because critical to a determination of a deliberate fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>ure to act must be proof that the failure was not mere inadvertence. Deliberately failing to make the necessary report to the local board is the conduct proscribed by the regulation; an inadvertent failure to do so is not a criminal offense. And it is in the proof that the conduct was deliberate, and therefore \u201cknowing,\u201d that the government is called upon to fashion some relationship between the provisions of the regulation and the defendant, by direct or circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">In <em>International Minerals, </em>the Court gave expression to a test which I believe has relevancy here: \u201c[where] the probability of regulation is so great that anyone who is aware that he is in possession of them or dealing with them must be presumed to be aware of the regulation.\u201d 402 U.S. at 565, 91 S.Ct. at 1701. To paraphrase this test for Selective Service deferment cases, we might ask: Are the specifics of the registrant\u2019s life-style which supported his deferment classification, such that there was a likelihood that it would be subject to regulation and control? If so, was it reasonable to presume that the registrant was aware of the existence of the regulation ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">It seems to me that the degree of certainty with which the government must establish the requisite intent to obtain a selective service conviction logically varies with the specific offense. It also seems to me that a prosecution for failure to register for the draft would be placed at one extreme. There is widespread knowledge of this requirement within the general public, and especially within the affected age groups. There the government would not vbe required to devote much evidentiary attention to proving <em>mens rea. </em>Similar examples might be: where one had received a student deferment, and was no longer in school; or had received a conscientious objector classification, and then become engaged in selling napalm or rifles to military organizations; or, having been deferred as a minister of religion, changed his occupation to printing for commercial purposes atheistic literature. A prosecution for failing to respect the technical niceties required for efficient administration of the system, however, presents other considerations. For example, a prosecution for failure to keep the local board advised of one\u2019s correct address, without more, and without evidence of any prejudice to the system, would naturally focus on the element of scienter. This prosecution falls somewhere between the extremes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">Presumably, Figured would have been drafted had he not received III-A status in 1963. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.30 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1p4\"><em>Class III-A: Registrant With a Child or Children; and Registrant Deferred by Reason of Extreme Hardship to Dependents. </em>\u2014 (a) In Class III-A shall be placed any registrant who has a child or children with whom he maintains a bona fide family relationship in their home. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\">Implicit in the deferment for dependency status under \u00a7 1622.30(a) is a Congressional expression of the public interest in preserving some type of family unit beyond mere fatherhood. The Act authorizes deferment of those \u201cin a status with respect to persons (other than wives alone, except in cases of extreme hardship) dependent upon them for support which renders their deferment advisable.\u201d 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(h) (1). Dependency means more than purely financial support. Otherwise, there would be no deferment for this reason; there would simply be increased financial allotments for such servicemen. <em>Cf., </em>32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.30(d). A deferment on family relationship seems to be based on a salutary policy of keeping the family unit intact, with the father living with and supporting the dependent children. Failure of the father to participate in the family unit would seem to strike at the very foundation of a dependency deferment under \u00a7 1622.30(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-12\">It is against this backdrop that we meet the question whether under all the evidence there were sufficient circumstances to permit a fact-finder to con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>elude that Figurell deliberately, not inadvertently, failed to report his change in his III-A dependency status to his local board. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.1(b) requires the registrant to report \u201cany change in his occupation, marital, military, or dependency status.\u201d Section 1622.30(a) requires a \u201cbona fide family relationship in their home.\u201d Our function as a reviewing court is not to substitute what finding we would have made had we been the fact-finder. Rather our responsibility is limited to determining whether there is a minimum quantity of evidence to satisfy the requirement of proof of <em>mens rea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">The record discloses that on January 12, 1967, Figurell, then in Class III-A, failed to disclose that he and his family were still living together. Previously he had affirmatively reported: on July 22, 1963, that he had been married on June 18, 1963; one day later, on July 23, 1963, he reported that his wife was pregnant; on April 8, 1964, that his wife had miscarried in November, 1963; on December 3, 1964, that his wife was again pregnant; on January 8, 1965, that a child had been born on December 31, 1964; on January 11, 1966, that a second child had been born on December 7, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">Additionally, in May, 1967, he presented to the board a letter, stating that he and his family were living together when, in fact, they had not been living together since January. Previously on February 9, 1967, his wife had reported to the board that he had left the family abode. Six days thereafter his classification was changed from III-A to I-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">Assuming, without conceding, that only the activities prior to January 17, 1967, constitute relevant circumstantial evidence bearing on the <em>mens rea </em>issue, the question which divides this court is whether these circumstances are sufficient to support a finding that Figurell, classified for four years as a III-A, knew that his home and hearth relationship was subject to Selective Service regulations. As set forth in <em>International Minerals, </em>was the \u201cprobability of regulation so great\u201d for the fact-finder to presume him to be aware of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">I say yes. The majority says no. And, although what divides this court is strictly a judgment call, I am suggesting that' implicit in the majority\u2019s view must be a threshold finding that Figurell at no time knew the wording of \u00a7 1622.-30(a): \u201cInto Class III-A shall be placed any registrant who has a child or children with whom he maintains a bona fide family relationship <em>in their home. . </em>\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] I find to be beyond the realities of probable human experience the suggestion that a draft registrant who has successfully applied for and has enjoyed the benefits of a deferment for three and a half years does not know nor has been told the qualifications of that deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-10\">Moreover, as here, where there is a history that the registrant was classified III-A in September, 1963, there has to be some rational explanation for subsequent reports to the local board regarding the family unit. On four separate occasions subsequent to his classification, he reported the pregnancies of his wife, the miscarriage, and the births of his children. Such conduct is consistent with knowledge of the regulation; it is totally inconsistent with purely volunteered action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-11\">Reiterating that our function is not to make a finding of the necessary <em>mens rea, </em>but to determine whether adequate circumstantial evidence was present to support the trial court\u2019s finding, I am satisfied there was sufficient, supportive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-12\">I would affirm the conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">. The \u201cmental element\u201d of Federal crimes is specified in the definitions of the crimes, which definitions are frequently modified, if not indeed distorted, in judicial decisions. If one looks to the statutes alone, the specifications of the mental states form a staggering array: [list of statutes omitted]. Unsurprisingly, the courts have been unable to find substantive correlates for all these varied descriptions of mental states than the statutory language. Not only does the statutory language not reflect accurately or consistently what are the mental elements of the various crimes; there is no discernible pattern or consistent rationale which explains why one crime is defined or understood to require one mental state and another crime another mental state or indeed no mental state at all.
