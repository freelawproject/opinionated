He alleged that the Pennsylvania state prison regulation requiring examination of prisoner mail by authorities so abridged his right to private consultation with counsel as to deprive him of the right to the effective assistance of counsel. The district court dismissed the complaint, which asked for an injunction \u201cuntil plaintiff\u2019s indictment has been disposed of in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">We will affirm the judgment of the district court because we are persuaded that the underlying issue is now moot. Following a plea of guilty in the Middle District criminal proceeding, appellant was sentenced on Aril 27, 1971. No appeal was taken to this court from the judgment of sentence within the jurisdictional time provided in F.R.A.P. 4(b). That criminal proceeding has therefore been terminated. Since the injunction was requested only until the \u201cindictment [was] disposed of,\u201d an event which has already occurred, it is impossible for this court to grant the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
