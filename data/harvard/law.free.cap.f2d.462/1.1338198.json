They later conceded that they could not recover for unseaworthiness because the vessel was not in navigation when they sustained their injuries. They contend that they have a direct cause of action against their employer for negligence in failing to furnish them a safe place to work. Appellee contends, and the district court held, that because appellants have been compensated under the Oregon Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> they are barred from further recovery by the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>In granting summary judgment the district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-12\">\u201cNotwithstanding plaintiffs\u2019 excellent briefs, I have concluded that the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of 1927 does preclude the actions. Moreover, because the actions are not based on unseaworthiness, they are not within the judicial exception of Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85 [66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099] (1946) and its progeny: Ryan [Stevedoring] Co. v. Pan-Atlantic [S.S.] Corp., 350 U.S. 124 [76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133] (1956); Reed v. The Yaka, 373 U.S. 410 [83 S.Ct. 1349, 10 L.Ed.2d 448] (1963); and Jackson v. Lykes [Brothers] Steamship Co., 386 U.S. 731 [87 S.Ct. 1419, 18 L.Ed.2d 488] (1967).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6W\">We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">Appellants argue that the decisions of the Supreme Court in Reed v. The Yaka, 1963, 373 U.S. 410, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 10 L. Ed.2d 448, and Jackson v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Company, 1967, 386 U.S. 731, 87 S.Ct. 1419, 18 L.Ed.2d 488, holding that Section 5 of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905) does not bar an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>action by an employee against his employer for <em>unseaworthiness </em>constitute a \u201cvirtual elimination of Section 5\u201d and should be extended to permit an action for the employer\u2019s <em>negligence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The Court had held in Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 1946, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S. Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099, that a shipowner\u2019s warranty of seaworthiness extended to a longshoreman injured while loading the ship, even though the longshoreman was employed by an independent contractor. In Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S.S. Corp., 1956, 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133, an employee of a stevedoring contractor obtained a judgment against a shipowner. The Court held that the contractor must reimburse the shipowner for damages caused by the contractor\u2019s breach of its duty to stow the cargo properly and safely. In referring to <em>Sieracki </em>and <em>Ryan, </em>the Court in <em>Reed </em>said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u201cBut we cannot now consider the wording of the statute alone. We must view it in the light of our prior cases in this area, like <em>Sieracki, Ryan, </em>and others, the holdings of which have been left unchanged by Congress. In particular, we pointed out in the <em>Sier-acki </em>case, which has been consistently followed since, that a shipowner\u2019s obligation of seaworthiness cannot be shifted about, limited, or escaped by contracts or by the absence of contracts and that the shipowner\u2019s obligation is rooted, not in contracts, but in the hazards of the work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">\u201cIn the light of this whole body of law, statutory and decisional, only blind adherence to the superficial meaning of a statute could prompt us to ignore the fact that Pan-Atlantic was not only an employer of longshoremen but was also a bareboat charterer and operator of a ship and, as such, was charged with the traditional, absolute, and nondelegable obligation of seaworthiness which it should not be permitted to avoid.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 373 U.S. at 414-415, 83 S.Ct. at 1353.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"As\">In <em>Jackson, </em>a longshoreman, employed by a shipowner in navigable waters, died from inhalation of noxious gases. His widow sued in Louisiana State court alleging that his death was proximately caused either by the shipowner\u2019s negligence in operating the ship or by the ship\u2019s unseaworthiness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Louisiana courts held that the action was barred by \u00a7 5 of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act, distinguishing Reed v. The Yaka, supra, on the ground that it involved an action <em>in rem </em>and the intervention of a third party. In reversing, the Supreme Court followed <em>Reed </em>and held that a longshoreman employed on a ship, whether by an independent contractor or by the shipowner, can recover for the unseaworthiness of the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">It is conceded that all of the cases in which the Supreme Court has permitted recovery by a longshoreman from his employer were based on a charge of unseaworthiness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subsequent to <em>Jack</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>son, </em>the Court has continued to recognize a clear distinction between liability based on unseaworthiness and liability based on negligence \u2014 most recently in Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corp., 1971, 400 U.S. 494, 498-499, 91 S.Ct. 514, 27 L.Ed.2d 562,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">\u201cA major burden of the Court\u2019s decisions spelling out the nature and scope of the cause of action for unseaworthiness has been insistence upon the point that it is a remedy separate from, independent of, and additional to other claims against the shipowner, whether created by statute or under general maritime law. More specifically, the Court has repeatedly taken pains to point out that liability based upon unseaworthiness is wholly distinct from liability based upon negligence. The reason, of course, is that unseaworthiness is a <em>condition, </em>and how that condition came into being\u2014 whether by negligence or otherwise\u2014 is quite irrelevant to the owner\u2019s liability for personal injuries resulting from it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">\u201cWe had occasion to emphasize this basic distinction again in Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, 362 U.S. 539 [80 S.Ct. 926, 4 L.Ed.2d 941], *. * * What has evolved in our case law, we said, is the \u2018complete divorcement of unseaworthiness liability from concepts of negligence.\u2019 362 U.S. at 550 [80 S.Ct. at 933].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Thus the Court in emphasizing the basic distinction between unseaworthiness and concepts of negligence has recognized that a shipowner is charged \u201cwith the traditional, absolute, and nondelega-ble obligation of seaworthiness\u201d <em>(Reed), </em>and that a cause of action based on unseaworthiness is \u201ca remedy separate from, independent of, and additional to other claims against the shipowner, whether created by statute or under general maritime law <em>(Usner).\u2019\u2019 </em>There is no parallel in the area of maritime negligence. There is no absolute or non-delegable obligation on the part of the employer and no additional or independent cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">The Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act was designed to provide compensation to employees engaged in maritime employment where recovery through workmen\u2019s compensation might not validly be provided by state law. Nogueira v. N.Y., N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., 1930, 281 U.S. 128, 131, 50 S.Ct. 303, 74 L.Ed. 754. For those employees entitled to compensation, the remedy is exclusive under Section 5. South Chicago Coal &amp; Dock Co. v. Bassett, 1940, 309 U.S. 251, 256, 60 S.Ct. 544, 84 L.Ed. 732.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Where the employer is also a shipowner, Section 5 does not pieclude an action for unseaworthiness, but we find nothing in any of the decisions of the Supreme Court to suggest that this additional right of recovery would be extended to an action for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-5\">. The barge was being constructed on ap-pellee\u2019s marine railway located on the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. The lower portion of the railway extends into the Willamette at low water while the middle and upper portions are on dry land at normal stages of water. The bulk of the railway is wholly submerged at normal stages of high water. Like the court below, we assume arguendo that the barge was a \u201cvessel\u201d and was \u201cin navigable waters\u201d and the appellants were doing work traditionally that of \u201cseamen\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\">. We do not decide whether appellants were entitled to compensation under the Oregon Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law or the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7. 901 et seq. This would appear to depend on wlieth-\u00ed er the accident occurred \u201cupon the navigable waters of the United States\u201d, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a), a point not in issue here. See Note 1, supra, and Victory Carriers, Inc. v. Law, 1971, 404 U.S. 202, 207-208, 92 S.,Ct. 418, 30 L.Ed.2d 383.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\">. Oregon Revised Statute 656.018 provides in part that an employer who satisfies the duty to provide Workmen\u2019s Compensation coverage \u201cis relieved of all other liability for compensable injuries to his subject workmen * * * \u201d and the rights of the workman \u201care in lieu of any remedies they may otherwise have for such injuries against the workman\u2019s employer * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b64-16\">.

The Court concluded that it would produce \u201ca harsh and incongruous result, one out of keeping with the dominant intent of Congress to help longshoremen, to distinguish between liability to longshoremen injured under precisely the same circumstances because some draw their pay directly from a shipowner and others from a stevedoring company doing the ship\u2019s service.\u201d 373 U.S. at 415, 83 S.Ct. at 1353.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b65-7\">. Appellants stress the fact that in the opening paragraph of the opinion in <em>Jackson, </em>the Court refers to the fact that the complaint alleged both negligence and unseaworthiness. This is the only time negligence is mentioned in the opimon, and it is clear that recovery was permitted on the ground of unseaworthiness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b65-13\">. Under different factual situations, a number of courts have rejected the contention, asserted by appellant, that the holding in <em>Jackson </em>should be extended to permit recovery for negligence from an employer under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and other acts making compensation under the act the exclusive remedy against the employer. See, e. g., Atkins v. Greenville Shipbuilding Corp., 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 279, cert. denied 396 U.S. 846, 90 S.Ct. 105, 24 L.Ed.2d 96; Vantrease v. United States, 6 Cir. 1968, 400 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>F.2d 853; Storey v. Garrett Corporation, C.D.Cal.1967, 43 F.R.D. 301; Miller v. United States, E.D.Va.1969, 307 F.Supp. 932.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\">. In <em>Dsner </em>a longshoreman employed by an independent contractor sought damage for injuries allegedly caused by the ship\u2019s unseaworthiness. The Court held that an \u201cisolated, personal negligent act of the petitioner\u2019s fellow longshoreman\u201d would not permit recovery for unseaworthiness. It was recognized that petitioner was covered fully under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. 400 U.S. at 498, n. 10, 91 S.Ct. 514. While the Court did not consider the question presented here, since petitioner did not seek recovery for negligence, the Court\u2019s clear recognition of the \u201ccomplete divorcement\u201d of the concepts of unseaworthiness and negligence is pertinent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b66-14\">.
