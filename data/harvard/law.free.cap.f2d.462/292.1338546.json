Code \u00a7 22-502). Concurrent sentences of seven to twenty-one years and three to nine years respectively were adjudged on each of the two types of offenses. Appellant raises two points as a basis for setting aside his convictions which we find to be inadequate to accomplish that objective. We accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b354-25\">The first attack made by appellant\u2019s counsel is that the evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>insufficient to support the implicit finding of the verdict that appellant aided and abetted the offenses. In this argument it is contended that \u201cPrater was merely present and did not participate in the assault.\u201d There was evidence at trial, however, to the contrary. It is disclosed that the two victims (Robert and Laurie), while returning from a high school prom about 2:45 A.M. on June 3, 1970, saw appellant and a taller man standing on a corner by a bus stop. These two men approached the victims and the taller man pulled out a gun and said, \u201cThis is a stickup\u201d (Tr. 9, 22-24, 157). He then ordered the victims to walk around the corner (Tr. 9, 24, 157); they complied and appellant followed behind Robert while the taller man walked behind Laurie (Tr. 9, 172). Both victims and two police officers who observed the parties testified that appellant and the gunman walked directly behind the victims. After the party got around the corner the taller man said, \u201cI ought to bust a cap in his ass\u201d (Tr. 9). Appellant then stated, \u201cGo on, bust a cap in his ass and get it over with\u201d (Tr. 24) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant then, according to the testimony, reached into Robert\u2019s back pocket, but his wallet was so tightly fitted into his pocket that appellant could not remove it (Tr. 9-10). A police car then came by and while the taller man escaped with the gun, appellant was arrested. The police frisked appellant at the arrest scene and found a black bush comb in his right rear pocket (Tr. 166) and later found $105.00 among his personal belongings (Tr. 169, 174). Robert realized the next morning that a bush comb he had had in his back pocket was missing (Tr. 9,10,12).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Appellant testified that he was going to the corner to catch a bus when he saw another man and the victims arguing (Tr. 183); that he did not know or speak to any of them (Tr. 184-185); that he saw no one with a gun (Tr. 184); that the three began running down the street (Tr. 184), and stopped by a police car; that then he (appellant) went over to the police car \u201cout of curiosity\u201d (Tr. 184, 187) and the police then searched him.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">From the foregoing it is obvious that the evidence was sufficient to prove appellant guilty of aiding and abetting<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the offenses if the jury believed the evidence introduced by the Government. Appellant argues that because he had $105.00 on his person at the time it is \u201cinherently incredible\u201d to believe that he would engage in a holdup and steal a comb. We find nothing inherently incredible about appellant\u2019s actions under such circumstances. The limits of individual desires for money are not standardized and the placement of the comb in his pocket could well have been a mere reflex act. The question as to the weight of the evidence was solely for the jury, and by their verdict they indicated they believed the prosecution witness and disbelieved appellant. Since that conclusion is based on substantial evidence, we see no basis in the record to disturb the verdict on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Secondly, appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence to prove that on June 3, 1970 he aided and abetted the assault with intent to rob \u201cwhile armed with a dangerous weapon, that is, a pistol.\u201d In charging this offense the indictment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">On or about June 3, 1970 . John Prater, <em>while armed with a dangerous weapon, that is, a pistol, </em>felo-niously and willfully assaulted Robert by force and violence and against resistance and by putting in fear, with intent to steal and take valuable goods and property from the person and from the immediate actual possession of said Robert .... (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">This indictment charges violations of D.C.Code \u00a7 22-501<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u00a7 22-3202.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">Appellant claims the evidence is insufficient to prove that he was \u201carmed with a dangerous weapon, that is, a pistol.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In support of this claim he points out that the taller man was never apprehended, that the pistol was never recovered and that no shots were fired from the pistol. From this base he speculates that the alleged pistol might have been a toy pistol, or an imitation pistol, or that in the event it were a real pistol that it might have been unworkable. He thus contends there is insufficient proof that the pistol was \u201ca dangerous weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">Since this offense occurred on June 3, 1970, the statute as amended on December 27, 1967 is applicable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>It refers to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">any pistol or other firearm, or other dangerous or deadly weapon, including but not limited to, sawed-off shotgun, shotgun, machinegun, rifle, dirk, bowie knife, butcher knife, switchblade knife, razor, blackjack, billy, metallic or other false knuckles .... (81 Stat. 737)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The enumerated articles indicate that Congress intended to include within the statutory concept of a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d any article or weapon that was able or likely to produce injury or capable of producing death. To this end the statute specifically included articles that could be used to reinforce a personal assault such as brass (metallic) knuckles and blackjacks. A pistol, even though non-operable, is a weapon that would come within the statutory requirement of being \u201cdangerous\u201d since it is capable of being used \u2014 and one of its frequent uses in crime is \u2014 almost as a blackjack to pistolwhip a victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">This brings us to the testimony concerning the gun which we must evaluate to determine whether there was sufficient testimony for the jury to find that it was \u201cdangerous.\u201d That it was a \u201cgun\u201d was testified to by the policemen and the victims (Tr. 9, 11, 21-24, 157, 162, 165, 172). In this connection we conclude from the testimony concerning the robbers\u2019 statements that they might \u201cbust a cap in his ass,\u201d that the jury would be justified in inferring that the gun was loaded and that if they had so desired they could have shot the victims. Such statement was a plain threat to shoot the victims and Robert so interpreted it (Tr. 9, 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">A similar factual situation existed in Wagner v. United States, 264 F.2d 524 (9th Cir. 1959) where the defendant in a postal robbery was charged with putting lives in jeopardy by the use of a dangerous weapon. In the opinion, Judge Hamley remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">There was no direct evidence that the gun was loaded. When, however, a robber displays a gun to back up his demands, he wants his victim to believe that it is loaded, and the fact-finder may fairly infer that it was. Here there was a voiced threat by one of the robbers that Martin would be shot if he did not keep his hand away from his coat pocket.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">264 F.2d at 530 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Wheeler v. United States, 317 F.2d 615, 618 (8th Cir. 1963) is to the same effect. It involved an offense under the Federal Bank Robbery statute where the accused was charged with putting the life of a victim in jeopardy \u201cby use of a dangerous weapon and device.\u201d The opinion by Judge Stephenson held that the evidence' was sufficient to prove that the gun was in fact loaded where there was testimony that the accused \u201cpulled a gun,\u201d said he was \u201cnot kidding,\u201d and later told them to not tell anyone about the robbery \u201cuntil I am gone ... we don\u2019t want no one to get shot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">The evidence concerning the gun and whether it constitutes a dangerous weapon as here alleged must be viewed in the light of all the surrounding circumstances. United States v. Daniels, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 223, 226-227, 437 F.2d 656, 659-660 (1970) and United States v. Curtis, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 363, 427 F.2d 630, 633 (1970) are other cases where defendants were found to have been properly convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon even though the gun itself was never recovered. When we so consider the facts we conclude that the jury were justified in finding that the offense was committed \u201cwhile armed with a dangerous weapon, that is, a pistol,\u201d as alleged in the indictment. This finding is supported by the evidence that the gun was a handgun (Tr. 9-10, 22, 24) that could be used dangerously as a bludgeon to inflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>physical injury and also that it was loaded and could be used dangerously as a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-5\">. Appellant contends that tlie victim was unsure who made the statement and erroneously attributed the single statement to both men; but the record shows it to be two <em>different </em>statements, each made by one of the robbers. The argument is largely irrelevant, in any event, because there is no doubt that one of the robbers made the statement and there is substantial additional evidence to prove that appellant aided and abetted the crime by walking behind the victims and trying to remove Robert\u2019s wallet from his pocket.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-10\">.
