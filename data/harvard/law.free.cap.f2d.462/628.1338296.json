We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-17\">Canoga\u2019s subsidiary, Scanbe Manufacturing Corporation, produces electrical circuit board files pursuant to Patent Re. 25,595. Scanbe obtained a judicial decision in 1966 that the patent was valid and that William Tryon, d/b./a Tryon Components Company, was infringing it by making and selling printed circuit card holders and card holder assemblies. The court enjoined Tryon from future infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-18\">Schnitger wants to purchase the circuit board files from Tryon, which cannot sell to him because of the 1966 injunction. Hence Schnitger brought this declaratory judgment action seeking a judicial ruling that the Scanbe patent is invalid and that Tryon can sell it despite the 1966 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-19\">Although the district court did not specify the reasons for its dismissal, it appears from the record that Schnitger is in privity with Tryon. The 1966 judgment is <em>res judicata </em>as to Tryon and those who obtain the infringing product from him. Ransburg Electro-Coating Corp. v. Williams, 246 F.Supp. 626 (W.D.Ark.1965). That judgment provides a complete defense to Schnit-ger\u2019s declaratory judgment action, and the district court properly dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-20\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
