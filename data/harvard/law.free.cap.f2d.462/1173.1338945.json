On September, 12, 1969, he appeared before that board, stated his belief that his reclassification was punishment for his participation in the demonstration, and urged the board members to resign. On the next morning, September 13, the <em>Baltimore Sun </em>carried a story about this appearance. The <em>Sun </em>article referred to appellant\u2019s participation in the Justice Department demonstration as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1236-11\">He was among the teachers and writers who met with Justice Department officials that day. The group included Dr. Benjamin Spock, . . . the Rev. William Sloane Coffin, . and Mitchell Goodman. . . . <em>All three were sentenced </em>to two-year jail terms and received $5,000 fines last July 11 on charges of conspiring to aid and counsel violations of the draft law. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1236-16\">The Baltimore Bureau of appellee Associated Press regularly reviews stories carried by Baltimore member newspapers, selecting some for rewriting and distribution to member newspapers in other cities. On the morning of September 13, Randolph C. Arndt, performing that function, selected the <em>Sun </em>story about appellant. In reading the story, however, Mr. Arndt, in the words of his affidavit \u201cmistakenly concluded that [appellant] was one of the persons convicted of conspiring to aid and counsel violations of the draft law, and . rewrote the story, reflecting this belief.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-17\">Later that day, the AP story was received at the offices of the appellee <em>Star, </em>where it was selected by an editor for insertion in that evening\u2019s editions. The selection was approved by Principal Assistant City Editor Philip Robbins, who obtained from the <em>Star\u2019s </em>\u201cclipping file\u201d on appellant four items of information on his background, which he added to the AP text. The <em>Star </em>editions of September 13 carried the story, which all parties agree was factually erroneous insofar as it stated that appellant had been convicted of draft law violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-18\">While reading through the paper, a <em>Star </em>editor discovered the error, and notified his superiors and the Baltimore Bureau of the AP. On the next day, September 14, the AP issued a corrective story, which was accompanied on its wire by a request that those newspapers which had used the original story print the correction. On the 15th, a Sunday, the Star carried its own correction at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>the bottom of page A-2, the same page on which the original story had appeared on Friday.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">The issue before us is whether, on these undisputed facts, the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of both the AP and the <em>Star. </em>We hold that it did not, and that the reasons helpfully stated by it for doing so are soundly conceived in the light of the governing Supreme Court doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">As the District Court noted, appellant is clearly a \u201cpublic figure\u201d within the meaning of the law established by New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), and its progeny.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His libel actions against the <em>Star </em>and the AP are, therefore, barred by the First Amendment unless he can show with \u201cconvincing clarity\u201d that appellees acted with \u201c \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u2014 that is, with knowledge that it [the story] was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d 376 U.S. at 280, 84 S.Ct. at 726. Against the affidavits of appellees\u2019 employees to the effect that they were unaware of the error, there is nothing in the record from which it can be inferred that the story was distributed or published \u201cwith knowledge that it was false.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The issue, then, is whether appellees acted with \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the accuracy of the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-15\">\u201cReckless disregard,\u201d as the Supreme Court made clear in St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 1325, 20 L.Ed.2d 262 (1968), is not determined with reference to the objective standard of a \u201creasonably prudent\u201d newsman. Rather, \u201c[t]here must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the <em>defendant in fact entertained serious doubts </em>as to the truth of his publication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) In this case, although it perhaps might be argued that appellees\u2019 employees acted without reasonable prudence in the circumstances, the undisputed facts do not permit an inference that they \u201cin fact entertained serious doubts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-16\">Turning first to appellee AP, there is no evidence that Randolph Arndt of its Baltimore Bureau in fact doubted the accuracy of his assumption that appellant had been convicted with Spock, Coffin, and Goodman. As the District Court noted, the article in the <em>Sun </em>was susceptible to misinterpretation. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>stated that appellant had joined with Spock, Coffin, and Goodman in the Justice Department demonstration, and then noted that \u201call three\u201d had been convicted of draft law violations. In that context, the use of the word \u201call\u201d might have led Arndt to conclude that the word \u201cthree\u201d had been used inadvertently, and that \u201call four\u201d had been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">The issue, to repeat, is not whether such a conclusion was reasonable, or whether prudence required that Arndt verify his assumption before distributing the story. Rather, it is whether Arndt in fact seriously doubted the accuracy of his assumption. In light of the wording of the <em>Sun </em>article, and in light of the fact that Arndt knew from the article that appellant had participated in the demonstration which resulted in the convictions, we hold that the District Court did not err in ruling that the AP story was the product of Arndt\u2019s good faith misinterpretation of the <em>Sun </em>story, and not \u201cthe product of his imagination.\u201d 390 U.S. at 732, 88 S.Ct. 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">Similarly, the court below correctly ruled that the <em>Star </em>did not publish the AP story with \u201creckless disregard.\u201d The erroneous information was not transmitted to the <em>Star </em>in a manner likely to arouse suspicion. Newspaper editors have no cause to doubt the accuracy of a major wire service dispatch, absent an apparent inconsistency or other indication of error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, there was no such indication. The erroneous statement was consistent with the rest of the AP story, as well as with Principal Assistant City Editor Robbins\u2019 prior information about appellant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, we can assume that the contents of the <em>Star\u2019s </em>clipping file on appellant, which presumably detailed his numerous antiwar activities,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, were consistent with the AP story, and unlikely to have aroused Robbins\u2019 suspicions when he consulted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">Appellant argues, however, that Robbins, in consulting the clipping file, must have noticed the absence of clippings relating to a conviction for draft law violations, and therefore must have entertained doubts as to the accuracy of the AP report. Whether or not such an \u201cinference upon an inference\u201d could ever establish reckless disregard with \u201cthe convincing clarity which the constitutional standard demands\u201d (376 U.S. at 285-286, 84 S.Ct. at 729) is doubtful. Certainly it cannot do so in this case. There is, first, no indication that Robbins examined the entire contents of the clipping file; his affidavit states only that he \u201cobtained\u201d information from it. In addition, the plausibility of appellant\u2019s inferences is diminished by the fact that the erroneous matter was peripheral to the main point of the story, and the fact that the file was used, not with reference to information in the AP text, but to obtain <em>additional </em>information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-11\"> Appellant advances two additional arguments on this appeal, both of which can be disposed of briefly. First, he contends that \u201cback issues\u201d of the September 13 <em>Star </em>were sold subsequent to that date, after the paper had discovered the error, and that the libel was therefore \u201crepublished\u201d with the requisite malice. We do not believe that the <em>New York Times </em>rule is to be nullified so easily. That case established a far-reaching constitutional doctrine, which must be applied in light of the realities of the modern newspaper business. Metropolitan newspapers operate under a daily deadline; and once the deadline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>is met and an edition is printed, it is placed in a distribution system that ap-pellee terms \u201cpre-determined and largely self-executing.\u201d Given those business methods, we think the realistic view is that, for purposes of the <em>Times </em>rule, a daily newspaper is \u201cpublished\u201d only once \u2014when it is printed and placed in the distribution system \u2014 unless it is redistributed <em>outside the normal channels </em>with the specific intent to convey the libelous information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">Second, appellant urges that we create a new tort, namely, the wilful refusal to make a good faith correction of a libelous news story. Even assuming that the federal courts in the District of Columbia should undertake to create new torts at this late stage in the development of the local judicial system, there would be no reason to do so in this case. Both appellees issued adequate and timely corrections, without waiting for a request from appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1236-12\">. The AP story centered on the meeting between appellant and his draft board, but stated that \u201cWaskow is one of the four defendants appealing a conviction in Boston of counseling draft violators. The others are Dr. Benjamin Spock; the Rev. William Sloane Coffin, . . . and Mitchell Goodman. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">. These corrective measures by the AP and the <em>Star </em>were taken before they received notice from appellant. According to the affidavit of the <em>Star\u2019s </em>Managing Editor, its correction was printed on Sunday rather than Saturday \u201cbecause our Saturday circulation is- considerably smaller than our weekday circulation whereas our Sunday circulation is considerably larger, and I wanted to reach the broadest possible audience of Star readers.\u201d The correction stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-9\">Correction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-10\">An Associated Press story in Friday\u2019s Star erroneously reported that Arthur I. Waskow, who is fighting induction by a Baltimore draft board, was among those convicted in Boston for conspiring to aid and counsel draft law violations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-11\">Waskow was not a defendant in Boston. The AP dispatch had incorrectly listed him along with the defendants [naming the defendants], . . . The main point of Friday\u2019s news story was that Waskow asked members of Local Board No. 20 to resign \u201crather than continue to conscript men for an unconstitutional, illegal, immoral and obscene war in Vietnam.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1237-18\">. <em>See </em>Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1987). In addition to his political activities, appellant has written extensively. His attorney offered to stipulate before the District Court that \u201cArthur Waskow is a public figure whose public activities are well known to the public and the press.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1237-19\">.
