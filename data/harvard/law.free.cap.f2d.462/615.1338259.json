Allen and Constance G. Allen appeal from an order of the district court which held that their complaint charging racial discrimination in the sale of real estate in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982 was barred by Virginia\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. The complaint, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages, alleges that the Allens suffered humiliation, emotional stress, and anxiety when the defendants initially refused to sell them a house. Later the Al-lens succeeded in purchasing a home in the subdivision the defendants were developing.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-24\">While this appeal was pending, we held, in Almond v. Kent, 459 F.2d 200 (4th Cir., 1972), that the state\u2019s two-year statute applies to actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for personal injuries. Both \u00a7 1982 and \u00a7 1983 were enacted to redress the infringement of civil rights. Both allow the recovery of damages for personal wrongs. We conclude, therefore, that the reasons stated in <em>Almond </em>for applying Virginia\u2019s two-year statute of limitations to actions under \u00a7 1983 make the same limitation period appropriate for personal injury suits based on \u00a7 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-25\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is vacated, and this ease is remanded for further proceedings. Each party shall bear his own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
