Court-appointed counsel ably represented the defendants on appeal and in the district court, where there was a jury trial for three days. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-21\">The grant or denial of a motion for severance under Rule 14, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and his decision will not be overturned on appeal unless there is an affirmative showing of abuse of discretion. Opper v. United States, 1953, 348 U.S. 84, 95, 75 S.Ct. 158, 99 L.Ed. 101; Gordon v. United States, 5 Cir.1971, 438 F.2d 858, 878-879; Tillman v. United States, 5 Cir.1971, 406 F.2d 930, 934-935, cert. denied, 395 U.S. 830, 89 S.Ct. 2143, 23 L.Ed.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-23\"> A eodefendant\u2019s confession is admissible in a joint trial if references to the other codefendants are deleted. United States v. Kershner, 5 Cir.1970, 432 F.2d 1066, 1071-1072; Posey v. United States, 5 Cir.1969, 416 F.2d 545, 551; United States v. Sims, 5 Cir.1970, 434 F.2d 258, 259; White v. United States, 5 Cir.1969, 415 F.2d 292, 293-294. The trial judge carefully reviewed Span\u2019s confession in camera and made extensive deletions of references to the co-defendants. For example, he required the deletion of any reference to the number of bank robbers. Here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>there was clear and convincing eye-witness identification of the defendants and such overwhelming evidence of guilt as to support a conclusion that the trial judge did not commit reversible error in denying a severance or admitting Span\u2019s censored confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">We have examined the photographs which were exhibited to the bank employees in two groups . of ten each. We find that the witnesses\u2019 in-court identification of the defendants was not tainted by any impermissible selection or spread of the photographs likely to suggest mis-identifieation. <em>See </em>United States v. Sutherland, 5 Cir.1970, 428 F. 2d 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The Court has considered all of the other issues raised on appeal. There is no merit to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
