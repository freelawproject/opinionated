Co-defendant Curtis pleaded guilty and testified for the government at appellant\u2019s trial. Curtis was sentenced to four years imprisonment. Following appellant\u2019s conviction at a jury trial, he was sentenced to eight years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">We find appellant\u2019s contentions clearly without merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judges are vested with wide discretion in sentencing. Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 243, 90 S.Ct. 2018, 26 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970). In this case, the difference in the sentences might be attributable to any number of factors fairly within the district court\u2019s discretion, <em>e. g., </em>possible rehabilitation, demeanor and attitude of defendant at trial, cooperation with the prosecution, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-10\">. Appellant contends that Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942), announces his right to receive a- sentence similar <em>to </em>that of his co-defendant. <em>Skinner, </em>however, concerned the arbitrary legislative classification of individuals, whereas no such classification appears in the instant case. Appellant further argues that the failure of the judge to delineate reasons for petitioner\u2019s sentence causes a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on a defendant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional rights. Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965). There is no evidence, however, to support the argument that appellant was given a lengthier sentence because he chose to assert his guaranteed rights. Indeed, when the First Circuit was faced with this precise contention, it noted that \u201c[i]t is too frivolous to merit discussion.\u201d Green v. United States, 334 F.2d 733, 736 (1st Cir. 1964). Appellant\u2019s reference in a supplemental letter filed with this court to Prince v. United States, 352 U.S. 322, 77 S.Ct. 403, 1 L.Ed.2d 370 (1957), and Heflin v. United States, 358 U.S. 415, 79 S.Ct. 451, 3 L.Ed.2d 407 (1959) is misplaced. <em>Prince </em>held that the crime of entry into a bank with intent to rob was not intended by Congress to be a separate offense from the consummated robbery, whereas <em>Heflin </em>held only that subsection (c) of \u00a7 2113 was intended \u201conly to provide punishment for those who receive the loot\u201d from the actual bank robbers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
