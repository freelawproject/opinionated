The employer discriminated against certain women employees by paying them less than their male counterparts for equivalent work. Sag-ner finally admitted the discrimination and offered to make restitution. But at the instigation of the appellant Union and in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq.t </em>the major part of the arrearage due was diverted to increase the pay of another group of employees also represented by the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">For reasons sufficiently indicated by the District Court, Hodgson v.
