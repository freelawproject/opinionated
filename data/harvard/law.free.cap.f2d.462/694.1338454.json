Crim.P. 17(b). We reverse on the subpoena point.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-20\">Prior to trial appellant\u2019s counsel moved under \u00a7 4244 to have him examined to determine his competency to stand trial. The court granted the motion and on its own ordered that appellant be examined to determine also whether he was sane at the time he escaped.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Examinations directed to both issues were conducted at the Federal Medical Center in Springfield, Missouri, and on the basis of a psychiatrist\u2019s report showing appellant to be competent to stand trial the court, without a formal order, determined appellant competent to go to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-21\">On October 5, 1971, after the \u00a7 4244 examination and appellant's return to custody, appellant\u2019s counsel moved pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 17(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>issuance of a subpoena commanding the presence at trial in Texarkana of Dr. Joseph F. Alderete, Chief Medical Officer, Bureau of Prisons, Atlanta, Georgia. No facts were alleged or efforts made to show the need for the doctor\u2019s presence other than recitation of the conclusory statement that \u201csaid witness is necessary to an adequate defense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a written order, the court denied the motion, adding that it was not opposed to deposing Dr. Alderete or having appellant examined by a local psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Subsequently, on the government\u2019s motion, Dr. Luther White, a psychiatrist of Texarkana, examined appellant. On October 27, 1971 the court issued a subpoena for Dr. White, at the defense\u2019s request, which request was supported by the averment that Dr. White would testify concerning appellant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">On November 1, 1971, with trial set for the following day, appellant by his counsel requested subpoenas for five more persons. Three of them were laymen, residents of Texarkana, who, it was averred, would testify as to overt acts committed by appellant immediately prior to his escape that would show his insanity at that time. The fourth was a Ringgold, Louisiana high school principal who recently had written a letter on appellant\u2019s behalf to the parole board. The last was Dr. Robert J. Murney, Clinical Psychologist, Federal Medical Center, Springfield, Missouri, who, it was averred, had recently examined appellant and would testify concerning his sanity at the time of the offense charged. The court granted subpoenas for the three Texarkana residents but denied the request to command the presence of Dr. Murney and the other nonresident witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">At trial the court admitted over appellant\u2019s Objection the testimony of Dr. H. Wayne Glotfelty, a forensic psychiatrist at the Springfield Federal Medical Center who had examined appellant in April, 1971 pursuant to the court\u2019s order, to the effect that appellant was sane at the time of the offense. The defense called Dr. White. He was not a forensic psychiatrist and was unsure of the legal definition of insanity, but gave as his opinion that it was possible that appellant was insane at the time of the offense. Through this witness appellant introduced into evidence a report of a psychiatric examination of him in 1967 in which Dr. Alderete, as Chief of the Psychiatric Service at Springfield, had concluded that appellant was psychotic and committable to a state institution. Having no expert witnesses more familiar than Dr. White with forensic psychiatry, appellant\u2019s counsel in cross-examining Dr. Glotfelty elicited for the jury bits of a May 15, 1971 report of a psychiatric examination of appellant conducted by Dr. Murney, who was identified as a clinical psychologist at the Federal Medical Center, to the effect that appellant showed chronic eharaeter-ological problems described as basically schizoid, but that he was not currently psychotic and seemed to meet the criteria for being competent to face prosecution. .The case was submitted to the jury with the only seriously contested issue being appellant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Appellant complains first of the admission <em>of </em>Dr. Glotfelty\u2019s testimony as being contrary to \u00a7 4244. This was not error. Section 4244 proscribes the admission into evidence against the accused of any statement made by him in the course of examination. Also, a finding by the judge that the accused is mentally competent to stand trial may not be introduced in evidence or other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>wise brought to the attention of the jury, thus precluding its having any prejudicial effect on the accused\u2019s insanity defense to the crime charged. Neither of these proscriptions was violated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"> The court did not err in <em>sua sponte </em>ordering an examination directed to appellant\u2019s competency at the time of the offense as well as to his competency to stand trial. Once the accused makes known that he will assert a defense of insanity, the court may order him examined on that issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When the accused moves for, and the court determines to grant, a \u00a7 4244 examination, the court validly can provide in its order that in the same examination inquiry be made into competency at the time of the offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This allows economy of judicial and medical efforts, of prosecution and defense efforts, and of the accused\u2019s time. In a sense, the discretion to enlarge the examination does, as appellant points out, expose him to the possibility of bolstering the government\u2019s case. But, in the end, all concerned \u2014 court, counsel, and parties \u2014 have an interest in determining if the accused was ineompe-tent at the time of the offense, if that is to be an issue, and we see no prejudice in the court\u2019s ordering that such determination be made sooner rather than later and at a time when the determination is least likely to delay a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">We conclude, however, that the court reversibly erred in refusing to grant one of the subpoenas requested. Prior to 1966, Rule 17(b) provided that a court \u201cmay\u201d order a subpoena issued but that an indigent defendant requesting it was required to support his motion with an affidavit stating the testimony he expected from the witness and showing further its materiality and that the defendant could not safely go to trial without the witness. Appellate courts took the view that under the rule the grant or denial of a subpoena was committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and was not to be disturbed in the absence of exceptional circumstances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 1966 the rule was amended to make issuance mandatory upon \u201ca satisfactory showing . . . that the presence of the witness is necessary to an adequate defense.\u201d That requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>leaves broad discretion in the district court by allowing the trial judge to weigh numerous factors, including materiality, relevancy, and competency, in deciding whether to grant the request for a subpoena. <em>See </em>United States v. Hathcock, 441 F.2d 197 (5th Cir. 1971); Welsh v. United States, 404 F.2d 414 (5th Cir. 1968); Findley v. United States, 380 F. 2d 752 (10th Cir. 1967). But we have held, quoting Greenwell v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 44, 317 F.2d 108, 110 (1963), that the amended requirement means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-4\">\u201c . . .if the accused avers facts which, if true, would be relevant to any issue in the case, the requests for subpoenas must be granted, unless the averments are inherently incredible on their face, or unless the Government shows, either by introducing evidence or from matters already of record, that the averments are untrue or that the request is otherwise frivolous.\u201d . That test places the burden of showing frivolity or abuse of process on the Government, where it properly belongs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Welsh v. United States, <em>supra, </em>404 F.2d at 417-418. See United States v. Hathcock, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">We need not decide whether under the <em>Welsh </em>test the denial of a subpoena directed to Dr. Alderete was, standing alone, an error, because we conclude that the subsequent denial of a subpoena for Dr. Murney was reversibly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">In his November 1 motion, appellant\u2019s counsel stated that Dr. Murney had examined appellant recently and would testify concerning his sanity at the time of the offense charged. It does not appear from anything in the record that the request was frivolous or the averments untrue. Such testimony would have been material and relevant to the only factual question really in issue. Without either Dr. Alderete or Dr. Murney, appellant was forced to rely on the testimony of Dr. White, whose somewhat unsure opinion as a psychiatrist not generally accustomed to applying the legal definition of insanity to his patients had considerably less probative force than the firm opinion of an expert like Dr. Glotfelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">It is true that the motion for a subpoena addressed to Dr. Murney was filed the day before trial, which is a late hour. From the fact that the Court granted the motion with respect to three witnesses already in Texarkana who appellant claimed would give lay testimony as to overt acts tending to show insanity at the time of escape, we may infer that the court\u2019s denial with respect to Dr. Murney sprang from a desire not to put the government to additional expense or from a desire not to delay trial, or both. \u201cCertainly there are frivolous requests for production of witnesses and just as certainly defendants may seek to abuse the right to compulsory process at government expense. In close cases the district court must exercise its sound discretion, bearing in mind that the burden of showing frivolousness or abuse of process is on the government.\u201d United States v. Hathcock, <em>supra, </em>441 F.2d at 200. Last minute tactics designed to bring the trial process to a halt are not to be countenanced, but considering the court\u2019s awareness of appellant\u2019s previous unsuccessful attempt to secure a subpoena for an expert to testify regarding his sanity and the apparent relevance of the desired witness\u2019 testimony, and considering also that the record does not demonstrate that in fact the trial would have been delayed, we conclude that the need for Dr. Murney\u2019s presence was sufficient to render the court\u2019s refusal to issue a subpoena for him reversibly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">The government urges that even if the court erred in not issuing a subpoena for Dr. Murney, the error was harmless because his complete report was introduced in evidence. We can find no basis in the record for the factual premise of this argument. The report was used in cross-examination of Dr. Glotfelty but was never placed in evidence. Nothing read from it in court by either Dr. Glot-felty or appellant\u2019s counsel pertained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>even remotely to appellant\u2019s competency at the time of the offense. The result of the court\u2019s order remained that appellant was unsuccessful in every attempt to present important testimony that, had it been available, might have contradicted the government\u2019s expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In summary, we can do no better than to quote Judge Rives\u2019 conclusion in <em>Welsh:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">Considered in the entire setting of this case, we conclude that [Moudy\u2019s] counsel should be afforded a better opportunity to develop the evidence as to [Moudy\u2019s] mental competency at the time of the commission of the alleged offense. More specifically, we hold that the court erred in refusing to order [Dr. Murney] subpoenaed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVV\">Welsh v. United States, <em>supra, </em>404 F.2d at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-12\">. The escape is undisputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-13\">. <em>\u201cDefendants Dnable to Pay. </em>The court shall order at any time that a subpoena be issued for service on a named witness upon an <em>ex parte </em>application of a defendant upon a satisfactory showing that the defendant is financially unable to pay tlie fees of the witness and that the presence of the witness is necessary to an adequate defense.

The record before us includes a stipulation agreed upon by the government and defense counsel at the conclusion 'of the trial and before the court in chambers that had Dr. Alderete been present he would have testified that he had examined appellant in 1967 and had found him psychotic and commitable to a state institution. In light of our disposition of the case, we need not consider the possible relevancy of this stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b759-6\">. See United States v.
