See Groendyke Transport, Inc. v. Davis, 5 Cir. 1969, 406 F.2d 1158.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1163-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1163-11\">Unusual as is issuance of the Great Writ of Habeas Corpus,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rarer still is the classic \u00a7 2255 unlawful sentence. The confused record in this case, however, indicates that Defendant apparently has been sentenced to a longer term than the statute allows. Accordingly, we vacate and remand the District Court\u2019s order denying \u00a7 2255 relief for further appropriate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-22\">Defendant was convicted on his pleas of guilty to post office burglary and possession of stolen money orders, violations of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2115 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 641. Importantly, Count I of the indictment encompassed the \u00a7 2115 violation, while Count II involved the \u00a7 641 charge. The transcript of the sentencing hearing held on February 13,1967 contains the following crucial language: \u201cThe Court sentences you to ten years in the penitentiary on Count One, and the other counts, one year; all counts to run concurrently; and so all of your years will run concurrent with your ten year sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-23\">Thus, it appears that Defendant has been sentenced to ten years for violating 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2115, since that was Count One of the indictment. The maximum sentence allowable under \u00a7 2115 is five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-24\"> Of course, the transcript may be in error. The formal written judgment of conviction and sentence signed the same day the sentencing hearing was held states that the ten year sentence is assessed for Count Two, and that the one year sentence is under Count One. As there is a variation between the oral sentence and the written judgment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>we vacate and remand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>ease for hearing and Findings of Fact regarding the term of the sentence <em>orally </em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pronounced, and for resentencing to the extent appropriate and permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1163-12\">.
