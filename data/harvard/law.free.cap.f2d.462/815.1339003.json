After having selected various groceries and before arriving at the checkout counter, the daughter decided to return two items \u2014 namely, the butter and the cheese \u2014 to the shelves. She did so. The ladies paid for their other purchases, left the store and proceeded to their car in Glosser\u2019s parking lot. As the daughter was entering the driver\u2019s seat, Glosser\u2019s female security officer grabbed her right arm and demanded the return of the butter and the cheese. Miss Curry replied that the items had been returned and invited the security officer to search her pockets and belongings. After so \u201csearching\u201d Miss Curry, the officer followed a similar procedure with the decedent, who had remained silent during this initial exchange. Nothing was discovered. Although the officer started to walk away, the daughter apparently prolonged the encounter, indicating in no uncertain terms what she thought of the detective\u2019s unfounded accusations. A heated argument ensued between the two and while it was in progress, the mother \u2014 a few feet away and upset by the incident \u2014 fell to the ground and died instantly of a coronary occlusion. According to the treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>physician, her death was a direct result of the general excitement of the event.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Until the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Niederman v. Brod-sky, 436 Pa. 401, 261 A.2d 84 (1970), the \u201cimpact rule\u201d was well established in Pennsylvania and pursuant to that doctrine, recovery was not allowed for any injury resulting from fright or other emotional trauma unaccompanied by an actual physical impact. E. g., Bosley v. Andrews, 393 Pa. 161, 142 A.2d 263 (1958); Koplin v. Louis K. Liggett Company, 322 Pa. 333, 185 A. 744 (1936). However, the inequities of the doctrine were readily apparent and the \u201cimpact rule\u201d was subsequently held to bar recovery only in those cases where there was no \u201cimpact\u201d whatsoever. Po-tere v. Philadelphia, 380 Pa. 581, 112 A. 2d 100 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The doctrine, at least in its most expansive form, was further eroded in <em>Niederman, supra, </em>where the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-7\">\u201cWe today choose to abandon the requirement of a physical impact as a precondition to recovery for damages proximately caused by the tort in only those cases like the one before us where the plaintiff was in personal danger of physical impact because of the direction of a negligent force against him and where plaintiff actually did fear the physical impact.\u201d 436 Pa. at 413, 261 A.2d at 90.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-8\"> Thus, recovery in the instant case would be allowed if either (1) a negligent \u201cimpact\u201d were shown \u2014 no matter how slight or (2) if the decedent was in personal danger of a negligent physical impact and where she was in actual fear of the impact, <em>Niederman, supra, </em>436 Pa. at 413, 261 A.2d 84.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court concluded that the events leading to the decedent\u2019s death did not fall within either of the above categories. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">Initially, the <em>only </em>physical contact between the detective and the decedent was the detective\u2019s search of the latter\u2019s pockets and belongings. In light of our examination of the relevant depositions, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the store detective was, in fact, justified in believing that the decedent had consented to the search. See e. g., Dicenzo v. Berg, 340 Pa. 305, 16 A.2d 15 (1941). As the record discloses no other touching of the decedent\u2019s person, recovery cannot therefore be predicated on the <em>pre-Niederman </em>cases cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\"> Second, the record adequately supports the District Court\u2019s finding that decedent\u2019s emotional distress was not traceable to a fear of physical harm created by the store detective and \u201cthat the act of searching was not an act intended to put decedent in a reasonable apprehension of an immediate battery.\u201d Thus, the <em>Niederman </em>exception is of no assistance to appellant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">The order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-18\">. 12 P.S. \u00a7 1601, et seq. and 20 P.S. \u00a7 320.601, et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\">. Decedent had been under the care of a physician for a number of years prior to her death for a heart condition, namely, \u201chypertensive cardiovascularitis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b879-10\">. No evidence was introduced by appellant to indicate that decedent\u2019s emotional distress was the result of the wanton or intentional misconduct of the security officer. Such a showing would be an additional basis for recovery. Papieves v. Kelly, 437 Pa. 373, 263 A.2d 118 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b879-18\">. It is also settled in Pennsylvania that words or threats alone are insufficient to put a person in reasonable apprehension of physical injury or offensive touching. Cucinotti v. Ortmann, 399 Pa. 26, 159 A.2d 216 (1960). <em>See </em>also Hoffman v. Rhoads Construction Co., 113 Pa.Super. 55, 172 A. 33 (1934).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
