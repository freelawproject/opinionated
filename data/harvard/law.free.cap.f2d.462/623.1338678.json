The basis of Al-brecht\u2019s petition was his claim that his guilty plea was involuntary because it was the product of coercion on the part of his trial counsel. The District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing, but it could find no merit to Albrecht\u2019s contention. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">From the evidence adduced at the hearing, the District Court determined: (1) Albrecht was influenced; but not legally coerced, by his counsel, and (2) Al-brecht\u2019s plea was primarily motivated by his fear of the death penalty which was based upon his affection for his child. From these facts, the court concluded that the plea was not constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\"> We cannot, of course, disturb the challenged decision unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>Moss v. Craven, 427 F.2d 139 (9th Cir. 1970); Knowles v. Gladden, 378 F.2d 761 (9th Cir. 1967). On the record before us, we cannot find error. There was substantial justification for concluding, as did the District Court, that Albrecht\u2019s plea was valid. <em>See </em>Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U.S. 790, 90 S.Ct. 1458, 25 L.Ed.2d 785 (1970); McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970); Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970); Knowles v. Gladden, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARi\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
