Frey, United States District Judge, Tucson, Arizona, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b545-9\">KOELSCH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Walker appeals from the judgment convicting him of violating 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462, refusing to obey the order of his Selective Service Board to submit to induction into the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">The principal issue on appeal concerns the validity of Walker\u2019s 1-A classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">The record reveals that Walker, shortly after being classified 1-A (available for military service) and before being ordered to report for induction, filed with his Local Board an SSS Form 150 in which he asserted a claim of exemption from both combatant and noncombatant training and service in the Armed Forces, by reason of religious training and belief, conscientiously opposing participation in war in any form, and requested a 1-0 classification (conscientious objector).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">The Board summarily denied his claim but thereafter reopened the matter at Walker\u2019s request and afforded him a personal appearance. However, the Board again denied him a 1-0 classification, on the ground that his professed religious beliefs were not sincerely held.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appeal Board, without assigning the basis for its action, again classified Walker 1-A, presumptively for the reason assigned by the Local Board. United States v. Kember, 437 F.2d 534, 536 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 1392, 28 L.Ed.2d 662 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">We are clear from our examination of the record that the Board\u2019s determination of Walker\u2019s lack of sincerity has a \u201cbasis in fact.\u201d Bergman v. United States, 420 F.2d 681 (9th Cir. 1969). The principal question- \u2014 since Walker had \u201cmet the statutory criteria\u201d [Parrott v. United States, 370 F.2d 388 (9th Cir. 1966)] \u2014 involves a highly subjective matter \u2014 the claimant\u2019s honesty and good faith. The Board noted that Walker, during his interview, was \u201cevasive in his answers\u201d; clearly this fact was a proper one to consider in determining Walker\u2019s credibility. Moreover, Walker acknowledged that he had used marihuana, contrary to the tenets of his religion; this fact too was relevant in that it tended to show the depth of his religious convictions. And, in addition, Walker had delayed for a considerable time before asserting his conscientious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>objector claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Salamy v. United States, 379 F.2d 838 (10th Cir. 1967). In sum, there is \u201csome proof that is incompatible with the registrant\u2019s proof of exemption.\u201d Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 396, 74 S.Ct. 152, 157, 98 L.Ed. 132 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Walker\u2019s remaining contention is quickly answered. This Circuit has consistently upheld against attacks on due process grounds the portion of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1624.1(b), which in terms provides that \u201cNo person other than a registrant shall have the right to appear in person before the local board. . . .\u201d United States v. Evans, 425 F.2d 302 (9th Cir. 1970); Uffelman v. United States, 230 F.2d 297 (9th Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-14\">. The minutes of the hearing affirmatively disclose that the sole basis for the Local Board\u2019s determination was AA\u2019alker\u2019s lack of sincerity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-15\">\u201cBoard determined to re-open the registrant's classification to 1-A and deny application for conscientious objector status as registrant was evasive in his answers and did not appear to be living up to his stated beliefs and had not convinced them of his sincerity. Registrant did not request conscientious objector status at time of filling out original questionnaire and his father was a conscientious objector in World War II and had known of the conscientious objector status as was indicated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-20\">Thus, there is no difficulty here, as there was in such cases as United States v. French, 429 F.2d 391 (9th Cir. 1971) and United States v. Haughton, 413 F.2d 736 (9th Cir. 1969) in ascertaining the \u201creasons\u201d for the Board\u2019s action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-14\">. In support of his claim Walker indicated that his opposition to the use of force and to violence had become fixed at a very early age \u2014 an assertion corroborated by his pare\u00f1ts, who declared that their son \u201cwas taught from infancy not to use guns or force of any kind and not to kill.\" Yet Walker, in his initial classification questionnaire, did not state or intimate any such views. Instead, he secured a student II-S classification on a showing that he was attending school. But for several months after he ceased to attend \u2014and hence lost his student deferred status \u2014 he did not assert a claim for a conscientious objector classification. Only after the Board learned that Walker was not a student and classified him 1-A did he do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
