At the trial the plaintiff conceded that the failure to renew her contract was not based on the infringement of any of her substantive constitutional rights but insisted that she had not been afforded a hearing comporting with the minimum requirements of procedural due process. The district court found that plaintiff had in fact been given a hearing by defendants and concluded that \u201cadministrative due process was not lacking in the premises\u201d. The action was dismissed and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-16\">The plaintiff had taught in the Notto-way County Schools for seventeen years. In the spring of 1968 she was told by her principal that he would not recommend her for reappointment for the coming school year. In the discussions with the principal and school superintendent which ensued the reasons for the principal\u2019s decision were explained to plaintiff. By letter to the superintendent dated May 20, 1968, plaintiff asserted that she was unable to reconcile these reasons with the severity of the action taken and she requested a meeting with the School Board \u201cin order that our views may be reviewed and considered by this body.\u201d In this letter she listed the three subjects she wished to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>have discussed and considered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Responding to this request by letter dated May 27, 1968, the superintendent informed plaintiff that a special meeting of the School Board had been called for May 29 \u201cfor the specific purpose of hearing your grievances\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The meeting was held as scheduled, and the plaintiff appeared with her counsel. The matter was given a full airing. The complaints made against plaintiff by the principal were general in nature and seemed to relate for the most part to disciplinary problems. There was no suggestion that plaintiff had been denied employment because of her race or for any other constitutionally impermissible reason. The superintendent reiterated his recommendation and plaintiff and her counsel stated their views. At the request of plaintiff\u2019s counsel the School Board\u2019s decision was deferred until the next regular meeting of the Board which was held on June 13, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Plaintiff and her attorney again appeared at the June meeting, but they tendered no witnesses, offered no additional evidence and did not seek to question further the principal and superintendent. They did not request a further hearing or postponement of decision. The School Board thereupon voted unanimously to follow the recommendations of the principal and superintendent and not to renew plaintiff\u2019s contract for the ensuing year.. This suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">There is a divergence of authority in the circuits on the question of the right of a teacher without tenure to a due process hearing upon non-renewal of a contract of employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This court has not been called upon to decide a case involving refusal to renew the contract of a non-tenured teacher unassociated with a claim of substantive constitutional right violation, but the lower courts of this Circuit, relying on decisions of this court in other public employee cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> have consistently denied the right to a hearing in such eases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">We need not decide here the question of plaintiff teacher\u2019s right to a hearing. Instead, we can assume <em>arguendo </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>she was so entitled and confine our decision to the narrow issue stipulated by the parties and decided by the district court: Was the hearing afforded plaintiff adequate to satisfy the requirement of procedural due process? We hold that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Plaintiff correctly asserts that if she was entitled to a hearing, minimal procedural due process required that she be given adequate notice, a specification of the charges against her, an opportunity to confront the witnesses against her and an opportunity to be heard in her own defense. Ferguson v. Thomas, 430 F.2d 852 (5th Cir. 1970). But it is equally true that \u201c[T]he sufficiency of the procedures employed in any particular situation must be judged in the light of the parties, the subject matter and the circumstances involved\u201d, and that \u201c[W]hen no established procedures exist the school may adopt any method that is adequate to comply with the above m\u00ednimums\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Admittedly the first meeting of the School Board was called on short notice and at best it was an informal forum for the airing of plaintiff\u2019s grievances. There was no statutory procedure prescribed, however, and the evidence was that it was the only procedure the Board had ever employed in such cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the plaintiff herself had requested this meeting, and she was able to attend in person and with counsel. No objection was raised as to insufficiency of notice, and any such objection must now be held to have been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The reasons for the failure of the principal and superintendent to recommend plaintiff\u2019s reappointment apparently were not reduced to writing until the day of the School Board meeting, but the evidence was uncontradicted that she had been given the reasons orally. Conclusive evidence of this is to be found in the statement in her letter requesting the meeting that she found it difficult \u201cto equate the reasons given not to recommend with the action taken\u201d. At no time does it appear that she or her attorney requested a written specification of the charges against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">The only two witnesses appearing against the plaintiff at the meeting were the principal and superintendent. These witnesses were not sworn and the proceedings were not reported but the evidence at the trial fully warranted the district court\u2019s findings that the plaintiff had ample opportunity to question them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The same is true of the court\u2019s finding that plaintiff was permitted to develop her own case fully. She did not produce witnesses in her own behalf, but she had opportunity to do so both at the first meeting and at the second meeting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>which was held two weeks later.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She and her counsel were afforded ample opportunity to be heard at each of the two meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">We conclude that if plaintiff was entitled to a hearing, the procedures employed in the two meetings of the School Board comported fully with due process principles. This accords with the results reached by other courts faced with similar fact situations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-14\">\u201cA. Well, I had debated what to do, if the two men weren\u2019t going to decide. I just wondered what I was going to do anyway and I didn\u2019t know what to do. But I had thought about this, and X had thought now, as you know, and the judge has mentioned so often we didn\u2019t want to bring race into this, and I didn\u2019t want to bring community people to the meeting; I didn\u2019t want to take my husband to the meeting; I didn\u2019t want to go alone and I . . . there were so many things liappen-ing. I thought we better get to the bottom of what was happening in an authentic and responsible manner and once and for all and not to recover the ground, so I called Mr. Hill and said to him concerning the problem that I was having, I would like to have him accompany me to the meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-22\">\u201cQ.

On cross-examination the Chairman of the School Board who testified as a witness for defendants professed unfamiliarity with the meaning of \u201cadversary hearing\u201d and \u201cdue process\u201d, prompting the district judge to observe with respect to the latter that \u201can awful lot of lawyers and an equal number of judges are having an extreme difficulty with it\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\">. \u201cAlthough the School Board was not required to give the plaintiff a hearing re whether or not they were going to give her a teaching contract for the coming school year, under the then Virginia law they voluntarily did so. They convened a special Board meeting so that the members could give their undivided attention to her complaint \u2014 they heard everything she had to say and were willing to listen to any other persons she wanted them to hear \u2014 The school superintendent stated publicly the reasons for not recommending that she be reliired. They allowed her counsel of her own choosing and they gave him every opportunity to question the superintendent and/or any of the Board members. They deferred their final vote for some two weeks at his request. In fact, there is not one word of evidence in this case indicating that the plaintiff was denied the right to literally do anything she wanted to do or to say anything she wanted to say in respect to the subject matter under consideration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b716-13\">.
