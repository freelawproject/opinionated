By this neglect plaintiff lost his remedy, and he can complain only of himself. The law knows no remedy for negligence, while it always favors the diligent. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., arts. 1310,1311; Crosby <em>v. </em>McWillie, 11 Tex., 96; Page <em>v. </em>Findley, 5 Tex., 393; Danzey <em>v. </em>Swinney, 7 Tex., 632.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-8\">IIL This w7as a final judgment, the object of which was to establish the claim sued on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-9\">The claim sued on is established by the judgment as a legal claim against the property of the estate of M.

Defendants had a right to consider this a final judgment and to give notice of appeal, and have the same entered; to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>risk the consequences of hazard on their own judgment as to the finality of said judgment; and the court had no night to refuse to enter that notice, aiid thus have the record incomplete.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-4\"><em>S. B. Barron, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agd\">This cause presents some peculiar features in practice, but defendant in error submits that, on principles of equity as well as on authority, this is a proper action and the judgment of the lower court a proper decree, in which there is no error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-5\">It is argued by plaintiff in error that an effort to collect a debt from an administrator and a failure is a bar to the claim, but he cites no authority to sustain the position. There is no question of the liability of heirs, receiving-portions, for the debts of the ancestor, and there is no statute, save the general statute of limitation, which bars the debt. Suppose, for instance, a creditor held a judgment against a party who \u2018 had died leaving no estate beyond a sufficiency to pay the privileged claims, an administration was opened, and the creditor should choose not to take the trouble and expense of probating his claim, the facts being well known that the administrator would likely have no funds with which to pay the claim, and the administration was duly closed, and afterwards the heirs should inherit a large fortune through the rights of the deceased father, before the claim was barred by the general statute of limitation: would the heirs not be liable to pay the debt? Then is any laches short of that whieli allows the claim to become barred sufficient to defeat the claimant\u2019s rights ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-6\">Defendant in error insists that the heirs, under plaintiff\u2019s amended pleadings, were not improper parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-7\">Defendant in error also claims that the judgment herein sued on is a lien upon the lands of M. L. West, and would be\" good against'those not sold by the administrator, and the heirs, being in possession of the laud, are proper parties, in view of the fraudulent collusion to defeat this claim. George W. Pope, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>one of the heirs, is in possession of the main tract of land, and as it is joint property, he is in possession for himself and the other heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-6\">This judgment was rendered September 24, 1860, with stay of execution until March 1, 1862. B. B. West died in 1865 and M. L. West died in 1867, so that under the stay laws then existing, execution could never have been issued on the judgment. Then it seems that under that statute of November 9, 1866, and the construction given it by this court in Moore <em>v. </em>Letchford, 85 Tex., 185, and Black <em>v. </em>Epperson, 40 Tex., 162, the lien under the judgment would be good until the judgment is barred by the statute of limitation.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b293-7\">Moore, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ\">The demand upon which this suit is prosecuted was presented to appellant for allowance as a valid claim against the estate of which he is the administrator on September 4, 1871, and was by him on said day rejected. This, as was decided by the court when the case was before it on a former appeal, (Gaston <em>v. </em>McKnight, 43 Tex., 619,) put-in operation the limitation of ninety days allowed by law for instituting suit upon it. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 5659.) As suit was not commenced within ninety days from the rejection of the claim, but near two years thereafter on a subsequent presentation and refusal of the administrator to again act upon it, the action, as originally brought, could not be maintained; and on the case being remanded, appellee, by amendment of his petition, made the heirs of appellant\u2019s intestate parties to the suit; and instead of seeking, as in the original petition, a judgment against appellant, to be paid in due course of administration, asked that appellant should be required by the court to at once and without delay make a final settlement of the estate in the County Court, and that the property in his hands be distributed among the heirs, and' the land upon which his debt was claimed to be a lien be held in their hands subject to its payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">On the trial of the case, as presented by appellee\u2019s amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>petition, it was adjudged by the court that appellee\u2019s demand \u201cis hereby established as a just and legal debt against said estate after the same shall be discharged and relieved from the jurisdiction of the County Court.\u201d And further, that \u201cit appearing from the evidence that there exists no good reason why the administration of the estate of M. L.Wcst should not be closed, and the property delivered over to the heirs of said estate, it is therefore ordered and decreed that said administrator proceed without delay to close said administration, or that he show to the County Court a good and valid reason why it be not done.\u201d It was also \u201c adjudged and decreed that appellee take nothing herein against appellant, but that he have and recover his cost, and that the further action and judgment in the cause be suspended until the next term of the court.\u201d From this judgment appellant prosecutes-this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The first question for our consideration is, whether this judgment is so far final as to support the appeal by the administrator. We think it is.' It disposes of all matters of controversy that can arise for determination between him and appellee on the pleadings. It requires the appellant to close the administration, &amp;c. The purpose of continuing the case until the next term is, we infer, to enable the court, by a supplemental decree, to subject the property of the estate, which it supposed would come into the hands of the heirs by that time, to the payment of appellee\u2019s debt. The fact that a case is continued to carry into effect a judgment finally settling and adjusting the matters in controversy, does not prevent an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The judgment being such as will warrant the appeal, is there any error in it of which appellant can complain ? That there is, we think is fully and definitely settled by the former judgment of the court in this case. It is a familiar and well-established principle, that when the law regulating the settlement of estates prescribes that debts against the intestate must be presented to the administrator within a given time or be barred, the failure to do so will bar a recovery, notwithstanding the period allowed for presentation may expire before the comple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>tion of the bar by the general law of limitation. (Graham <em>v. </em>Vining, 2 Tex., 433.)</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b295-9\">[Opinion delivered December 12, 1879.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The law \u201c regulating proceedings in matters of probate \u201d applicable to this,case, while it requires all claims for money, whether evidenced by judgment, mortgage, or note; to be legally exhibited to the administrator before they will servo as the legal foundation of a proceeding against him for their enforcement, permits such claims to be exhibited to the administrator, subject to the conditions imposed by law, at any time before the estate is closed, if not barred by the general law of limitation. But the law further provides, that when once exhibited, if rejected, they shall be barred, unless suit shall be instituted on them within ninety days after their rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Bow, to hold that notwithstanding the presentation to and rejection by the administrator of a claim, it may be again exhibited to him, and if not allowed, or without a subsequent presentation, suit may be brought upon it, would be to disregard and set at naught the express and unequivocal declaration of the statute that such claim shall be barred. The failure to sue within the time limited, when the claim is rejected, must as effectually extinguish it as the failure to present it within the time required under the former law. When a claim is barred by a failure to present it to the administrator, it is barred against the heirs as well as the administrator, notwithstanding its payment was secured by a lien upon land; (Graham <em>v. </em>Vining, 2 Tex., 433;) for, with us, administration is had as well of real as personal property. The failure to note this difference between administration under the statutes of this State and at common law, it is believed, occasioned the error into which, in our opinion, the court has fallen in its judgment in this case, and for which it must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">[Associate Justice Bonner did not sit in this case.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
