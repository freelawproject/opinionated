Judgment lien\u2014Statute construed.\u2014The act of February 14, 1860, (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 3962,) which required judgment, before it could operate as a lien, to be filed for registration, took effect from its passage. The act being complete in itself, and clearly indicating the legislative intent that it should be operative from the time of ils passage, such intent cannot be defeated by a failure in the act to make a specific designation of the time it should go inlo effect, as required by a preexisting statute.

Vendor's lien\u2014Contract.\u2014In the opinion of Justice Gould, the decisions of this court show a broad distinction between the rights of a vendor under an absolute .deed with warranty which recites the existence of unpaid purchase-money notes, but retains no express lien in terms for their payment, and his rights under a deed which declares that a lien is reserved for unpaid purchase-money. Under the former, the vendor has parted with title, and has only\u2019an implied vendor\u2019s lien for ptirchase-mone)'\"; under the latter, the superior title remains with the vendor, and the deed is the evidence of an execu-' tory contract.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-15\">3.

Einney, and others, to recover lot 57 in the city of Brenham, claiming title to and possession of the same on the 1st day of January, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">On the 11th of January, 1879, appellees answered by general demurrer, plea of misjoinder of parties, and plea of not guilty; also special plea alleging that prior to the purchase of said lot by appellants the same had been sold by A. Testard, under whom both parties claimed as a common source, to W. W. Simmons, appellants\u2019 vendor, Testard retaining a vendor\u2019s lien, which was unpaid and unsatisfied at the date of appellants\u2019 purchase; that several years prior to appellants\u2019 purchase one Brown recovered a judgment in the District Court of Washington county against said Testard, which became a lien on the lot; that it was sold by the sheriff to C. Ennis to satisfy the Brown judgment; that Ennis was the owner of the Simmon's notes given to Testard, which evidenced the lien upon the lot; that appellants had notice of the Brown judgment and Simmons notes; and that appellants, prior to the institution of the suit, had sold the lot to Ennis. Defendants also pleaded three and five years\u2019 limitation, possession in good faith, valuable improvements, payment of taxes and non-payment by appellants, and bankruptcy of Boulds Baker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-7\">January 21, 1879, appellants filed a supplemental petition in response, consisting of general denial, plea of not guilty, and a special plea that the Brown judgment never was a lien upon the lot, not having been recorded; that the sheriff\u2019s sale to Ennis was null, void, and fraudulent, because the sheriff had no execution empowering him to make the sale; that the Testard lien had been waived and abandoned; that the Simmons notes were barred by the statute of limitations, and a plea of coverture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-8\">January 24, 1879, appellees answered by general denial and plea of not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-9\">April 6, 1860, John Brown recovered a personal judgment in the District Court of Washington county against A. Testard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>who then owned the lot now sued for. Appellants alleged in their supplemental petition that the judgment did not create nor otherwise become a lien upon the lot in dispute when rendered, nor at any time thereafter, because a transcript of said judgment was not recorded in the record book of mortgages of Washington county, nor was the transcript of the judgment ever filed with the clerk of the County Court for record. The appellees introduced no proof to negative this allegation. September 3, 1860, Testard conveyed the lot to W. W. Simmons, who sold it to Ophelia M. Baker on November 15, 1862.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">Thus the plaintiffs claimed title to the property under one Simmons. The defendants claimed title under Ennis, who bought at the execution sale under the Brown judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-7\">The property in controversy belonged to A. Testard at the date of the judgment, April 6, 1860. A. Testard conveyed it to Simmons by deed with general warranty dated September 3,1860, for the consideration of $1,500 cash in hand paid, and two notes executed to the Testards by Simmons, one for $1,500, due May 1,1861, and the other for $1,000, due January 1, 1862, the notes being referred to in the deed. The Testards at the date qf the execution of the notes transferred them to C. Ennis, the vendor of the defendants, who owns and holds them, both notes being unpaid. Ennis became the purchaser of the lots in controversy at sheriff\u2019s sale on the 5th of January, 1869, and sold one of the lots to the defendant Finney on the 24th of November, 1870, for $500, and the other lot to the defendant Compton for the same price, on the 29th of November, 1870. The defendants Finney and Compton took possession of and improved their lots immediately after their purchase. The plaintiffs claimed title by a conveyance by Simmons to Ophelia M. Baker, dated November 15, 1862.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-8\">The cause was submitted to the court for decision, and judgment rendered for appellees.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-9\"><em>McAdoo Jodon, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-10\">I.

The act of 1st December, 1849, fixing the time at which laws pass\u00e9d shall go into effect, (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 4576,) reads as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u201cEvery law hereafter made shall commence and be in force with the commencement of the sixtieth day after the day of the adjournment of the session of the Legislature at which such law may he passed, unless in the law itself another time for the commencement thereof is particularly mentioned.\u201d The Eighth Legislature adjourned on the 13th of February, 1860. By reference to the Session Laws of the Eighth Legislature, p. 117, it will he seen that the act of February 14,1860, does not prescribe another time for its commencement, as is done in other acts of the same session which took effect from and- after their passage.

Mrs. Baker\u2019s title was evidenced by a deed from W. W. Simmons of date ^November 2, 1862, Simmons having bought of A. Testard, from whom defendants also deraign their title, on September 3, 1860, executing his notes for an unpaid balance of the purchase-money, and receiving a deed which recited the notes. The title of defendants was under an execution sale had on January 5,1869, by virtue of a judgment in the District Court of Washington county, in favor of John Brown against A. Testard and others, of date April 6, 1860, at which sale they claimed that C. Ennis became the purchaser, and subsequently conveyed to them. They further sought to protect themselves in the possession of the lots, asserting that Ennis became the holder of the unpaid purchase-money notes of Simmons, and by reason of that fact acquired and transmitted to them the vendor\u2019s lien of A. Testard, and other rights of Testard in and to the land. They also defended under the five years\u2019 limitation. The case was submitted to the court, and judgment rendered in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Appellants assign as error several rulings of the court in the admission of evidence; but the statements in the brief of counsel are insufficient to enable us to see that the court erred, or, if it erred, that the error was material.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Mrs. Baker\u2019s title is superior to that of defendants, unless the latter and the judgment of the court can be supported on one of the three grounds set up by defendants, as stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">1st. Appellees insist that the John Brown judgment was a lien on the .lot at the date of its rendition, although not recorded as required by the \u201cAct to prevent judgments from becoming dormant, and to create and preserve judgment liens,\u201d passed February 14,1860. This act, it is said, took effect, not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>as stated in Paschal\u2019s Annotated Digest in the margin, and as heretofore assumed by this court, from its passage, but sixty days after the adjournment of the Legislature. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 3962; Boggess <em>v. </em>Howard, 40 Tex., 156.) If this be not so, appellees\u2019 claim to a judgment lien must fail. The act of February, 1860, provides that \u201c no judgment hereafter rendered shall operate as a lien until tiled in the office of the clerk of the County Court of the county where it is rendered, for registration.\u201d Its third .section reads: \u201c From and after the passage of this act no sheriff, or other officer, shall sell real estate under and by virtue of an execution, without having previously obtained from the clerk of the County Court where the sale is made a certificate stating the number and amount of judgments against the defendant in execution of record in his office,\u201d\u2014proceeding to regulate the sale and the distribution of the proceeds on the basis of recorded judgment liens provided for in other sections of the same act. In our opinion, the legislative intent appears on the face of the act, that it shall take effect from its passage. That intention in regard to the third section is expressed so clearly and explicitly as to admit of no other construction. That section is so connected with and dependent upon the others, as to make it impracticable for it to go into operation by itself. Hence, we repeat, it clearly appears on the face of the act that it was intended to take effect from its passage. In our opinion, the legislative intention is to be carried out, notwithstanding the former statute prescribing that \u201cEvery law hereafter made shall commence and he in force with the commencement of the sixtieth day after the day of the adjournment of the session of the Legislature at which such law may be passed, unless in the law itself another time for the commencement thereof is particularly mentioned.\u201d (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 4576.) It is true that after this enactment it was usual to insert in statutes intended to take effect at once a clause providing \u201cthat this act shall take effect from and after its passage.\u201d 'Examples may, however, be found where it is enacted that \u201cfrom and after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>passage of this act\u201d certain things shall be lawful, without any other or particular designation of the time when the act shall take effect. (Gen. Laws 12th Leg., 1st sess., p. 63.) In such cases, the legislative intent is clearly expressed, and is not to be defeated by reason of the failure to make the particular designation required by a former Legislature. The later act, being complete in its own provisions, must control. In a case where a statute is silent, or where its construction is obscure and doubtful, the rule prescribed would apply. We have seen that the statute under consideration is neither silent nor obscure. We know of no way of reconciling the provisions of the two statutes. The third section of the later act speaks in unambiguous language, \u201cfrom the date of its passage,\u201d and therefore cannot be controlled by the former law.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The cases cited by counsel originated when there was a constitutional provision regulating the subject. In such cases the question is, not as to the legislative intent, but whether the act conforms to the constitutional requirement. The Constitution of Illinois directed that no public act take effect until sixty days from the end of the session, \u201cunless, in case of emergency, the General Assembly shall otherwise direct.\u201d A statute prescribed that \u201c from and after the 1st of March next it shall not he lawful,\u201d &amp;c. It -was held that it \u201c did not direct that the act shall become an operative law\u2019 before the time fixed by the constitutional provision quoted.\u201d (Wheeler <em>v. </em>Chubbuck, 16 Ill., 363.) The legislative intent, however clear, v7as inoperative unless expressed in the form prescribed by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">2d. Appellees\u2019 second counter-proposition in support of the judgment is, that \u201cby the sale made under the judgment in favor of Brown <em>v. </em>Testard and others, and by the transfer by the Test\u00e1rds to Ennis of the unpaid purchase-money notes, and the subsequent conveyances from Ennis to the defendants, the title to the property in controversy passed to the defendants in this suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Under this, three minor propositions are submitted, which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>with the authorities cited by counsel in support of each, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u201cFirst minor proposition: When land is conveyed and the deed shows that the vendor\u2019s lien is retained,-the vendor holds the better title. (Roosevelt <em>v. </em>Davis, 49 Tex., 463; Peters <em>v. </em>Clements, 46 Tex., 119; Dunlap\u2019s Administrator v. Wright, 11 Tex., 597; Baker v. Ramey, 27 Tex., 52; Monroe v. Buchanan, 27 Tex., 241; Caldwell v. Fraim, 32 Tex., 327.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u201c Second minor proposition: The title of Testard, the original vendor, passed by the transfer of the two purchase-money notes, and by the sheriff\u2019s sale, to Ennis, the vendor of the defendants in possession. (Baker <em>v. </em>Clepper, 26 Tex., 629.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u201cThird minor proposition : A plaintiff in an .action of trespass to try title not having paid the purchase-money, cannot recover against his vendor, or those claiming under him, who are in possession. (Burgess <em>v. </em>Millican, 50 Tex., 397; Dunlap\u2019s Administrator <em>v. </em>Wright,-11 Tex., 597; Browning <em>v. </em>Estes, 3 Tex., 462; Baker <em>v. </em>Clepper, 26 Tex., 629.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">It is to be remarked that the deed from Testard, as described in the statement of facts, is an absolute deed with warranty; and though it recites that for the unpaid part of the purchase-money certain promissory notes were executed, no express lien is retained to secure their payment. The cases cited by appellees are all-cases where the vendor, though he makes a deed, recites in it that a lien is retained for the unpaid purchase-money, or takes at the time a mortgage or deed of trust to secure its payment. In the opinion of the writer, the decisions of this court show a broad line of demarkation between such cases and the one at bar, holding that the former are executory contracts, in which the superior title remains in the vendor, but classing the latter as executed contracts, in which the vendor has parted with his title, and has only the implied vendor\u2019s lien for the unpaid purchase-money. It is true, the expression has been sometimes used in opinions, that until the purehase-mouey is paid the superior title is in the vendor, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>it will, he thinks, be found that it has always been in discussing a case where there was an express lien, or where the contract was executory. The written argument of one of the counsel for appellants seems to concede appellees\u2019 third minor proposition, if limited to. cases where none of the purchase-money has been paid. The writer is unwilling to place the opinion of the court on appellants\u2019 second counter-proposition on other grounds, without, at the same time, denying the minor propositions submitted as to the superior title or right of possession of a vendor by such a deed as that made by Testard, the purchase-money being unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">But we are unable to see that the assignees or holders of the purchase-money notes acquired, as such, any title or possessory right to the lot, or anything more than the vendor\u2019s lien by which the notes were secured. Nor are we able to see' that Testard had, after conveying the lot to Simmons and parting with the purchase-money notes, any right or interest in the land subject to execution. In our opinion, the judgment cannot be supported on the ground of rights vested in defendants as holders of the purchase-money notes, or as owners of whatever title Ennis acquired at the execution sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">3d. The third ground on which the judgment is supported is, that \u201c the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is barred limitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Without pausing to investigate or pass upon the legal propositions involved,'we remark that it is fatal to the ease attempted to be made for appellees if they had notice of Mrs. Baker\u2019s claim. The defendants appear to have relied on Shephard\u2019s opinion as to the title they were getting, and might well be held chargeable with whatever notice or knowledge Shephard had. Without intending to decide that they had notice of Mrs. Baker\u2019s claim, we remark that it does not appear that the court below passed upon the question, and that the absence of notice does not so appear as to justify us in assuming it. We think it evident that the ease was tried and contested mainly on other grounds, and, under the circumstances, do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>think the judgment should be supported here on the ground of limitation.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b271-8\">[Opinion delivered November 4, 1879.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">On motion for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\"><em>Sayles $ Bassett </em>and <em>Shephard, Garrett, </em>on their application for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">I. The opinion and judgment are predicated on the proposition, that on the execution of the deed from Testard to Simmons the superior title would pass to the vendee, unless there was an express reservation in terms of the vendor\u2019s lien, notwithstanding it did affirmatively appear from the deed that the purchase-money was unpaid,\u2014a proposition which, it is respectfully submitted, is unsupported by principle or by authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">This proposition can be best treated by dividing it into minor propositions, and appending to these such authorities and suggestions as may seem pertinent thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">1. The right of the vendor to land sold is superior to that of the vendee until the purchase-money is paid. The right of the vendee depending upon the payment of the purchase-money, if the conveyance to him shows that the purchase-money is unpaid, he, by the express terms of the instrument, holds it in trust lor the vendor. (2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., secs. 1219, 1220, 1224; Mackreth <em>v. </em>Symmons, 15 Ves. Ch., 336; Garson <em>v. </em>Green, 1 Johns. Ch., 308; Briscoe v. Bronaugh, 1 Tex., 330; Osborn <em>v. </em>Cummings, 4 Tex., 13; Yarborough <em>v. </em>Wood, 42 Tex., 91; White <em>v. </em>Downs, 40 Tex., 225; Cordova <em>v. </em>Hood, 17 Wall., 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">2. In all cases of the sale of land, the purchase-money being unpaid, the vendor\u2019s lien <em>prima: facie </em>exists without any express agreement to that effect, and it lies on the purchaser, and those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>claiming under him with notice of the fact that the purchase-money is unpaid, to show that the vendor agreed to waive the lien. (Parker County <em>v. </em>Sewell, 24 Tex., 238; Autrey <em>v. </em>Whitmore, 31 Tex., 627; Brown <em>v. </em>Christie, 35 Tex., 689; Wasson <em>v. </em>Davis, 34 Tex., 159, and authorities cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">3. The implications of law enter into contracts and form a part of their terms as fully as if expressed in words. (Bulkley <em>v. </em>United States, 19 Wall., 40; United States <em>v. </em>Babbit, 1 Black, (U. S.,) 61; 3 Pars, on Cont., 515; Self <em>v. </em>King, 28 Tex., 552; Rockmore <em>v. </em>Davenport, 14 Tex., 602.) '</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">4. It follows as a corollary, from the foregoing propositions, that when the recitals in the deed show that the purchase-money is unpaid, and refer to and describe the outstanding notes, which notes themselves in express terms undertake to secure the unpaid purchase-money, the lien is retained by the very terms of the contract as fully and completely as if it had been reserved by express words to that effect in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">It is true, as said in.the opinion, that none of the Texas cases in which the proposition is announced, that where the purchase-money remains unpaid the superior title continues in the vendor, are cases in which the vendor\u2019s lien is merely implied; and it is also true that it does not affirmatively appear in any of said cases that such was the character of the lien. But it is equally true that this court has never, until now, held that such a result did not follow where the reservation of the lien arose by implication of law from the recital in the deed that the purchase-money remained unpaid, as well as where the lien was expressly reserved in terms.</p>\n<p id=\"ATT\">Eor is any reason apparent why a distinction should exist in the two cases; for, as we have seen, the cases themselves are identical in principle. When the deed recites that the purchase-money remains unpaid, the reservation of the lien is implied and imputed, as matter of law, to the agreement of the parties. When, in addition to such recital, there is an express reservation, it is nothing more than what the law would declare to be the contract in the absence of any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>stipulation. The provisions of the law enter into every contract and become a part of it, whether expressly incorporated into it or not.</p>\n<author id=\"b273-6\">Could, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A_G\">Having duly considered the application for rehearing, the court adheres to the views expressed in the original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">It is our opinion that the record so describes the deed from Testard to Simmons as to authorize the inference that it is an absolute conveyance, referring in its recitals to notes given for an unpaid balance of the purchase:money, but retaining no express lien for their payment; and we are all agreed that by that deed the title and right of possession passed from Testard to Simmons, subject only to the implied or vendor\u2019s lien to secure the purchase-money notes. It is deemed proper to explain that the original opinion on this subject was expressed as the opinion of the writer, because the court, not regarding the question as necessarily involved in the case, had not passed upon-it, and not because of any difference of opinion on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">We do not regard the recitals in the purchase-money notes as amounting, either alone or in connection with the deed, to an express lien. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">In regard to the defense of limitation, we do uot think that the judgment of the court below can he supported on that ground. Thinking, however, that the court below had probably not passed upon that question, we have preferred, and still prefer, to leave it open.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The motion for rehearing is refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">Motion for rehearing refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
