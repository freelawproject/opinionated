The wife\u2019s interest in the community property is of a purely equitable character, and her right to it, or that of her heirs, is subordinate to that of her surviving husband, or his executor or administrator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-7\">The foregoing proposition involves the following minor propositions, viz.:</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-8\">1. The heirs of the deceased wife are entitled only to the residue of their mother\u2019s interest in the community property, after payment of all debts with which such community property is chargeable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-9\">2. If the husband fails during his life-time, his wife having previously died, to pay all their community debts, then their community property belongs to the estate of the deceased husband, and properly comes under the jurisdiction of the Probate Court in the administration of the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-10\">3. The burden is upon the heirs of the deceased wife, seeking to recover from a purchaser of their father, or his administrator, their mother\u2019s community interest, to prove\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-11\">1. The character of their mother\u2019s community interest\u2014 whether her title is a legal or equitable one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-12\">2. That they are the heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-13\">3. That at the time of sale no community debts existed with which said estate was chargeable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-14\">4. That they have not otherwise received from their father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>estate \u00e1n equivalent for the interest they sue to recover.

If the Probate Court has jurisdiction of a tract of land, as part of an estate, its judgment decreeing and confirming the sale thereof for any of the purposes for which such court is authorized to order the sale of land, protects the purchaser. (Lynch <em>v. </em>Baxter, 4 Tex., 431; Burdett <em>v. </em>Silsbee, 15 Tex., 604; Alexander <em>v. </em>Maverick, 18 Tex., 178; George <em>v. </em>Watson, 19 Tex., 354; Withers <em>v. </em>Patterson, 27 Tex., 501; McCreery <em>v. </em>Fortson, 35 Tex., 647.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-9\">III. The plaintiffs below have received the proceeds of the sale of the tract of land they sue to recover, and these payments to thgm constitute a counter equity, <em>pro tanto, </em>against their equitable title; or if they assert a legal title, they must refund the sums received before they can recover. (Jones\u2019 Administrator <em>v. </em>Jones, 15 Tex., 143; Bartlett\u2019s Heirs <em>v. </em>Cocke, 15 Tex., 471; Monroe <em>v. </em>Leigh, 15 Tex., 519.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-11\"><em>Timmons g Brown, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-12\">I. The interest of the heirs of the deceased wife in the land sued for, is a legal and not an equitable one; and to entitle them to recover it, they have only to prove that it was community property owned by their father and mother at the time of the death of the mother, and that they are the heirs of the mother. (Johnson <em>v. </em>Harrison, 48 Tex., 257; Yancy <em>v. </em>Batte, 48 Tex., 46; Thompson <em>v. </em>Cragg, 24 Tex., 582.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-14\">n. The decree of the Probate Court made in the matter of the administration of the estate of J. R. Robson, could not affect the interest of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-15\">It is not shown that any debts existed against the community, nor is any fact shown that would' give the court authority to sell the community interest of the mother of plaintiffs in the tract of land sued for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>1st. If there' were' community debts existing at' Mrs. Bob-son\u2019s death, then her surviving husband might, if he had seen fit to do so, have sold the land in controversy to raise money to pay them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-6\">2d. This power was in the surviving husband alone, and did not pass to his personal representative upon his death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-7\">3d. A creditor of the community could only subject the interest of the deceased wife to the payment of his debt after the death of both husband and wife, by or through au administration upon both estates, and not by an administration upon the estate of the husband alone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-8\">4th. The purchaser at a sale made by virtue of proceedings had in the estate of the husband alone, would buy subject to the rule <em>caveat emptor, </em>and would take only the interest of the deceased husband.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-9\">5th. The community interest of the wife in this case could not be sold to raise money to pay an allowance to the second wife and minor children of the husband. Only the property of the husband could be sold for this purpose.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b423-10\">Gould, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AnB\">The community interest of the first wife of John R. Hobson in the land in controversy vested, on her death, in her children, and their father having died after a second marriage, that community interest was not subject to sale as a part of his estate for the purpose of raising an allowance for his widow and minor children, including a child of the second marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">The purchaser at a sale ordered for that purpose acquired no title to the community interest in the land sold, inherited by the children of the first wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">The defense of equitable estoppel was not made out. Some of the plaintiffs were minors entitled to and receiving a share of the allowance for the benefit of the widow and minor children. That allowance had been made, and the greater part paid, before the sale of this land, and there were assets of the estate properly applicable to the payment of the balance. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the administrator paid the balance of their share out of the proceeds of the sale ordered by the court, this would not estop the minors from recovering their land.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b424-6\">[Opinion delivered January 23, 1880.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Z\">[Chief Justice Moore dissented.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
