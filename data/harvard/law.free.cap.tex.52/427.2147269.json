Palmer, for twelve-acre lot number 3 in block 19, in the town of Liberty, Palmer being then in possession of the lot, and claiming under a deed from William C. Abbott, vendee of the executors, who, acting under the will of Hugh Jackson, had previously\u2014June 9,1856\u2014conveyed the same to Abbott.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-8\">The petition alleged, amongst other things, that the lot and improvements constituted the homestead of Hugh Jackson and family at the date of his death, on the 12th of October, 1854, and remained such until after the death of his wife Elizabeth, which occurred in May, 1856; that Hugh and Elizabeth, at the dates of their deaths, respectively, died seized and possessed of the.property; that in pursuance of item <em>4 </em>of the will of Hugh Jackson, the executors, after the death of Elizabeth, sold and conveyed the property to William 0. Abbott on the 9th of June, 1856; that Abbott agreed and promised to pay to the executors the sum of $1,500 in three installments of $500 each, evidenced by three promissory notes executed on and bearing same date with the day of sale and deed of conveyance to him, one of the notes being made payable to the executors twelve months after date, another twenty-four months after date, and tho third thirty-six months afterdate; that on the same day of sale and conveyance to Abbott, in accordance with the terms of sale, to secure the purchase-money of the lot, Abbott exc-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The petition further alleged the minority of the children of the said Hugh and Elizabeth up to within two years of the .filing of suit; that all the property belonging to the estate of decedents had been fully administered, debts paid, and partition had among said children, save the lot in controversy, which, it was averred, belonged, both in law and equity, to them as heirs and legatees aforesaid, unless and until the purchase-money therefor be fully paid according to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>tract of sale to Abbott, with which Palmer refused to comply; that the premises when sold to Abbott were well worth $1,500, but by reason of use, neglect in repairs, &amp;c., they arc not worth exceeding $500; that none of the purchase-money, save the first above-mentioned note of $500, had been paid or in any manner satisfied or discharged; that Abbott and Palmer and their legal representatives have had the use and enjoyment of the premises since the day of sale thereof by the executors to Abbott, and that the petitioners and none of them hqve ever since the sale had or received any benefit therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-5\">The relief prayed for was, that the claim of Palmer, or pretense of ri^ht and title set up by him, to the premises, be annulled and forever barred, unless the purchase - money remaining due and unpaid be promptly paid off and discharged, with the interest accrued, as specified in the promissory notes to petitioners, to the end that the property might be restored in equity to those to whom of right it belonged, namely, the heirs and legatees of Hugh and Elizabeth Jackson; that if the purchase-money be not paid by defendant under the order of the court, then that the lot be adjudged to belong to the estate of decedents or their children, that the writ of possession issue, and that they have judgment for their damages and costs of suit, and general and equitable relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-6\">In 1874 defendant Palmer died, and after him John Jackson, executor, one of the plaintiffs, and the cause was continued from term to term to make parties, &amp;c. Proper parties being made, (to wit, Palmer\u2019s administrator, widow, and children,) and the ple\u00e1dings of the parties having been amended to conform to the change of parties, the cause came to trial at the September Term of the court, 1879; the defendants answering by demurrer, pleas of not guilty, statute of limitation of three, five, and ten years, <em>res adjvdicata, </em>waiver of the vendor\u2019s lien by reason of the mortgage covering other property than the lot sold to secure the purchase-money, and four years\u2019 limitation as to the notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>To defendants\u2019 answer, the plaintiffs interposed a demurrer, which being overruled, trial was had, resulting in verdict and judgment for the defendants. Palmer had actual and constructive notice of the mortgage when he purchased, which was executed and recorded contemporaneous with the deed, and recited that the notes were for purchase-money. From this judgment the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first charge asked, which was refused, and which is referred to in the opinion, was as follows, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-7\">\u201c The deed and mortgage of the 9th of June, 1856, are to be considered together and as one instrument affecting the title of the property as conveyed by the Jacksons to Abbott, and you are instructed as to the legal effect thereof that said instruments operate to vest the superior title in the plaintiffs, and give them the right to recover the lot in controversy in default of the payment of the balance of the purchase-money that the evidence may show to he due and yet unpaid. If you believe from the evidence that the purchase-money promised by Abbott has not been fully paid according to the terms of the sale between him and the Jacksons, I charge you, the law is this: that, with respect to the plaintiffs, all the right or title which Palmer, or his legal representatives or heirs, acquired by the deed to Abbott, of date 12th of January, 1860, was what is styled the \u2018 equity of redemption,\u2019 or a right in the nature of an equity of redemption; that is, the right to have a perfect title from the plaintiffs on the single condition of the payment of the balance, if any, of purchase-money that may by the evidence he shown to be due and unpaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-8\">Other features of the charge complained of will be apparent from a reference thereto in appellants\u2019 brief,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-9\"><em>Davis Sayles, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-10\">I. The jury were instructed in the first and second paragraphs of the charge, in effect, that the vendor\u2019s lien must be retained or expressly reserved in the deed of conveyance, in order to enable or entitle the vendor to assert his superior right or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>equity to the land as against, the vendee and those claiming under him. In this there was error. Such lien might be and was expressly reserved by the mortgage executed simultaneously with the deed from the Jacksons to Abbott. (Wallis <em>v. </em>Beauchamp, 15. Tex., 305; The Howards <em>v. </em>Davis, 6 Tex., 180; Dunlap <em>v. </em>Wright, 11 Tex., 597; Baker <em>v. </em>Ramey, 27 Tex., 53; Monroe <em>v. </em>Buchanan, 27 Tex., 245; McAlpin <em>v. </em>Burnett, 19 Tex., 497; Burgess <em>v. </em>Millican, 50 Tex., 401; Brush <em>v. </em>Ware, 15 Pet, 112.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-5\">n. The court erred in its charge to the jury in this: The third paragraph of the charge plainly implies that the taking of the mortgage by the Jacksons (embracing as it did other prop\u00bb erty than that sold) was, in itself, the taking such \u201c distinct and independent security\u201d for the purchase-money as <em>ipso facto </em>operated to waive the lien of the vendors, regardless of the terms of the mortgage, and the plain intent of the parties as shown by the deed arid mortgage, taken and construed together. (Peters <em>v. </em>Clements, 46 Tex., 122; Masterson <em>v. </em>Cohen, 46 Tex., 521; Price <em>v. </em>Lauve, 49 Tex., 83 ; Burgess <em>v. </em>Millican, 50 Tex., 403; Irvin <em>v. </em>Garner, 50 Tex., 49.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-6\">TIT. The court erred in its charge in this: The third paragraph of said charge misled the jury in that the same proceeds upon the fallacy that the plaintiffs were under some obligation to protect the defendants against the consequence of Abbott\u2019s bad faith, and the refusal of his administrator to accept the claim preferred therefor and pay the balance of the purchase-money; and further, in that it assumes that if the plaintiffs\u2019 right of action or remedy on the mortgage is barred by limitation, then their right to recover possession of the lot is lost. (Estes <em>v. </em>Browning, 11 Tex., 243 ; Roosevelt <em>v. </em>Davis, 49 Tex., 463; Keys <em>v. </em>Mason, 44 Tex., 140; Clay v. Hart, 49 Tex., 438; Black <em>v. </em>Rockmore, 50 Tex., 96; Swain <em>v. </em>Cato, 84 Tex., 395; Flanagan <em>v. </em>Cushman, 48 Tex., 244.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-7\">IV. The court further erred in its charge in this: In the fourth paragraph of said charge it is therein assumed that the deed to Abbott, and the mortgage by him to the Jacksons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>although duly recorded in Liberty county, gave no notice to Palmer of the rights and lien of plaintiffs. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., arts. 4988, 4994; Jones <em>v. </em>The State, 13 Tex., 175; 25 Tex. Supp., 256; Chamblee <em>v. </em>Tarbox, 27 Tex., 146.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-6\">V. The eighth assignment, relied on as a proposition, is that the court erred in refusing to give the charge, asked by plaintiffs, marked number 1. (Blankenship <em>v. </em>Douglas, 26 Tex., 228 ; Hedgepeth <em>v. </em>Robertson, 18 Tex., 871; 13 Tex., 583; Pierce <em>v. </em>Randolph, 12 Tex., 295; Rogers <em>v. </em>Broadnax, 24 Tex., 543 ; Marsh <em>v, </em>Hubbard, 50 Tex., 208; Mims <em>v. </em>Lockett, 23 Ga., 241.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-7\">VI. The charge of the court was erroneous in this: That it assumed that Palmer, notwithstanding the notice had by him of all the facts, acquired a better title than Abbott himself got from the Jacksons; in other words, that Palmer, in this contest, has superior rights and equities to those which Abbott could assert were he the defendant in the action. (Dunlap <em>v. </em>Wright, 11 Tex., 603; Fraim <em>v. </em>Frederick, 32 Tex., 308; Caldwell <em>v. </em>Fraim, 32 Tex., 326; Williams <em>v. </em>Murphy, 36 Tex., 76; Baker <em>v. </em>Compton, <em>supra, </em>252; Delespine <em>v. </em>Campbell, <em>supra, </em>4; Chew <em>v. </em>Barnet, 11 S. &amp; R., 389, 392; Jewett <em>v. </em>Palmer, 7 Johns.

Pickett, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApF\">\u2014 The third paragraph of the judge\u2019s charge, assigned as\"error by appellants; is, in substance, that when a party sells land and takes a mortgage or other independent security, as upon the land sold and upon other lands he will be considered to have waived the lien; and that if he allows the purchase-money debt and mortgage to become barred, he cannot recover back the property sold from a subsequent purchaser from his vendee for value.. This charge is not error. (Baker <em>v. </em>Compton, <em>supra, </em>252; Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., 633, 634, 642, 643, 1520, 1522; Pitschki <em>v. </em>Anderson, 49 Tex., 1; McDonough <em>v. </em>Cross, 40 Tex., 251; Brightman <em>v. </em>Word, 37 Tex., 311; Parker County <em>v. </em>Sewell; 24 Tex., 238.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Gould, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AKO\">The controlling question in this case is as to the legal effect of the sale and conveyance by the executors of Hugh Jackson to W. O. Abbott, and the contemporaneous mortgage given by Abbott to said executors to secure the purchase-money notes for the lot conveyed to him, said mortgage embracing several other lots, the property of Abbott, as well as the lot bought by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Our opinion is, that the legal effect of these instruments was to make the contract executory, and that the superior title to the lot remained in the heirs and executors of the estate of Hugh Jackson, entitling them to recover possession, although the purchase-money notes were barred. We see nothing in the fact that the mortgage embraced other property, nor in the language of the mortgage, to take the case out of the rule laid down in Dunlap <em>v. </em>Wright, and in numerous cases following that authority. That rule is firmly established, and its operation should not be rendered uncertain by introducing an exception which seems to us mainly founded on a doubt as to the correctness of the rule itself, and a consequent disposition to limit its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Although the purchase-money notes were barred, the vendees of the purchaser\u2014Abbott having bought from one whose title was dependent on payment of the purchase-money, and having notice thereof\u2014could not successfully resist the recovery of the lot, the purchase-money being unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">If, after resisting the suit for the collection of the purchase-money and the enforcement of the mortgage on all of the .mortgaged property, the defendants have any equitable rights growing out of the laches of the plaintiffs, those equities, not having been set up in their pleadings, cannot be considered. It is .not seen, however, that they have any equity that will protect them from the legal title of plaintiffs. The plaintiffs occupied to them no such relation as imposed the-duty of diligence in the enforcement of their remedies in order to protect defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Because the .court erred in refusing the first charge asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>by plaintiffs, and in its charge as given, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b443-7\">[Opinion delivered January 27, 1880.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
