This property was no part of the estate of A.

Pope at the time of his death in 1872, and he left surviving him constituents of a family, viz., .bis wife, Beatrice H. Pope, and Miss Lou Pope, an unmarried daughter, and two minor sons, Asa and Irvine Pope.

Under the law' in force anterior to 1870, after the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>of the incumbrancer the homestead was virtually relieved of the incumbrance, for the reason that the homestead was part of the estate and subject to the jurisdiction of the Probate Court, and any foreclosure must necessarily result in a forced sale, which was then inhibited by law. (Robertson\u2019s Administratrix <em>v. </em>Paul, 16 Tex., 472.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-6\">Under the Constitution of 1869 and the act of the Legislature of 1870, no lien, even for the purchase-money of a homestead, or for labor and material expended thereon, could be enforced in the Probate Court, the Probate Court having no jurisdiction of the property, but must have been enforced by a direct action against the heir, &amp;c.

The death of the constituent of an irrevocable power, or a power coupled with an interest, does not revoke the power, nor does such death discharge the estate descending directly to the heir of any incumbrance or lien legitimately created by the ancestor.

Appellant bought the property at a sale by the trustee executing the power vested in the trustee, and took such title as A. Pope, the constituent, had at the date of the deed of trust.

Alexander Pope, one \u00f3f the parties to the deed of trust to M. L. McClure, having died, the power to sell was revoked. (Robertson\u2019s Administratrix <em>v. </em>Paul, 16 Tex., 474; Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 5650.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-11\">II. Alexander Pope, one of the parties to the deed of trust, having died, the sale of the property by McClure was a nullity. There was an administration on the estate of Alexander Pope, deceased, and the claim must be paid in accordance with the law of estates. (Robertson\u2019s Administratrix <em>v. </em>Paul, 16 Tex., 474; Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 5650; McLane <em>v. </em>Paschal, 47 Tex., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>365, and authorities referred to by Judge Moore in McLane <em>v. </em>Paschal.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b300-4\">Gould, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AyF\">In this case, after the death of the maker of a mortgage with power of sale, and pending administration on bis estate, a sale was had under the power, and the purchaser at that sale asserts his title in this suit against the heirs of the deceased debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"AeD\">Since the decision in Robertson\u2019s Administratrix <em>v. </em>Paul, such sales have been held invalid. The reason upon which that line of decisions is founded, is not that the power is revoked by death, but that our statutes governing the settlement of estates postpone such claims to sundry others, including the allowance to be made to the widow and children in lieu of a homestead and other exempt property, and that a sale under the power would be inconsistent with these statutory preferences. \" In this case, the land covered by the mortgage with power of sale was the homestead of the deceased at the time he executed the mortgage and at the time of his death, in 1872. The probate law then in force contained a provision that \u201c The property reserved from forced sale by the Constitution and laws of this State, or its value, if there be no such property, does not form any part of the estate of a deceased person when a constituent of the family survives.\u201d (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 5487.) It is argued, that as this homestead constituted no part of the estate, its sale could not interfere with the priorities allowed by the statute regulating the administration of estates. Hence it is claimed that the sale was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In our opinion, this position .cannot be maintained without a departure from former decisions. Exempt property constituted no part of the estate for the payment of debts before the probate law of 1870. That law, in directing that exempt property shall constitute no part of the estate, was not designed to interfere with the established policy of our laws to allow no mere mortgage lien to be so enforced as to deprive the widow and children of the exempt property, or an allowance in lieu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>thereof. Under that statute, as under former and subsequent statutes, the Probate Court was authorized to make an allowance in lieu of a homestead and exempt property, and that allowance was to be paid in preference to claims secured by mortgage or lien. (Terry <em>v. </em>Terry, 39 Tex., 313; Mayman <em>v. </em>Reviere, 47 Tex., 357; McLane v. Paschal, 47 Tex., 370, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">If one lien creditor could appropriate the homestead because of his power of sale, the property on which other creditors have a lien might be taken to supply to the family of the deceased their allowance in lieu of the lost homestead. The preferences given by the statute would be interfered with if there were no other property, and if there were no other assets than those incumbered with liens, gross inequality between lien creditors of the same class would often be the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The mortgage with power of sale was but an incident to the claim against the estate. That claim \u201c comes within the letter and policy of the law which requires the presentation of the claim, and which postpones its payment to other preferred claims.\u201d (Robertson\u2019s Administratrix <em>v. </em>Paul, 16 Tex., 476; Black <em>v. </em>Rockmore, 50 Tex., 88.) In the latter ease the rule in Robertson\u2019s Administratrix <em>v. </em>Paul was enforced, although there was no administration, the estate being managed by the survivor of the community under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b301-10\">Moore, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Anm\">As no notice has been taken of the fact in the report of the case of Black <em>v. </em>Rockmore, 50 Tex., 88, I avail myself of the present opportunity to say that I dissented from so much of the judgment in that case as holds that the power of sale given by the trust deed was revoked by the death of the grantor. And I add, that I only concur in the judgment in this case on the ground that the questions in it have been in effect ruled upon and deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>mined in Black <em>v. </em>Rockmore, and other cases in which they were involved.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b302-6\">[Opinion delivered December 12, 1879.]</decisiondate>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
