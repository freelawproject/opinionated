The exceptions to the intervention of C. IT. Moore &amp; Co. and of Wedemeyer &amp; Schulte, should have been sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b636-14\">In ascertaining their right to intervene, regard must be had <em>not </em>only <em>to </em>their pleadings, but also to those of the original parties. The proceeding to foreclose the mechanic\u2019s lien, under the statute, is a proceeding <em>in rern. </em>The plaintiff sued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>for balance due him on contract for erecting, and furnishing the material for, the building of defendant, and for extra work. It is true he claimed a lien, but there was an entire absence of allegations in his petition by which to support the claim. There was no allegation that the contract referred to by him, under which the work was performed, or that the bill of particulars for the extra work sued for, was ever recorded, so as to fix or secure the lien, as contemplated by the statute. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 7112.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-6\">II. These intervenors were sub-contractors. They were bound to know and take notice of the contract as between the plaintiff and defendant, and no lien independent of the original contract could arise\u2014none other could be secured or fixed\u2014and in order to fix a lien as to any one, whether original or sub-contractor, the contract should have been recorded within the time prescribed by law. It was never recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-7\">The lien of a sub-contractor, if he have any, is subordinate to the owner\u2019s contract, (Phil, on Mech. Liens, sec. 62, p. 90,) of which the sub-contractor is conclusively presumed to know. The mere fact that the intervenors claimed a debt due them from the owner for work on the same building contracted to be built by Sanford for the defendant, would not entitle them to intervene. \u201cHo personal judgment in favor of a subcontractor can be rendered against the owner, because not personally liable to him; his remedy is <em>in </em>rem, against the property only, and that to the extent of the contractor\u2019s lien, to which the sub-contractor may be subrogated.\u201d (Phil, on Mech. Liens, p. 308.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-8\">But the question still recurs, How can either or any have a lieu, secure or fix such lien, so as to entitle them to this extraordinary statutory remedy? We answer, by recording such contract, through which each and all must derive their lien, which is not fixed or secured till recorded, and only from thenceforth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-9\">HI. But supposing that the allegations of the plaintiff' had set forth the facts which, under the statute, would fix and se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>cure a lien in him, then the question would recur, with respect to the petition of C. H. Moore &amp; Co., is it, considered with respect to itself, sufficient ? The statute calls for judicial interpretation. We think a correct rendering of article 7112 of Paschal\u2019s Digest is: \u201c Any person or firm, [being] artisan or mechanic,\u201d &amp;c. And this interpretation is strengthened when we come to the second clause of the first section of the act:</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b638-4\">\u201c In order to fix and secure the lien herein provided for, the contractor, mechanic, laborer, or artisan' furnishing material, shall have the right at any time within six months after such debt becomes due to file his contract, &amp;c. If the contract, order, or agreement be verbal, &amp;c., a bill of particulars must be recorded. When such contract or account is filed and recorded, it shall be deemed sufficient diligence to fix and secure the lien,\u201d &amp;c., from date of filing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b638-5\">C. H. Moore &amp; Co. do not show by allegation that they were of the class for whom the statute provides, unless it be held that the statute means that \u201c any person or firm \u201d whose material is used in the construction of a building is entitled to the lien, without regard to his or their vocation or to his or their relation to the building. The courts will not extend the lien by construction. (Cronkright <em>v. </em>Thomson, 1 E. D. Smith, (N. Y.,) 661; Doughty <em>v. </em>Devlin, Id., 646; 2 E. D. Smith, 556, 596, 611; 33 Mo., 396; 3 Oregon, 372; 43 Cal., 515; 24 Ill., 517; 24 Wis., 563.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b638-9\">IY. The judgment in favor of intervenors derives no support from the special finding of the facts by the jury; for these must be tested by the pleadings. A fact found or proven without allegation, affords no more ground for judgment than does an allegation without proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b638-10\">Y. An owner cannot be made pay more than the contract price, and the garnishing notice only stops payments from thenceforth. All payments before that are valid. (Phil. on Mech. Liens, p. 270; 1 Sandf., 14.) The garnishing notice referred to is the statutory notice of attested account, delivered to the owner or the claimant, showing amount claimed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>for what work or material,\u2014not a mere dry notice, independent of the form required by statute; for we remark here, that there is no allegation of such notice as, under the statute, would operate as garnishment in favor of intervenors C. H. Moore &amp; Co., and that the verdict of the jury of notice, &amp;c., cannot aid the intervenors\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-6\">In the ease of Holmes <em>v. </em>Shands, 26 Miss., 639, the court held, that \u201c where the material or labor is bestowed by contract with a third person and on his account, such person being under contract with the owner of the property to do the work and furnish the material, there is no liability on the part of the owner of the property, except to the party with whom he contracted.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-7\">And again, in 2 Ohio St., 124, it is said: \u201cMaterial must be furnished for the purpose or with the understanding that it shall be used for the purpose of some building, on the credit of the building rather than on the personal credit of the buyer.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-8\">That the decree for the sale of the homestead lots\u2014not the house only\u2014was error, we are prepared to show upon authority and reason ; and on that question would prefer to be heard orally before your honorable court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b639-9\"><em>Harcourt Spencer </em>and <em>James B. Stubbs, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANq\">The first assignment is, that \u201c the court erred in overruling the demurrer and special exceptions to the intervenors.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-10\">I. This action of the court was correct, certainly as far as the general demurrer was concerned, and the special exceptions were only to that part asserting a lien on the property under the law then in force. All the requisites of a valid mcchauic\u2019s and material-man\u2019s lien were stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-11\">II. The j udgment follows as matter of course upon the verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-12\">The jury found on the general charge in favor of plaintiff for \u00a7483.75, and upon the special issues. [See statement of case.] (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 7112; Shields <em>v. </em>Morrow, 51 Tex.,. 393; Waldroff <em>v. </em>Scott, 46 Tex., 1.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>III. An intervenor can avail himself of the benefit of the original suit, and show that he is entitled to the subject in dispute to the exclusion of either party; and whether the subject be the recovery of a personal judgment, the foreclosure of a lien, or both, our practice favors such consolidation, which is, perhaps, the only proper course. (Waldroft <em>v. </em>Scott, 46 Tex., 1; Hancock <em>v. </em>Dimon, 17 Tex., 369; Eccles <em>v. </em>Hill, 13 Tex., 65; Smith <em>v. </em>Allen, 28 Tex., 497; Pomeroy\u2019s Remedies, 458-468; Stich <em>v. </em>Dickinson, 38 Cal., 608.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-4\">IV. The alleged promise of Pool to pay interveuors for work done and material furnished towards the erection of his building, was an original undertaking, and not the promise to pay the debt of another; and upon that ground interveuors stated a good cause of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-5\">V. The act of November 17, 1871, (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 7112,) provided that when labor was performed or material furnished in the erection of improvements upon a homestead, the person so performing the work and furnishing the material should have a lien upon the lots and the improvements, to be secured and enforced as in other cases, and was entitled to an order of sale. (Act of November 17,1871, secs. 3, 4; Pope <em>v. </em>Graham, 44 Tex., 196.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-6\">VI. Where the petition contains a good cause of action, and there is no statement of facts and bills of exception, it will be presumed that the facts in evidence before the jury sustained their verdict, and that everything was proved which was susceptible of legal proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-7\">VII. In the absence of a statement of facts, this court cannot revise the rulings of the court below in giving or refusing instructions. (Teas <em>v. </em>McDonald, 13 Tex., 355; Roberts <em>v. </em>Heffner, 19 Tex., 131; Baldwin <em>v. </em>Dearborn, 21 Tex., 446; St. Clair <em>v. </em>McGehee, 22 Tex., 5; Walling <em>v. </em>Kinnard, 10 Tex., 508.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b640-8\">Bonner, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AUM\">It is contended by appellantPool that appellees Moore &amp; Co. and Wedemeyer &amp; Schulte had no right to intervene in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>We have no statute providing for the right of intervention, but our practice on this subject, as said in Whitman <em>v. </em>Willis, 51 Tex., 425, is probably derived through the Ecclesiastical Courts of England and the modifications of the civil law as found in the State of Louisiana, and rests upon the principle that a party should be permitted to do that voluntarily which, if known, a court of equity would require to he done.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In 2 Chitty\u2019s General Practice, 492, it is stated that \u201c if any third person consider that his interest will be affected by a cause which is pending, he is not bound to leave the care of his interest to either of the litigants, but has a right to intervene or be made a party to the cause, and to take on himself the defense of his own rights, provided he does not disturb the order of the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">In Brown <em>v. </em>Saul, 4 Mart., N. S., La.,) 434, decided in the Supreme Court of Louisiana, to which State we can very appropriately look for light upon this question, it was held, that to give this right the intervenor should have with one of the original parties a union of interest in relation to the subject-matter in dispute, and that this interest should be founded on some right, claim, or lien, either conventional or legal, directly and closely connected with this subject-matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Mr. Pomeroy, in his work on Remedies and Remedial Rights, sec. 430, after a review of the decisions in Iowa, California, and Louisiana, sums up the doctrine of intervention in the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">\u201c The intervenor\u2019s interest must be such, that if the original action had never been commenced, and he had first brought it as the sole plaintiff*, he would have been entitled to recover in his own name to the extent at least of a part of the relief sought; or if the action had first been brought against him as a defendant, he would have been able to defeat the recovery, in part at least. His interest may be either legal or equitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">It is believed that our practice substantially conforms to these principles, and permits intervention in suits for real or personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>property. (Field <em>v. </em>Gantier, 8 Tex., 74; Eccles <em>v. </em>Hill, 13 Tex., 65; Burditt v. Glasscock, 25 Tex. Supp., 45; Smith <em>v. </em>Allen, 28 Tex., 497; Smalley <em>v. </em>Taylor, 33 Tex., 668; Mussina <em>v. </em>Goldthwaite, 34 Tex., 125; Whitman <em>v. </em>Willis, 51 Tex., 421; Sayles\u2019 Prac., ch. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Upon the issues as presented by the pleadings, we are of opinion that the claims of the original plaintiff, Sanford, and of the intervenors were so intimately connected, and so dependent the one upon the other, as to present a proper case and subject-matter for intervention, so that the respective rights and interests of all the parties, including the plaintiff himself, could be adjusted and protected. (Phil. on Mech. Liens, sec. 205; Loonie <em>v. </em>Hogan, 5 Seld., (9 N. Y.,) 440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">To hold otherwise might, subject the property to the very liability suggested by appellant\u2014the enforcement of two or more liens for the same indebtedness. (Waldroff <em>v. </em>Scott, 46 Tex., 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The demurrer of appellant Pool, defendant below, to the pleadings of Sanford, the original plaintiff\u2019, so far as he sought to enforce his alleged mechanic\u2019s lien, should have been sustained. The right to such lien depends upon a substantial compliance with the statute giving the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The requisites of the statute are necessarily descriptive of the lien, and if omitted in the pleadings should subject them to demurrer. (Tinsley <em>v. </em>Boykin, 46 Tex., 599; Sutherland <em>v. </em>Ryerson, 24 Ill., 517; Shaw <em>v. </em>Allen, 24 Wis., 564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">The only allegation in the petition, in regard to the lien, was that plaintiff claimed \u201cthat the work and materials furnished by him in his business as a mechanic gave him a lien upon the said dwelling and lots.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">If, however, the pleadings of plaintiff had been sufficient on general demurrer, they were clearly insufficient when tested by the special demurrers of defendant, and these should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">The same objection applied to the petition of intervenors Moore &amp; Co., so far as they sought a lien, either as principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>or sub-contractors, unless the recitals in the exhibit to their petition can be taken as affirmative allegations of the grounds of their alleged lien. This exhibit was referred to only as an itemized account of the articles furnished' by them, and of tho value of the same. It shows, however, that it was recorded and a copy served upon defendant Pool as required by statute to fix the lien, but there were no allegations to this effect in the pleading itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Rule 19 of this court, for the government of the District Courts, (47 Tex., 620,) provides that exhibits may be attached to a pleading, and referred to as such, in aid and explanation of the allegations therein; but this will not relieve the pleader from making the proper allegations, of which the exhibits maybe the evidence, in whole or in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">This is but declaratory of what the proper practice was before the adoption of the rules, and tested by it, the demurrer to so much of the pleadings of Moore &amp; Co. as claimed a lien should have been sustained. These iutervcnors did not, by-proper and appropriate allegations, show that either the original plaintiff, Sanford, or they themselves were entitled to a mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The petition of Wedemeyer &amp; Schulte did not show that Sanford was entitled to the mechanic\u2019s lien, but it was sufficient to entitle them, if sustained by the evidence, to such lien as principal contractors themselves. There is no statement of facts in the record, hut there were certain special verdicts in response to issues made up under the direction of the court, and which, under the statute, are \u201c conclusive between the parties as to the facts found.\u201d (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1469; Rev.Stats., art. 1332.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">' Although there seems .to be some inconsistency in these special verdicts, yet, in our opinion, their legal effect, as presented to us, is, that the contracts with both Moore &amp; Co. and Wedenmyer &amp; Schulte were made with Sanford, tho original contractor, and not with appellant Pool, the owner. If this were so, it would make them sub-contractors under Sanford, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>and not original contractors. As to intervenors Wedemeyer &amp; Schulte, in the absence of a statement of facts we would presume that the evidence sustained their allegations that they were original contractors, and the judgment of the court below to this effect, were it not for this affirmative finding by the jury to the contrary. Under their pleading and the special issues, the court erred in adjudging the lien in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">For the error of the court in overruling the exceptions of appellant Pool to the original petition of plaintiff, Sanford, and to the petition for intervention of Moore &amp; Co., in so far as the same claimed the mechanic\u2019s lien, and the further error in rendering judgment on the special issues in favor of both intervenors for the enforcement of such lien, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">As the cause will be remanded, it is proper that we indicate our opinion upon certain questions which are presented in the record, and which may arise on another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">1. To authorize the court to decree to either the original plaintiff or the intervenors a judgment for the enforcement of the mechanic\u2019s lien as original contractors, they must, by appropriate allegations and proof, show that they are entitled to the same. In our opinion, the intervenors Moore &amp; Co. come under the designation, \u201c any person or firm,\u201d used in the statuto, and are within both its letter and spirit. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 7112.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">2. As heretofore decided by this court, the mere fact that the intervenors were sub-contractors, would not, as such, entitle them to the statutory mechanic\u2019s lien. (Shields <em>v. </em>Morrow, 51 Tex., 393; Horan <em>v. </em>Frank, 51 Tex., 401; Loonie <em>v. </em>Frank, 51 Tex., 406.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">If, however, under appropriate allegations, the testimony should showr that they, or cither of them, were sub-contractors under Sanford, and that they availed themselves of the special provisions of the statute in the nature of a garnishment, and thereby adjusted the \u201ctrue sum due\u201d them by Sanford as original contractor, and fixed liability upon Pool, the owner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>for its payment, then, as intimated in Horan <em>v. </em>Frank, <em>supra, </em>in a proper ease, upon sufficient allegations and proof, as in ease of collusion between the owner and the original contractor, or fraud or insolvency of the parties, equity would subrogate the intervenors to the rights of the principal contractor, both to the amount due them as thus adjusted and fixed, and also to the mechanic\u2019s lien to secure the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">3. Pool, as owner, could not be compelled to pay, including all prior voluntary payments made in good faith, according to the terms of his contract as originally or subsequently made, and for which a lien was fixed and secured under the statute, any greater amount than the contract price. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 4598; Laws 15th Leg., sec. 6, p. 92; Rev. Stats., art. 3176; Doughty <em>v. </em>Devlin, 1 E. D. Smith, (N. Y.,) 634; Russell <em>v. </em>Bell, 8 Wright, (Penn.,) 53; Horan <em>v. </em>Frank, 51 Tex., 401; Phil, on Mech. Liens, secs. 206-213, and authorities cited)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">4. To entitle the intervenors to be subrogated to the rights of the principal contractor, the statutory notice in the nature of a garnishment, by service of \u201can attested account of the amount and value of the work and labor thus performed or materials furnished and remaining unpaid,\u201d must have been given. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 4595.) Mere ordinary notice, information, or knowledge, on the part of the owner, that the principal contractor was indebted to them, would not, of itself, be sufficient to bind the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">5. If the testimony should show that the intervenors, as subcontractors, were about to abandon the work because they were apprehensive that the principal contractor would not pay them, or for other good and sufficient reason, and that to prevent this they were induced by the owner, Pool, to continue and complete their part of the work in consideration that he would pay them therefor, this would be a sufficient original understanding to take the contract without the statute of frauds and to bind Pool, and the intervenors could, in any event, recover against him a personal judgment, or a judgment enforcing the mechanic\u2019s lien in their favor as original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>contractors, if they fixed and secured the same under the terms of the statute. (Phil. on Mech. Liens, sec. 213; Holmes <em>v. </em>Shands, 4 Cush., (26 Miss.,) 642; Landis <em>v. </em>Royer, 59 Penn.
