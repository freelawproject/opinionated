The judgment is contrary to the law and evidence. The evidence showed that the plaintiff\" was unmarried at the date of purchase of the property claimed by her as a homestead, and also at the dates of the judgment, execution, and levy upon the property, and also at the trial; and that at neither of those dates did she have a family. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., arts. 30, 31, 6994; Const. of 1876, art. 16, secs. 50-52; Baird <em>v. </em>Trice, 51 Tex., 555; Whitehead <em>v. </em>Nickelson, 48 Tex., 517; Howard <em>v. </em>Marshall, 48 Tex., 471; Roco <em>v. </em>Green, 50 Tex., 483; Wright <em>v. </em>Hays, 34 Tex., 253; Burns <em>v. </em>Jones, 37 Tex., 50; Hoffman <em>v. </em>Neuhaus, 30 Tex., 633; Petty <em>v. </em>Barrett, 37 Tex., 84; Farmer <em>v. </em>Simpson, 6 Tex., 303; Mabry <em>v. </em>Harrison, 44 Tex., 286; White <em>v. </em>Shepperd, 16 Tex., 163; Potshuisky <em>v. </em>Krempkan, 26 Tex., 307; Kent <em>v. </em>Beaty, 40 Tex., 440; Batts <em>v. </em>Scott, 37 Tex., 59.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-5\">n. The adoption of a person, under our statute, neither makes the adopted person a member of the family of the adopter, nor imposes any obligation on the latter to support or maintain the person adopted. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., arts. 30, 31.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-6\">III. The adoption being in the nature of a \u201cgift,\u201d as we believe, and within the meaning of the word in our statute of frauds, and being made to make a family after the lien of Mrs. Wolfe\u2019s judgment had attached to the property, and being made to defeat the collection of the judgment, was a legal fraud upon Mrs. Wolfe, and was void as to the judgment, even if by such adoption a family was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-7\">The plaintiff\" testified that \u201c she knew of the judgment in favor of the defendant in this suit when she adopted said Anna; that she [witness] did not know what the court would do as to her claim of homestead in said property, and at the time she adopted said Anna she did so to protect herself against said judgment and to save said property, but that in doing so she had no intention to do wrong.\u201d (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 3876; Belt <em>v. </em>Raguet, 27 Tex., 471; Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., secs. 186, 187, 258, 259, 349.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>IV. The judgment in favor of Mrs. Wolfe being a lien upon the property prior, in point of time, to the adoption of Anna L. Howard by Mrs. Buckley, and there being no homestead right in Mrs. Buckley in -the property at the date of the judgment, the judgment hound the property and made it liable thereto, even though it should be held that the adoption made a family fo.r Mrs. Buckley. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 7005; Baird <em>v. </em>Trice, 51 Tex., 555; Farmer v. Simpson, 6 Tex., 303; Mabry v. Harrison, 44 Tex., 286; White <em>v. </em>Shepperd, 16 Tex., 163; Potshuisky <em>v. </em>Krempkan, 26 Tex., 307; Kent <em>v. </em>Beaty, 40 Tex., 440; Batts v. Scott, 37 Tex., 59.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-5\">V. The apprentice law having been repealed, there was no law in force in Texas, in 1877, under which minors could be hound to another, and hence the binding of the Logree children to Mrs. Buckley was illegal and void. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., pp. 1192-1194; Laws of 1871, 1st Sess., eh. 92,. p. 90.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-6\">VT. Even if mistaken as to the last proposition, the binding of said minors to Mrs. Buckle}', a single, unmarried person, did not make for her such a family as could give her a homestead right in the property; and being unmarried, she was not entitled to a homestead exemption. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 6994; Whitehead <em>v. </em>Nickelson, 48 Tex., 517; Howard <em>v. </em>Marshall, 48 Tex., 471; Roco v. Green, 50 Tex., 483.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-7\">VII. As no constituent of a family remained to Mrs. Buckley when she purchased the property levied on, nor when she commenced occupying it, nor at any time thereafter, including the times when the judgment was obtained, the levy made, the injunction suit filed, and the injunction served, and even up to the trial, she is not entitled to a homestead exemption, and the property is and was liable to the judgment in favor of Mrs. Wolfe, and the levy by virtue of the execution thereon. (Whitehead <em>v. </em>Nickelson, 48 Tex., 517; Burns <em>v. </em>Jones, 37 Tex., 50; Hoffman <em>v. </em>Neuhaus, 30 Tex., 633; Petty <em>v. </em>Barrett, 37 Tex., 84; Wright <em>v. </em>Hays, 34 Tex., 253; Trammell <em>v. </em>Neal, Tex. .Law Jour,, Jan, 28, 1880, p. 325.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b655-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number><em>Hutcheson </em>Carrington, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-7\">I. At the date of the judgment Mrs. Buckley was a widow, and had a family residing with her, dependent upon her, and using and occupying the property as a homestead. The property was therefore exempt from forced sale. (Const. of 1870, art. 12, sec. 15; Const. of 1876, art. 16, secs. 50-52; Homestead Cases, 31 Tex., 677; Wood <em>v. </em>Wheeler, 7 Tex., 13; Hoffman <em>v. </em>Neuhaus, 30 Tex., 633; McCreery <em>v. </em>Fortson, 35 Tex., 648; Taylor <em>v. </em>Boulware, 17 Tex., 77; Whitehead <em>v. </em>Nickelson, 48 Tex., 517; Howard <em>v. </em>Marshall, 48 Tex., 471; Roco <em>v. </em>Green, 50 Tex., 483; Thomp. on Home, and Ex., secs. 55-62.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-8\">H At the time of the levy of the execution and of the trial of the cause, appellee was the head of a family. (Paschal\u2019s Big., arts. 30, 31, title Adoption ; Stone <em>v. </em>Darnell, 20 Tex., 11; Macmanus <em>v. </em>Campbell, 37 Tex., 267.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-9\">HI. By the act of adoption, appellee stood in <em>loco parentis </em>to the child Anna Howard, in whose favor all the duties and responsibilities of a parent immediately devolved upon her. (Paschal\u2019s Big., arts. 30, 31; Thomp. on Home, and Ex., par. 48; 1 Bouv. Law Die., p. 90, title Adoption.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-10\">IV. The adoption was in no sense a fraud upon appellant, and even if done for the purpose of strengthening appellee\u2019s right to her homestead, her right to it would not be vitiated thereby. (North <em>v. </em>Shearn, 15 Tex., 174; Stone <em>v. </em>Darnell, 20 Tex., 11; Thomp. on Home, and Ex., pars. 308-310; Cipperly <em>v. </em>Rhodes, 53 Ill., 346; Edmondson <em>v. </em>Meacham, 50 Miss., 35.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-11\">V. By the adoption, the child Anna Howard became interested in the preservation of the homestead, and her rights should be respected. (North <em>v. </em>Shearn, 15 Tex., 176; Thomp. on Home, and Ex., par. 308.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-12\">VI. If appellee had not been the head of a family at the date of the judgment, she became so by the adoption of the child Anna before the levy of the execution, and for this, if for no other reason, the injunction was properly perpetuated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>(Stone <em>v. </em>Darnell, 20 Tex., 11; Macmanus <em>v. </em>Campbell, 37 Tex., 267; Giddings <em>v. </em>Crosby, 24 Tex., 295; Trotter <em>v. </em>Dobbs, 38 Miss., 198; Irwin <em>v. </em>Lewis, 50 Miss., 363; Hawthorne <em>v. </em>Smith, 3 Nev., 182.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-5\">VH. The policy of our laws is to protect widows in their right to a home, exempt from the demands of creditors. (Probate Laws of 1846, 1848; Paschal\u2019s Dig., arts. 1304, 1305; Hart. Dig., arts. 1061, 1107; Probate Law 1870, secs. 26, 125; Probate Laxv 1876, sec. 57; Green <em>v. </em>Crow, 17 Tex., 185; James <em>v. </em>Thompson, 14 Tex., 467; Giddings <em>v. </em>Crosby, 24 Tex., 295; Mabry <em>v. </em>Ward, 50 Tex, 404.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-6\">Whether the apprentice law had been repealed or not,, Mrs. Buckley was, morally and legally, bound to care for, support, and maintain the two Legree children. They became a part of her family, and were solely dependent upon her for support. (Eoco <em>v. </em>Green, 50 Tex., 490; Thomp. on Home, and Ex., pars. 45, 46.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b656-7\">Bonner, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ARN\">The judgment below exemptsthe property in controversy from forced sale, on the ground that the appellee, Mrs. Buckley, was the head of a family, and that the same constituted her homestead; and before the judgment should be reversed, it should appear that in this there was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The judgment against Mrs. Buckley, to the lien of which it is claimed the property should be subject, was rendered in favor of appellant, Mrs. Bertha Wolfe, on December 10,1878. It was not controverted that Mrs. Buckley had lived upon the place since April, 1876. The only material question in the case was, whether Mrs. Buckley constituted such head of a family as, under our Constitution and laws, was entitled to the homestead exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">As said in Roco <em>v. </em>Green,. 50 Tex., 490, owing to the want of appropriate legislation on this subject, we have had to- decide the particular case under consideration by the aid of such rules of construction and analogy as were considered most applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>The testimony shows that Mrs. Howard, who was the daughter of C. W. Bucldey, deceased, late husband of appellee, Mrs. Buckley, and who was her step-daughter, died in 1879, leaving four children, among them Anna Howard; that Mrs. Howard had been raised by Mrs. Buckley from a mere child, and had been a constant inmate of her family since her marriage with the father, C. W. Buckley, until the marriage of Mrs. Howard with W. H. Howard, in 1869; that after the death of Mrs. Howard, her surviving husband and the father of the children, having no home and being unable to support them, they were brought to the house of Mrs. Buckley, the property in controversy, and have lived with her ever since. This was prior to the date of the judgment in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Subsequently to the levy of the execution, Mrs. Buckley, in pursuance of a previously long-formed intention, formally, under the statute, adopted the child Anna, and who then and since the death of her mother had been living with Mrs. Buckley.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Although the immediate cause of the adoption of the child Anna was to strengthen the homestead rights of Mrs. C. Buckley, yet, under all the circumstances of this case, the fact that this homestead had been purchased with proceeds derived from the sale of one which clearly was not subject to forced sale; that this purchase had been made and the new homestead occupied, as such, by Mrs. Buckley b'efore the rendition of this judgment against her; the continued residence with her of the children of Mrs. Howard, also before its rendition, and under circumstances which seem to preclude any presumption that this was done with an improper purpose; the peculiar social status of the parties; the prior assumed obligation of Mrs. Buckley to support these children, and their state of dependence upon her for moral training, and for at least a portion of their support and maintenance; her previously long - formed intention to adopt Anna, and the general policy of our laws providing exemption in favor of widows and minor children,\u2014 we are not prepared to say that this did not constitute such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>family as woitlcl be entitled to the protection of this property as a homestead, even without the adoption of the child Anna; or that if this adoption was necessary for this purpose, that, under the circumstances, there was such bad faith in the transaction as would amount to \u00e1 fraud upon any previously-acquired rights of the judgment creditor.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b658-9\">[Opinion delivered February 27, 1880.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">It does not, in this case, become necessary to determine the legal effect of such adoption, further than that, if made in good faith, it would create such legal relation of parent and child as would constitute a family as contemplated by our Constitution and laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Neither does it become necessary, in the view we take of this case, to express any opinion upon the question whether there might not be a distinction, as affecting the right to acquire a homestead, between the rights of a creditor acquired by a judgment lien upon all the lands generally of the debtor, and those acquired by a specific lien upon a particular tract, as by attachment, mortgage, or vendor\u2019s lien. (North <em>v. </em>Shearn, 15 Tex., 174; Macmanus <em>v. </em>Campbell, 37 Tex., 267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
