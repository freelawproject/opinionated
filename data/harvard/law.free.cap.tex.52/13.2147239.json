Tried below before the Hon. John C.

Jones, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-9\">I. The act of November 17, 1871, passed at the second session in 1871, (p. 28,) does not, in terms, provide for the mechanic\u2019s or contractor\u2019s lien on railroads, nor does the act of August 7, 1876, (Acts of 1876, p. 91,) make any provision, in terms, for such a lien. And the courts will not, by construction, extend such lien to railroads where the statute creatina: the lien makes no provision for-it in terms. (Phil, on Mecli. Lieu, sec. 15.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-10\">II. The act of February 18, 1879, (Acts of 1879, p. 8.) is the first and only act of the Legislature of the State of Texas that provides, in terms, for the mechanic\u2019s lien on railroads. This suit was commenced in the District Court of Smith county, Texas, on February 28,1878, nearly a year previous to the passage of the act of February 18, 1879.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-11\">PH. The act of August 7,1876, (Acts of 1876, sec. 1, p. 91,) like the act of November 17, 1871, limits the mechanic\u2019s or contractor\u2019s lien to the particular work done and materials furnished, and to the particular land, lot or lots on which the work is situated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-12\">The plaintiffs, in their petition, assert the mechanic\u2019s or contractor\u2019s lien on defendant\u2019s entire road, extending from Tyler, in Smith county, to Ferguson, on the Texas and Pacific Eailroad, in Upshur county, Texas, and the lien is established and decreed by the court to be foreclosed on this entire road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-13\">IV. If the mechanic\u2019s or contractor\u2019s lien on railroads is provided for at all by the act of 1871, or the act of 1876, it is given upon the particular work and materials, and the particular parts of the road on which the work is done and for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the materials are furnished. Phillips, in his work on Mechanic\u2019s Liens, sec. 182, p. 259, says that \u201cthe mechanic\u2019s lien may be on parts of a railroad without being on the whole road.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-5\">Y. It does not appear at what particular places on defendant\u2019s road in Smith county, nor at what particular places on defendant\u2019s road in Upshur county, Texas, plaintiffs performed their work; but it does appear that a part of their work was done in Smith, and the other part in Upshur county.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-6\"><em>Reaves Dodd, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-7\">I. By statute and the provisions of the Constitution, appellees were secured in their mechanic\u2019s lien upon the railroad of appellant. (Acts of 1876, pp. 91,92; Const. of 1876, art. 16.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-8\">II. If appellees had a lien, it necessarily extended to the whole railroad and to land .necessarily connected therewith. (Acts of 1876, pp. 91, 92; Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 4912.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-9\">III. Under our statutes railroads, including the road-bed, track, right of way, franchises, and ch\u00e1rtered powers constitute an entirety and form a whole, and cannot- he severed and sold in parcels or lots. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 4912.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-10\">IY. The appellees, under the Constitution of this State, are secured in' their lien upon appellant\u2019s railroad, and that notwithstanding the Legislature may have failed to enact a law for the speedy enforcement of the same. The court below, in the exercise of its powers as a court of equity, had the right to form the remedy and decree its enforcement. (Const. of 1876, art. 16, secs. 35, 37; Acts of 1876, pp. 91, 92; Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 7112; Phil, on Mech. Liens, secs. 2,469,478; Peck <em>v. </em>Jenness, 7 How., 620; Coleman <em>v. </em>Freeman, 3 Kel., (Ga.,) 140.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b24-11\">Gould, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AEc\">Driscol &amp; Co. sued the railroad company for work and labor done and materials furnished under a written contract, to erect the bridges and construct the cattle-guards on defendant\u2019s road between Tyler, in Smith county, and Ferguson, in Upshur county, claiming a mechanic\u2019s lieu on the railroad. Plaintiffs recovered judgment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>$1,074.65, foreclosing also the lien claimed on the railroad, including the road-bed, franchise, and chartered powers and privileges, from Tyler to Ferguson.</p>\n<p id=\"ASJ4\">The railroad company complains of that part of the judgment enforcing-the mechanic\u2019s lien, and maintains that there was no law of the State at the date of the contract or judgment providing for a contractor\u2019s or builder\u2019s lien on railroads.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">On the part of appellees, the lien is claimed under \u201cAn act to provide for and regulate mechanics\u2019, contractors\u2019, builders\u2019, and other liens in the State of Texas,\u201d approved August 7, 1876, and under sections 35 and 37 of article 16 of the Constitution, which they say give the lien without further legislation. Section 35 of article 16 of the Constitution requires the Legislature to pass laws to protect laborers on railroads and other public works against the failure of contractors and subcontractors to pay their wages. We think it manifest that this section has no reference to contractors or builders, and the law enacted in pursuance of the section shows that such was the view taken of it by the Legislature. (Rev. Stats., Appendix, p. 6; Aiken <em>v. </em>Wasson, 24 N.Y., 482; Balch <em>v. </em>Yew York and Oswego Railroad Co., 46 N. Y., 521.)</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">Section 37 of article 16 reads: \u201cMechanics, artisans, and material-men of every class shall have a lien upon the buildings and articles made or repaired by them for the value of the labor done thereon, or material furnished therefor; and the Legislature shall provide by law for the speedy and efficient enforcement of their liens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">The law enacted under this section provides: \u201cThat any person or firm, lumber dealer, artisan, or mechanic who may labor or furnish material, machinery, fixtures, and tools to erect any bouse improvement, or to repair any building or any improvement whatever, shall have a lien on such house, building, fixtures, or improvements, and shall also have a lien on the lot or lots, or land necessarily connected therewith, to secure payment for labor done, lumber, material, or fixtures furnished for construction or repairs.\u201d (Eev. Statutes, title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Liens, ch. 2.) The subsequent portions of this act, so far from containing anything showing that structures such as railroads were contemplated, has provisions which show the contrary. The lien given on land in the country extends to fifty acres, and on lots in a town includes the lots upon which the improvements are situated. (Eev. Stats., arts. 3169, 3170.) The person enforcing the lion is allowed to have the land or lots sold, or the improvements only. (Eev. Statutes, art. 8171.) These provisions are inappropriate and insufficient to designate the extent of a lien on the bed of a railroad, and are inconsistent with the general railroad law, which contemplates the sale of \u201cthe entire road-bed, track, franchise, and chartered powers and privileges.\u201d (Eev. Stats., art. 4262.) The language of the statute does not indicate any intention to give a lien on railroad-beds and corporate franchises, nor are any of its provisions as to the extent of the lieu or the mode of its enforcement such as would be appropriate to such a lien.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b26-12\">[Opinion delivered October 17, 1879.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The statute, in our opinion, does not embrace railroad-beds or franchises. Similar statutes have been construed in other States, and have been generally held not to embrace thorn. (Foster <em>v. </em>Fowler, 60 Penn. St., 2\u20197; La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Vanderpool, 11 Wis., 124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">In most of the States there are special statutes regulating \u25a0liens on railroads. (Jones on E. E. Securities, sec. 582 <em>etsaq.) </em>The statute was evidently passed in obedience to section 37 \u25a0 of article 16 of the Constitution, and shows the legislative \u25a0 construction of that section. We concur in that construction, and think that the Constitution does not, of itself, impose the dien claimed, nor does it require the Legislature to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">-Because of - the error of the District Court in enforcing a mechanic\u2019s lien, the judgment is reversed and reformed so as \u25a0to allow the plaintiffs\u2019 moneyed judgment against defendant . to stand, but so as to give them no lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">Eeversed and reformed.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">[ Justice .Bpni\u00eder did .not .sit in tlfis case.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
