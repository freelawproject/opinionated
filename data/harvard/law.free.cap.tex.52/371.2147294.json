Tried below before the Hon. William H. Burkhart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-9\">Suit was brought March 30, 1878, by' James D. Edwards against A.

Baker, W. B. Botts, Ira II. Evans, Galusha A.

It was also proven by defendant that, to secure the notes, Ward &amp; Dewey had executed to Phelps a deed of trust on the plantation, as alleged in his answer, and that the deed of trust was recorded in Brazoria-county record of deeds and mortgages shortly after its execution, and before June, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-9\">Defendant Phelps also proved that there was and is a shed to the sugar-house on said plantation; that under this shed there is erected, within four feet of the sugar-house, a brick furnace, built from the ground up; that in this furnace, and fixed therein with brick and mortar, there is a large iron boiler; that these\u2014the boiler and shed over it\u2014were erected since or about the time of the purchase of the steam train, and 'were not connected with any of the machinery except the steam train; that on the side of this boiler there are iron flanges, being part of the boiler; that the steam train furnished by plaintiff, as above stated, consists of copper piping and copper pans, and the same is placed in said sugar-house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Defendant Phelps also proved that the Lake Jackson plantation is a sugar plantation, and that said sugar-house and machinery, or other similar arrangement, are necessary to take off and prepare for shipment and market the sugar crops raised on the plantation.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-5\"><em>M. W. Garrett </em>and <em>Baker </em>Bolts, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agg\">The machinery called a steam train, for the purchase - money of which plaintiff sued, wras a fixture on the Lake Jackson plantation, and the lien of defendant Phelps thereon, under his deed of trust for the purchase-money of the plantation, was superior and prior to plaintiff\u2019s alleged lien, and should have been so held and adjudged by the court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-6\"><em>A. </em>P. <em>McCormick, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b382-7\">Bonner, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AYAq\">The statute under which Edwards, the defendant in error, claims a lien on the machinery furnished by him to Ward &amp; Dewey, gives such lien both on the machinery furnished and on the laud with which it'is necessarily connected. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 7112.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The question does not necessarily arise in this case, as to what are the respective equities of a previous vendor of improved lands who retains his lien for the unpaid purchase-money thereon, and of another party who subsequently furnished material, machinery, or fixtures by which this property had been improved, and which was so connected therewith that they could not be severed without permanent injury to the freehold.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">This judgment subjects the machinery only which was furnished by Edwards to be sold to satisfy his lien, and not the land and the improvements which were previously placed thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">The machinery thus furnished seems to have been necessary to the successful operation of the sugar-mill, purchased by Ward &amp; Dewey from Phelps, plaintiff in error, and it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>not appear but what it was of that character of fixtures which a lessee would have a right to remove after the expiration of his lease; or but what Phelps still has the same security for his debt which he had at the time of his sale, and that conse-' quently his rights are not affected.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b383-7\">[Opinion delivered January 9, 1880.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">To hold, in such a case as this, that the lien of one who furnishes machinery to another necessary to make available his property, should be subordinate to the lien for the unpaid purchase-money for this property, would, we think, he in restraint of trade and against sound principles of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">There being no apparent error in the judgment below, the same is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
