It follows that the statute presumes a pensioner who is qualified for a return to city employment. Since the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, within its statutory authority, declined to find petitioner qualified for any city position based on his cocaine use, petitioner falls outside the scope of Administrative Code \u00a7 13-254 and is not entitled, as a matter of law, to the benefits it provides. Accordingly, there is nothing left for the Board of Trustees to decide and nothing to be gained by a remand. <em>(Matter of Caruso v Ward, </em>72 NY2d 432; <em>Matter of Jennings v Leon, </em>31 AD3d 762; <em>Matter of Stephens v Suffolk County Dept. of Civ.

In the following years, the Police Department received information indicating that petitioner was not disabled; that he had made false representations to the Pension Fund; and that he had ingested cocaine, thus becoming ineligible to return to duty. The City, understandably, claims that it should not have to continue paying him a pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Despite the common-sense appeal of the City\u2019s position, we affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s order annulling the termination of petitioner\u2019s pension benefits. The Appellate Division correctly held that the benefits can be terminated only by the trustees of the Police Pension Fund, who have not taken the necessary action. However, while we recognize the technical merit of petitioner\u2019s argument, we express our distress at the way the system has malfunctioned in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In December 2003, petitioner, after 11 years on the police force, applied for accident disability retirement. He claimed that as a result of a line-of-duty accident (a fall while walking on ice and snow) he suffered from constant pain in his right shoulder and neck, loss of range of motion in his neck and shoulder, and pain radiating into his arm, which prevented him from performing police duty. His application was granted, and he was awarded accident disability retirement on May 12, 2004 <em>(see </em>Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 13-252).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">The following month, the Police Department received information that petitioner was working, and began an investigation that led a department official to report that petitioner was \u201cperforming construction work on a daily basis.\u201d The investigation included observations of the work, some of them videotaped. An investigator\u2019s reports say that petitioner was seen picking up siding, passing it to others, lifting it over his head and nailing materials above his head with both arms extended for some time\u2014all tasks performed without apparent difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">The Police Department informed the Police Pension Fund in November 2004 that petitioner \u201cmay no longer be disabled,\u201d and the Pension Fund agreed in December 2004 to \u201creexamine\u201d petitioner. The reexamination included an interview by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Pension Fund\u2019s Medical Board at which petitioner, according to the board\u2019s memorandum of the interview, said that he \u201ccannot lift any heavy objects . . . cannot work overhead . . . has no outside work and his major occupation is babysitting his two children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Despite the difference between petitioner\u2019s assertions and the videotapes, neither the Police Department nor the Pension Fund suggested\u2014and neither, so far as the record shows, has suggested to date\u2014that petitioner was guilty of fraud or misrepresentation, or that he should refund any of the pension money he had received. However, the Pension Fund\u2019s Medical Board did conclude in May 2005 that petitioner\u2019s condition \u201chas improved dramatically,\u201d and recommended disapproval of his retirement application. The Pension Fund\u2019s trustees took no action on this recommendation for approximately two years, other than to remand the matter twice to the Medical Board, which twice reaffirmed its previous recommendation, noting in its second reaffirmance on September 19, 2006 that petitioner \u201cseems to have made a remarkable recovery from his injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Finally, on April 11, 2007, the Pension Fund Board of Trustees voted, over the dissent of several trustees, to invoke New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 13-254, entitled \u201cSafeguards on disability retirement,\u201d under which a disability pensioner found to be able to work may be returned to city service. The \u201csafeguards\u201d procedure soon hit a snag, however. Petitioner was placed on a list of candidates eligible to become police officers, but on July 6, 2007 he was informed that he was \u201cmedically disqualified\u201d for that position \u201cdue to the presence of an unauthorized substance, cocaine, in your hair sample.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">On July 12, the New York City Law Department advised the Pension Fund that \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d petitioner\u2019s disqualification, \u201che is no longer deemed to be disabled, and he is no longer entitled to a disability pension.\u201d There is no indication in the record that the Pension Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees ever considered or acted on this advice, but on July 18, 2007 the Pension Fund\u2019s Director of Pension Payroll advised petitioner \u201cthat your pension benefit will be suspended beginning with the July 2007 payroll.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Petitioner brought this CPLR article 78 proceeding, seeking to annul the determination to suspend his pension benefits. Supreme Court denied the application (22 Misc 3d 1132[A], 2008 NY Slip Op 52670[U]). The Appellate Division reversed, annulling the suspension of benefits (70 AD3d 460 [2010]), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>granted leave to appeal to this Court. We now reluctantly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The \u201csafeguards\u201d statute, New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 13-254, under which the Pension Fund tried to bring petitioner back to work, says, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201cOnce each year the board [of trustees of the Police Pension Fund] may . . . require any disability pensioner, under the minimum age or period for service retirement elected by him or her, to undergo medical examination. . . . Upon the completion of such examination the medical board shall report and certify to the board whether such beneficiary is or is not totally or partially incapacitated physically or mentally and whether he or she is or is not engaged in or able to engage in a gainful occupation. If the board concurs in a report by the medical board that such beneficiary is able to engage in a gainful occupation, he or she [sic] shall certify the name of such beneficiary to the appropriate civil service commission . . . and such commission shall place his or her name as a preferred eligible on such appropriate lists of candidates as are prepared for appointment to positions for which he or she is stated to be qualified. Should such beneficiary be engaged in a gainful occupation, or should he or she be offered city-service as a result of the placing of his or her name on a civil service list, such board shall reduce the amount of his or her disability pension ... if any, to an amount which, when added to that then earned by him or her, or earnable by him or her in city-service so offered him or her, shall not exceed the current maximum salary for the title next higher than that held by him or her when he or she was retired.\u201d (\u00a7 13-254 [a].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The statute is complicated. In simplified summary, adequate for present purposes: A disability pensioner found to be able to work is put on a civil service list, and his or her pension is reduced based on outside earnings and the amount \u201cearned . . . or earnable\u201d in any city job that is offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The application of the statute to this case presents something of a puzzle, because although petitioner was put on a civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>service list, he was not, and evidently could not be, offered a job because of his cocaine use. If the statute is mechanically applied, petitioner might actually <em>benefit </em>from using cocaine, because he presumably does not want to be offered a city job; he wants to remain retired and receive his pension. Supreme Court, in a thoughtful opinion, correctly concluded that this anomaly could not have been intended by the statute\u2019s authors.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Supreme Court wrote: \u201cThese provisions ... do not contemplate a situation where the beneficiary refuses to return to City service . . . or . . . where the beneficiary is disqualified from City service for reasons unrelated to the physical or mental ability to work.\u201d (2008 NY Slip Op 52670[U] at *8.) We do not necessarily agree that a beneficiary\u2019s <em>refusal </em>to return would not be covered by the text of the statute; the statute seems to contemplate a pension reduction for money \u201cearnable\u201d by a beneficiaiy who is \u201coffered\u201d city employment. In the situation before us, however, Supreme Court was right that there is a problem the text of the statute does not address. Where a beneficiary who would otherwise be brought back to city employment is disqualified from that employment by his own fault, either the reduction or suspension of his benefits must be a consequence, though the statute does not expressly say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The Appellate Division reversed Supreme Court\u2019s order, without discussing Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the statute, because the suspension of petitioner\u2019s benefits \u201cwas not directed by the Board of Trustees\u201d of the Pension Fund (70 AD3d at 462). The Appellate Division was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">It is clear from a reading of the safeguards statute that action under that statute must be taken by the board (\u201cthe board may . . . require\u201d; \u201csuch board shall reduce\u201d). Elsewhere, the Administrative Code, in two apparently redundant sections, says that the Pension Fund \u201cshall be administered by a board of trustees\u201d and that \u201c[e]very act of the board of trustees shall be by resolution\u201d (Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 13-202 [a], [b]; \u00a7 13-216 [a], [b]). The City points to no relevant exception to these provisions, or to any other provision of law that authorizes a suspension of benefits without a board vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The City\u2019s argument on this point is that, because petitioner was no longer entitled to benefits, ceasing to pay them was a \u201cpurely ministerial act.\u201d We disagree. However well justified a reduction or termination of benefits may be in this case, the Board of Trustees has to do it. There might be cases in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the impropriety of paying benefits is so obvious that Pension Fund employees can simply stop paying, without either advance approval or ratification from the board; this might be true, for example, if the statute said on its face, \u201cNo benefits shall be paid to any beneficiary who has a positive drug test.\u201d But the application of the confusing safeguards statute to this case is something the trustees must address. Of course the trustees should weigh the advice of the City\u2019s Law Department in deciding the question, but the decision is theirs, subject to appropriate judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Nor can we accept the dissent\u2019s argument that the Board of Trustees revoked petitioner\u2019s pension by its April 11, 2007 vote. The minutes of the April 11 meeting say nothing about terminating benefits. They make clear that the trustees voted to bring petitioner \u201cback off disability\u201d through the safeguards statute, which offers no grounds, at least on the facts as they existed on April 11, for terminating benefits rather than reducing them. Indeed, the City has not argued here that petitioner\u2019s benefits were terminated on April 11. The City\u2019s position is that petitioner would have continued to be entitled to benefits but for his positive drug test in July.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Though petitioner is entitled to prevail here, the case as a whole is very troubling. It seems from the record that petitioner either has received or is in a position to claim accident disability benefits for the last seven years, and counting. Yet any reader of this record must have serious doubt that he was ever really disabled. Whether any of the benefits paid to him may be recouped is a subject on which we express no opinion. But we do express the hope that the Pension Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees will generally act to protect the Fund and the public with more efficiency than it has displayed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b628-8\">Pigott, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AXq\">Because I believe that the Police Pension Fund Board of Trustees revoked petitioner\u2019s disability retirement benefits on April 11, 2007, and that the July 12, 2007 Law Department memorandum challenged by petitioner merely interpreted that revocation, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The Board of Trustees voted on April 11, 2007 not only to return Seiferheld to city service, but also to deny him\u2014\u201cdisapproval\u201d him for\u2014accident disability retirement, \u201cbringing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>member back off disability.\u201d As the Deputy Executive Director of the Police Pension Fund informed the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS), in a letter of May 2, 2007, the Board of Trustees had rescinded its earlier decision approving Seiferheld\u2019s accident disability retirement application, and \u201cdenied bim a continuation of disability benefits.\u201d In my view, the Board of Trustees <em>did, </em>despite Seiferheld\u2019s allegations to the contrary, make the final determination regarding the revocation of his accident disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">With his disability pension revoked, petitioner became subject to the \u201csafeguards\u201d statute, New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 13-254, and he would have been placed on a special preferred list for a position as a police officer, except that cocaine was found in his hair sample, disqualifying him. At this point, unsurprisingly, DCAS failed to recommend him for any other civil service title position.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">When the Chief of the New York City Law Department\u2019s Pensions Division informed the Police Pension Fund\u2019s Deputy Executive Director that Seiferheld\u2019s accident disability retirement should be \u201csuspended,\u201d i.e. terminated, in its entirety, because he was no longer considered disabled, she was not terminating Seiferheld\u2019s accident disability retirement benefits because of his drug test failure. She was merely interpreting the effects that the drug test failure might have on the April 11, 2007 Board of Trustees determination denying Seiferheld accident disability retirement. Her conclusion was that the drug test failure would have no effect on Seiferheld\u2019s status with respect to accident disability; those benefits had been revoked by the Board of Trustees, and the revocation would stand, \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d the fact that Seiferheld now would have no job. The drug test failure would not affect the prior revocation of benefits determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In other words, no new, allegedly unauthorized, determination was made by the Law Department. Rather, it was interpreting the preexisting, April 11, 2007 Board of Trustees decision to revoke Seiferheld\u2019s accident disability retirement benefits. Seiferheld\u2019s disability benefits were not revoked by the Law Department; they had already been revoked by the Board of Trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Seiferheld\u2019s real problem\u2014and one for which there may be no legal recourse\u2014is that DCAS decided not to recommend that he be placed on any other special preferred list (i.e. for other civil service title positions) after he failed the drug test. This meant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>that he had not been \u201coffered city-service as a result of the placing of his or her name on a civil service list\u201d (Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 13-254 [a]), and would not qualify for a \u201csafeguards\u201d pension in place of his revoked disability pension. But challenging DCAS\u2019s decision is an argument that Seiferheld has chosen not to make. Seiferheld does not argue that DCAS acted in excess of its authority in its decision not to recommend him for a position.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In my view, the Appellate Division erred in finding that the Board of Trustees had not considered what action should be taken with respect to revocation of the accident disability retirement benefits. This error, which the majority of this Court repeats, rests on an assumption that the Board\u2019s final determination had merely been that Seiferheld should be returned to work as a police officer. This leaves out a crucial part of the Board\u2019s ruling. The Board\u2019s final determination was that Seiferheld was not disabled, <em>should not receive disability benefits, </em>and should be returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">I would therefore reverse, deny the petition and dismiss the CPLR article 78 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read and Jones concur with Judge Smith; Judge Pigott dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
