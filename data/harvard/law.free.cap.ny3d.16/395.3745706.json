Based on these and other findings, the Comptroller proposed legislation to establish a City of Buffalo Oversight and Recovery Board whose mission was to ensure effective long-term restructuring of the City\u2019s fiscal condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">In response, the State Legislature created the Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority (BFSA), a public benefit corporation, to assist in achieving fiscal stability in the City by the 2006-2007 fiscal year <em>(see </em>Public Authorities Law \u00a7 3857 [1]). The Legislature stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">\u201cIt is hereby found and declared that the city [of Buffalo] is in a state of fiscal crisis, and that the welfare of the inhabitants of the city is seriously threatened. The city budget must be balanced and economic recovery enhanced. Actions should.be undertaken which preserve essential services to city residents, while also ensuring that taxes remain affordable. Actions contrary to these two essential goals jeopardize the city\u2019s long-term fiscal health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>and impede economic growth for the city, the region, and the state\u201d (L 2003, ch 122, \u00a7 1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Among other powers, the BFSA was authorized to impose a wage freeze upon finding that such a freeze was essential to the adoption or maintenance of a city budget or financial plan <em>(see </em>Public Authorities Law \u00a7 3858 [2] [c] [i]). In April 2004 it did just that, determining \u201cthat a wage freeze, with respect to the City and all Covered Organizations, is essential to the maintenance of the Revised Financial Plan and to the adoption and maintenance of future budgets and financial plans that are in compliance with the Act.\u201d (Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority Resolution No. 04-35 [Apr. 21, 2004], available at http:// www.bfsa.state.ny.us/meetings2004/resolutions/res0435.pdf.) The freeze, effective April 2004, prevented any increase in wages, including increased payments for salary adjustments according to \u201cplan and step-ups or increments\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The freeze was lifted in July 2007, whereupon the BFSA and the City indicated that city employees would immediately be entitled to a one-step increase in salaty and wages. The Unions objected, however, contending that the employees were entitled to advance the four salary steps that they would have received had the freeze not been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">In 2007, petitioners and plaintiffs (hereinafter the Unions) commenced these CPLR article 78 and declaratory judgment proceedings and action against respondents (hereinafter the City) challenging, among other things, the suspension of step-up plan wage increases. Supreme Court granted the petitions, finding that Public Authorities Law \u00a7 3858 (2) (c) (iii) applies only to wages lost during the freeze and not to longevity and promotional steps provided in the various contracts between the City and its unions and therefore petitioners were \u201centitled to their previously negotiated wage increase benefits going forward immediately.\u201d (2007 NY Slip Op 33683[U], *5 [2007].)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The City appealed. The Appellate Division affirmed for essentially the same reasons as Supreme Court (63 AD3d 1673 [4th Dept 2009]). This Court granted leave and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Public Authorities Law \u00a7 3858 (2) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">\u201cIn carrying out the purposes of this title during any control period, the [BFSA]: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>\u201c(c) may impose a wage and/or hiring freeze: (i) During a control period, upon a finding by the [BFSA] that a wage and/or hiring freeze is essential to the adoption or maintenance of a city budget or a financial plan that is in compliance with this title, the [BFSA] shall be empowered to order that all increases in salary or wages of employees of the city and employees of covered organizations which will take effect after the date of the order pursuant to collective bargaining agreements . . . now in existence or hereafter entered into, requiring such salary or wage increases as of any date thereafter are <em>suspended. </em>Such order may also provide that all increased payments for . . . <em>salary adjustments according to plan and step-ups or increments for employees of the city and employees of covered organizations which will take effect after the date of the order pursuant to collective bargaining agreements . . . </em>requiring such increased payments as of any date thereafter are, in the same manner, suspended. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201c(iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, <em>no retroactive pay adjustments of any kind shall accrue or be deemed to accrue during the period of wage freeze, </em>and no such additional amounts shall be paid at the time a wage freeze is lifted, or at any time thereafter\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The City argues that under section 3858 (2) (c) (i) and (iii), contractual salary increases, step increases, and other pay adjustments were suspended and did not accrue during the wage freeze period and that, therefore, the union members were only entitled to a one-step increase\u2014rather than four step increases\u2014once the wage freeze ended. The Unions, on the other hand, acknowledge that the act prohibits the accrual of retroactive pay, but argue that their members accrued service credit in the step-salary plan and, upon the lifting of the wage freeze, should receive those salary step increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Both parties argue that the plain language of the statute supports their position. In our view, neither interpretation is unreasonable. Ultimately, however, the interpretation proffered by the City most comports with the meaning and purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The legislation plainly permits the BFSA to suspend all salary and wage increases, including any \u201cstep-ups\u201d and \u201cincrements\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>(Public Authorities Law \u00a7 3858 [2] [c] [i]). It further provides that \u201cno retroactive pay adjustments <em>of any kind </em>shall accrue or be deemed to accrue during the period of wage freeze\u201d (\u00a7 3858 [2] [c] [iii] [emphasis added]). The term \u201cretroactive pay adjustments of any kind\u201d must be read broadly. Subdivision (2) (c) (iii) refers back to (2) (c) (i), which defines the type of adjustments, including differentials, step-ups and increments, that the BFSA is empowered to suspend. Thus, the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201caccrue\u201d in subparagraph (iii) provides further evidence of its intent under subparagraph (i) that step increases and increments were suspended and did not accrue during the wage freeze.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">While examining the specific language of statutory provisions is part of our inquiry, we must also look to the underlying purpose and the statute\u2019s history as \u201c[w]e are mindful that in \u2018the interpretation of statutes, the spirit and purpose of the act and the objects to be accomplished must be considered. The legislative intent is the great and controlling principle\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ferres v City of New Rochelle, </em>68 NY2d 446, 451 [1986] [emphasis omitted], quoting <em>People v Ryan, </em>274 NY 149, 152 [1937]).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Public Authorities Law \u00a7 3850-a sets forth the Legislature\u2019s intent. In that provision, the Legislature declared that the \u201cmaintenance of a balanced budget by the city of Buffalo is a matter of overriding state concern.\u201d This remedial legislation was enacted to provide the City of Buffalo with \u201clong-term fiscal stability,\u201d ensuring confidence of investors in the City\u2019s bonds and notes and to protect the economy of the region <em>(id.). </em>The act further provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of this title shall be liberally construed to assist the effectuation of the public purposes furthered hereby\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 3873). Thus, the entire purpose of the statute was to place the City of Buffalo on sound financial ground over the long term. In order to accomplish such purpose, BFSA was empowered to freeze wages and salary increments until the City\u2019s growth and stability were renewed. The intent of the statute supports the City\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, the amended petitions in <em>Matter of Meegan v Brown </em>and <em>Matter of Foley v Brown </em>dismissed, and judgment granted to defendants in <em>Buffalo Teachers Federation, Inc. v Buffalo Board of Education for City School District of City of Buffalo </em>declaring in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
