The court denied appellant his constitutional right to confrontation by letting the People decline to call the child complainant, and instead present his accusation through the testimony of a physician and \u201cmandated child abuse reporter,\u201d who reported it to the police, but never recorded it in the medical record. <em>(People v Pacer, </em>6 NY3d 504; <em>Crawford v Washington, </em>541 US 36; <em>Davis v Washington, </em>547 US 813; <em>People v Goldstein, </em>6 NY3d 119; <em>California v Green, </em>399 US 149; <em>Coy v Iowa, </em>487 US 1012; <em>People v Cintron, </em>75 NY2d 249; <em>Davis v Alaska, </em>415 US 308; <em>Pointer v Texas, </em>380 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>US 400; <em>People v Arroyo, </em>54 NY2d 567.)

Since the three-year-old complainant would not have understood his response to a doctor\u2019s question, posed almost an hour into treatment, to be medically significant, it was inadmissible under New York\u2019s \u201cmedical treatment\u201d hearsay exception. <em>(Davidson v Cornell, </em>132 NY 228; <em>People v Huertas, </em>75 NY2d 487; <em>People v Nieves, </em>67 NY2d 125; <em>People v Settles, </em>46 NY2d 154; <em>People v Brown, </em>80 NY2d 729; <em>People v Caviness, </em>38 NY2d 227; <em>White v Illinois, </em>502 US 346; <em>Scott v Mason, </em>155 AD2d 655; <em>People v Thomas, </em>282 AD2d 827; <em>People v Torres, </em>175 AD2d 635.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-5\"><em>Daniel M.

When the child\u2019s mother returned home approximately five hours later, defendant and the mother took the child to the hospital, where he was examined and treated by an emergency room pediatrician.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">At trial, the court permitted the pediatrician to testify about a statement the child made outside the presence of his mother and defendant. Specifically, when the pediatrician asked the child why he did not get out of the tub, he responded, \u201che wouldn\u2019t let me out.\u201d The pediatrician did not include this statement in the child\u2019s medical records, nor did the child testify at trial. Defendant was convicted of assault in the first degree and endangering the welfare of a child, and, on appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed (65 AD3d 699 [2009]). A Judge of this Court granted leave (14 NY3d 887 [2010]).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">The only issues before us are whether the trial court erred in allowing the pediatrician\u2019s testimony concerning the child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>statement in evidence as germane to the child\u2019s medical diagnosis and treatment, and whether its admission violated defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Supreme Court properly concluded that the child\u2019s statement was germane to his medical diagnosis and treatment and therefore was properly admitted under that exception to the hearsay rule. When seeking treatment for injuries, there is a \u201cstrong inducement for the patient to speak truly of his pains and sufferings\u201d and therefore \u201cstatements expressive of [a patient\u2019s] present condition are permitted to be given as evidence only when made to a physician for the purposes of treatment\u201d <em>(Davidson v Cornell, </em>132 NY 228, 237-238 [1892]).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Here, the pediatrician testified that, during her initial assessment, she observed that the child had sustained second and third degree burns to his feet and legs. The pediatrician testified that she asked the child how he had been injured to determine the time and mechanism of the injury so she could properly administer treatment, the type of treatment being dependent on when and how the child was injured. Moreover, the pediatrician testified that by asking the question, she was trying to ascertain whether the child had a predisposing condition, such as a neurological disorder (e.g., was prone to seizures or developmental delays) that may have prevented him from getting out of the bathtub.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Defendant nevertheless contends that, by allowing the pediatrician to testify as to what the child told her, he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witness against him in violation of <em>Crawford v Washington </em>(541 US 36 [2004]) and <em>Davis v Washington </em>(547 US 813 [2006]). The United States Supreme Court held in those cases that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who [does] not appear at trial unless [the witness] was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination\u201d <em>(Davis, </em>547 US at 821, quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 US at 53-54).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">At issue here is whether the child\u2019s statement to the pediatrician was testimonial, as defendant claims, or nontestimonial, as the People assert. In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court held that only \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d can \u201ccause the declarant to be a \u2018witness\u2019 within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause,\u201d and \u201c[i]t is the testimonial character of the statement that separates it from other hearsay that, while subject to traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>limitations upon hearsay evidence, is not subject to the Confrontation Clause\u201d (547 US at 821). \u201cStatements are non-testimonial when made in the course of. . . interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to . . . meet an ongoing emergency\u201d and \u201care testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution\u201d <em>(Michigan v </em>Bryant, 562 US \u2014, \u2014, 131 S Ct 1143, 1154 [2011], quoting <em>Davis, </em>547 US at 822).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test reflects an \u201cimportant distinction between a statement (generated through police interrogation or otherwise) that \u2018accuses\u2019 a perpetrator of a crime . . . versus one that serves some other nontestimonial purpose\u201d <em>(People v Rawlins, </em>10 NY3d 136, 148 [2008], <em>cert denied sub nom. Meekins v New York, </em>557 US \u2014, 129 S Ct 2856 [2009]). Significantly, \u201c[t]he lodestar . . . that emerges from <em>Davis </em>is the <em>purpose </em>that the statement was intended to serve\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Indeed, the Supreme Court recently explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201c[w]hen, as in <em>Davis, </em>the primary purpose of an interrogation is to respond to an \u2018ongoing emergency,\u2019 its purpose is not to create a record for trial and thus is not within the scope of the Clause. But there may be <em>other </em>circumstances, aside from ongoing emergencies, when a statement is not procured with a primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony. In making the primary purpose determination, standard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some statements as reliable, will be relevant. Where no such primary purpose exists, the admissibility of a statement is the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause\u201d <em>(Bryant, </em>562 US at \u2014, 131 S Ct at 1155).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Applying the primary purpose test here, it is evident that the statement \u201che wouldn\u2019t let me out\u201d was not of a testimonial character, since the primary purpose of the pediatrician\u2019s inquiry was to determine the mechanism of injury so she could render a diagnosis and administer medical treatment. Moreover, the Supreme Court has noted that \u201cstatements to physicians in the course of receiving treatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay rules\u201d and not the Confrontation Clause <em>(Giles </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>v California, </em>554 US 353, 376 [2008]; <em>see Bryant, </em>562 US at \u2014 n 9, 131 S Ct at 1157 n 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Finally, it is of no moment that the pediatrician may have had a secondary motive for her inquiry, namely, to fulfill her ethical and legal duty, as a mandatory reporter of child abuse, to investigate whether the child was potentially a victim of abuse. Her first and paramount duty was to render medical assistance to an injured child. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
