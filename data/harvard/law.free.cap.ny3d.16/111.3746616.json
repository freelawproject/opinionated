The Village/Town of Mount Kisco failed to meet its duty of care to maintain the parking lot in a reasonably safe condition. <em>(City of Rochester v Campbell, </em>123 NY 405; <em>Taylor v City of Yonkers, </em>105 NY 202; <em>Preston v State of New York, </em>59 NY2d 997; <em>Bass v City of New York, </em>38 AD2d 407, 32 NY2d 894; <em>Duren v City of Binghamton, </em>172 Misc 580, 258 App Div 694, 283 NY 467; <em>Tompkins v Hunter, </em>149 NY 117; <em>Transit Commn. v Long Is.

The Appellate Division incorrectly concluded that the Village/Town of Mount Kisco met its initial burden as the movant for summary judgment. <em>(Winegrad v New York Univ. Med.

The Appellate Division mistakenly applied the <em>Yarborough v City of New York </em>(10 NY3d 726 [2008]) causality test of \u201cimmediacy\u201d to this slip and fall on ice case. <em>(Cruz v New York City Tr.

The affirmative creation exception to the prior written notice laws properly requires proof that the work performed by the municipality immediately resulted in the creation of a dangerous condition. <em>(Yarborough v City of New York, </em>10 NY3d 726; <em>Oboler v City of New York, </em>8 NY3d 888; <em>Schleif v City of New York, </em>60 AD3d 926; <em>Weiss v Fote, </em>7 NY2d 579; <em>Amabile v City of Buffalo, </em>93 NY2d 471; <em>Zahn v City of New York, </em>299 NY 581; <em>Hirasawa v City of Long Beach, </em>57 AD3d 846; <em>Diaz v City of New York, </em>56 AD3d 599; <em>Smith v Village of Rockville Ctr., </em>57 AD3d 649; <em>Lugo v County of Essex, </em>260 AD2d 711.) II. Once the Village/Town of Mount Kisco established that it did not receive prior written notice of the dangerous icy condition, the burden shifted to plaintiff to establish that the work performed by the municipality immediately resulted in the creation of the defective condition. <em>(Yarborough v City of New York, </em>10 NY3d 726; <em>Babenzien v Town of Fenton, </em>67 AD3d 1236; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>Groninger v Village of Mamaroneck, </em>67 AD3d 733; <em>Lastowski v V.S.

III. There is no merit to plaintiffs new contention that the parking lot at issue-is not a \u201chighway\u201d within the meaning of the prior written notice laws, nor is that a proper legal question on this appeal. <em>(Misicki v Caradonna, </em>12 NY3d 511; <em>Quain v Buzzetta Constr.

IV Plaintiffs proof failed to establish that the ice patch on which she slipped was, in fact, directly traceable to the snow piles created by the Village/Town of Mount Kisco. <em>(Mahaney v Neuroscience Ctr., </em>28 AD3d 432; <em>Simmons v Metropolitan Life Ins.

Since the ice hazard at issue may have been created by the municipality\u2019s negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>snow removal efforts, and, if so, the municipality may have known of the hazard, we conclude that Supreme Court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Plaintiff Dale San Marco slipped and fell in a parking lot owned by defendant Village/Town of Mount Kisco (the Village) while on her way to work on Saturday, February 5, 2005 at approximately 8:15 a.m. At 4:45 am. on the previous morning, the Village had treated the parking lot for ice conditions. However, the Village did not employ a work crew on Saturdays and Sundays to monitor the parking lot for dangerous conditions. It is undisputed that in the interim between the Village\u2019s last inspection and salting of the lot early on Friday morning and San Marco\u2019s fall on Saturday morning, the air temperature had risen above freezing for approximately 19 hours and then dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">As a result of her fall, San Marco suffered a concussion, fractured her sacrum and herniated several cervical discs. Her injuries required a bone graft and surgical installation of a titanium plate affixed to her spine and secured by 13 screws. In May 2005, San Marco and her husband, suing derivatively, commenced this action, seeking to recover damages for her personal injuries. San Marco alleged that she fell on a patch of black ice that was caused by the melting and refreezing of a pile of snow that the Village had plowed into a row of meters adjacent to the parking spaces. San Marco further alleged both that the Village was negligent in plowing the snow so near the parking spaces and negligent in failing to take measures to remedy any dangerous ice conditions that developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">In response, the Village asserted that Village Law \u00a7 6-628 and Village of Mount Kisco Code \u00a7 93-47 shielded it from liability in the absence of prior written notice. Pursuant to Village Law \u00a7 6-628, a municipality cannot be liable as a matter of law \u201cunless written notice of the defective, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed condition or of the existence of the snow or ice, relating to the particular place, was actually given to the village clerk.\u201d The Village consequently established before the motion court that its clerk had not received written notice regarding a defective condition in the parking lot where San Marco fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Supreme Court, however, rejected the Village\u2019s argument that the action should be dismissed because no one had given written notice of a black ice condition. The court reasoned that the Village\u2019s snow removal procedure triggered an exception to the written notice statute, finding a question of fact as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the Village might have created the hazardous ice condition. Under <em>Amabile v City of Buff alo </em>(93 NY2d 471 [1999]), a prior written notice statute does not protect a municipality from liability if it can be proven that the \u201clocality created the defect or hazard through an affirmative act of negligence\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 474).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The Appellate Division reversed and granted the Village summary judgment, concluding that this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Yarborough v City of New York </em>(10 NY3d 726 [2008]) and <em>Oboler v City of New York </em>(8 NY3d 888 [2007]) controlled in cases of melting and freezing snow. <em>Yarborough </em>and <em>Oboler, </em>which respectively dealt with hazards caused by a pothole and an uneven manhole cover, held that the \u201caffirmative negligence\u201d exception to prior written notice statutes applies only where the action of the municipality \u201cimmediately results in the existence of a dangerous condition\u201d <em>(Yarborough, </em>10 NY3d at 728, quoting <em>Oboler, 8 </em>NY3d at 889). Reasoning that this \u201cimmediacy test\u201d extends to snow melting cases, the Second Department found that the Village\u2019s action of snowplowing did not amount to \u201cimmediate creation\u201d of the hazard that San Marco allegedly encountered (57 AD3d 874, 877 [2d Dept 2008]). Rather, the Court found, \u201cthe environmental factors of time and temperature fluctuations . . . caused the allegedly hazardous condition\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The Appellate Division granted plaintiffs leave to appeal. We reverse and deny summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Reviewing the public policy rationale for prior written notice statutes, as well as the factual distinctions between each category of case, we conclude that the immediacy requirement for \u201cpothole cases\u201d should not be extended to cases involving hazards related to negligent snow removal. In reaching the conclusion that the Village should not be shielded from liability as a matter of law in the present case, we uphold the general underlying purpose of prior written notice statutes. Although it can be harsh for plaintiffs in many cases, it is sensible that the municipality is exempt from liability for injuries on public property unless the municipality knew of the problem. Prior written notice statutes were designed precisely to release municipalities from the \u201cvexing problem of municipal street and sidewalk liability\u201d <em>(Barry v Niagara Frontier Tr. Sys., </em>35 NY2d 629, 633 [1974]) when they have no reasonable opportunity to remedy the problem <em>(see e.g. Jagoda v City of Dunkirk, </em>43 AD2d 795, 796 [4th Dept 1973] [\u201cNotice provisions . . . are intended to insure that a municipality be given reasonable opportunity to cure defective conditions, the existence of which it could not be expected to know absent some sort of positive apprisal\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>We recognized the importance of actual notice in <em>Doremus v Incorporated Vil. of Lynbrook (18 </em>NY2d 362 [1966]), stating that prior written notice statutes represent \u201can effort to exempt. . . villages from liability for holes and breaks of a kind which do not immediately come to the attention of the village officers unless they are given actual notice thereof\u2019 <em>(id. </em>at 366). In keeping with this emphasis, we developed in <em>Amabile </em>the exception for the municipality\u2019s affirmative creation of the hazardous condition that caused injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Then, in <em>Yarborough </em>and <em>Oboler, </em>we held that a municipality could only be liable for its actions that immediately produced a hazardous condition. These holdings merely reinforced the object of prior written notice statutes to protect municipalities from liability for a road construction or repair, recognizing the difficulty in determining, after the passage of time, whether the initial repair was negligent. At the same time, the affirmative negligence exception addressed situations where a hazard was foreseeable, insofar as the municipality created it by, for example, digging an unmarked ditch in a road or neglecting to cover a street drain.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Considering the present facts in light of the underlying purpose of prior written notice statutes, we find these statutes were never intended to and ought not exempt a municipality from liability as a matter of law where a municipality\u2019s negligence in the maintenance of a municipally owned parking facility triggers the foreseeable development of black ice as soon as the temperature shifts. Unlike a pothole, which ordinarily is a product of wear and tear of traffic or long-term melting and freezing on pavement that at one time was safe and served an important purpose, a pile of plowed snow in a parking lot is a cost-saving, pragmatic solution to the problem of an accumulation of snow that presents the foreseeable, indeed known, risk of melting and refreezing.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Moreover, a patch of pavement may gradually and unpredictably deteriorate, making the point at which the efficacy of the initial repair ceases unknown to the municipality. It is therefore understandable that the hazard may escape detection until the municipality receives written notice of the problem. However, in the case of black ice that forms from plowing snow in a municipally owned parking facility, a municipality should require no additional notice of the possible danger arising from its method of snow clearance apart from widely available local temperature data. Indeed, there is evidence that in the case at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>bar, the Village treated the same parking lot with salt and sand the day before the accident, in order to limit the hazards of black ice. Thus, the determinative factor in this case should be whether the Village\u2019s snow removal efforts created the ice condition on which San Marco fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We have recognized the problem of negligent snow removal going back to 1949 in <em>Zahn v City of New York </em>(299 NY 581 [1949]), where judgment for the injured plaintiff was affirmed upon similar facts\u2014that a plaintiff fell on black ice that had accumulated as a result of melting and refreezing of snow that the property owner had shoveled on the sidewalk in front of her home. Although this case involved a private defendant, since that time there have been Appellate Division cases holding that a municipal defendant may be liable for a negligent ice condition without prior written notice. For example, on almost identical facts to the present case, in <em>Smith v County of Orange </em>(51 AD3d 1006 [2d Dept 2008]), the Second Department held that there was a triable issue of fact \u201cregarding whether the ice upon which the plaintiff slipped was formed when snow piles created by the County\u2019s snow removal efforts melted and refroze\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1006; <em>see also Brownell v City of New York, </em>277 AD2d 31 [1st Dept 2000], <em>lv denied </em>96 NY2d 712 [2001]; <em>Rector v City of New York, </em>259 AD2d 319 [1st Dept 1999]; <em>Glick v City of New York, </em>139 AD2d 402 [1st Dept 1988]).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">We do not hereby create a new burden on municipalities to remove all snow off-premises in order to avoid liability <em>(see e.g. Zwielich v Incorporated Vil. of Freeport, </em>208 AD2d 920 [2d Dept 1994]). Nor do we seek to render the municipality an insurer of pedestrians. However, at this juncture, plaintiff raises triable issues of fact that compel denial of summary judgment. Primarily, a jury must decide whether San Marco fell on ice created by the Village\u2019s snow clearance operation. And relatedly, there are factual issues concerning whether the Village exercised its duty of care to maintain the parking lot in a reasonably safe condition by plowing snow high alongside active parking spaces, and in failing to salt or sand the lot on weekends, despite the fact that it remained open seven days a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment denied. The certified question need not be answered upon the ground that it is unnecessary.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Smith, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"A_p\">The majority opinion seems to say that no written notice requirement applies in this case because the Village should have foreseen that its method of removing snow would create a hazard. This amounts to saying that no written notice is required because the municipality was negligent. But the whole point of written notice legislation is to protect municipalities from liability, even where they are negligent, unless they have received written notice of the hazard in question. The majority decision frustrates this legislative aim, contradicting both the text of the written notice requirements and our recent holdings in <em>Oboler v City of New York </em>(8 NY3d 888 [2007]) and <em>Yarborough v City of New York </em>(10 NY3d 726 [2008]). I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Village Law \u00a7 6-628 says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u201cNo civil action shall be maintained against the village for damages or injuries to person or property sustained in consequence of any street, highway, bridge, culvert, sidewalk or crosswalk being defective, out of repair, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed or for damages or injuries to person or property sustained solely in consequence of the existence of snow or ice upon any sidewalk, crosswalk, street, highway, bridge or culvert unless written notice of the defective, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed condition or of the existence of the snow or ice, relating to the particular place, was actually given to the village clerk and there was a failure or neglect within a reasonable time after the receipt of such notice to repair or remove the defect, danger or obstruction complained of, or to cause the snow or ice to be removed, or the place otherwise made reasonably safe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Village of Mount Kisco Code \u00a7 93-47 is very similar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">\u201cNo civil action shall be brought or maintained against the Village of Mount Kisco for damages or injuries to person or property sustained in consequence of any street, highway, bridge, culvert, sidewalk or crosswalk being defective, out of repair, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed or in consequence of the existence or accumulation of snow or ice upon any street, highway, bridge, culvert, sidewalk or crosswalk, unless written notice of the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>such condition, relating to the particular place, had theretofore actually been given to the Board of Trustees of the Village of Mount Kisco and there had been a failure or neglect on the part of said village to cause such condition to be corrected or such snow or ice to be removed or the place otherwise made reasonably safe within a reasonable time after the receipt of such notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Written notice requirements of this kind are common in New York. Ordinarily they do not, as these provisions do not, include in their text an exception for hazards the municipalities created. We have nevertheless recognized such an exception\u2014not, as the majority implies, to nullify the requirement in every case in which a municipality negligently fails to foresee the consequence of its actions, but to take account of cases in which a prior written notice requirement would be anomalous. Thus, if a city construction crew digs a hole in the street, it would seem absurd to immunize the city from lawsuits by pedestrians who fall in the hole on the ground that no one gave the city written notice of the hole\u2019s existence (see <em>Doremus v Incorporated Vil. of Lynbrook, </em>18 NY2d 362, 366 [1966] [written notice requirements were designed to exempt municipalities from roadway defects \u201cwhich do not immediately come to the attention of the village officers\u201d]). <em>Kiernan v Thompson </em>(73 NY2d 840 [1988]) was a case of this type. Where the City of Ithaca, in removing a tree stump, had left a crack in the sidewalk, we held that \u201csince the City created the crack in the pavement, plaintiff was not required to provide it with prior written notice of the unsafe condition\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 842).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Our cases also recognize, however, that the rationale of the exception does not apply where a condition that the municipality creates is not immediately dangerous, but becomes so with the passage of time. In such cases the municipality may be at fault for not foreseeing the danger, but that is irrelevant; there is, by hypothesis, fault by the municipality in every case to which a prior written notice requirement applies. Where the danger is not the immediate result of the municipality\u2019s negligent act, it cannot be said with certainty\u2014as it can in the case of the hole the city itself dug\u2014that the municipality actually knew of the danger. In such cases, therefore, the municipality is entitled to prior written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">As the Appellate Division explained in <em>Bielecki v City of New York </em>(14 AD3d 301, 301-302 [1st Dept 2005]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u201cWe understand the affirmative negligence exception to the notice requirement to be limited to work by the City that immediately results in the existence of a dangerous condition. . . . If we were to extend the affirmative negligence exception to cases like this one, where it is alleged that a dangerous condition developed over time from an allegedly negligent municipal repair, the exception to the notice requirement would swallow up the requirement itself, thereby defeating the purpose of the Pothole Law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We adopted the reasoning of <em>Bielecki </em>in two recent cases, <em>Oboler </em>(8 NY3d at 889-890 [case dismissed where plaintiff failed to show that a height differential between a manhole cover and the adjoining asphalt existed immediately after the city\u2019s resurfacing of the roadway]) and <em>Yarborough </em>(10 NY3d at 728 [case dismissed where city was allegedly negligent in repairing a pothole, causing deterioration \u201cover time with environmental wear and tear\u201d]). These cases effectively overruled our affirmance several decades ago of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision in <em>Muszynski v City of Buffalo </em>(33 AD2d 648 [4th Dept 1969], <em>affd on op below </em>29 NY2d 810 [1971]). <em>Oboler </em>and <em>Yarborough </em>essentially adopt the view of Judge Scileppi, dissenting in <em>Muszynski, </em>that written notice is required where \u201cthe dangerous condition was not created immediately and consequently\u201d upon a municipality\u2019s action (29 NY2d at 813).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The majority here distinguishes <em>Oboler </em>and <em>Yarborough </em>on the ground that those cases involved defects in the pavement itself, not ice that formed on the pavement. The majority\u2019s reasoning is that, while it is \u201cunderstandable\u201d that deterioration of the pavement resulting from negligent street repair \u201cmay escape detection\u201d (majority op at 117), a negligently created pile of snow \u201cpresents the foreseeable, indeed known, risk of melting and refreezing\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 117). But this confuses the issue of written notice with the issue of negligence. If a risk is neither foreseeable nor known, the municipality is not liable for it at all\u2014the written notice statute is unnecessary. The premise of the plaintiffs case, in a case like <em>Oboler </em>or <em>Yarborough, </em>is that the municipality should have foreseen, but negligently failed to foresee, that its way of repairing the streets would cause the pavement to deteriorate. There is, in other words, no logical distinction between pavement-defect cases like <em>Oboler </em>and <em>Yarborough </em>and snow-and-ice cases like this one. The written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>notice requirements here apply by their terms to the \u201caccumulation of snow or ice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Of course it can be said in a case like this\u2014as it could be said in <em>Oboler, Yarborough, Bielecki </em>and similar cases\u2014that it is unfair to leave plaintiffs uncompensated for an injury that a municipality negligently caused, but that is what prior written notice requirements do. Such requirements may be harsh, but they are \u201ca valid exercise of legislative authority\u201d <em>(Amabile v City of Buffalo, </em>93 NY2d 471, 473 [1999]). The State, which has created municipalities and has, by abrogating the old rule of sovereign immunity, permitted citizens to bring actions against them, has chosen to limit those lawsuits to cases in which a municipality has received written notice of the hazard complained of. Because the Village here received no such notice, this case should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Judges Ciparick, Pigott and Jones concur with Chief Judge Lippman; Judge Smith dissents in a separate opinion in which Judges Graffeo and Read concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
