The arbitrator\u2019s award should be vacated because it violated public policy by denying Ms. Kowaleski statutory protections against retaliation for whistleblower activity. <em>(Matter of Sprinzen [Nomberg], </em>46 NY2d 623; <em>Sabetay v Sterling Drug, </em>69 NY2d 329; <em>Hanley v New York State Exec.

The arbitrator\u2019s award should be vacated because the arbitrator exceeded his power which was expressly limited by the statutory requirement to consider and determine the merits of Ms. Kowaleski\u2019s whistlebower defense. <em>(Matter of Silverman [Benmor Coats], </em>61 NY2d 299.) III. The award should be vacated because the arbitrator failed to determine whether the charges against Ms. Kowaleski were initiated and pursued in retaliation for whistleblower activity. <em>(Matter of Obot [New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs.], </em>89 NY2d 883; <em>Treglia v Town of Manlius, </em>313 F3d 713; <em>Matter of Crossman-Battisti v Traficanti, </em>235 AD2d 566.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b148-7\">Ciparick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Petitioner Barbara Kowaleski began her employment with the State Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) as a correction officer in 1981, and was assigned to the Hale Creek Correctional Facility (Hale Creek) in 1995. In October 2004, she was served with a notice of discipline (Notice) charging her with violating provisions of the employees\u2019 manual on three separate occasions in September and October 2004:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1) in September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>2004, she allegedly \u201cmade inappropriate comments of a personal nature about another staff member in the presence of staff and inmates\u201d; (2) in October 2004, she allegedly argued with a fellow employee; and (3) also in October 2004, she allegedly was \u201cdisrespectful and insubordinate\u201d when she ignored a superior\u2019s order to stop interrupting another employee. The Notice called for her termination and the loss of any accrued leave. Kowaleski filed a grievance and, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), a hearing was held before an arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">At the start of the hearing, Kowaleski argued that the disciplinary action was only being brought to retaliate against her for reporting a fellow officer\u2019s misconduct in 2002, and that she was entitled to raise this as an affirmative defense pursuant to Civil Service Law \u00a7 75-b, which prohibits public employers from retaliating against employees for reporting their coworkers\u2019 improper conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The arbitrator determined that because the CBA limited his authority \u201cto determinations of guilt or innocence and the appropriateness of proposed penalties,\u201d he lacked authority to consider Kowaleski\u2019s retaliation defense. He noted, however, that he would consider evidence of retaliation when determining witness credibility and \u201cin the larger context of guilt or innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In January 2007, the arbitrator found Kowaleski guilty of two of the three charges and determined that termination was appropriate. He found that Kowaleski had, in the presence of inmates, asked if a fellow officer\u2019s son had been shot, potentially endangering the officer and his family, and that she had insubordinately ignored a superior\u2019s instructions. The arbitrator noted that, under the CBA, an employee can only be disciplined for \u201cjust cause,\u201d which requires, among other things, that the employer made a \u201cfair and objective investigation,\u201d that \u201cthe employer\u2019s action was non-discriminatory,\u201d and that \u201cthe penalty is reasonably related to the seriousness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>offense.\u201d After finding Kowaleski guilty, the arbitrator concluded that there was \u201cjust cause\u201d for the penalty of discharge, which was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or excessive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Kowaleski filed this CPLR 7511 petition seeking a declaration (1) vacating the arbitrator\u2019s opinion and award, and (2) directing that the charges in the Notice be dismissed or remanded for a new hearing before a different arbitrator. DOCS moved to dismiss the petition. Supreme Court found that the arbitrator exceeded his power by ignoring Civil Service Law \u00a7 75-b, but concluded that because this was an error of law, the award should not be vacated. The court further reasoned that section 75-b only precludes disciplinary action \u201ctaken <em>solely </em>in retaliation,\u201d and here witness testimony provided a \u201cseparate and independent\u201d basis for the action. Supreme Court found that the arbitrator\u2019s findings and award were rational.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The Appellate Division affirmed, with two Justices dissenting. The majority found that although the arbitrator \u201cincorrectly stated that it was beyond his jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s claim of retaliation, this error of law does not warrant vacating the award under the circumstances,\u201d given the arbitrator\u2019s rational and supported finding that Kowaleski was guilty of two of the charges <em>(Matter of Kowaleski [New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs.], </em>61 AD3d 1081, 1083 [3d Dept 2009]). Moreover, the majority reasoned, the arbitrator did consider \u201cevidence of retaliation in weighing witness credibility and assessing petitioner\u2019s guilt\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Two Justices dissented on the grounds that Kowaleski was \u201cdeprived of her right to have the arbitrator determine . . . the specific factual issue of whether the disciplinary charges were, in the first instance, initiated and pursued to retaliate for the prior matters\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1085 [brackets and internal quotation marks omitted]). Kowaleski appealed as a matter of right pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a). We agree with the dissenting Justices and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Under CPLR 7511 (b) an arbitration award must be vacated if, as relevant here, a party\u2019s rights were impaired by an arbitrator who \u201cexceeded his power or so imperfectly executed it that a final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made\u201d (CPLR 7511 [b] [1] [iii]). It is well-settled that an arbitrator \u201cexceed[s] his power\u201d under the meaning of the statute where his \u201caward violates a strong public policy, is irrational or clearly exceeds a specifically enumerated limitation on the arbitrator\u2019s power\u201d <em>(Matter of New York City Tr. Auth. v Transport Workers\u2019 Union of Am., Local 100, AFL-CIO, </em>6 NY3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>332, 336 [2005]; <em>see also Matter of Falzone [New York Cent. Mut. Fire Ins. Co.], </em>15 NY3d 530 [2010]). Outside of these narrowly circumscribed exceptions, courts lack authority to review arbitral decisions, even where \u201can arbitrator has made an error of law or fact\u201d <em>(Falzone, </em>15 NY3d at 534).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Here, the arbitrator clearly exceeded a \u201cspecifically enumerated limitation\u201d on his power. As the courts below found, and DOCS concedes, the arbitrator not only had authority to consider Kowaleski\u2019s retaliation defense, but was required to do so. Civil Service Law \u00a7 75-b prohibits a public employer from taking disciplinary action to retaliate against an employee for reporting \u201cimproper governmental action\u201d (Civil Service Law \u00a7 75-b [2] [a]). If \u201cthe employee reasonably believes dismissal or other disciplinary action would not have been taken but for\u201d the whistleblowing, the employee \u201cmay assert such as a defense before the designated arbitrator or hearing officer\u201d (Civil Service Law \u00a7 75-b [3] [a]). Whatever the terms of the CBA, \u201c[t]he merits of such defense <em>shall he considered and determined </em>as part of the arbitration award or hearing officer decision\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis added]). In short, the statute requires the arbitrator to consider and determine the merits of an employee\u2019s retaliation defense where such a defense is raised <em>(cf. Matter of Obot [New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs.], </em>89 NY2d 883, 885-886 [1996] [award not vacated where an employee failed to raise the retaliation defense in the arbitration and the arbitrator did not consider it]). If the arbitrator or hearing officer finds that \u201cthe dismissal or other disciplinary action is based solely\u201d on the employer\u2019s desire to retaliate, the disciplinary proceeding must be dismissed (Civil Service Law \u00a7 75-b [3] [a]). Therefore, the arbitrator\u2019s finding here that he did not have authority under the CBA to consider Kowaleski\u2019s retaliation defense was not only incorrect as a matter of law, but also in excess of an explicit limitation on his power. Because he failed to consider and determine the defense, the award must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Contrary to DOCS\u2019 position, it was not enough for the arbitrator to hear evidence of retaliation in the context of making determinations as to witness credibility and deciding Kowaleski\u2019s guilt. A disciplinary action may be retaliatory even where an employee is guilty of the alleged infraction. Under Civil Service Law \u00a7 75-b (3), an arbitrator is required to dismiss a disciplinary action based solely on retaliatory motive, regardless of the employee\u2019s guilt or innocence <em>(see </em>Civil Service Law \u00a7 75-b [2] [a]; [3] [a]). This separate retaliation inquiry is critical. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>order to be effective, whistleblower protections like those embodied in Civil Service Law \u00a7 75-b must shield employees from being retaliated against by an employer\u2019s selective application of theoretically neutral rules. Thus, a separate determination regarding the employer\u2019s motivation in bringing the action is necessary if section 75-b is to truly \u201cestablish[ ] a major right for employees\u2014the right to speak out against dangerous or harmful employer practices\u201d (Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1984, ch 660, at 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Because we find that the arbitrator\u2019s failure to separately consider and determine Kowaleski\u2019s affirmative defense of retaliation on the merits requires the award to be vacated, we decline to reach Kowaleski\u2019s other arguments. We note, however, that she has requested that any rehearing be before a different arbitrator. That request should be ruled on by Supreme Court in the exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Therefore, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be reversed, with costs, petitioner\u2019s application to vacate the arbitration award granted, and the matter remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-9\">. In 2003, Kowaleski had received two notices of discipline, both with dismissal from service as the proposed penalty. In the resulting arbitration, she testified that she had reported a fellow correction officer\u2019s misconduct in 2002, and was frequently harassed at work. While noting that it was \u201cnot within [his] authority to make a determination of whether harassment occurred,\u201d the arbitrator observed that Kowaleski was \u201cthe object of animosity and/or harassment\u201d by some of her fellow officers, and that the harassment \u201cmay have originated when CO Kowaleski informed her supervisor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>[2002] incident.\u201d He found her guilty of some of the disciplinary charges and imposed a 60-day suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\">. Kowaleski testified that, in 2002, she observed a fellow officer use excessive force on an inmate, and she refused to sign a report that she had witnessed the inmate assault the officer. The sergeant who was supposed to be supervising when the incident occurred told Kowaleski to \u201c[k]eep [her] mouth shut or else [she] would be escorted off the premises.\u201d A group of her coworkers began harassing her, and the harassment escalated after she reported the incident to the administration. A retired correction sergeant who had last worked at Hale Creek in 2005 testified that Kowaleski \u201ccouldn\u2019t make a move without getting blamed for something.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
