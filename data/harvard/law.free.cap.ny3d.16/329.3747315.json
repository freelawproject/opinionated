We hold that the RGB has the power to make this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">The RGB orders in issue here govern rent levels for the years ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2010. The two orders are identical in all relevant ways except for the amounts of the increases allowed. The parties focus on the first of the two, as will we.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">The part of that order that concerns us sets out the rent increases permitted in renewal leases of apartments. It makes separate provision for apartments in which heat is provided by the landlord at no charge to the tenant, and those in which it is not; and it also distinguishes between one-year and two-year renewal leases. In each category, the order authorizes a percentage rent increase: for apartments where heat is provided, 4.5% for a one-year lease and 8.5% for a two-year lease; where heat is not provided, 4% for a one-year lease and 8% for a two-year lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">However, \u201cwhere the most recent vacancy lease was executed six years or more prior to the date of the renewal lease under this Order,\u201d the order makes the percentage increases subject to a dollar floor, calculated to affect apartments in which the old rent was less than $1,000 a month. For example, where heat is provided, the authorized increase in a one-year renewal lease is 4.5% or $45, whichever is greater; for a two-year lease it is 8.5% or $85, whichever is greater; and so forth. Thus, if the old rent on an apartment that had had no vacancy for six years or more was, say, $450, a landlord who provided heat and offered a one-year renewal lease could charge an additional $45\u2014a 10% increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The RGB\u2019s purpose in taking this approach was to remedy what it saw as an inequity. Ordinarily, the permissible rent for a rent-stabilized apartment depends on the rent charged in the past, with relatively modest increases authorized annually by the RGB, and larger increases (or, at higher rent levels, decontrol) when the apartment becomes vacant. But the costs of maintaining an apartment and providing services to its occupant are often not in proportion to historical rents. Where the rent is relatively small and there is no vacancy for many years, the disproportion can become acute, with small annually-authorized increases that do not come close to covering increased costs. Those costs have to be paid somehow, so if percentage increases are uniform, the increases must be set at a level that allows landlords to make larger profits on the apartments that get larger increases, and to use those profits to pay the costs for the lower-rent apartments. In other words, tenants paying higher rents must subsidize those paying lower rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Perhaps that subsidy could be justified on the ground that tenants paying higher rents are generally wealthier. An analysis by the RGB staff, however, showed that the subsidy appears to be unfair even when tenant income is taken into account. The analysis (which excluded senior citizens receiving rent increase exemptions) showed that the median rent-to-income ratio for tenants living in their apartments six years or more was lower than the same ratio for all tenants\u2014and would continue to be lower even if minimum increases in the range of those at issue here were imposed. The RGB therefore decided to adopt the minimums.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">This case began as two CPLR article 78 proceedings, one relating to each of the RGB\u2019s orders; the proceedings have been consolidated. Petitioners are two rent-stabilized tenants, both of whom have lived in their apartments for more than six years and pay less than $1,000 a month in rent, and a tenants\u2019 rights organization. They seek to annul the orders to the extent they allow minimum dollar increases. Petitioners make no claim that the minimum increases are unreasonable or unfair, but assert that the RGB lacks the power to permit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Supreme Court granted the relief petitioners sought (27 Misc 3d 340 [2010]), and the Appellate Division affirmed <em>(Matter of Casado v Markus, </em>74 AD3d 632 [1st Dept 2010]). We granted leave to appeal (15 NY3d 712 [2010]), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Petitioners\u2019 primary argument is that the RGB has no power to create classes of housing accommodations\u2014meaning, petitioners say, that the RGB is forbidden to draw any distinctions within any of the three \u201cclasses\u201d of housing accommodations\u2014 apartments, hotel units and lofts\u2014established by the New York City Council. Petitioners base this argument on two provisions of law: New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 26-510 (b), which is part of the Rent Stabilization Law (RSL), originally enacted in 1969 by the New York City Council (Local Law No. 16 [1969] of City of NY, codified as amended at Administrative Code \u00a7 26-501 <em>et seq.); </em>and section 3 (a) of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act (ETPA), enacted by the State Legislature in 1974 (L 1974, ch 576, \u00a7 4, codified as amended at McKinney\u2019s Uncons Laws of NY \u00a7 8621 <em>et seq.). </em>At the same time it enacted the ETPA, the Legislature repealed and reenacted the parts of the RSL relating to the RGB, making no relevant change in the language of section 26-510 (b) (L 1974, ch 576, \u00a7 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In its current form, section 26-510 (b) authorizes the RGB to \u201cestablish annually guidelines for rent adjustments,\u201d and to file with the City Clerk annually \u201ca statement of the maximum rate or rates of rent adjustment, if any, for one or more classes of accommodations\u201d (Administrative Code \u00a7 26-510 [b]). ETPA \u00a7 3 (a) (Uncons Laws \u00a7 8623 [a]) says that in New York City \u201c[t]he existence of [a] public emergency requiring the regulation of residential rents for all or any class or classes of housing accommodations . . . shall be a matter for local determination . . . by the local legislative body.\u201d (The power given the New York City Council by this section of the ETPA was largely revoked by the State Legislature in 2003 [see L 2003, ch 82, \u00a7 1, codified at Uncons Laws \u00a7 8605].) Petitioners claim that these enactments, read together, reserve the power to create \u201cclasses of housing accommodations\u201d to the City Council exclusively, and that the City Council has not delegated and could not delegate to the RGB any power to draw distinctions between accommodations of the same class. Petitioners\u2019 argument does not persuade us.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">On its face, the RSL does not prohibit the RGB from distinguishing some kinds of apartments from others. The language that empowers the RGB to establish \u201cthe maximum rate or rates of rent adjustment . . . for one or more classes of accommodations\u201d (Administrative Code \u00a7 26-510 [b]) does not, as a simple matter of grammar, say or imply that there must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>only one \u201cmaximum rate ... of rent adjustment\u201d for each class. And the ETPA language that petitioners rely on (which has been in any event largely nullified by later legislation) has nothing to do with the issue before us. To say that a \u201clocal legislative body\u201d may determine when a \u201cpublic emergency\u201d exists requiring rent regulation for \u201call or any class or classes of housing accommodations\u201d (Uncons Laws \u00a7 8623 [a]) is to say nothing at all about whether, or by whom, multiple levels of rent increases may be permitted within each class.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In fact, the RGB has always made some distinctions between apartments, even though apartments are generally considered one \u201cclass\u201d of housing accommodation. Most obviously, the RGB prescribes different rental rates for one-year and two-year leases. Petitioners say that this is an exception to the general rule against the making of distinctions within a \u201cclass,\u201d and assert that the exception is authorized by Administrative Code \u00a7 26-511 (c) (4) (reenacted by the State Legislature, L 1985, ch 907, \u00a7 1). That code provision, however, says nothing about the RGB\u2019s power to make distinctions: it says that landlords shall be required \u201cto grant a one or two year . . . lease at the option of the tenant.\u201d It is true that this requirement would make little sense if rent increases for one- and two-year leases had to be the same, because almost all tenants would elect two-year leases; but this reinforces our point\u2014the Legislature must have assumed that the RGB would make common-sense distinctions when it fixed the increases allowed for apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The RGB has made a number of other distinctions within the apartment \u201cclass.\u201d It has allowed landlords to charge extra when electricity is included in the rent, and to collect \u201cfuel adjustment surcharges\u201d (see <em>Stein v Rent Guidelines Bd. for City of N.Y., </em>127 AD2d 189, 190, 196 [1st Dept 1987]; <em>Matter of Chessin v New York City Conciliation &amp; Appeals Bd., </em>100 AD2d 297, 304 [1st Dept 1984]). Indeed, the order challenged in this case distinguishes between apartments in which heat is provided by the landlord and those in which it is not. Petitioners say that all these distinctions are invalid, and have survived only because the power to create them has never been challenged; they assert that they could, but chose not to, attack the heat-based distinction contained in the order now at issue. To us, however, the fact that such distinctions have long been accepted without question is further confirmation that nothing in the governing legislation can fairly be read to prohibit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">We therefore reject petitioners\u2019 argument that the RGB may not permit any increases that are larger, in percentage terms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>for some apartments than for others. But petitioners also attack the dollar minimum increases now at issue on a narrower ground. They point out that the problem addressed by these m\u00ednimums\u2014the plight of landlords who are unable for a long time to obtain vacancy increases\u2014has been dealt with to some degree by state legislation. New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 26-511 (c) (5-a), adopted by the Legislature in 1997 (L 1997, ch 116, \u00a7 19), governs the rent increases permitted after an apartment becomes vacant. In general, the permissible vacancy increase is 20%, but where there has been no previous such increase within eight years \u201cthe legal regulated rent may be further increased\u201d according to a formula stated in the legislation. Petitioners argue, in substance, that by giving landlords this form of relief, the Legislature implicitly prohibited the RGB from giving another form of relief for the same evil.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Again, petitioners\u2019 argument does not persuade us. There is no conflict between the RGB\u2019s dollar minimum increases, which give some benefit to landlords of low-rent, slow-turnover apartments while their tenants remain in possession, and the state legislation, which gives relief regardless of rent level after a slow-turnover apartment has finally become vacant. It is true that some landlords may, eventually, benefit from both provisions, but the two benefits, even where cumulative, are not logically inconsistent. Nor is the state legislation so detailed and comprehensive as to imply that the Legislature has preempted the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Petitioners rely on <em>Matter of New York State Tenants &amp; Neighbors Coalition, Inc. v Nassau County Rent Guidelines Bd. </em>(53 AD3d 550 [2d Dept 2008]), which invalidated an order of the Nassau County Rent Guidelines Board permitting rent increases that would vary with tenants\u2019 income. The <em>New York State Tenants </em>Court held that \u201cthe Board exceeded its statutory authority in establishing a separate class of accommodation based on tenant income\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 552). To the extent that the Second Department in <em>New York State </em>Tenants\u2014like the First Department here\u2014accepted the argument that there can be no distinction in the rent increases allowed within a \u201cclass of accommodation\u201d it was mistaken, for the reasons we have explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">This does not mean that the result in <em>New York State Tenants </em>was necessarily wrong. It could be argued that, in making distinctions based on tenant income, the Nassau County Rent Guidelines Board trespassed on a sensitive policy area that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>within the Legislature\u2019s special province (see <em>Boreali v </em>Axelrod, 71 NY2d 1 [1987]). We do not pass on the merit of that argument as it applies to the <em>New York State Tenants </em>case. But we find the argument inapplicable here, where the RGB has dealt with a narrower, more technical and less sensitive issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the petitions dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b398-6\">Ciparick, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Anl\">Because I believe that the New York City Rent Guidelines Board (RGB or Board) lacks authority to promulgate orders imposing dollar minimum increases solely on tenants who have been living in their apartments for six years or more and paying less than $1,000 per month in rent, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">I find it unnecessary to reach the question of whether the RGB has authority to create any distinctions whatsoever within the extant classes of accommodation, since it patently lacks power to draw the particular distinction at issue here. As the majority explains, the Board\u2019s authority is derived from Administrative Code of the City of NY (Rent Stabilization Law of 1969) \u00a7 26-510 (b), under which it may \u201cestablish annually guidelines for rent adjustments.\u201d Even assuming that the Board, pursuant to this delegation, can set multiple rates for each class of housing, its ability to do so is limited by well-settled principles of administrative law.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Under the two orders at issue on this appeal, a tenant who has been living in an apartment for six years or more is subject to a minimum increase, whereas a more recent tenant in an identical apartment paying identical rent is not so subject. The rationale behind these orders is apparently, as Supreme Court explained, \u201cto attempt to equalize the rental amounts that long-term and short-term tenants pay, because the operating expenses for those apartments are the same\u201d (27 Misc 3d 340, 346 [2010]), yet long-term tenants generally pay less than more recent tenants for the same apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Of course, it is no coincidence that long-term tenants are the greatest beneficiaries of rent stabilization, or that, in the majority\u2019s words, \u201ctenants paying higher rents must subsidize those paying lower rents\u201d (majority op at 334). This inequality is due, in large part, to the Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997 (L 1997, ch 116, \u00a7 19), which amended the Rent Stabilization Law to provide that a vacancy lease can increase a unit\u2019s rent by up to 20%, and even more where there has been no vacancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>increase in the prior eight years or the rent is particularly low (Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 26-511 [c] [5-a]). The evident purpose of these changes was to bring apartments closer to market rent as they become vacated <em>(see </em>Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1997, ch 116, at 38-39). Critically, the Legislature did not couple the large rent increases it was authorizing for new tenants with any alteration in how rent increases were calculated for current tenants. Under this scheme, by design, there is a large rent gap between new tenants and those whose tenancies predate the amendment, and it will increase as many apartments experience repeated vacancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u201cIt is a fundamental principle of administrative law that an agency cannot promulgate rules or regulations that contravene the will of the Legislature\u201d or are \u201c \u2018out of harmony\u2019 with an applicable statute\u201d (Weiss <em>v City of New York, </em>95 NY2d 1, 4-5 [2000]), yet the RGB did exactly that. By creating varied rates with the intended effect of minimizing the degree to which landlord costs are disproportionately covered by higher-paying apartments, the Board sought to mitigate a rent disparity the Legislature created.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">More broadly, it is axiomatic that, \u201c[a]s an arm of the executive branch of government, an administrative agency may not, in the exercise of rule-making authority, engage in broad-based public policy determinations\u201d <em>(Rent Stabilization Assn. of N.Y. City v Higgins, </em>83 NY2d 156, 169 [1993], citing <em>Boreali v Axelrod, </em>71 NY2d 1, 9 [1987]). It strikes me as a great usurpation of power for the RGB to create separate increases based on what it perceives as a structural inequity in the rent laws. The Board found it problematic that long-term tenants shoulder such a small percentage of landlord costs, and this determination, in our view, crosses \u201cthe difficult-to-define fine between administrative rule-making and legislative policy-making\u201d <em>(Boreali, </em>71 NY2d at 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Indeed, the RGB has conceded throughout this litigation that any distinctions in rate increases must be based on factors sufficiently connected to the housing accommodations themselves.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It seems to have accepted the reasoning of <em>Matter of New York State Tenants &amp; Neighbors Coalition, Inc. v Nassau County </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Rent Guidelines Bd. </em>(53 AD3d 550, 552 [2d Dept 2008]), which relied on <em>Boreali </em>and <em>Weiss </em>in striking down a rent increase contingent on tenants\u2019 income. We see no relevant distinction between creating varied rates of increase based on income, which the Board concedes would be ultra vires, and varied rates based on duration of tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Finally, I note that under the majority\u2019s reasoning there is no limit to the amount that the Board can increase rents at the lowest end of the rent-stabilized spectrum for the purpose of evenly distributing maintenance costs that in many buildings are shared by long-term, newer, and market-rate tenants. To me, it is obvious that such equalization is anathema to the purpose of the Rent Stabilization Law, and therefore beyond the Board\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Accordingly, I would affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read and Pigott concur with Judge Smith; Judge Ciparick dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Judge Jones concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\"> In Supreme Court, \u201cthe RGB concede [d] that it may not create classes of accommodations based on factors, such as the income of the tenants, that are not sufficiently connected to the housing accommodations themselves.\u201d (27 Misc 3d at 349.) Far from repudiating this view on appeal, the Board reiter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ated during oral argument before us that a rate distinction based on income would be inappropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
