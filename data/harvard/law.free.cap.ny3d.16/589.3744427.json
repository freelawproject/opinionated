Defendant, a 23-year-old man, and another adult were also there. While at Steven A.\u2019s home, the girls drank alcohol and smoked marijuana with Steven A. and his friends, and also engaged in sexual activity. Two days later, K.D. informed the police that she had intercourse with Steven A. at his party, but did not accuse defendant. K.D. gave a second statement to the police a few days later, stating she had intercourse with the defendant that night against her will. Defendant was charged with rape in the first degree (forcible), rape in the second degree (statutory) and three counts of endangering the welfare of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">During jury selection, the People asked the prospective jurors whether the lack of DNA evidence would \u201caffect anybody\u2019s decision in this matter?\u201d After being sworn, a juror asked to approach the bench and informed the court: \u201cI guess I think that there should be DNA evidence.\u201d County Court made a limited inquiry about the juror\u2019s statement. It then granted the People\u2019s request to remove the juror over defendant\u2019s objection. The court found him to be \u201cunqualified to serve as a juror.\u201d As to another prospective juror, that juror advised the court, when asked whether any of the jurors knew the prosecutor, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>prosecutor \u201ctook a case for me for my son,\u201d about 13 or 14 years earlier. County Court denied defendant\u2019s challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Prior to trial, defendant moved for an order allowing him to introduce evidence at trial of K.D.\u2019s sexual conduct at the party, specifically her involvement with Steven A. County Court held a hearing pursuant to CPL 60.42 (5).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The court initially granted the motion, but subsequently granted the People\u2019s motion to reargue this issue. The court then ruled that the defense was \u201cprohibited from eliciting testimony relative to any prior sexual conduct of the victim with any of the other individuals who were present\u201d unless the People introduced evidence attributing KD.\u2019s bruises to sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">At trial, K.D. testified that she was raped by defendant. A.B. testified that K.D. had been alone with defendant in a bedroom and when she emerged, wearing only a sheet, she was crying and saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d Because of County Court\u2019s Rape Shield Law determination, defendant was prohibited from introducing, among other things, R.S.\u2019s statement to the police that K.D. was crying because she was upset that she had sex with Steven A.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The jury acquitted defendant of rape in the first degree, but convicted him of rape in the second degree and three counts of endangering the welfare of a child. Defendant appealed, contesting, inter alia, County Court\u2019s rape shield and jury selection rulings. The Appellate Division affirmed, finding no error or abuse of discretion by County Court in its discharge of one juror and failure to disqualify another and rejecting defendant\u2019s Rape Shield Law argument (67 AD3d 1052 [2009]). This Court now affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred by rejecting evidence of K.D.\u2019s sexual activity with another person around the time of the incident pursuant to CPL 60.42 (5). CPL 60.42 declares \u201c[e]vidence of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct\u201d inadmissible in a prosecution for a sex offense under article 130 of the Penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Law, except in certain circumstances. CPL 60.42 provides five statutory exceptions. \u201cThe first four allow evidence of a complainant\u2019s prior sexual conduct in narrowly defined factual circumstances,\u201d and the fifth, the subdivision at issue here, \u201cvest[s] discretion in the trial court\u201d <em>(People v </em>Williams, 81 NY2d 303, 311 [1993]). Pursuant to subdivision (5), evidence of a victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct may be introduced upon a determination by the court that such evidence is \u201crelevant and admissible in the <em>interests of </em>justice\u201d (CPL 60.42 [5] [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The Legislature specifically intended the Rape Shield Law to limit the inquiry into \u201ca victim\u2019s past sex life in prosecutions for sex offenses\u201d because it found that such evidence, in forcible rape cases, rarely \u201celicits testimony relevant to the issues of the victim\u2019s consent on credibility, but serves only to harass the alleged victim and confuse the jurors\u201d (Mem of Assemblyman Stanley Fink, 1975 NY Legis Ann, at 47-48).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We recognize that, \u201cin the interests of justice,\u201d evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct may be admissible if it is relevant to a defense <em>(see generally People v </em>Jovanovic, 263 AD2d 182, 198 [1st Dept 1999] [application of section 60.42 (5) to redacted e-mails\u2014containing evidence to which the Rape Shield Law would have applied\u2014because they were \u201chighly relevant to establishing the defense\u201d]). In contrast, such evidence must be precluded if it does not tend to establish a defense to the crime because it will only harass the victim and possibly confuse the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">In this case, County Court appropriately accepted the defendant\u2019s argument that evidence of the complainant\u2019s sexual conduct that evening would be relevant to his defense if the People introduced evidence of her bruising caused by sexual contact and attributed such evidence to him. Such evidence would have been relevant to both charges of rape, but the People decided not to offer evidence of bruising. Defendant argues that R.S.\u2019s statement to the police\u2014that K.D. told her that she was crying because she had sex with Steven A.\u2014should have been admitted pursuant to CPL 60.42 (5) because it raised an alternative basis for admissibility since the People presented proof that the victim was crying when she emerged from the bedroom with defendant to buttress their proof of forcible compulsion. Since it would have been probative, if at all, of only the forcible rape charge and defendant was acquitted of that count, we need not resolve whether the trial court abused its discretion in declining to admit that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s rulings regarding whether to exclude two jurors for cause. However, no abuse of discretion is apparent <em>(see </em>CPL 270.15 [4]; CPL 270.20).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Pursuant to CPL 270.15 (4), a court may allow a challenge of a sworn juror for cause, prior to the time a witness is sworn at the trial, where the challenge is made upon a ground that was not known to the challenging party before the trial juror was sworn <em>(see also People v Harris, </em>57 NY2d 335, 349 [1982]). Additionally, CPL 270.20 (1) specifically enumerates the grounds upon which a prospective juror may be challenged for cause. CPL 270.20 (1) (b) focuses on the prospective juror\u2019s state of mind to render an impartial verdict, and subdivision (1) (c) addresses any relationship between the juror and a person involved in the criminal action which could affect the juror\u2019s impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Although County Court failed to make a probing inquiry regarding the sworn juror\u2019s ability to render an impartial verdict, its discharge was not error as such action is authorized by CPL 270.15 (4). Furthermore, this Court has noted that a \u201ctrial court should lean toward disqualifying a prospective juror of dubious impartiality, rather than testing the bounds of discretion by permitting such a juror to serve\u201d <em>(People v Branch, </em>46 NY2d 645, 651 [1979]; <em>see also People v Blyden, </em>55 NY2d 73, 78 [1982] [\u201cThe costs to society and the criminal justice system of discharging the juror are comparatively slight, while the costs in fairness to the defendant and the general perception of fairness of not discharging such a juror are great\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Likewise, there was no error in refusing to disqualify a prospective juror due to a former professional relationship <em>(see People v Provenzano, </em>50 NY2d 420 [1980] [trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting an acquaintance and supporter of the District Attorney to serve as a juror]). Because the relationship between the prosecutor and prospective juror was distant in time and limited in nature, County Court did not abuse its discretion by permitting this juror to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\"> CPL 60.42 states: \u201cEvidence of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct shall not be admissible in a prosecution for an offense or an attempt to commit an offense defined in article one hundred thirty of the penal law [\u2018Sex Offenses\u2019].\u201d Subdivision (5) permits such evidence if a court determines \u201cafter an offer of proof by the accused outside the hearing of the jury, or such hearing as the court may require, and a statement by the court of its findings of fact essential to its determination, to be relevant and admissible in the interests of justice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
