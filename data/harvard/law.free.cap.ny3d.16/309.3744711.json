As the Supreme Court and the Appellate Division dissent correctly determined, the decision to deny Madeline Acosta\u2019s application for security clearance was neither arbitrary nor capricious nor an abuse of administrative discretion. <em>(Matter of Arrocha v Board of Educ. of City of N.Y., </em>93 NY2d 361; <em>Matter of Boatman v New York State Dept. of Educ., </em>72 AD3d 1467; <em>Matter of Peckham v Calogero, </em>12 NY3d 424; <em>Matter of Bonacorsa v Van Lindt, </em>71 NY2d 605; <em>Matter of Malverty v Waterfront Commn. of NY.

School Dist., </em>91 NY2d 577; <em>Matter of DaimlerChrysler Corp. v Spitzer, </em>7 NY3d 653.) II. The New York City Department of Education\u2019s denial ignores the legislative history of Correction Law article 23-A, which clearly demonstrates that the Legislature intended to protect individuals such as Ms. Acosta from precisely the type of discrimination in which appellants engaged. <em>(Riley v County of Broome, </em>95 NY2d 455; <em>Rankin v Shanker, </em>23 NY2d 111; <em>People v Finnegan, </em>85 NY2d 53; <em>People v Mower, </em>97 NY2d 239; <em>Matter of Scotto v Dinkins, </em>85 NY2d 209; <em>Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent.

This general bar was enacted to further certain goals that the Legislature has identified as among the \u201cgeneral purposes\u201d of the Penal Law, namely, \u201cthe rehabilitation of those convicted\u201d and \u201cthe promotion of their successful and productive reentry and reintegration into society\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 1.05 [6]). As Governor Hugh L. Carey\u2019s memorandum approving the legislation that codified this general prohibition noted, \u201cthe key to reducing crime is a reduction in recidivism,\u201d and \u201c[t]he great expense and time involved in successfully prosecuting and incarcerating the criminal offender is largely wasted if upon the individual\u2019s return to society his willingness to assume a law-abiding and productive role ifrustrated by senseless discrimination\u201d (Governor\u2019s Approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1976, ch 931, 1976 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2459 [\u201cProviding a former offender a fair opportunity for a job is a matter of basic human fairness, as well as one of the surest ways to reduce crime\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">There are, however, two significant exceptions to this general prohibition. The first exception arises where \u201cthere is a direct relationship between one or more of the previous criminal offenses and the specific license or employment sought or held by the individual\u201d (Correction Law \u00a7 752 [1]). The Legislature has clarified that a \u201c \u2018[d]irect relationship\u2019 means that the nature of criminal conduct for which the person was convicted has a direct bearing on his fitness or ability to perform one or more of the duties or responsibilities necessarily related to the license, opportunity, or job in question\u201d (Correction Law \u00a7 750 [3]). This \u201cdirect relationship\u201d exception is not at issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">It is the Correction Law\u2019s second exception to the general rule barring the adverse treatment of an application for a license or employment based on an applicant\u2019s prior criminal conviction that concerns us here. The second exception allows for the adverse treatment of such applications where \u201cthe issuance or continuation of the license or the granting or continuation of the employment would involve an unreasonable risk to property or to the safety or welfare of specific individuals or the general public\u201d (Correction Law \u00a7 752 [2]). We have previously noted that the Legislature has not provided a statutory definition of the phrase \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d in this context \u201cfor the obvious reason that a finding of unreasonable risk depends upon a subjective analysis of a variety of considerations relating to the nature of the license or employment sought and the prior misconduct\u201d <em>(Matter of Bonacorsa v Van Lindt, </em>71 NY2d 605, 612 [1988]).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Although the \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d analysis under the second exception is a subjective one, section 753 (1) of the Correction Law provides that, \u201c[i]n making a determination\u201d as to whether either the \u201cdirect relationship\u201d exception or the \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d exception applies, \u201cthe public agency or private employer shall consider\u201d the following eight factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">\u201c(a) The public policy of this state, as expressed in this act, to encourage the licensure and employment of persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u201c(b) The specific duties and responsibilities necessarily related to the license or employment sought or held by the person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201c(c) The bearing, if any, the criminal offense or offenses for which the person was previously convicted will have on his fitness or ability to perform one or more such duties or responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201c(d) The time which has elapsed since the occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">\u201c(e) The age of the person at the time of occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201c(f) The seriousness of the offense or offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">\u201c(g) Any information produced by the person, or produced on his behalf, in regard to his rehabilitation and good conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">\u201c(h) The legitimate interest of the public agency or private employer in protecting property, and the safety and welfare of specific individuals or the general public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">A failure to take into consideration each of these factors results in a failure to comply with the Correction Law\u2019s mandatory directive (see <em>Matter of Arrocha v Board of Educ. of City of N.Y., </em>93 NY2d 361, 364 [1999] [\u201cthe Board <em>must </em>consider\u201d (emphasis added) the Correction Law \u00a7 753 (1) factors]).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">When petitioner was 17 years old, she was convicted of the serious crime of first degree robbery. After serving over three years in prison she was granted parole in December 1996. The record reflects that, since then, she has become a productive and law-abiding member of society. She earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in 2001 from the City University of New York (CUNY), and, while working and attending classes at CUNY, volunteered with an organization that provides assistance to inmates in developing skills that will help them reintegrate into society upon being released. After earning her college degree, in addition to starting a family, she worked in positions of responsibility at two law firms.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">Desiring employment that would allow her to spend more time with her family, in 2006 petitioner left her law firm position and took a part-time position at the Cooke Center for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Learning and Development (the Cooke Center). The Cooke Center is a not-for-profit private corporation that provides, among other things, preschool special education services in New York City through a contract with the DOE. The record reflects that petitioner worked four days per week and was engaged primarily in clerical activities with no responsibility for providing any instruction to the Cooke Center\u2019s preschool students.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In August 2006, three months after she started working for the Cooke Center, petitioner\u2019s supervisor asked her to be fingerprinted for DOE security clearance purposes (she had previously disclosed her 1993 conviction to the Cooke Center). The DOE subsequently notified petitioner that, in light of her prior criminal conviction, she would be interviewed at the DOE\u2019s offices on September 28, 2006. At the bottom of the notice petitioner received, in underlined and bold typeface, she was advised that she could \u201csubmit a written personal statement explaining the events and circumstances surrounding your conviction(s) record,\u201d and, \u201c[i]n addition, you may also submit the following: current employment verification (on company letterhead) verifying title/dates of service, references from friends/ neighbors/church and any achievements you have made either before or after your conviction(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">At the interview with the DOE\u2019s investigator, petitioner provided the DOE with two letters of reference from the Cooke Center. She also provided a number of other documents evidencing her education, rehabilitation and volunteer work over the 13 years since her conviction, including her diploma, various certificates of achievement, and various letters of appreciation. Of particular relevance on this appeal, one of the letters of reference from the Cooke Center specified that petitioner was hired, in part, on the basis of \u201cher model references from past employers and colleagues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">At the September 28, 2006 interview, petitioner was advised that three people at the DOE would be reviewing her file, but the investigator she was meeting with that day would be the only one meeting with her in person. He stated that the two other reviewers \u201cdo not have time to review the stack of documents\u201d petitioner submitted because \u201cthey have numerous other files to look at\u201d; thus, he suggested she revise her \u201cpersonal statement to include more information summarizing the documents\u201d she submitted \u201csince they will not be looking at all the documents,\u201d only her personal statement. The interviewer asked no questions concerning the details <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>surrounding her conviction, no questions concerning her former employment at the two law firms, and no questions concerning her job duties at the Cooke Center. Petitioner states that \u201c[t]he whole interview lasted no more than five minutes.\u201d The record contains an affidavit from the investigator who interviewed petitioner, but the only aspect of her description of the interview that he specifically challenges is its length, estimating, in part on the basis of the relevant sign-in sheet, that he met with petitioner for approximately 30 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">By letter dated October 12, 2006, the DOE notified petitioner that her application was denied. The DOE\u2019s letter acknowledged that New York law generally prohibits the denial of employment on the basis of prior criminal convictions, but then referenced the \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d exception to that general prohibition. The letter explained that petitioner\u2019s \u201capplication is denied due to the serious nature of your convictions\u201d because, \u201c[i]n light of these convictions, granting employment will pose an unreasonable risk to the safety and welfare of the school community.\u201d The Cooke Center subsequently terminated petitioner\u2019s employment because, as petitioner acknowledges on this appeal, the Cooke Center\u2019s contractual relationship with the DOE necessitated her termination in the event the DOE denied her application for security clearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">This petition against the DOE and the Cooke Center, among others, followed. Supreme Court dismissed the petition. The Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting, reversed, concluded that the DOE acted arbitrarily in denying petitioner\u2019s application, granted the petition and remanded the matter to Supreme Court to fashion an appropriate remedy (62 AD3d 455 [1st Dept 2009]). The Appellate Division subsequently certified a question to this Court concerning the propriety of its order. We agree with the Appellate Division that the DOE acted arbitrarily in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">It is, of course, improper for courts to \u201cengag[e] in essentially a re-weighing\u201d of the Correction Law \u00a7 753 factors <em>(Arrocha, </em>93 NY2d at 367), but, on this record, it is plain that the DOE failed to consider all of the factors in making its determination as to whether the \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d exception applied to petitioner\u2019s application, rendering its denial of that application arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">We first note that this conclusion is not mandated by the fact that the DOE did not state with specificity its detailed analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>with respect to each of the eight factors in its denial letter to petitioner, as it was not required to do so in the letter notifying her of its decision <em>(but see </em>Correction Law \u00a7 754 [providing that, if requested, a public agency or private employer that denies a person\u2019s application for a license or employment on the basis of that person\u2019s prior criminal conviction \u201cshall provide, within thirty days of a request, a written statement setting forth the reasons for such denial\u201d]). Nor does the DOE\u2019s apparent inability to point to any contemporaneously created record that demonstrates that it considered each of the eight factors in reviewing petitioner\u2019s application necessarily require a finding that the DOE acted arbitrarily, though, of course, such documentation, if it existed, might tend to show that the DOE had fulfilled its obligation under the Correction Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Rather, on this record, the DOE\u2019s own statements demonstrate that it failed to comply with the statute and acted in an arbitrary manner. An affidavit from the DOE\u2019s Director for Employee Relations for the Division of Human Resources, prepared by the DOE in connection with this proceeding, provides \u201cconsiderations and observations\u201d relevant to the DOE\u2019s decision to deny petitioner\u2019s application. Among the considerations listed in this affidavit is that petitioner \u201cdid not provide references from any previous employers.\u201d However, the interview notice petitioner received from the DOE did not state that she should provide references from previous employers, and her interviewer did not ask her to provide those references. Moreover, one of the Cooke Center references that she did provide to the DOE mentioned the \u201cmodel references from past employers\u201d that the Cooke Center had reviewed and relied upon in hiring her. Thus, had the DOE reviewed this reference letter, it would have known that the letters from past employers it now says were missing were not only available but were highly favorable to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This illuminates a larger, more serious issue regarding the DOE\u2019s consideration of petitioner\u2019s application. The Correction Law requires the DOE to \u201cconsider\u201d \u201c[a]ny information produced by the person, or produced on his [or her] behalf, in regard to his [or her] rehabilitation and good conduct\u201d in determining whether the \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d exception applies to an application (Correction Law \u00a7 753 [1] [g]). Yet, on this record, it is plain that, other than her personal statement, the DOE did not consider the documentation that petitioner submitted in support of her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The arbitrary nature of the DOE\u2019s action here becomes even more evident given the \u201cgeneral policy\u201d the DOE Director\u2019s affidavit states that the DOE follows with respect to first-time applicants. The Director\u2019s affidavit notes that this application was petitioner\u2019s \u201cfirst application for security clearance from the DOE,\u201d and, as a matter of \u201cgeneral policy, the DOE takes a closer review of first-time applicants with criminal histories who have not worked with children in order to emphasize to the applicant that the DOE takes the safety and welfare of its students very seriously.\u201d We have no doubt that the DOE takes the safety and welfare of the entire school community very seriously, and its efforts in that regard are laudable. However, in light of the DOE\u2019s failure to comply with the statutorily mandated minimum requirement of reviewing all of the documentation petitioner submitted <em>(see e.g. </em>Correction Law \u00a7 753 [1] [g]), it is difficult to conclude on this record that the \u201ccloser review\u201d purportedly applied here amounted to anything more than a pro forma denial of petitioner\u2019s application on the basis of her prior criminal conviction. Such a denial, without consideration of each of the Correction Law \u00a7 753 factors, is precisely what the statute prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The Legislature has determined that, as a general rule, it is unlawful for a public or private employer to deny an application for a license or employment on the ground that the applicant was previously convicted of a crime. This general prohibition advances the rehabilitation and reintegration goals of the Penal Law. Furthermore, barring discrimination against those who have paid their debt to society and facilitating their efforts to obtain gainful employment benefits the community as a whole. The \u201cdirect relationship\u201d exception and the \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d exception to this general rule may be resorted to only upon a consideration of each of the eight factors enumerated in Correction Law \u00a7 753 <em>(see Arrocha, </em>93 NY2d at 364).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Finally, we note that petitioner does not dispute that, in light of the Cooke Center\u2019s contract with the DOE, the DOE\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s application for security clearance obligated the Cooke Center to terminate her employment. The Cooke Center\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition as against it, therefore, should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, by granting the motion of Cooke Center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>for Learning and Development to dismiss the petition against it, and, as so modified, affirmed. The certified question should be answered in the negative.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b381-4\">Smith, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Aiu\">It is easy to sympathize with this petitioner, and to be dismayed by the decision of the Department of Education (DOE) to deny her security clearance. From what we know, petitioner\u2019s achievement in overcoming her very troubled youth is impressive, and could be inspiring to others. But I would not give in to the temptation to second-guess the DOE, which has the duty to protect not only the public\u2019s money and property, but also the children committed to its charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The question for the DOE\u2014not the courts\u2014to decide was whether granting petitioner a security clearance \u201cwould involve an unreasonable risk to property or to the safety or welfare of specific individuals or the general public\u201d (Correction Law \u00a7 752 [2]). Considering the interests at stake, the DOE could reasonably believe that anything more than a very small risk would be \u201cunreasonable,\u201d and that there might be more than a very small risk here. In 1993, petitioner was arrested on two separate occasions, and charged with crimes including two first degree robberies involving the use or threatened immediate use of a dangerous instrument (Penal Law \u00a7 160.15 [3]). She pleaded guilty and received a sentence of 4 to 12 years. She was paroled in 1997 and discharged from parole in 2000. These events were history, but not ancient history, when she applied for a security clearance in 2006. The DOE could have reasonably wanted to know more about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Petitioner chose to tell them very little. Invited to \u201csubmit a written personal statement explaining the events and circumstances surrounding your conviction(s) record,\u201d she responded, and later expanded her response. This is all that her expanded statement says about the crimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201cI was 17 years old at the time of my incarceration. Before my incarceration I attended school full time. I was a senior at John Jay High School when I became involved in an abusive relationship. He was physically abusive and he forced me to participate in the robberies he wanted to commit and at the time I thought for my own safety I would go along with it. We were not arrested committing a crime. I was on my way home from school when I attempted to board the train with train pass that had someone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>else\u2019s name on it. The officer at the station requested for me to produce identification to match the train pass. I didn\u2019t have identification. The officer ran a check on the name and found out it was reported stolen. We were both arrested. I soon severed all ties with him. I take responsibility for my part and honestly feel remorseful for allowing for those things to happen in my presence. I was sentenced to 4-12 years. He was sentenced to 6-18 years because he was accused of having a weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Among the facts petitioner did not disclose is how many robberies there were; what weapon was used; what was done to intimidate the victims; and what petitioner did to help. Reading petitioner\u2019s statement, one cannot learn why a judge thought that she deserved a 4-to-12-year sentence. I can hardly blame petitioner for not wanting to dwell on these very unpleasant details; but I also cannot blame the DOE for deciding that it should not give petitioner clearance without knowing more than it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">It seems to me that, despite its disclaimer, the majority has done what it acknowledges courts should not do: It has reweighed the relevant factors, and decided that it disagrees with the DOE\u2019s evaluation of them. The majority quibbles with the DOE over a minor point\u2014whether the absence of references from previous employers is significant, where petitioner was apparently able to provide such references at an earlier time (majority op at 319). Stretching to find a \u201clarger, more serious issue,\u201d the majority asserts that the DOE\u2019s procedure was flawed because it failed to \u201cconsider the documentation that petitioner submitted in support of her application\u201d (majority op at 319). I find it extremely hard to believe that either the DOE\u2019s decision or the majority\u2019s here would be different if a DOE employee had turned over every page of the considerable stack of certificates of recognition <em>that </em>petitioner submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">It seems obvious that the majority\u2019s real difference with the DOE is substantive, and not procedural\u2014the majority thinks the DOE made a mistake. Perhaps it did, but it did not act so arbitrarily that we are justified in annulling its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Pigott and Jones concur with Chief Judge Lippman; Judge Smith dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Read concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
