Plaintiffs have properly pleaded a wrongful birth cause of action and the existence of sources of compensation pursuant to applicable government programs for their damages recoverable for its successful prosecution does not, as a matter of law, require its dismissal. <em>(Becker v Schwartz, </em>46 NY2d 401; <em>Park v Chessin, </em>46 NY2d 401; <em>Bani-Esraili v Lerman, </em>69 NY2d 807; <em>Miller v Rivard, </em>180 AD2d 331; <em>Alquijay v St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt Hosp.

Assuming, arguendo, that plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action for their extraordinary expenses may be dismissed if the pertinent government programs available for their child\u2019s medically necessary extraordinary care and treatment will fund this care and treatment, defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions must be denied as defendants\u2019 proof failed to establish, as it must, that these programs will in fact completely fund such care and treatment; or, alternatively, plaintiffs\u2019 proof sufficed to raise a triable issue of fact that their child\u2019s medically necessary care and treatment would not be entirely funded by these programs. <em>(Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., </em>68 NY2d 320; <em>Winegrad v New York Univ.

After the child\u2019s birth, plaintiffs commenced this medical malpractice \u201cwrongful birth\u201d action <em>(see Becker v Schwartz, </em>46 NY2d 401, 409 [1978]) against numerous medical providers who allegedly failed to detect and/or failed to inform them of the abnormal cerebellar development of the fetus. Plaintiffs allege that steps would have been taken to terminate the pregnancy had they been properly informed. They seek damages for the extraordinary expenses involved in caring for their severely disabled child, including medical treatment and supplies, surgical treatment, physical therapy, vision therapy, occupational therapy, a home health aide, and special educational services.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, submitting expert affidavits stating that the extraordinary expenses necessary for the child\u2019s care have been and will continue to be completely covered by certain enumerated governmental programs. In opposition to defendants\u2019 motion, plaintiffs submitted the affirmation of Dr. Joseph Carfi, M.D., who prepared a \u201clife care plan\u201d and report detailing the care required for the child. According to Dr. Carfi, the government programs referenced by defendants\u2019 experts provided only a \u201cminimum level of services\u201d so as to create a \u201cbasic floor of opportunity.\u201d Dr. Carfi also took the position that \u201coptimal care\u201d for the child required more services than those provided by government programs and, as a result, plaintiffs had or would be forced to bear out-of-pocket expenses related to the child\u2019s special medical and educational needs. Supreme Court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, concluding that plaintiffs had failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether they had or would incur extraordinary expenses in providing for the medical and educational care of their son (19 Misc 3d 1142[A], 2008 NY Slip Op 51138[U]).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">On plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the Appellate Division unanimously reversed <em>(see Foote v Albany Med. Ctr. Hosp., </em>71 AD3d 25 [3d Dept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>2009]). Although it agreed that most of plaintiffs\u2019 expenses in caring for the child had been and would continue to be covered under government programs, the Appellate Division concluded that the aid received by plaintiffs for such programs would, under the statutory collateral source rule, merely serve to offset any award of damages made after trial <em>(see id. </em>at 28). The Appellate Division also concluded that Dr. Carfi\u2019s \u201caffirmation, report and life-care plan, which distinguish between the \u2018basic floor\u2019 of services provided by public education and the level necessary to meet all of the son\u2019s needs, [were] sufficient to raise a question of fact\u201d for trial <em>(id.). </em>Because Supreme Court had not considered defendants\u2019 alternative basis for summary judgment\u2014that plaintiffs could not establish a deviation from the applicable standard of medical care\u2014the Appellate Division remitted for consideration of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The Appellate Division granted defendants leave to appeal and certified a question inquiring whether it erred, \u201cas a matter of law, in reversing . . . the order of the Supreme Court. . . and remitting the matter to Supreme Court for further proceedings.\u201d We now affirm and answer the certified question in th\u00e9 negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In <em>Bani-Esraili v Lerman </em>(69 NY2d 807 [1987]), we explained that, in a \u201cwrongful birth\u201d action, the parents\u2019 \u201clegally cognizable injury\u201d is \u201cthe increased financial obligation arising from the extraordinary medical treatment rendered the child during minority\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 808; <em>see also Alquijay v St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt Hosp. Ctr., </em>63 NY2d 978, 979 [1984]; <em>Becker, </em>46 NY2d at 413). Here, the Appellate Division properly concluded that defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment should have been denied. Dr. Carfi\u2019s life care plan, report and affirmation are sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a triable factual issue whether plaintiffs have or will incur extraordinary financial obligations relating to the care of their son. In particular, a question of fact exists whether there is a difference between the resources provided by government programs and the extraordinary medical and other treatment or services necessary for the child during minority. We thus agree with the Appellate Division that \u201c[t]he existence of government programs . . . will not, as a matter of law, eliminate plaintiffs\u2019 financial obligation for their son\u2019s extraordinary medical and educational expenses\u201d <em>(Foote, </em>71 AD3d at 29 [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In light of our conclusion, we need not reach and express no opinion about the additional ground for denial of the motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>summary judgment, set forth by the Appellate Division, that, pursuant to the statutory collateral source rule <em>(see </em>CPLR 4545 [a]), \u201cthe availability of another source of compensation does not obviate\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 injury but, instead, can only offset any damages awarded after trial <em>(Foote, </em>71 AD3d at 28). That issue, along with issues pertaining to liens, if any, and the underlying medical malpractice issues remain open for consideration by Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
