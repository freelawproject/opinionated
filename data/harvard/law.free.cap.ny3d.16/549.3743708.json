The District Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Mohawk Maintenance Co. v Kessler </em>(52 NY2d 276 [1981]) is sound as a matter of New York law and public policy. <em>(Von Bremen v MacMonnies, </em>200 NY 41; <em>511 W. 232nd Owners Corp. v Jennifer Realty Co., </em>98 NY2d 144; <em>Matter of Co-operative Law Co., </em>198 NY 479.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b611-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b611-7\">Ciparick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has certified the following question for our consideration: \u201cWhat degree of participation in a new employer\u2019s solicitation of a former employer\u2019s client by a voluntary seller of that client\u2019s good will constitutes improper solicitation?\u201d <em>(Bessemer Trust Co., N.A. v Branin, </em>618 F3d 76, 94 [2d Cir 2010].)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Specifically, the Second Circuit seeks our guidance on whether the following two sets of actions, taken together, make out \u201cimproper solicitation\u201d under New York law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">\u201c(1) the active development and participation by the seller, in response to inquiries from a former client whose good will the seller has voluntarily sold to a third party, in a plan whereby others at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>seller\u2019s new company solicit a client, and (2) participation by the seller in solicitation meetings where the seller\u2019s role is largely passive.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Plaintiff Bessemer Trust Company, N.A. (Bessemer) is a privately owned wealth management and investment advisory firm headquartered in New York City. Founded in 1907, Bessemer provides services to high net worth individuals, families, and institutional clients. Defendant Francis S. Branin, Jr. is an investment portfolio manager. In 1977, Branin joined the New York City based investment management firm Brundage, Story &amp; Rose, LLC (Brundage) where he too advised high net worth clients. Branin became a principal at Brundage in 1982 and served as its chief executive officer from 1996 through October 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">By purchase agreement dated August 18, 2000 (the Purchase Agreement), the shareholders of Brundage agreed to sell the assets of their firm, including Brundage\u2019s client accounts and related good will, to Bessemer for more than $75 million. Bessemer acquired these assets in October 2000 and Branin, along with the seven other Brundage principals, began to work at Bessemer at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The Purchase Agreement imposed no express restrictive covenants on the Brundage principals. They were at-will employees of Bessemer with no ownership interest in the newly formed firm. The Purchase Agreement further provided that only $50 million of the purchase price was payable up front. Branin, the largest Brundage shareholder, received more than $9.1 million of this amount. The remainder of the purchase price was conditional. If the Brundage principals were able to achieve certain thresholds related to client retention, revenue enhancement, and reduction of expenses, they were eligible to receive the remainder of the purchase price in four subsequent installments. In September 2001 and in April 2002, the Brundage principals, having met designated benchmarks, qualified for the first two contingency payments. In total, Branin received over $15 million for the sale of his interest in Brundage between October 2000 and April 2002. Branin and the rest of the Brundage principals were ineligible for the remaining two contingency payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Branin soon became unhappy with his role at Bessemer. He disliked the fact that Bessemer management had reduced his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>responsibilities and excluded him from key management meetings. As a result, Branin started to explore different opportunities. To that end, from November 2001 to June 2002, Branin periodically met with William Rankin, the president and chief executive officer of Stein Roe Investment Counsel LLC (Stein Roe), a wealth management firm, to discuss the possibility of his employment. The two discussed Branin\u2019s desired level of compensation and how such compensation would be structured. Rankin was aware that Bessemer had recently acquired Brundage and understood from these conversations that if Branin were to join Stein Roe, he could not actively solicit his clients to transfer their accounts from Bessemer to Stein Roe.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">By late May or early June, Branin had made the decision to join Stein Roe. On July 12, 2002\u2014less than two years after Bessemer acquired Brundage\u2014Branin resigned from Bessemer. Ten days later, by letter dated July 22, 2002, Stein Roe formally offered Branin the position of senior vice-president and principal. Branin commenced his employment with Stein Roe on July 29, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Branin did not notify his existing clients about his decision to resign from Bessemer and join Stein Roe. Bessemer instructed Branin to prepare a list of his clients with the pertinent account holder information so that Bessemer could transition these accounts to other investment advisors at the firm. Branin complied with this directive. Shortly after reviewing the list of Branin\u2019s accounts, Bessemer mailed letters to Branin\u2019s clients, informing them that Branin was \u201cleaving Bessemer to pursue other career opportunities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Once Branin joined Stein Roe, some of his former Bessemer clients contacted him. Many of these clients asked Branin why he had left Bessemer. Branin\u2019s standard response to these inquiries was \u201ca firm like Stein Roe was far more appropriate for me, . . . that the method of dealing with clients, that the approach whereby portfolio managers managed the client portfolios and interacted directly with the clients was more . . . appropriate for my training and experience of 30 years in the business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Several of Branin\u2019s clients elected to transfer their accounts to Stein Roe in the ensuing months. As relevant to this appeal, the Palmer family, Branin\u2019s largest client at Bessemer, were among those who had followed Branin to Stein Roe. The Palmer family first developed a relationship with Branin at Brundage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>in the 1980s, where Branin served as the junior investment advisor on the account. Eventually, Branin was elevated to lead advisor on the account and he and the head of the Palmer family, Carleton Palmer III (Palmer), had become friends. Despite this friendship, Branin refrained from informing Palmer of his decision to work at Stein Roe. The Palmer family first learned that Branin had left Bessemer when Paul Barkus, a Bessemer employee, telephoned Palmer\u2019s brother. Indeed, Barkus specifically advised Palmer\u2019s brother that Branin was not permitted to contact them; Barkus informed Palmer\u2019s brother that Branin had accepted an offer with a different firm, but did not disclose that it was Stein Roe.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The news that Branin was no longer with Bessemer alarmed the Palmer family. Although Palmer knew Barkus, his primary and virtually exclusive contact at Bessemer was Branin. Palmer immediately called Branin at his home. During this conversation, Branin disclosed that he had joined Stein Roe and, on the advice of counsel, was told not to solicit his Bessemer clients. At the conclusion of the telephone call, Palmer indicated that his family would need time to consider their options and hinted that they \u201cwould more than likely solicit or investigate both firms,\u201d meaning Stein Roe and Bessemer.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">As a follow-up, Palmer sent Branin a letter, dated July 31, 2002, seeking to organize a \u201cpreliminary meeting\u201d in order to discuss how their accounts \u201cwould be handled within your new organization.\u201d Palmer also sought information on \u201cthe background of the organization and the continuity of account management that could be provided.\u201d The Palmer family and Stein Roe agreed to meet in New York on August 29, 2002. The Palmer family similarly arranged a meeting with Bessemer on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Once Branin received Palmer\u2019s letter, he requested president Rankin\u2019s guidance in determining who should represent Stein Roe in the upcoming meeting with the Palmer family. Rankin referred Branin to the appropriate personnel and Branin facilitated a strategy session with them one week prior to Stein Roe\u2019s presentation to the Palmers. During this session, Branin described the Palmer family\u2019s investment philosophy and other background information related to this long-standing client. On the day of the Stein Roe meeting, Branin was present. He introduced the Palmer family to Rankin and the other participating Stein Roe executives. From there, Palmer conducted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>meeting, directing questions toward the Stein Roe representatives. Branin essentially played no role in this meeting and would only \u201coccasionally amplify a point\u201d that the others were making. Palmer did not inquire about the fee structure at Stein Roe.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">After his meetings with both Stein Roe and Bessemer, Palmer\u2019s instinct was to transfer the family\u2019s accounts to Stein Roe. Since Palmer\u2019s first meeting with Stein Roe, however, was introductory in nature, Palmer wanted a formal proposal from Branin. Palmer invited Branin to his home state of Ohio to discuss the specifics. Branin obliged and traveled to Ohio on September 16, 2002. Branin explained that he would be the lead investment advisor on the account and that Stein Roe\u2019s president would serve as the backup advisor to the account. Branin also confirmed that Stein Roe would charge the same fees that Bessemer was currently charging the Palmer family. The following day, the Palmer family moved their accounts to Stein Roe.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">On November 22, 2002, after a number of Branin\u2019s clients left Bessemer for Stein Roe, Bessemer commenced this action in Supreme Court. Bessemer, in relevant part, alleged that Branin had breached his duty of loyalty to Bessemer under the theory that Branin improperly solicited his former clients to join him at Stein Roe, thereby impairing the good will that Branin had sold to Bessemer in connection with Bessemer\u2019s acquisition of Brundage. Branin removed the case to federal District Court on diversity grounds and filed a number of counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Once the parties completed pretrial discovery, they each brought a motion for summary judgment. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York denied the motions. With the consent of the parties, District Court conducted a bench trial solely as to Branin\u2019s liability on Bessemer\u2019s claims. By order dated April 10, 2006, District Court found that Branin \u201cimproperly induced the Palmer account to leave Bessemer and that this inducement in fact caused the Palmer account to leave Bessemer and join Stein Roe\u201d in violation of New York law <em>(Bessemer Trust Co., N.A. v Branin, </em>427 F Supp 2d 386, 393 [SD NY 2006]). With respect to the other accounts that transferred from Bessemer to Stein Roe, however, District Court found that Bessemer did not meet its burden of proving that Branin had violated New York law <em>(see id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Following the bench trial on the question of liability, Bessemer moved for summary judgment on Branin\u2019s counterclaims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>which District Court granted <em>(Bessemer Trust Co., N.A. v Branin, </em>498 F Supp 2d 632 [SD NY 2007]). Thereafter, the parties proceeded to trial on the issue of damages. District Court conducted a second bench trial and awarded Bessemer over $1.2 million in damages and prejudgment interest <em>(see Bessemer Trust Co., N.A. v Branin, </em>544 F Supp 2d 385, 393 [SD NY 2008]).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The parties appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. As relevant to the issue before us, Bran-in appealed District Court\u2019s liability determination with respect to the Palmer account.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As noted earlier, the Second Circuit certified a question to our Court, seeking guidance \u201cin determining what actions [under New York law] constitute improper solicitation\u201d <em>(Bessemer Trust Co., </em>618 F3d at 87 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Under New York common law, a seller has an \u201cimplied covenant\u201d or \u201cduty to refrain from soliciting former customers, which arises upon the sale of the \u2018good will\u2019 of an established business\u201d <em>(Mohawk Maintenance Co. v Kessler, </em>52 NY2d 276, 283 [1981]). We first adopted this rule, which derives from English common law, in <em>Von Bremen v MacMonnies </em>(200 NY 41 [1910]). The rationale underlying the rule is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">\u201c \u2018[a] man may not derogate from his own grant; the vendor is not at liberty to destroy or depreciate the thing which he has sold; there is an implied covenant, on the sale of good will, that the vendor does not solicit the custom which he has parted with; it would be a fraud on the contract to do so. . . . It is not right to profess and to purport to sell that which you do not mean the purchaser to have; it is not an honest thing to pocket the price and then to recapture the subject of sale; to decoy it away or call it back before the purchaser has had time to attach it to himself and make it his very own\u2019 \u201d <em>(Von Bremen, </em>200 NY at 50-51, quoting <em>Trego v Hunt, </em>[1896] AC 7, 25; <em>see also Mohawk, </em>52 NY2d at 286; <em>Bessemer Trust Co., </em>618 F3d at 86).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>A seller\u2019s \u201cimplied covenant\u201d not to solicit his former customers is \u201ca permanent one that is not subject to divestiture upon the passage of a reasonable period of time\u201d <em>(Mohawk, </em>52 NY2d at 285). Indeed, we have recognized that upon the sale of \u201cgood will,\u201d a \u201cpurchaser acquires the right to expect that the firm\u2019s established customers will continue to patronize the business\u201d <em>(id., </em>citing <em>People ex rel. Johnson Co. v Roberts, </em>159 NY 70, 80-84 [1899]). This is so because \u201c[t]he essence of [these types of] transaction[s] is, in effect, an attempt to transfer the loyalties of the business\u2019 customers from the seller, who cultivated and created them, to the new proprietor\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Notwithstanding this \u201cimplied covenant,\u201d a buyer assumes certain risks when he purchases an existing business and attempts to transfer the loyalties or \u201cgood will\u201d of that business as his own. For example, the customers of the acquired business, \u201cas a consequence of the change in ownership,\u201d may choose to take their patronage elsewhere <em>(id.). </em>Indeed, \u201cthe occurrence of a certain amount of attrition is one of the risks that the purchaser must assume when he acquires an established business\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Moreover, the seller of a business is free to subsequently compete with the purchaser and even \u201caccept[ ] the trade of his former customers, provided that he does not <em>actively </em>solicit such trade\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 285 n 6 [emphasis added]). To militate against these risks, which extend beyond the limited scope of a seller\u2019s \u201cimplied covenant,\u201d a purchaser is free to negotiate an express covenant, reasonably restricting, for instance, a \u201cseller\u2019s right to compete in a particular geographical area or field of endeavor\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 284).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">There is no hard and fast rule in determining whether a seller of \u201cgood will\u201d has improperly solicited his former clients, and we decline to create one here. Rather, in making this assessment on a case-by-case basis, the trier of fact must consider the principles underlying the rule in <em>Mohawk </em>and the factors involved within the relevant industry that may impair the \u201cgood will\u201d conveyed by the original seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">A trier of fact ought to consider whether, following the sale of a business and its good will, a seller initiated contact with his former customers or clients. Such initiation is particularly relevant where a seller, like Branin, remains in the industry. On this point, Branin has conceded that such contact would impair the \u201cgood will\u201d acquired by a bona fide purchaser. We agree. The \u201cimplied covenant\u201d not to solicit former customers bars a seller from taking affirmative steps to directly communicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>with them <em>(see e.g. Hyde Park Prods. Corp. v Lerner Corp., </em>65 NY2d 316, 321 [1985] [deliberate solicitation of seller\u2019s former customers \u201cbreached the duty against impairment of the goodwill transferred as part of the sale of the business\u201d]). A seller may not, for example, send targeted mailings or make individualized telephone calls to his former customers informing them of his new business ventures. These examples are illustrative, not exhaustive, of the types of purposeful communications with former customers that the \u201cimplied covenant\u201d proscribes. On the other hand, absent an express or restrictive covenant not to compete, a seller of \u201cgood will\u201d who lawfully competes with a purchaser may advertise to the public. So long as such advertisement is general in nature\u2014and not specifically aimed at the seller\u2019s former customers\u2014it is permissible under New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">A seller, of course, is not free to tout his new business venture simply because a former client has fortuitously communicated with him first. Such a rule would contravene our holdings in <em>Von Bremen </em>and <em>Mohawk </em>and lead to inconsistent results. Nonetheless, not all discussions between a seller and former client are impermissible. While the \u201cimplied covenant\u201d places certain barriers on a seller\u2019s conduct, it in no way prohibits a former customer or client from gathering information about that seller. In the free market, consumers of goods and services have the right to make informed choices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issue we must resolve is to what extent a seller of \u201cgood will\u201d may respond to the various inquiries of a former client.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In the context of the financial services industry, as in this case, a former client, contemplating the transfer of his business from the purchaser back to the seller, will invariably conduct due diligence and seek factual information pertaining to topics such as investment strategy, resources available to the seller, personnel, and fee structure. Given the competitive nature and the complexity of the financial services sector, these types of questions are entirely appropriate and, indeed, expected, especially in a case such as this where the Palmer family placed a great deal of personal trust in Branin <em>(see generally SEC v Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., </em>375 US 180, 189-190 [1963]). Thus, a seller of \u201cgood will\u201d may answer the factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>inquiries of a former client, so long as such responses do not go beyond the scope of the specific information sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Nevertheless, the \u201cimplied covenant\u201d places some limitations on a seller\u2019s right to answer all the questions posed by a former client. A seller of \u201cgood will\u201d engages in improper solicitation when, even if prompted, he disparages the purchaser of his business. In relinquishing the \u201cgood will\u201d of his business to a purchaser, a seller loses his right to explain, for example, why he believes his products or services are superior. This rule comports with the purpose of the \u201cimplied covenant,\u201d which precludes a seller from \u201cdestroying] or depreciating] the thing which he has sold\u201d <em>(Von Bremen, </em>200 NY at 51 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Our discussion applies with equal force to the seller of \u201cgood will\u201d who subsequently establishes a new business as a solo practitioner or joins a competing firm <em>(see Bessemer Trust Co., </em>618 F3d at 89 n 5). In this case, Branin opted to join Stein Roe, a firm that competes with Bessemer. The issue in which the Second Circuit seeks our guidance is to what degree a seller may assist his new employer in responding to inquiries made by a former client. Since the seller of \u201cgood will,\u201d absent a restrictive covenant, may compete with a purchaser, we conclude that certain activity within a new employer\u2019s firm must be permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">A seller of \u201cgood will,\u201d for example, is free to convey certain information about his former client to his new employer. In the context of the financial services industry, appropriate topics may include items such as a former client\u2019s investment preferences, financial goals, and tolerance of risk; it may not include information that is proprietary to a purchaser of \u201cgood will.\u201d A seller may also aid his new employer in preparing for a \u201csales pitch\u201d meeting requested by a former client and may be present when such meeting takes place, although the \u201cimplied covenant\u201d imposes some restrictions on the seller\u2019s level of involvement during such a meeting. So long as a seller\u2019s role is limited to responses to factual matters, his participation in such a meeting will not violate the \u201cimplied covenant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">In answering the certified question, we continue to apply our precedents in <em>Von Bremen </em>and <em>Mohawk </em>and hold that the \u201cimplied covenant\u201d bars a seller of \u201cgood will\u201d from improperly soliciting his former clients. We conclude that, while a seller may not contact his former clients directly, he may, \u201cin response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>to inquiries\u201d made on a former client\u2019s own initiative, answer factual questions. Furthermore, under the circumstances where a client exercising due diligence requests further information, a seller may assist his new employer in the \u201cactive development . . . [of] a plan\u201d to respond to that client\u2019s inquiries. Should that plan result in a meeting with a client, a seller\u2019s \u201clargely passive\u201d role at such meeting does not constitute improper solicitation in violation of the \u201cimplied covenant.\u201d As such, a seller or his new employer may then accept the trade of a former client.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Accordingly, the certified question should be answered in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Following certification of a question by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the question by this Court pursuant to section 500.27 of the Rules of Practice of the New York State Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.27), and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and consideration of the briefs and the record submitted, certified question answered in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-10\">. Branin also appealed District Court\u2019s award of damages and the court\u2019s dismissal of his counterclaims against Bessemer. Bessemer appealed District Court\u2019s calculation of damages. In light of its certified question to our Court, the Second Circuit reserved its decision on District Court\u2019s award of damages <em>(see Bessemer Trust Co., </em>618 F3d at 91).
