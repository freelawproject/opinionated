We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Defendant asserts, and the state concedes, that the trial court erred by entering misdemeanor convictions and sentencing her as a misdemeanant on four counts, on the ground that the underlying charges were for violations, as a matter of law, because the district attorney failed to satisfy the requirements of ORS 161.565(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State v.

Franks, </em>143 Or App 384, 386-87, 923 P2d 1302, <em>rev den </em>324 Or 488 (1996).

It follows that a sentence for an offense other than that with which the accused was charged is unauthorized and therefore void. The district attorney failed to make the required declaration under ORS 161.565(2), and, by operation of the statute, counts two through five became violations. <em>Bonnin, </em>144 Or App at 268-69. That is so notwithstanding the fact that the trial court neglected to amend the indictment to that effect. <em>Id. </em>at 267 n 1. As a matter of law, then, defendant was charged with four violations, and the trial court erred by imposing sentences on those four counts in excess of that authorized by ORS 161.565. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the judgment of conviction on counts two through five.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Judgment of conviction on count one affirmed; judgment of conviction on counts two through five reversed and remanded for entry of judgment as violations; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\"> The charges in question are two counts of recklessly endangering another person, ORS 163.195, and one count each of criminal mischief II, ORS 164.354, and failure to perform the duties of a driver when property is damaged, ORS 811.700.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\"> ORS 161.565(2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">\u201cUpon the date scheduled for the first appearance of the defendant upon any misdemeanor charge, other than a misdemeanor created under ORS 811.540 and 813.010, the district attorney first shall declare on the record the intention whether or not to treat the offense in the case as a violation. The case shall proceed as a violation unless the district attorney affirmatively states that the case shall proceed as a misdemeanor. If the case proceeds as a violation, the accusatory instrument shall be amended to denominate as a violation the offense in the case, and the offense, for purposes of the case, shall thereafter be treated as a violation subject to a fine as provided in ORS 161.635 for violations. * * * If the offense is denominated a violation pursuant to this subsection, the court shall, when it enters judgment in the case, clearly denominate the offense as a violation in the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
