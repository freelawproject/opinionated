During the <em>voir dire </em>conducted pursuant to FED. R. CR. P. 11, the Defendant was advised by his counsel and subsequently insisted that the maximum sentence for 19 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A), trafficking marijuana, was five (5) years. The Government agreed with defense\u2019s position. In support of his position, Defendant relied heavily on the provisions set forth at 14 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 3(a)(1). Because \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A) only provides for a mandatory minimum sentence, the Court took the matter under advisement, required counsel to submit briefs and continued the matter <em>sine die. </em>For reasons that follow, the Court finds that the maximum sentence for violation of 19 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A) may exceed five (5) years and in fact be an indefinite number of years. Thus, the change of plea must be rejected unless the Defendant knowingly and voluntarily acknowledges what the maximum sentence is for trafficking marijuana, as ruled by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">On January 22, 2003, the Government filed a two (2) count Information against the Defendant, Lester DeCastro, charging the Defendant, in Count I, with aiding and abetting, in connection with trafficking cocaine, in violation of 19 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 614a(a)(3)(C) and 14 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 11; and in Count II, with aiding and abetting, in connection with trafficking marijuana, in violation of 19 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A) and 14 V.I.C. \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">On September 26, 2003, a Change of Plea hearing was held, during which time the parties notified the Court that the Defendant had accepted an \u201copen\u201d plea offer made by the Government. Under the terms of the plea agreement, the Defendant would plead guilty to Count II of the Information, which charged him with aiding and abetting, in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>with trafficking marijuana, in violation of 19 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A) and 14 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 11. Thereafter, in accordance with FED. R. Cr. P. 11, the Court asked the Defendant, <em>inter alia, </em>what was the maximum sentence the Court could impose for Count II. The Defendant, through advice of counsel,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> indicated that the maximum sentence was five (5) years incarceration and a Twenty-Five Thousand Dollar and 00/100 ($25,000.00) mandatory fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Title 19 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u201cAny person who knowingly sells, manufactures, delivers, or brings, into this Territory, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession of, in excess of 50 pounds of marijuana is guilty of a felony which shall be known as trafficking in marijuana. If the quantity involved is excess of 50 pounds, but less than 200 pounds, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 3 calendar years and to pay a fine of $25,000.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The Defendant contended and the Government agreed that 14 V.I. CODE ANN. 3(a)(1) limits the Court to imposing a period of incarceration not exceeding five (5) years. Section 3(a)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">\u201cielxcept in cases where a different punishment is prescribed by law, every crime or offense declared to be a felony is punishable by imprisonment not exceeding five years.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">After entertaining argument regarding Defendant\u2019s contention, the Court aborted the change of plea hearing, required the parties to file briefs supporting their contention and continued the matter <em>sine die.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">The issues before the court for resolution are: (1) whether 14 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 3(a)(1) is applicable to 19 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A); (2) whether the Court is otherwise limited in its discretion in determining an appropriate maximum term of imprisonment for violation of 19 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A); and (3) whether the case upon which Defendant relies, to wit: <em>United States v. Bruney, </em>30 V.I. 360, 866 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Supp. 874, (D. V.I. 1994), is distinguishable from the facts presented herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\">A. 14 V.I. Code Ann. \u00a7 3(a)(1) is Inapplicable To 19 V.I. Code Ann. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">The Defendant contends and the Government agrees that 14 V.I. Code Ann. \u00a7 3(a)(1) applies to 19 V.I. Code Ann. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A) and thereby limits the Court to imposing a period of incarceration not to exceed five (5) years. Title 14 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 3(a)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">\u201cje]xcept in cases where a different punishment is prescribed by law, every crime or offense declared to be a felony is punishable by imprisonment not exceeding five years.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Excluded from its application are crimes for which a punishment is already prescribed. Reliance therefore on 14 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 3(a)(1) is misplaced because that provision is only applicable when neither a maximum nor a minimum sentence is provided or the penalty provision is rendered void for vagueness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since a minimum penalty is provided for violation of 19 V.I. Code Ann. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A), 14 V.I. Code Ann. \u00a7 3(a)(1) is not applicable. <em>See Government of the Virgin Islands v. Foster, </em>734 F. Supp. 210 (D.C.V.I. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">B. Although V.I. Code Ann. Tit. 19, \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A) Recites Only the Mandatory Minimum Penalties For Its Violation, The Court Has Broad Discretion In Determining A Maximum Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Analogous to the provisions of 19 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A), is 19 VI. CODE Ann. \u00a7 614a(a)(3)(C),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which governs trafficking cocaine. The latter provision has been interpreted by the District Court of the Virgin Islands in <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Foster, </em>734 F. Supp. 210 (D.C.V.I. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>In <em>Foster, </em>the Defendant was convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>trafficking cocaine in violation of 19 V.I. CODE \u00a7 614a(a)(3)(C) and possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1). There, the issue decided was whether the two offenses were sufficiently distinct to allow the Defendant to be sentenced under both the Virgin Islands and the United States criminal code without violating the constitutional prohibition of double jeopardy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In <em>Foster, </em>the court determined that for the purposes of sentencing, the offenses for which the Defendant was convicted were the same offense. By imposing a general sentence under both offenses, giving due consideration for the sentencing structure established by the Virgin Islands Code, the double jeopardy clause was not offended. To that end, the court held that the general sentence imposed could not exceed the maximum permissible sentence on the offense that carries the greater maximum sentence. <em>Foster, </em>734 F. Supp. at 214; <em>see also Government of the Virgin Islands v. Brathwaite, </em>782 F.2d 399, 406-407 (3d Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Out of necessity, the <em>Foster </em>court had to establish what the maximum permissible sentence for each offense was under both the Virgin Islands criminal code and the United States criminal code. Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), the federal offense, the Court determined that the maximum sentence was twenty (20) years imprisonment, but under 19 V.I.C. \u00a7 614a(a)(3)(C), the territorial offense, the court\u2019s discretion appeared unlimited. Although the Virgin Islands code prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>provisions of \u00a7 614a(a)(3)(C) were conspicuously silent as to a maximum penalty. <em>Foster, </em>734 F. Supp. at 214. To that end, the court held that indeed, it appears the Legislature of the Virgin Islands, did not intend to limit a judge\u2019s authority to sentence under the section, except to the extent that it provided for a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. <em>Foster, </em>734 F. Supp. at 214 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\">Applying the holding in <em>Foster, </em>to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the conclusion this Court must reach is inescapable. The Legislature has established only a mandatory minimum sentence of three (3) years incarceration and a Twenty-Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollar ($25,000.00) fine, but no maximum sentence for violation of 19 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A). Therefore, this Court has broad discretion in determining an appropriate maximum term of imprisonment based on mitigating factors. <em>Cf. Government of V.I. </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>42 V.I. 146, 150 (D.C.V.I. 1999) (holding that although the statute governing punishment for second degree murder provides minimum penalties, it sets no maximum penalty for second degree murder, giving the judge broad discretion in determining the appropriate term of imprisonment.! (citing <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>5 V.I. 616, 620, 365 F.2d 500, 501 (3d Cir. 1966)). It should be noted, however, that in a recent opinion dated August 17, 2004, <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Government of the Virgin Islands, </em>332 F. Supp. 2d 808, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16831 (D.C.V.I. 2004) at http://www.vid.uscourts.gov/ dcopinion/03 cr0023_wamer_opn.pdf, the Appellate Division held that the Court was further limited to imposing a sentence of a definite term of years, and not permitted to impose a penalty of life imprisonment for murder in the second degree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">C. The Facts in <em>United States v. Bruney, </em>30 V.I. 360, 866 F. Supp. 874 (D.V.I. 1994), are Distinguishable From the Facts Presented Herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The holding in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bruney, </em>30 V.I. 360, 866 F. Supp. 874 (D.C.V.I. 1994) is inapplicable to the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Bruney, </em>the Defendant was convicted in the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands of, <em>inter alia, </em>attempted second degree murder. The Defendant filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>motion for a judgment of acquittal and a new trial, challenging his conviction(s). Among the questions raised on appeal was whether there is a crime of attempted murder in the second degree under Virgin Islands law. The Defendant argued that \u201cthe application of the Virgin Islands attempt statute, 14 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7331, to the offense of second degree murder is unconstitutionally vague because it does not provide an ascertainable maximum term or fine.\u201d <em>Bruney, </em>30 V.I. at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The penalty for the crime of second degree murder is prescribed by 14 V.I. Code Ann. \u00a7 923(b). That provision states, in pertinent part \u201cwhoever commits murder in the second degree shall be imprisoned for not less than five (51 years.\u201d Significantly, \u00a7 923(b) also fails to provide a maximum penalty. The attempt provision, section 331 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">\u201c[wjhoever unsuccessfully attempts to commit an offense, shall, unless otherwise specially prescribed by this Code or other law, be punished by-... (2) imprisonment for not more than one-half of the maximum term ... prescribed by law for the commission of the offense attempted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The Defendant argued that it was impossible to apply the Virgin Islands attempt statute to 14 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 923(b) because one-half of an unknown remains an unknown. <em>Bruney </em>at 365. Despite the fact that an application of \u00a7331 to \u00a7 923(b) rendered the penalty void for vagueness,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Court held that 14 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 3(a)(1) applied, thereby supplying a penalty where one was otherwise unascertainable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This residual provision provided a maximum punishment for \u00a7 923(b) so \u00a7331 could be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>. While,the step-by-step analysis was not completely disclosed, as to how the <em>Bruney </em>court reached .its decision in applying 14 V.I. CODE ANN, \u00a7 3(a)(1), it is apparent that the Court-concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-3\">' 1. Murd\u00e9r in the s\u00e9c\u00f3rid degree has a minimum \u00edhand\u00e1tory sentence of five (5) years imprisonment; \"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\">2. Murder in the second degree does not have a maximum sentence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">3. The Virgin Islands-attempt statute, 14 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7'331, creates a penalty consisting of one-half the maximum term of the offense attempted: \" \u2022 ' '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">4.' One-half of the unknown maximum for second degree murder is unascertainable; - - ' \" 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">5. Absent case law or a \u201csavings/residual\u201d s\u00ed\u00e1tufe, an unknown penalty provision violates the \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d doctrine \u00e1nd renders the statute violative of .the \u201cdue,,process\u201d.clause and , thereby unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">6. Title, 1 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 51 establishes a savings clause for . statutes deemed void or unconstitutional. The provision states, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-12\">\u201c[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided, if any provision of this Code ... or the application of any such, provision to any person, thing, or circumstance, is determined by. any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such determination of invalidity shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the' other provisions, or the application of the other provisions, qf this Code ... which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to effect this purpose the provisions of this Code ... are severable.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-13\">7. Pursuant to \u00a7 51 the entire penalty aspect of 14 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 923(b) was stricken for purposes of applying 14 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 331;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-14\">8. Title 14 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 3(a)(1) therefore became applicable, setting the maximum penalty at five (5) years;, ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-15\">9. One-half of the penalty supplied by section 14 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 3(a)(1) is 214 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-16\">Accordingly, the <em>Bruney </em>court determined that the maximum penalty that could be imposed on the Defendant fot attempted murderin' the second degree was <em>2lA </em>years. Nonetheless, the <em>Bruney </em>court\u2019? holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>is inapplicable to the case <em>sub judice </em>because there is no \u201cattempt\u201d provision at issue and a minimum sentence is prescribed for violation of 19 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The Defendant\u2019s reliance on 14 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 3(a)(1) is misplaced. Section 3(a)(1) is inapplicable to 19 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 614a(a)(l)(A) because the latter provides a penalty, albeit only the minimum penalty, for its violation. Although only a mandatory minimum sentence of three (3) years incarceration and a $25,000 mandatory f\u00edne, is provided, case law gives this Court broad discretion in determining the appropriate term of imprisonment under \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A) when the statute is silent as to a maximum penalty for its violation. <em>Bruney </em>is distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice </em>inasmuch as the Defendant in <em>Bruney </em>was charged and convicted of attempted second degree murder. In that case, because application of the Virgin Islands attempt statute requires that a definite maximum penalty for the offense attempted be ascertained, the <em>Bruney </em>court ultimately found that 14 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 3(a)(1) applied. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, no such attempt provision is at issue as the Defendant intends to plead guilty to aiding and abetting trafficking marijuana, in violation of 19 V.I. CODE Ann. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Accordingly, the Court finds that the maximum sentence permitted for violations of 19 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 614a(a)(1)(A) exceeds five (5) years, in the Court\u2019s discretion, and in fact may be any number of definite years, subject to <em>Warner, supra, </em>and the parole provisions of 5 V.I. CODE ANN. \u00a7 4601.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-12\"> Attorney Gwendolyn Wilds, Esq. appeared on behalf of the attorney of record, Stephen A.

Concomitant with the due process requirement of certainty is the requirement that the penalty portion of a statute be definite. <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>Piazza, </em>596 So. 2d 817, 820 (La. 1992); <em>see generally </em>Joseph G.

Code Ann. \u00a7 614a(a)(3)(C) (1995-2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\"> The double jeopardy clause prevents a person from being twice tried or twice punished for the same offense. U.S. Const. amend. 5. The double jeopardy clause, however, is not offended when an individual is tried and convicted under the criminal codes of two separate independent sovereigns, i.e. the United States criminal code and a State\u2019s criminal code, for the same offense. <em>U.S. v. Williams, </em>2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22677 (D.C.V.I.). This rule of law, commonly known as the \u201cdual sovereign doctrine,\u201d does not apply to criminal prosecutions in the Virgin Islands, even though Congress has applied the double jeopardy clause to the Territory of the Virgin Islands by section 3 of the Revised Organic Act. <em>Williams, </em>2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22677 at *20. The Territory of the Virgin Islands, as a creation of the U.S. Congress by virtue of Article IV, Section III, Clause I of the United States Constitution, lacks the inherent sovereign power of a State and therefore acts as an agent of the federal government. Ergo, the Virgin Islands and the federal government are considered a single sovereignty for the purpose of determining whether an individual may be punished under both Virgin Islands and United States statutes for similar offenses growing out of the same occurrence, without violating the double jeopardy clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b41-8\"> [A] missing term or an open-ended sentence may be filled only by imposing a specific term of years other than life imprisonment and [ ] a life term is proper only when provided by statute.
