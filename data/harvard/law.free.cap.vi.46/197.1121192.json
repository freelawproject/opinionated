INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b210-18\">This appeal is before the Court on the sole issue of whether the trial court\u2019s order suppressing the Government of the Virgin Island\u2019s [\u201cgovernment\u201d or \u201cappellant\u201d] redacted statements of non-testifying codefendants properly applied <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 88 S. Ct. 1620 (1968), and its progeny. For the reasons set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>forth below, we will vacate the trial court\u2019s order and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\">II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">. On or about November 4, 1999, Duvalier Basquin [\u201cBasquin\u201d] was robbed and brutally murdered in the Bolongo Bay area of St. Thomas. During the investigation of the robbeiy and murder of Basquin, the following four suspects were questioned by the police: Ottice Bryan [\u201cBryan\u201d], Selvin Hodge [\u201cHodge\u201d], Eladio Camacho [\u201cCamacho\u201d], and Kirsten Greenaway [\u201cGreenaway\u201d] [collectively \u201cappellees\u201d]. There of the suspects gave written narrative statements to the police. Two of the suspects, Hodge and Camacho, acknowledged participation in certain acts and implicated each other as well as defendants Greenaway and Bryan. They claimed that Basquin was lured out to a remote place, then robbed and murdered. <em>(See </em>App. at 5-27). Greenaway gave an exculpatory statement. <em>(See id. </em>\u00e1t 28).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Greenaway, Camacho, and Hodge each filed a motion for severance, based in part on <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 88 S. Ct. 1620 (1968). The Territorial Court denied all three motions for severance, ruling that the defendants\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights could be protected by proper redaction of the statements. Accordingly, the court ordered the government to file copies of the statements it sought to admit.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">A. The Government\u2019s Original Redacted Statements of Greenaway, Hodge, and Camacho</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The government submitted its first redacted version of Greenaway\u2019s, Hodge\u2019s, and Camacho\u2019s statements. <em>(See </em>App. at 49-77). The government\u2019s original redaction of Greenaway\u2019s statement consisted of a photocopy of her handwritten statement to the police. In its redaction, the government, using broad, blackout markings, covered over a question by the interrogator asking Greenaway what she would say if Hodge and Camacho told the police that she aided them in the robbery and murder of Basquin. <em>(Id. </em>at 51-54).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">In its proposed redaction of Hodge\u2019s statement, the government again submitted a photocopied version of Hodge\u2019s original, handwritten statement, also containing blacked out text. In this version, the government substituted the phrases \u201csomeone,\u201d \u201csomebody,\u201d \u201canother,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>and other similar words and pronouns for the codefendants\u2019 names. For instance, Hodge originally said that, on the day that Basquin was murdered, \u201cOtis, Eladio, Kirsten Greenaway and myself was at home.\u201d <em>(See </em>App. at 5). In the government\u2019s redacted version, the names of Hodge\u2019s co-defendants were marked over in heavy black, and his statement was changed to read \u201ca few other people and myself was at home.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at 55). The government also submitted a redacted version of Camacho\u2019s statement, similarly marked and edited. <em>{Id. </em>at 67-77).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\">Camacho, Greenaway, Bryan, and Hodge each objected to the government\u2019s initial redactions and submitted alternative redactions. (App. at 78-115). The trial judge held a hearing on September 12, 2001, to consider the defendants\u2019 objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">B. The Government\u2019s Second Set of Redacted Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Before the hearing, the government filed a second set of proposed redactions. (App. at 32-48). The government\u2019s second submission of Greenaway\u2019s statement was a photocopied, handwritten version that contained references to Bryan, Camacho, and Hodge by name. <em>{Id. </em>at 34-37). The second proposed redacted statement of Hodge was typed, and substituted the words \u201canother,\u201d \u201csomeone,\u201d arid \u201csomebody\u201d for the other defendants\u2019 names. This version also contained a physical description of Bryan, that, although not specifically naming him, referred to him as being \u201cabout 5'8\" - 5T0\". He has that Spanish breed hair, but short. He has a dark brown complexion.\u201d In addition, the redaction contained a specific reference to Bryan\u2019s address. <em>{Id. </em>at 38-42). The government also submitted an amended redaction of Camacho\u2019s statement that contained references to persons nicknamed \u201cTootsie\u201d and \u201cKiki,\u201d and replaced the names of the codefendants with the words \u201csomeone\u201d or \u201ca person.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>{Id. </em>at 43-48).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">C. The Court-ordered Redactions</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">At the hearing, the trial judge considered each line of the government\u2019s second proposed redactions, and invited objections from the parties. The court ruled on each objection, and ordered the government to submit typed redactions consistent with its rulings that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>any sentences containing direct references to the defendants, nicknames, physical descriptions, and the substituted pronouns be omitted. (App. at unnumbered 142-49) .<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">The government filed a timely notice of appeal, pursuant to V.I. CODE Ann. tit. 4, \u00a7 39(a)(1), and moved this Court to stay further proceedings. (See Government\u2019s Emergency Expedited Motion for Stay, September 14, 2001). This Court granted the government\u2019s motion to stay. (See Order, Crim. App. No. 2001-256 (D.Y.I. App. Div. Sept. 14,2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">A. Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">On appeal, the government argues that the Territorial Court abused its discretion in ruling that it could not admit into evidence redacted confessions that replaced the codefendants\u2019 names with non-identifying language. In addition, the government avers that the trial judge further abused his discretion by ordering that non-identifying factual information be redacted from the defendants\u2019 statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The defendants counter that the government\u2019s proposed redactions, substituting pronouns for the defendants\u2019 names, are insufficient in light of binding caselaw. They maintain that <em>Bruton </em>and subsequent cases prohibit references not only to a defendant\u2019s identity, but also to that defendant\u2019s existence. Appellees aver, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s amended redaction strikes an appropriate balance between protecting their Sixth Amendment rights and the administration of justice. In addition, Biyan and Camacho contend that this Court is without jurisdiction to consider this appeal because the suppressed evidence is not substantial proof of the charges against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The government replies that the trial court overreached and redacted statements that did not identify the codefendants. The government further argues that the trial court\u2019s ordered redactions render the statements nonsensical for use in establishing a conspiracy among the codefendants. Finally, the government maintains that this Court retains jurisdiction over its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">This Court has jurisdiction to consider the judgments and orders of the Territorial Court in criminal cases. 4 V.I.C. \u00a7 33; Section 23A of the Revised Organic Act of 1954.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government, pursuant to 4 V.I.C. \u00a7 39(a)(1), may appeal a pretrial order that suppresses evidence. <em>See Government of the Virgin Islands v. Christopher, </em>990 F. Supp. 391, 393, 38 V.I. 193 (D.V.I. App. Div. 1997). Admission of evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Guardian Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>31 V.I. 145, Civ. No. 1991-385 (App. Div. Oct. 25, 1994). When reviewing an order suppressing evidence, this Court reviews findings of fact for clear error. 4 V.I.C. \u00a7 33. We exercise plenary review over questions of constitutional law. <em>Maddox v. Government of the Virgin Islands, </em>121 F. Supp. 2d 457, 459 (D.V.I. App. Div. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him or her.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 206, 95 L. Ed. 2d 176, 107 S. Ct. 1702 (1987). Where two or more defendants are tried jointly, therefore, the pretrial confession of one cannot be used to implicate the other unless the confessing defendant takes the stand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">In <em>Bruton, </em>two defendants accused of participating in the same crime were tried jointly. At trial, a witness testified that one of the defendants confessed to him that he and the other defendant committed the crime. 391 U.S. at 124. The trial judge permitted the admission of the confession into evidence, and instructed the jury that it should consider the confession as evidence only against the codefendant who had confessed and not against the defendant named in the confession. <em>Id. </em>at 125 n.2. The Supreme Court held that, despite the limiting instruction to the jury, the admission of this confession violated the Sixth Amendment rights of the named defendant because the confession posed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u201csubstantial threat\u201d to the non-confessing defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine the witnesses against him. <em>Id. </em>at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\">In <em>Richardson, </em>the Supreme Court revisited the <em>Bruton </em>rule and addressed the issue of whether, in a joint trial, a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession, redacted to conceal the identity of another defendant, complied with the Confrontation Clause when other evidence presented at trial linked the defendant to the crime. 481 U.S. at 202. The state had redacted the confession of defendant Williams to \u201comit all reference\u201d to the codefendant, Marsh, \u201cindeed, to omit all indication that <em>anyone </em>other than ... Williams\u201d and a third person had participated in the crime. <em>Id. at 203 </em>(emphasis in original). The redacted confession indicated that Williams and the third person had discussed the crime while traveling in the front seat of a car. <em>Id. </em>at 203-04, n.l. Later during the trial, Marsh testified that she was in the back seat of the car. <em>Id. </em>at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Recognizing that the confession, coupled with Marsh\u2019s testimony, may well have persuaded the jury that Marsh was involved in the crime, the Supreme Court determined that this redacted confession (and appropriate limiting instructions) was admissible in light of Bruton. <em>Id. </em>at 208. The Court reasoned that, whereas the codefendant\u2019s confession in <em>Bruton </em>expressly implicated the defendant as an accomplice, this redacted confession was \u201cnot incriminating on its face, and became so only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held, thus, that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession with a proper limiting instruction when, as here, the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant\u2019s name, but any reference to his or her existence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211. The Court signaled that the lack of reference to a codefendant\u2019s existence was not the <em>sine qua non </em>of an admissible redaction by noting specifically that it expressed no opinion on the admissibility of a confession in which the defendant\u2019s name has been replaced with a symbol or neutral pronoun. <em>Id. </em>at n.5. Replacing a codefendant\u2019s name with a neutral pronoun is undisputably a reference to the defendant\u2019s existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The Supreme Court next addressed \u201cwhether redaction that replaces a defendant\u2019s name with an obvious indication of deletion, such as a blank space, the word \u2018deleted,\u2019 or a similar symbol, still falls within <em>Bruton\u2019s </em>protective rule.\u201d <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>523 U.S. 185, 192, 140 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>294, 118 S. Ct. 1151 (1998). In <em>Gray, </em>codefendant Bell had confessed to the police that he, defendant Gray, and a third person brutally beat a man to death. <em>Id. </em>at 188. Bell and Gray were subsequently tried jointly for the murder. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge permitted a detective to read the redacted confession into evidence, substituting the words \u201cdeleted\u201d or \u201cdeletion\u201d where Gray\u2019s name appeared. <em>Id. </em>The detective then testified that he was able to arrest Gray based on Bell\u2019s statement. <em>Id. </em>at 188-89. The prosecution also introduced into evidence a printed copy of the confession with Gray\u2019s name omitted, leaving instead, a blank white space. <em>Id. </em>at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\">The Court determined that this redacted confession, unlike the one in <em>Richardson, </em>was more akin to the confession in <em>Bruton </em>since it directly referred to Gray\u2019s existence. <em>See id. </em>at 192. Accordingly, the Court held that redacted confessions that simply substitute a defendant\u2019s name with an obvious blank space, a symbol, a word such as \u201cdeleted,\u201d or any other <em>similarly obvious </em>indications of alteration are inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 192 (emphasis added). The Court stated that such redacted statements were \u201cdirectly accusatory,\u201d because a jury will often react to an. unredacted confession and a confession such as one in <em>Gray </em>in the same manner, as a jury will often understand that the confession refers specifically to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 193-194.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The Court further distinguished between the blank spaces in the <em>Gray </em>redaction and the factual statements in <em>Richardson, </em>concluding that the latter did \u201cnot point directly to a defendant at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194. The Court cautioned, however, against a bright-line rule whereby all inferences the jury might make would be admissible, suggesting that confessions containing nicknames and unique physical descriptions would be excluded. <em>Id. </em>at 195 (citing <em>Harrington v. </em>California, 395 U.S. 250, 253, 23 L. Ed. 2d 284, 89 S. Ct. 1726 (1969) (assuming a <em>Bruton </em>violation where confessions described codefendant as the \u201cwhite guy\u201d and gave a description of his age, height, weight, and hair color)). Instead, the obviousness of an inference that the statement refers to the defendant is critical. The <em>Gray </em>Court observed that the permissible statements in <em>Richardson </em>did not directly inculpate the non-confessing defendant, and only incriminated the defendant through inferences the jury could draw from evidence introduced later at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 196. According to the Court, however, the statements in <em>Gray, </em>even with the redaction, \u201cobviously refer directly to someone, often obviously the defendant, and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>involve inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immediately, even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">The Supreme Court went on to note that redaction of a confession that uses a blank space, the word \u201cdelete,\u201d or a symbol, \u201cnormally is possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court in <em>Gray </em>examined the redacted statement at issue as it was read to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">\u201cQuestion: Who was in the group that beat Stacey?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cAnswer: Me, deleted, deleted, and a few other guys.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\"><em>Id. </em>The Court then proposed a hypothetical redaction. Why could the witness not, instead, have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201cQuestion: Who was in the group that beat Stacey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">\u201cAnswer: Me and a few other guys.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-9\"><em>Id. </em>The opinion in <em>Gray </em>then pointed out that its proposed redaction was similar to the statement in <em>Richardson, </em>because, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cit did not indicate that it had been redacted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197. We note that <em>Gray\u2019s </em>permissible redaction also refers to the existence of one or more possible codefendants without obviously or directly referring to codefendant Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">In a case arising from the Virgin Islands, <em>United States v. Richards, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recognized the foregoing proposed permissible redaction using neutral pronouns or non-identifying words. 241 F.3d 335, 341, 43 V.I. 337 (3d Cir.), (finding <em>Bruton </em>violation but holding it was harmless error), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 960, 150 L. Ed. 2d 770, 121 S. Ct. 2615 (2001). Defendants Richards and Greenaway were tried jointly for offenses stemming from the robbery of a Brinks armored van. The third robber, Stevens, who drove the van, confessed to being the \u201cinside man\u201d and identified Richards and Greenaway as his accomplices. <em>Id. </em>at 337. Greenaway was subsequently arrested, and he stated to police that he and an unnamed \u201cfriend\u201d had committed the robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 337-38. Stevens continued to cooperate and testified at trial that he and Richards had planned the robbery for two weeks. <em>Id. </em>at 338. A Federal Bureau of Investigation agent then testified and, without objection from Richard\u2019s counsel, read the following part of Greenaway\u2019s statement into evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The first time I heard about the idea of robbing the Brink\u2019s armored van was when a friend, whom I do not wish to name, spoke to me about it. He and I talked and my friend told me it would be easy to rob the armored car since there was an inside man ... The next time I met with my friend was on the day of the robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 338. The agent continued to read from Greenaway\u2019s statement, which contained additional references to his \u201cfriend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals held that this reading of Greenaway\u2019s confession violated <em>Bruton </em>because the references to his \u201cfriend\u201d were \u201cjust as blatant and incriminating of Richards as the word \u2018deleted\u2019 in the <em>Gray </em>case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The <em>Richards </em>court acknowledged the permissible redaction proposed in <em>Gray </em>and noted that Greenaway\u2019s statement referred to only three participants in the crime: Greenaway, the \u201cinside man,\u201d and his \u201cfriend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals nevertheless found that Greenaway\u2019s redacted statement was not like <em>Gray\u2019 </em>s permissible redaction \u201cMe and a few other guys\u201d because the \u201cinside man\u201d was easily identified so that the reference to \u201c\u2018my friend\u2019 sharply incriminated Richards, the only other person involved in the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The redacted statements proposed by the government in this case fall somewhere between those in <em>Richardson </em>and <em>Gray. </em>Here, the government has proposed redacted statements that retain physical descriptions and nicknames of the codefendants and substitute pronouns for the defendants\u2019 names. We agree with the appellees that, in light of <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Gray, </em>including the defendants\u2019 nicknames and physical descriptions would identify particular defendants in violation of the rule established in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The more difficult question in this case is whether the use of pronouns or other neutral words or phrases in place of the codefendants\u2019 proper names would violate the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. Other courts have permitted such substitutions. <em>See United States v. Sanin, </em>252 F.3d 79, 84-85 (2d Cir.) (finding no <em>Bruton or Gray </em>error where prosecutors used the phrases \u201cseveral individuals\u201d and \u201cindividuals\u201d in lieu of codefendants\u2019 names), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1008, 151 L.

Ct. 2553 (2001). <em>But see United States </em>v. <em>Long, </em>900 F.2d 1270, 1279-80 (8th Cir. 1990) (finding a <em>Bruton, </em>error where a codefendant\u2019s statement to an FBI agent replacing the defendant\u2019s name with \u201csomeone\u201d was improperly admitted under <em>Bruton </em>because the codefendant\u2019s cross-examination of the agent \u201cled the jury straight to the conclusion that \u2018someone\u2019 referred to [the defendant]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\">We agree with those courts that read <em>Bruton, Richardson </em>and <em>Gray </em>as permitting the <em>non-obvious </em>substitution of pronouns and other neutral words and phrases in place of the codefendants\u2019 proper names or other directly identifying words. We believe that such redaction differs from the redacted statement in <em>Gray, </em>as it does not draw the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that a name was omitted and avoids inviting the jury to \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d with the defendants\u2019names.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">For instance, in <em>Logan, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed a conviction in which a non-testifying codefendant\u2019s.statement was redacted, substituting the phrase \u201canother individual\u201d for the defendant\u2019s name. 210 F.3d at 823. In so doing, the court distinguished this statement from the one. in <em>Gray, </em>noting that, in the latter case, the confession \u201cquite obviously\u201d had been redacted. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Logan </em>Court found, however, that any indication there had been a redaction was absent in its case, and that \u201c[f]or all, the jury knew, these were [the nontestifying codefendant\u2019s] actual words, not a modified version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court also noted that, \u201cin our case, the allegedly offending phrase occurred only once,\u201d whereas the witness in <em>Gray </em>read the statement into evidence, saying the word \u201cdelete\u201d four separate times. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In applying this reasoning to the instant case, we conclude that the government\u2019s second set of redactions failed to adequately protect the Sixth Amendment rights of the codefendants because the statements would clearly indicate to a jury that they had been redacted. For instance, in his statement to the authorities, Hodge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">Yes, when we saw the taxi coming, we went into the buch [sic] and hid. The driver of the taxi could not see us. We saw when the taxi drove pass us. When the taxi got to the house it came to a stop. Kirsten got out and she paid the driver. She then began to walk towards the house as if that was really her house. The driver of the taxi had to backed [sic] into a turn around space. When the driver backed into the space to turn around, Otis rushed the driver\u2019s side of the taxi. He had jerked open the driver\u2019s door and stuck a knife to his neck. Otis told the driver to give him everything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">(App. at 7-8). The government proposed the following redaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">Yes, when we saw the taxi coming, we went into the bush and hid. The driver of the taxi could not see us. We saw when the taxi drove pass us. When the taxi got to the house it came to a stop somebody got out and she paid the driver. She then began to walk towards the house as if that was really her house. The driver of the taxi had to backed into a turn around space. When the driver backed into the space to turn around, someone rushed the driver\u2019s side of the taxi. Someone had jerked open the driver\u2019s door and stuck a knife to his neck. Someone told the driver to give someone everything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\"><em>(Id. </em>at 39). The trial court, in its order, reduced this statement to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">The driver of the taxi had to backed into a turn around space. The driver backed into the space to turn around.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-10\"><em>(Id. </em>at 142).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">We find that the government\u2019s redaction violates the rule established in <em>Bruton </em>and extended in <em>Gray. </em>Although the government\u2019s version correctly omitted <em>the </em>defendants\u2019 <em>proper names, it </em>failed <em>to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>comply with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause because it implicated Greenaway by gender and the redactions were obvious. There are three male defendants and one female defendant, Greenaway. Under such circumstances, the use of the pronoun \u201cshe\u201d in place of Greenaway\u2019s proper name would be like the use of the words \u201cmy friend\u201d in <em>Richards, </em>as the jury would naturally tend to assume that Greenaway was the \u201cshe\u201d to whom Hodge was referring.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Furthermore, the repetitive and awkward use of the word \u201csomeone\u201d makes this passage appear as obviously redacted as the statement in <em>Gray </em>that used the word \u201cdeleted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"> Although we find that the government\u2019s redaction violated <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Gray, </em>we believe that the trial court went too far in attempting to protect the defendants\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights. The court-ordered redaction eviscerated any value the statements might have for establishing the government\u2019s conspiracy charge. This Court believes that there exists a middle ground between the government\u2019s proposed redactions and those ordered by the trial judge that would be consistent with <em>Bruton, Richardson, </em>and <em>Gray. </em>Redaction or summarization could be done to remove any references to the defendants as well as any indication of redaction. For example, the government could redact Hodge\u2019s statement to read something like:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\">Yes, when we saw the taxi coming, we went into the bush and hid. The driver of the taxi could not see us. We saw when the taxi drove pass us. When the taxi got to the house it came to a stop. The passenger go out and paid the driver and began to walk towards the house. The driver of the taxi had to backed into a turn around space. When the driver backed into the space to turn around, one of us rushed the driver\u2019s side of the taxi and had jerked open the driver\u2019s door and stuck a knife to his neck and told the driver to give over everything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">We believe that this approach would permit the redaction of most of the defendants\u2019 statements in a manner consistent with <em>Bruton </em>and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>progeny. This approach could also be applied even to those portions of the statements containing multiple references to the other defendants. For example, a portion of Camacho\u2019s original statement reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">Otis and myself was catching a ride to go country and we saw Tootsie with the truck. He picked us up and we went to play pool, while there Tootsie said he was coming back, when he came back he had Kiki with him. We then left together up to the Market Square where Kiki catch the taxi, and while we was going out in the truck Tootsie he said he was going to robb [sic] the taxi driver because he owes him money. He said he did not want to deal with him in the Market Square because he did not want anybody in his business, so when he reach Bologna Bay he is going to robb the taxi driver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">(App. at 26-27).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The government\u2019s redacted version of this portion of Camacho\u2019s confession reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">Someone and myself was catching a ride to go country and we saw \u201cTootsie\u201d with the truck. A person pick us up and we went to play pool, while there \u201cTootsie\u201d said a person was coming back, when a person came back, a person had \u201cKiki\u201d with a person, we then left together up to the Market Square, where \u201cKiki\u201d catch the taxi, and while we was going out in the truck, \u201cTootsie,\u201d a person said a person, was going to rob the taxi driver because he owes a person money. A person said a person did not want to deal with him in the Market Square because a person did not want anybody in his business, so when he reach Bolongo Bay, a person is going to rob the taxi driver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-9\"><em>(Id </em>at 48). There are at least thirteen references to \u201csomeone\u201d or \u201ca person\u201d in this one paragraph, not including the additional redaction that would be necessary in order to omit the references to the nicknames \u201cTootsie\u201d and \u201cKiki.\u201d Due to the repetitive use of these pronouns and the awkward reading of this passage, it is difficult to imagine that a jury would not be able to discern that this statement had been redacted to omit the names of the persons who were involved. In this sense, these redactions are too similar to the use of the word \u201cdeleted\u201d in <em>Gray.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>The trial court\u2019s ordered redaction of this part of Camacho\u2019s statement, on the other hand, omitted this response in its entirety. <em>(Id. </em>at unnumbered 145-47). Although this obviously would protect the other defendants\u2019 rights, we find that the tidal court again abused its discretion in extending the <em>Bruton </em>rule too far. Even in this instance, redaction or summarization could be done in such a way as to remove any references to the defendants as well as any indication of redaction. Why, for example, could the government not redact Camacho\u2019s statement to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-3\">Some others and myself left together up to the Market Square, where one catch the taxi, and while we was going out in the truck, another talked about going to rob the taxi driver when he reach Bolongo Bay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Redaction in this manner would permit the government to enter into evidence information to prove its conspiracy charge, while at the same time protecting the rights of the codefendants by neither identifying them nor indicating to the jury that the statement has been redacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Finally, we note that the record does not indicate exactly how the government plans to offer these statements into evidence. It is not clear whether the government intends to have the redacted statements read <em>verbatim </em>into the record, and/or the written redactions introduced as evidence, and/or have the police officer who took them summarize the redacted contents of the statements for the jury. The latter option by oral summary allows redaction that avoids both references to specific defendants and indications of obvious redaction. <em>See, e.g., Sanin, </em>252 F.3d at 82 (permitting the prosecution\u2019s witness to refer to the defendants as \u201cindividuals\u201d instead of their proper names); <em>Tutino, </em>883 F.2d at 1134-35 (affirming conviction where redaction read into evidence summarized defendant\u2019s statement). For instance, in <em>Tutino, </em>defendant Tutino gave an admission in which he inculpated codefendants Guarino and Larca in a drug trafficking conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>At trial, the prosecution\u2019s witness introduced the following redacted version of Tutino\u2019s statement by oral testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">In substance, Ralph Tutino told me that he and others were involved in [two] heroin transactions on March 19, 1987[,] and December 27, 1986. In respect to the transaction on March 19th, 1987, Tutino stated that he had received money from Vincent Cafaro earlier in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the day and then had gone on received a package from other people, and then returned that package to Vince Cafaro.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1135. Such an approach, of course, would require that the government, and possibly the trial judge, properly instruct the witness to conform her or his testimony to the redaction guidelines we have lineated in this opinion. <em>See Sanin, </em>252 F.3d at 82 (finding no <em>Bruton </em>error where prosecution and trial judge instructed the witness not to use defendants\u2019 proper names or words that may implicate them).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">We agree with the appellees that the government\u2019s proposed redactions insufficiently protect the Sixth Amendment rights of the defendants in light of <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Gray. </em>We also agree with the government that the trial court overreached and abused its discretion in protecting. those rights. We hold that there exists a middle ground between the government\u2019s proposed redactions and those ordered by the trial judge, in which key aspects of the statements may be offered into evidence while still protecting the constitutional rights of the appellees. Accordingly, we will vacate the Territorial Court\u2019s order suppressing the government\u2019s redacted statements, and will remand this matter for additional proceedings consistent with this memorandum opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\"> In his original statement to the police, Camacho stated that Hodge\u2019s <em>nickname was </em>\u201cTootsie\u201d and that the \u201cgirl\u201d who aided in the robbery and murder of Basquin went by the name \u201cKiki.\u201d (App. at 17).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\"> The pages of the Appendix are numbered until page 115, but are unnumbered after that.
