Supp. 2d 540, 561 (D.V.I. 2003), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>105 Fed. Appx. 324 (3d Cir. 2004). Accordingly, I entered a decree in the consolidated portion of this litigation awarding injunctive and other such relief common to all parties. That relief included an award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for each plaintiff as determined upon due application to this Court after the completion of the individual portion of each case. The plaintiffs individual case is now complete, and all appeals by the government have been resolved in the plaintiffs favor. Thus, all that is left to be determined in this case is the plaintiffs request for attorneys fees and costs. For the reasons set forth below, I rule that the plaintiff is entitled to $354,666.45 in attorneys\u2019 fees, $11,336.35 in costs and $120.00 in expert witness costs it incurred in successfully litigating this matter. Accordingly, I will order the government to pay the plaintiff $366,122.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">I. LEGAL BASIS FOR AWARDING ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">On May 23, 2003, plaintiff Equivest St. Thomas, Inc. [\u201cEquivest\u201d] filed a notice of filing of attorneys fees and costs. Equivest supplemented this filing on August 21, 2003, and July 7, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government has opposed Equivest\u2019s requests for fees and costs. To the extent each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>government\u2019s many objections to Equivest\u2019s requested fees and costs are comprehensible, I will address them individually in Part II below. Before addressing these objections, however, I first review the legal basis for awarding Equivest\u2019s fees and costs and reject the government\u2019s initial argument that I should refrain from providing Equivest any such award.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The plaintiffs complaint, as amended, sought to enjoin the defendants from assessing real property taxes for commercial property in the Virgin Islands other than in strict accordance with 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a) and 33 V.I.C. \u00a7 2404. The plaintiff alleged that, because the defendants utilized outdated evaluating methods that unequally valued property among similarly situated taxpayers, the defendants were violating their civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The plaintiffs suit was consolidated with other similar cases brought by other plaintiffs and a bench trial was held on the issues common to all plaintiffs. Following the bench trial, I found that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">plaintiffs have proved their federal claim that Roy Martin, acting in his official capacity as the Tax Assessor for the Government of the Virgin Islands, violated plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 by systematically employing a method of assessment not calculated to determine the actual value of properties, as required by 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401a, namely, he did not use the income capitalization approach in appraising and assessing plaintiffs\u2019 commercial properties and abided by the limitation on the assessment of residential property imposed by 33 V.I.C. \u00a7 2402(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\"><em>Berne Corp., </em>262 F. Supp. 2d at 561. To remedy the government\u2019s unlawful behavior, I determined that Equivest and the other plaintiffs were entitled to equitable relief under federal and Virgins Islands law, namely 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 80. <em>Id. </em>at 565-72. Included in my decree enjoining the government from illegally assessing the plaintiffs properties was an order awarding each plaintiff \u201ccosts of suit incurred thus far, including reasonable attorneys fees and costs, as shall be determined upon due application to this Court as each individual case is completed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">This award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs was permitted under federal and local law. Congress has provided courts with discretion to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to parties who successfully litigate civil rights claims under section 1983. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (\u201cthe court, in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs ....\u201d). The Virgin Islands Legislature more broadly allows a court to award to any prevailing party in a civil action costs and fees it incurred in prosecuting or defending the action. <em>See </em>5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541. Under both statutes, a party need not prevail on every claim to be considered a prevailing party for purposes of qualifying for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See Truesdell v. Philadelphia Housing Auth., </em>290 F.3d 159, 163 (3d Cir. 2002) (\u201cplaintiffs may be considered \u2018prevailing parties\u2019 for attorney\u2019s fees purposes [under \u00a7 1988] if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\u201d) (quoting <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40, 103 S. Ct. 1933 (1983)); <em>Jo-Ann\u2019s Launder Ctr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., </em>31 V.I. 226 (1995) (\u201cA prevailing party [under 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541] is one who has received at least some of the benefits which were sought in the litigation ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">In their opposition filing, the government requests that I entirely refrain from awarding Equivest fees and costs. Given that on May 12, 2003 I awarded Equivest \u201ccosts of suit incurred thus far, including reasonable attorneys fees and costs,\u201d I will treat the government\u2019s request as a motion to reconsider my award. In addressing this motion, I note that the government has offered nothing new that would compel me to reverse my earlier decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That decision explained the long and tortured history of this litigation, which the government made unnecessarily burdensome by defending the indefensible at trial. <em>See Berne Corp., </em>262 F. Supp. 2d 540. I will incorporate this history by reference here, as it provides evidence of the substantial litigation costs the plaintiff incurred in protecting its civil rights. The plaintiff having achieved total success, it is entitled to just compensation for these litigation costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Significantly, I also recognize that \u201calthough [section 1988] expressly refers to a district court\u2019s discretion, it is well settled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>a prevailing plaintiff should recover an award of attorney\u2019s fees absent special circumstances.\u201d <em>See County of Morris </em>v. <em>Nationalist Movement, </em>273 F.3d 527, 535 (3d. Cir 2001) (citing <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1263, 88 S. Ct. 964 (1968)). As no special circumstances are present here that would warrant denying Equivest attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, I will reject the government\u2019s motion to reconsider, and will expand my award to include costs and fees Equivest incurred after May 12, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In analyzing the grounds of the government\u2019s opposition, I will focus on the necessity of the fees and costs incurred by Equivest and whether it was reasonable for Equivest\u2019s attorneys to bill these fees and pass on their costs. As the United States Supreme Court has instructed, \u201cthe most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation ... multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.\u201d <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 432, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40, 103 S. Ct. 1933 (1983). Thus, after determining the appropriateness of the time Equivest spent litigating this matter, I will calculate a \u201clodestar\u201d amount relative to reasonable hourly rates in this jurisdiction. <em>See Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>478 U.S. 546, 562-66, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439, 106 S. Ct. 3088 (1986) (discussing calculation of the lodestar). If necessary, this amount will then be adjusted to take into account any other relevant factors that are not already adequately represented in the lodestar calculation. <em>Id. </em>at 564-66; <em>see also Blum </em>v. <em>Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 897-901, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891, 104 S. Ct. 1541 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">II. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S OPPOSITION TO EQUIVEST\u2019S REQUEST FOR ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES AND COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">A. There Is No Evidence Of Overstaffing Or Excessive Staff Conferences</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">The government argues that Equivest\u2019s fees and costs should be substantially reduced because Equivest\u2019s attorneys overstaffed this litigation with nine attorneys and five paralegals. The government also complains that this alleged overstaffing resulted in an excessive number of staff conferences. A closer review of plaintiff counsels\u2019 billing records shows that, although fourteen individuals billed time on this matter, 88% of the attorneys\u2019 fees requested represent the work of one partner and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>associate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Assigning two individuals to handle the vast majority of this matter hardly amounts to overstaffing, especially considering the great extent to which the government\u2019s obstruction added to the complexity of this litigation, thereby increasing the plaintiffs need to staff this matter with additional attorneys. None of the billing records indicate the individuals contributing to this matter were performing duplicative work or that their work was unnecessary. Moreover, it is entirely reasonable that the two attorneys primarily handling this matter would occasionally rely on the contribution of other attorneys and paralegals. Thus, I reject the government\u2019s claim that the plaintiffs attorneys overstaffed this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\">The government argues next that Equivesf s award of fees and costs should be reduced due to its attorneys engaging in unnecessary staff conferences. The government stresses that Attorney Messier\u2019s participation in 120 staff conferences related to this complex litigation over the course of nearly two years is, \u201c[b]y any standard, ... extremely excessive and unnecessary.\u201d (Opp\u2019n. Mot. at 10.) I disagree that such a number of conferences is <em>per se </em>unreasonable, as \u2018\u201c[cjareful preparation often requires collaboration and rehearsal.\u2019\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood </em>v. <em>AG, </em>297 F.3d 253, 272 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-Velez, </em>132 F.3d 848, 860 (1st Cir. 1988)). Although the government has not itemized the specific conferences it finds objectionable,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I have reviewed the records of all staff conferences, including those involving Attorney Messier, and have found no obvious examples of unnecessary communication between the plaintiffs attorneys and paralegals. Viewing the billing records as a whole, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>however, I do not doubt that there was occasionally some duplication of effort and instances of unnecessary communication. Thus, while I do not fully accept the government\u2019s argument, I will give the government the benefit of the doubt and accept the plaintiff\u2019s offer to reduce the overall amount of fees requested by five percent:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\">B. There is No Evidence of Excessive Communication With Client And Experts</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The government also complains that the plaintiffs attorneys \u201cspent an inordinate and unnecessary amount of time. communicating with [Equivest representatives] Gwen Parrish, J. Cohen, and the experts via email and telephone.\u201d (Opp\u2019n Br. at 10.) The government then vaguely suggests that \u201cthe, amount of time spent in this case is unreasonable and excessive and therefore, not compensable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 10-11.) Again, the government fails to identify any specific instances of unnecessary communication. Even worse, the government, does not reference any legal authority, relevant or otherwise, in support of its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Rule 1.4 of the American Bar Association Rules of .Professional Conduct, provides, in relevant part, that \u201ca lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.\u201d Additionally, subpart, (a)(2) of that rule demands that a lawyer \u201creasonably consult with, the client about the means by which the client\u2019s objectives are to be accomplished.\u201d These ethical duties required that Equivest\u2019s attorneys engage in significant communication with Equivest representatives Gwen Parrish and J. Cohen. Having reviewed plaintiff counsels\u2019 billing records, I have found no instances of communication between Equivest\u2019s attorneys and its representatives that were not reasonably necessary to prepare for trial or to keep Equivest informed of the latest developments in the case. Similarly, I find no evidence of unnecessary communication between the plaintiffs attorneys and expert witnesses. Thus, I will not reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Equivest\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fee award based on the government\u2019s alleged claims of excessive client and expert communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\">C. The Time Devoted to Preparation of Pleadings and Other Papers Filed With the Court Was Reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The government next challenges the time Equivest\u2019s attorneys billed for preparation of pleadings and other papers filed with the Court. Unlike its previous arguments, the government has identified specific examples within this category of excessive billing. For example, the government complains that the plaintiffs attorneys spent approximately thirty-five hours in the initial phase of this case. Specifically, the government argues that the initial filings in this matter were similar to the ones filed in the <em>Berne </em>litigation, and therefore it was unnecessary for the plaintiffs attorneys to spend approximately thirty-five hours to review those earlier filings and draft a complaint, motion for injunctive relief, an accompanying memorandum of law, and an affidavit. The government also complains that Equivest\u2019s attorneys spent an excessive amount of time preparing proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">I disagree with the government\u2019s general challenge to the fruitful time and effort plaintiffs counsel put into its filings with this Court, and with the specific complaints levied against the time billed for Equivesf s initial filings and findings of facts and conclusions of law. Having reviewed the billing records associated with plaintiff counsel\u2019s preparation of court filings, I find that the time devoted to these filings was not \u201cexcessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.\u201d <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 434, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40, 103 S. Ct. 1933 (1983). Regarding the initial filings, it would be unprofessional for the plaintiffs attorneys to blindly copy the complaint and other early documents from the <em>Berne </em>litigation, as the government\u2019s argument suggests. Moreover, spending some thirty hours researching, editing, and revising such critical documents as a complaint and a memorandum of law in support of a motion for injunctive relief hardly amounts to overbilling.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Similarly, it was proper for Equivest\u2019s attorneys to allot considerable time to Equivest\u2019s proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law. This document was approximately sixty-five pages in length, well-researched, contained extensive cross-references to the trial transcripts, and was a valuable aid to me in resolving this matter. Accordingly, I will not reduce Equivest\u2019s fee award based on the government\u2019s claim that plaintiffs counsel was excessive in its careful preparation of pleadings for this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">D. The Time Billed For Trial Preparation and Trial Work Was Reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The government also levies several complaints against the trial preparation and participation of Equivesf s attorneys. Specifically, the government contests what it describes as \u201cthe duplication of work on preparing the trial outline and other trial preparation,\u201d and excessive time preparing witnesses for trial. I agree with the government\u2019s contention that the two attorneys handling this matter did indeed devote a substantial amount of time to prepare witnesses and other necessary trial work. I disagree, however, with the government\u2019s contention that this time was excessive, especially taking into account the government\u2019s obstreperous conduct of this litigation. As described in my decision in the consolidated portion of this litigation, the government obstructed the discovery process leading up to trial and interjected every impediment it could think of to avoid living up to its responsibility to fix the Territory\u2019s system of real property taxation that it had already agreed, was broken. <em>See Berne Corp., </em>262 F. Supp. 2d at 550-52. This behavior forced Equivesf s attorneys to spend additional time preparing for trial. For example, because the government was not forthcoming in responding to interrogatories and government witnesses often made inconsistent statements, the plaintiffs attorneys were forced to review voluminous transcripts and prepare extensive rebuttal outlines. Moreover, the government\u2019s pre-trial behavior put Equivest on notice that it would contest every possible issue at trial and thereby increased the time Equivesf s attorneys had spend preparing for trial. In light of these facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>I find that the time billed for trial preparation was necessary and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\">I also reject the government\u2019s claim that it was unnecessary for Attorney McConnell to participate in the consolidated and individual portions of trial. As noted above, Attorney McConnell was one of only two attorneys handling the bulk of this matter. Although he was not Equivest\u2019s lead counsel in the courtroom, his presence throughout this litigation was critical, as he often consulted with the lead counsel during trial and assisted lead counsel in determining and organizing many exhibits. Accordingly, I will not eliminate or discount the fees associated with Attorney McConnell\u2019s attendance to Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">E. Equivest\u2019s Attorneys Did Not Fail to Delegate or Overcharge for Simple, Administrative Tasks; Attorney Messier\u2019s Travel to Miami Was Reasonable But Will Be Reduced To Account for Reduced Efficiency In Transit</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The government next contests what it describes as Equivest\u2019s attorneys\u2019 overbilling for administrative tasks and failure to delegate other simple tasks. The government has identified five items in its initial opposition filing that allegedly represent this overbilling and failure to delegate. In its reply brief, Equivest\u2019s attorneys agreed to forgo the fees associated with three of the five specifically identified items, totaling 2.30 hours of attorney work and 1.0 hour of paralegal work.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, I will reduce Equivest\u2019s award to reflect this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The remaining two objections that allegedly demonstrate a failure to delegate and overbilling for simple tasks are that plaintiffs counsel billed for phone calls even when the person phoned was unavailable and that the fees for summarizing the depositions of Verne Callwood, Roy Martin, and Kenneth Voss were excessive. The government has not identified specific examples of plaintiffs counsel charging for phone calls that were not successful in reaching an intended recipient. Without such guidance from the government, I was able to identify only one phone call for which Equivest was billed that did not reach its intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>recipient.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The records indicate that on April 18, 2002, Attorney McConnell placed a call to an unavailable recipient but left a message regarding settlement. Although the call did not result in a direct connection with its intended target, substantive information was communicated for which these attorneys could reasonably charge their client. <em>See Abrams </em>v. <em>Lightolier Inc., </em>50 F.3d 1204, 1225 (3d Cir. 1995) (stating that telephone related expenses are recoverable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 when it is the custom of attorneys in the community to bill for such expenses). Thus, I will not deny Equivests attorneys\u2019 fees for this call.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\">Likewise, I find no reason to reduce or deny the fees associated with summarizing the depositions of Verne Callwood, Roy Martin, and Kenneth Voss. As these three individuals were central figures in the dispute, it was entirely reasonable for Equivest\u2019s attorneys to carefully review and organize the testimony they provided during depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Finally, the government argues I should reject entirely or reduce the fees associated with Attorney Messier\u2019s travel to Maimi. I find no reason to deny Equivest all fees billed for Messier\u2019s round-trip travel to Miami on August 11 and 12, 2002. The trip was reasonably necessary to meet with and confer with Equivest\u2019s expert witness, Kathleen Conroy. Moreover, the billing records demonstrate that Messier used his travel time to work on this matter by reviewing deposition transcripts on the plane and in his hotel. I do, however, agree with the government\u2019s argument that a lawyer\u2019s efficiency in performing legal work is reduced while in transit. I will therefore reduce by twenty-five percent the fees Messier charged Equivest for work performed while traveling on August 11, 2002, and August 12, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">F. Equivest Is Entitled to An Award of Fees and Costs Regarding Its Litigation Before the Court of Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The government argues that I should deny Equivest all fees associated with plaintiff counsel\u2019s appellate work in this matter because \u201cthere seems to be a difference of opinion\u201d regarding whether appellate work is compensable under section 1988. Contrary to the government\u2019s argument, it is well established that a successful civil rights plaintiff may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>recover under section 1988 attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in defending a favorable trial court ruling before the Court of Appeals. <em>See, e.g., Ustrak v. Fairman, </em>851 F.2d 983, 990 (7th Cir. 1988). It is true, as the government argues, that once the Court of Appeals has considered an application for appellate attorneys fees, the prevailing party may not resubmit the same application to this Court. <em>See Yaron </em>v. <em>Twp. of Northampton, </em>963 F.2d 33, 37 (3d Cir. 1992). It is also true, as the government notes, that on April 3, 2003, Equivest received an award for costs in the amount of $280.60 for reproduction of its appellate brief and appendix. The lost logic in the government\u2019s argument, however, is that Equivest\u2019s award from the Court of Appeals was rendered under Rule 39 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and not pursuant to section 1988. Thus, because Equivest has not filed a section 1988 request for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs with the Court of Appeals, I retain the authority to award attorneys\u2019 fees related to its appellate work. Having determined that the fees for this appellate work were entirely reasonable, I reject the government\u2019s request that I deny them.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\">G. Equivest is Entitled to Attorneys Fees and Costs It Incurred in Successfully Defending Against The Government\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In opposition to Equivest\u2019s second supplemental attorneys\u2019 fees affirmation and declaration, the government argues that Equivest cannot recover attorneys\u2019 fees related to its retention of counsel based in Washington, D.C. This non-local counsel successfully defended Equivest against the government\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. The government argues all of these attorneys\u2019 fees should be denied because the attorneys are not admitted to practice in the Virgin Islands and have not been admitted <em>pro hac vice, </em>thus they may not be awarded fees by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">As the government suggests, all attorneys practicing before this Court must, pursuant to Local Rule of Civil Procedure 83.1, be barred in this jurisdiction or admitted <em>pro hac vice. </em>The plaintiffs Washington, D.C.based attorneys, however, never appeared in this Court and only acted on Equivest\u2019s behalf in the United States Supreme Court, where they are admitted and authorized to practice. The government has provided no authority, as I am sure none exists, requiring attorneys practicing before the United States Supreme Court to be barred or admitted <em>pro hac vice </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>practice in the United States Virgin Islands. Even more important, the government has provided no authority establishing that I may not award Equivest for the reasonable attorneys expenses it incurred in defending against its petition for a writ of certiorari. Accordingly, I will award Equivest the fees and costs associated with defending against the government\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">H. Government\u2019s Financial Plight Does Not Obviate Its Responsibility to Compensate for Reasonable Attorneys Fees and Costs Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Finally, the government requests that I consider what it refers to as its \u201cfinancial plight\u201d in awarding Equivest attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. It is characteristically brazen for the government to ask for a reduction on these grounds given that it willfully violated the plaintiffs civil rights. Although I regret that the politicians in charge of the governance of the Virgin Islands have placed the Territory in dire financial straits, the government may not use its financial mismanagement as a basis to deny the victims of its unlawful behavior their just compensation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The government unwisely elected to defend the indefensible at trial and to litigate this matter to its bitter end. I will not deny this successful plaintiff its just attorneys\u2019 fees and costs because the government has made similarly unwise decisions in the management of its finances. Moreover, the highest appointed officials of the government, including the Attorney General and the Commissioner of Finance, repeatedly assured this Court that the Virgin Islands Government would be able to fully pay any monetary judgment that might be entered against it in this litigation. Indeed, the officials professed to be offended at plaintiff counsel\u2019s suggestion to the contrary. Thus, I will not give credence to the government\u2019s claims of poverty now that it has lost utterly.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">111. EQUIVEST IS ENTITLED TO $354,666.45 IN ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Having reviewed the requisite billing records and considered the government\u2019s corresponding protests, I find that, with the exception of the minor reductions discussed below, Equivest shall be compensated for the expenses it incurred in successfully prosecuting this matter. As discussed above, calculating Equivest\u2019s fee award involves two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>elements: the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation, and an appropriate hourly rate. I will address each element individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\">A. Number of Hours Reasonably Expended On the Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Equivest seeks reimbursement for 1,698 hours of legal work performed by its attorneys and their staff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In considering the government\u2019s many objections to the plaintiff\u2019s requested attorneys fees, I thoroughly reviewed the hours billed by Equivest\u2019s attorneys and am convinced that, with the exception of the hours accounted for in subpart C below, they are all reasonable. Accordingly, I will calculate the lodestar based on these 1,698 hours and subtract any unnecessary time in the final step of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">B. The Rates Charged By Equivest\u2019s Attorneys Represent Reasonable Hourly Rates</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Next, I determine the reasonable hourly rate to apply to the 1,698 hours of legal and support work Equivest\u2019s attorneys spent in this matter. As a starting point, I first look to the fees charged by Equivest\u2019s attorneys. As detailed in their billing records, plaintiff counsel\u2019s billing rates on this matter range from $95.00 per hour for paralegal work to $300.00 per hour for work by a senior partner. In particular, the two primary attorneys associated with this matter, Messier and McConnell, billed at rates of, respectively, $235.00 per hour and $200.00 per hour. The non-local attorneys responsible for opposing on Equivest\u2019s behalf the government\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari charged $403.75 per hour for work by a senior partner and $246.50 per hour for work by an associate.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Although these rates are above average for this jurisdiction, they are justified by the higher expertise of Equivest\u2019s attorneys and the unusual complexity of this litigation. It is noteworthy that the government admits that Attorneys Messier and McConnell are experienced in their field and are members of a \u201cwell-reputed firm.\u201d (Opp\u2019n at 19.) I also find it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>persuasive that the amounts charged by Equivest\u2019s attorneys represent their normal billing rates, as the Supreme Court has instructed that \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee under \u00a7 1988 is one calculated on the basis of rates and practices prevailing in the relevant market.\u201d <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Jenkins by Agyei, </em>491 U.S. 274, 286, 105 L. Ed. 2d 229, 109 S. Ct. 2463 (1989); <em>see also Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>487 F.2d 161, 167 (3d Cir. 1973) (\u201cthe value of an attorney\u2019s time generally is reflected in his normal billing rate\u201d). These rates are \u2018\u201cin line with those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation.\u2019\u201d <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Jenkins by Agyei, </em>491 U.S. 274, 286, 105 L. Ed. 2d 229, 109 S. Ct. 2463 (1989) (quoting <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 896, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891, 104 S. Ct. 1541 (1984)). Accordingly, I find to be reasonable the rates Equivest paid its attorneys and will use these rates in calculating the lodestar amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">C. Calculation of the Lodestar And Consideration of Factors Outside the Lodestar Results in A Fee Award of $354,666.45</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">For the reasons stated above, I find that the rates charged by the plaintiffs attorneys were reasonable and that the hours those attorneys devoted to this litigation were, except for the reductions discussed below, entirely appropriate. Therefore, multiplying plaintiff counsels\u2019 reasonable rates with the respective hours they devoted to this matter results in a preliminary lodestar amount of $374,912.05.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">To reach a final lodestar amount, I will now account for hours not reasonably expended on this litigation or hours that the plaintiff has voluntarily withdrawn. As discussed above, I accept the plaintiffs offer to reduce by five percent the overall amount of fees requested, thereby alleviating any concern of unnecessary staff conferences and duplication of effort. Incorporating this five percent reduction results in an attorneys fees\u2019 amount of $356,116.45. As also discussed above, Equivest\u2019s attorneys have voluntarily agreed to withdraw certain fees requested and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>I have exercised my authority to eliminate other fees. Specifically, the plaintiff withdrew its request for $560.00 in fees associated with 2.30 hours of work by Attorney McConnell on December 24, 2002, and 1.00 hour of work by paralegal Cuchara on June 5, 2002, and July 22, 2002.1 have also reduced by twenty-five percent the fee associated with work performed by Attorney Messier during his travel to and from Miami, reflecting decreased productivity while traveling. Taking these reductions into account results in a final lodestar amount of $354,666.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\">As the final step in calculating Equivest\u2019s appropriate fee award, I must consider if there are any other factors not taken into account in the lodestar amount that warrant adjusting the fee upward or downward. <em>See Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 434, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40, 103 S. Ct. 1933 (1983). In considering such factors, the Supreme Court has instructed that \u201cthe important factor is the results obtained\u201d and that \u201c[w]here a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434, 435. Given that the plaintiff has achieved overwhelming success, the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance strongly favors awarding Equivest a fully compensatory fee. Thus, having found no extraneous reasons to deviate from the lodestar amount and considering Equivest\u2019s total victory in this matter, I will award $354,666.45 in attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">IV. EQUIVEST IS ENTITLED TO AN AWARD OF $11,336.35 FOR COSTS AND $120.00 FOR EXPERT WITNESS FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Equivest has requested $11,336.35 for costs it incurred in successfully prosecuting this matter. Equivest has not sought reimbursement for everyday operating expenses such as long distance telephone charges, facsimile and copying costs, and mailing expenses. Instead, its requested costs consists of expenses closely related to this litigation, such as court filing fees, process service fees, transcript purchase fees, witness fees, and travel expenses for Messier\u2019s necessary trip to Miami. Having reviewed these requested costs, I find that they are reasonable expenses which are normally charged paying clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The government contests the portion of Equivest\u2019s requested costs relating to witnesses that were not deposed or did not testify at trial, arguing that I should deny all witness and process service fees for these individuals. I disagree. All witnesses that were subpoenaed were either government employees or were affiliated with the government and were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>subpoenaed because the government would not agree to produce them without a subpoena. Equivest informs in its reply brief that when a witness fee check was returned by a witness, it was credited to the account and does not appear on the costs submitted to the Court. Thus, to the extent that witness fees appear on the billing records, they represent checks that were not returned by the government\u2019s witnesses. As the government could have voluntarily produced these witnesses, any costs associated with their failure to return checks to which they were not entitled should fall on the government. Thus, I will not deny Equivest costs for process service or witness fees and, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and 5 Y.I.C. \u00a7 541, will award Equivest $11,336.35 for its costs in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In its initial request for costs and fees, Equivest sought reimbursement pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 for expert witness fees totaling $56,884.95. In its reply brief, however, Equivest accurately acknowledges such an award is not warranted because the United States Supreme Court has held that section 1988\u2019s provision for a \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d does not include recovery of expert witness fees. <em>See West Virginia Univ. Hospitals </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>499 U.S. 83, 88, 102, 113 L. Ed. 2d 68, 111 S. Ct. 1138 (1991); <em>see also Abrams, </em>50 F.3d at 1225 (\u201cthe reading given \u2018attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 ... does not include fees paid for expert witnesses\u201d). Thus, if Equivest is entitled to any reimbursement for expert fees, that reimbursement must be made pursuant to the local attorneys\u2019 fee statute, 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has instructed that section 541 limits reimbursement for expert fees to the minimal amount allowed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821. <em>See Dr. Bernard Heller Foundation v. Lee, </em>847 F.2d 83, 86-88 (3d Cir. 1988). Section 1821 allows witnesses to be paid $40.00 per day for their attendance and for their travel time. Accordingly, I will grant Equivest\u2019s request that it be awarded $120.00 for travel and attendance expenses regarding the expert testimony of Kathleen Conroy and Steven Santora.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">It is well settled that, absent special circumstances, a successful civil rights plaintiff should recover attorneys fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. It is also well settled that 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541 provides me with discretion to award to prevailing parties fees and costs associated with local causes of action. Pursuant to my authority under both statutes, I will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>award Equivest $354,666.45 in attorneys\u2019 fees, $11,336.35 in costs, and $120.00 in expert witness fees it reasonably incurred. These amounts are not a windfall for the plaintiffs and are not ordered as punishment against the government. Rather, they represent just compensation for Equivest\u2019s litigation expenses, as permitted under local and federal law. To insure that the government promptly pays the $366,122.80 compensation it now owes the plaintiff, I will order the government to pay the amount it owes within ninety days of this order. I will also order the parties to provide a notice to the Court within ninety days of the date of this order informing whether payment has been made. If payment has not been made by that date, the Court will scheduling a hearing for the parties to address whether the government should be held in contempt for violating this Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-9\"> Equivest\u2019s May 23, 2003, filing for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs was premature because my May 12, 2003, decree did not did not permit award of attorneys\u2019 fees until the individual portion of Equivest\u2019s case had been determined. After its individual case was decided on August 13, 2003, Equivest appropriately supplemented its request on August 21, 2003. Following resolution of appeals and other outstanding issues, Equivest supplemented its request for attorneys\u2019 fees for a second and final time on July 7, 2004. The government filed oppositions to Equivest\u2019s requests on September 8, 2003, and July 26,2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-4\"> The government argues I should reverse my earlier decision and deny Equivest all attorneys\u2019 fees and costs because this litigation was \u201clargely a routine real property tax assessment challenge.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Opp\u2019n. at 4.) Quite the contrary, this litigation was enormous in scope, as it involved a challenge to the entire system of property taxation in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b463-5\"> This award is merely compensatory and not punitive in nature. <em>See Missouri </em>v. <em>Jenkins by Agyei, </em>491 U.S. 274, 285-87, 105 L.

The government complains that, \u201cdue then-lumping of billing entries,\u201d it is \u201csometimes unclear\u201d how much time the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys devoted to certain tasks. (Opp\u2019n at 11.) As the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has instructed, \u201cit is not necessary to know the exact number or minutes spent nor the precise activity to which each hour was devoted nor the specific attainments of each attorney.\u201d <em>Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v.

Not only are these generalized arguments without merit, they provide no assistance in identifying particular instances of excessive staff conferences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\"> In its September 22,' 2003 reply brief, the plaintiff provided the following offer to reduce its overall\u2019 fees by five percent:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">To the extent, however, that the Court concludes that these conferences did result in some duplication of effort, Equivest submits that a five percent (5%) reduction in the overall amount of fees requested would be sufficient to address this concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">(Reply Br. at 7.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b467-6\"> I also reject the government\u2019s argument.that Attorney McConnell spent 3.70 hours on September 4, 2001 in preparing a one-page cover motion.

A complete review of the billing records shows that on September 4, 2001, McConnell worked on the motion for the preliminary injunction and the accompanying memorandum of law, as McConnell\u2019s September 5, 2001, billing entry shows he revised the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>memorandum of law.
