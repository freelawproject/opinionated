INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Appellant now appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment in an action for breach of a lease arguing that the lease\u2019s indemnification clause allows his insurer to subrogate to his rights against the appellee, and thereby warrants recovery of all monies expended in defending a lawsuit by appellee\u2019s employee. After due consideration, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">On February 10, 1989, TOPA Equities (V.I.), Ltd. [\u201cTOPA\u201d] leased a commercial property to Bared Jewelers of the Y.I., Inc. [\u201cBared\u201d]. On February 8, 1994, Bared\u2019s employee, Lydia Gonzalez, injured herself on a spiral staircase while working on the leased premises. She collected worker\u2019s compensation and also sued TOPA as landlord in Territorial Court on May 8, 1995 for negligent maintenance of the staircase. <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>TOPA Equities (V.I.), Ltd., </em>Civ. No. 344/1995 <em>[\u201cGonzalez </em>action\u201d]. TOPA referred the <em>Gonzalez </em>action to its insurer, Dorchester Insurance Co. who arranged for counsel to answer the complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> TOPA and Dorchester then tendered the defense to Bared and its insurer based on an indemnification clause in their commercial lease whereby Bared agreed to indemnify TOPA from all claims for injury on the leased premises.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (J.A. 463.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Pursuant to this lease provision, Bared had purchased a personal injury liability policy with CNA Insurance Company, naming both itself and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>TOPA as insured parties. In response to Dorchester\u2019s tender, CNA offered to split the costs of handling the <em>Gonzalez </em>action \u201c50/50\u201d. Dorchester rejected this offer, insisting that CNA pay the full cost of TOPA\u2019s indemnification as required by the lease provision. (J.A. at 26.) Dorchester and TOPA eventually settled their liability in the <em>Gonzalez </em>action for $125,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On March 23, 2000, TOPA sued Bared for breach of contract, seeking to recover the monies TOPA and Dorchester paid in defending the <em>Gonzalez </em>action, which included the $125,000.00 settlement payment along with $18,329.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees. (J.A. at 452-477.) On May 29, 2001, Bared moved to dismiss the action, arguing Dorchester was the real party in interest. On June 26, 2001, pursuant to Rule 17 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Dorchester ratified TOPA to prosecute this action on its behalf, thereby agreeing to be bound by the outcome without becoming a named party. (J.A. at 37-38, 275.) On September 18, TOPA moved for summary judgment based on the lease\u2019s indemnification clause. Bared responded that no indemnification was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">After a hearing, the trial judge on June 19, 2002, ruled that Bared was required to indemnify TOPA only for money TOPA actually lost, and that Dorchester was not subrogated to TOPA\u2019s rights under the indemnification clause because Dorchester and Bared were \u201cco-insurers\u201d of TOPA for the same risk of personal injury on the premises Bared leased from TOPA. (J.A. at 45.) After a further hearing on TOPA\u2019s damages only, the trial judge entered a final order on August 12, 2002. The trial judge also noted that \u201cDorchester\u2019s remedy, if any, must come through an action for contribution against other insurers and not an action for breach of contract.\u201d (J.A. at 46.) (emphasis in original)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">TOPA has now timely appealed whether Dorchester is subrogated to TOPA\u2019s rights against Bared under the lease\u2019s indemnification clause and whether that clause places the entire and primary risk of loss on Bared.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">A. Jurisdiction and Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">This Court has jurisdiction to review final judgments and orders of the Territorial Court in all civil cases. <em>See 4 </em>V.I.C. \u00a7 33; Section 23 A of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Revised Organic Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cFindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.\u201d 4 V.I.C. \u00a7 33. The standard of review for this Court in examining the Territorial Court\u2019s application of law is plenary. <em>See Nibbs </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>31 V.I. 196, 204 (App. Div. 1995). The Court also exercises plenary review over an order granting summary judgment. <em>See Gass v. V.I. Tel. Corp., </em>311 F.3d 237, 240, 45 V.I. 649 (3d Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">B. Whether the trial court\u2019s June 19, 2002 ruling was proper</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The trial court found that Dorchester and Bared were \u201cco-insurers\u201d and therefore \u201cequally responsible parties.\u201d (J.A. at 38-46.) It reasoned that Dorchester, therefore, could not be subrogated to TOPA\u2019s rights against Bared because it would unfairly shift the entire expense of defending the <em>Gonzalez </em>action from Dorchester to Bared. The trial court concluded that Dorchester could only recover from the \u201cco-insurer\u201d Bared through an action for contribution. It ruled that because Dorchester had \u201calmost completely indemnified\u201d TOPA, TOPA could only recover its own out-of-pocket losses for the <em>Gonzalez </em>action from Bared pursuant to the lease\u2019s indemnification clause. (J.A. at 45.) We cannot agree with the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The lease\u2019s indemnification clause requires Bared to reimburse TOPA for all of its costs in defending Bared\u2019s employee\u2019s suit for personal injuries she suffered on the premises Bared leased from TOPA. In that clause, Bared specifically agreed to indemnify TOPA \u201cfrom any and all claims arising from injury on the above described premises during the term of this lease.\u201d It necessarily follows that Dorchester and Bared are not \u201cequally responsible parties\u201d because Bared specifically agreed to indemnify TOPA. As TOPA\u2019s liability insurer, Dorchester is subrogated to TOPA\u2019s rights against Bared under the lease\u2019s indemnification clause.-</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">It is clear that the landlord TOPA and the tenant Bared contractually agreed to shift the entire risk of loss for injury on the premises to Bared and required Bared to insure itself and TOPA against such risk. Whether TOPA separately obtained general liability insurance from Dorchester to cover its risk is immaterial. It is perfectly proper for a commercial tenant and landlord to negotiate an indemnification clause in a contract to shift the entire loss of a specific risk to one party and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>insurer. <em>See Wal-Mart Stores Inc. </em>v. <em>RLI Ins. Co., </em>292 F.3d 583, 588-94 (8th Cir. 2002) (construing Arkansas law to give controlling effect to an indemnity clause even though indemnitee had insurance).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Since Bared agreed to bear the \u00e9ntire risk of loss of personal injury on the premises it leased from TOPA, there is nothing inequitable in allowing Dorchester to be subrogated to TOPA\u2019s rights to enforce this indemnification. In fact, the policy between Dorchester and TOPA expressly provides for such subrogation. (J.A. at 320.) We therefore hold that Bared is liable to TOPA, and through subrogation to Dorchester as its insurer, for all monies TOPA expended in defending the <em>Gonzalez </em>action. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The trial court\u2019s June 19, 2002 decision erred in denying TOPA full recovery because Bared expressly agreed to indemnify TOPA regardless of other insurance it acquired from Dorchester. We accordingly will vacate the judgment below and remand the matter with the direction that the trial court enter summary judgment in TOPA\u2019s favor.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\"> Both TOPA and Dorchester were subsidiaries of TOPA Equities, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\"> The lease provision provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">It is further agreed that the Lessee [Bared] assumes all risks or liability for personal injury to any person or any injury to property while on the described premises; and [Bared] shall at all times indemnify and save harmless the Lessor [TOPA] from any and all claims arising from injury on the above described premises during the term of this lease.
