On April 16, 1981 the court\u2019s findings were filed and on April 21, judgment was entered in the docket. On April 30, 1981 the defendant timely filed a claim of report and a motion for a new trial. The denial of the motion for a new'trial was docketed on May 15, 1981. On May 26, 1981 the defendant\u2019s draft report was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">Dist./Mun. R. Civ. P. 64(c)(ii) requires draft reports to be filed within ten (10) days after entry of judgment. Wing v. Liziewski, 59 Mass. App. Dec. 30 (1976). However, the filing of a motion for a new trial tolls the time for filing of the draft report. Dist./Mun. R. Div. P. 64(c)(iii) and the full time (ten days) for filing draft reports \u201cshall commence to run and shall be computed from the entry of any of the following orders made upon a timely motion under such rules: ... (3) denying a motion for a pew trial under Rule 59.\u201d Rule 64(c)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">When the denial of the motion for a new trial was docketed on May 15, 1981, the ten days to file a draft report began to toll. The draft report was not filed until the eleventh day thereafter and no motion was filed or allowed to extend the time for filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">The draft report not having been filed timely is to be dismissed.
