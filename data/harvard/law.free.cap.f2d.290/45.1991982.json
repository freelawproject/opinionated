(a) 1. of the Order of the Board must be limited to discrimination against any employee or applicant for employment in violation of Section 8(a) (3) of the Act by any agreement, act or practice that encourages union membership including any that conditions the hiring of applicants for employment or the retention of employees in their jobs on union membership or requires employers to grant preference to members of the union in respect to hire or tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-20\">Paragraph I. (a) 2. of the Order reading as follows is deleted;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-21\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Entering into, performing, maintaining, or otherwise giving effect to any agreement, or arrange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>ment with the Portsmouth Contractors Association, its successor, Southern Olyo Contractors Association, the Consolidated Construction Company, or any other employer over whom the Board would assert jurisdiction which provides for an exclusive hiring hall but does not explicitly provide for the minimum safeguards stated in Mountain Pacific Chapter of the Associated General Contractors, 119 N.L.R.B. 883.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afn\">Paragraph II. (b) of the Order reading as follows is deleted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">\u201c(b) Reimburse the employees of Consolidated Construction Company for monies illegally exacted from them in the manner and to the extent set forth in the section of this Decision and Order entitled \u2018The Remedy.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The notice shall be changed accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Enforcement of the Board\u2019s Order, as modified herein, is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-13\">.
