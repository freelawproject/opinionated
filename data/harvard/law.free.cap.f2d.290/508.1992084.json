The two individual plaintiffs are citizens of Colorado, as are two of the individual defendants. In addition, all parties are apparently indispensable and there is no possibility of realignment. Thus the case falls within the rule which denies diversity jurisdiction when a plaintiff is a citizen of the same state as one of the defendants. See 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00a7 18.07; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-23\">The plaintiffs further contend that defendants have conspired to deprive them of contractual benefits in violation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, thereby creating a federal question. But that statute contemplates violations of protected civil rights, and does not extend federal jurisdiction to suits for damages grow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>ing out of alleged breach of contract. See Walker v. Bank of America, 9 Cir., 268 F.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The order of the trial court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
