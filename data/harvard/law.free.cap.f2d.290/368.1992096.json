For this reason, exercising our authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (1958), the findings and conclusions are set aside, the subject matter thereof to await full development of the facts and consideration of the law applicable thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-22\">While we do not require the case to be advanced for trial we suggest that its nature might well lead the District Court to give further consideration to the motion to advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
