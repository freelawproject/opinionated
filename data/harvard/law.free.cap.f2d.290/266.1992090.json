The principal question for determination is whether the remedies provided in Section 3 of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq., are exclusive and deny to the employees or their representatives the right to call a strike to enforce the awards made by the Board. We agree with the trial court that the strike call was illegal because in disputes of the nature here involved the statutory remedy is exclusive, and the Board\u2019s money award may be enforced only by an action in the United States District Court as provided for in Section 3, First (p) of the Act. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 153, First (p)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">The facts have been stipulated, and the findings of fact are not questioned here. The dispute arose under collective bargaining agreements governing the terms and conditions of employment of the employees represented by the Brotherhood. A number of the employees claimed that, under the provisions of the agreements, they were entitled to compensation for services rendered in addition to their regular duties. The Railroad denied the claims, and the employees resorted to the statutory procedure which resulted in money awards being made to the employees by the proper division of the National Railroad Adjustment Board. The Railroad refused to honor the awards, and a strike was called which, if carried out, would seriously affect the Railroad\u2019s operation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon application of the Rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>road, the District Court temporarily enjoined the strike, and upon hearing the injunction was made permanent. Denver &amp; R. G. W. R. R. v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, D.C.Colo., 185 F.Supp. 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The purposes of the Act are set forth therein,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and they have been stated in numerous Supreme Court decisions, a detailed recount of which would serve no useful purpose here. It suffices to say that the primary purpose of the Act and the 1934 Amendment thereto was to avoid interruption of commerce by promoting industrial peace, stabilizing the relationship between labor and management, and eliminating, as far as possible, the danger of strikes on the nation\u2019s railroads. Pennsylvania R. R. v. Day, 360 U.S. 548, 79 S.Ct. 1322, 3 L.Ed.2d 1422; Union Pac. R. R. v. Price, 360 U.S. 601, 79 S.Ct. 1351, 3 L.Ed.2d 1460; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River &amp; Ind. R. R., 353 U.S. 30, 77 S.Ct. 635, 1 L.Ed.2d 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">Disputes over the interpretation or application of provisions of existing collective bargaining agreements have been generally referred to as \u201cminor\u201d disputes to distinguish them from those growing out of negotiations to reach an agreement on a contract relating to the future, which disputes are characterized as \u201cmajor.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The latter usually affect the pay and working conditions of an entire class of employees. For the settlement of these two classes of dispute the statute fixes two distinct methods. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River &amp; Ind. R. R., supra; Elgin, J. &amp; E. Ry. v. Burley, 325 U.S. 711, 722, 65 S.Ct. 1282, 89 L.Ed. 1886. When there is a failure to settle major disputes, after exhausting the statutory remedies, the employees are free to resort to economic du<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ress. Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Chicago &amp; N. W. R., 362 U.S. 330, 341, 80 S.Ct. 761, 4 L.Ed.2d 774; Elgin, J. &amp; E. Ry. v. Burley, supra, 325 U.S. at page 725, 65 S.Ct. at page 1290. But, as to minor disputes the statutory scheme for settlement is different. The law is well settled that \u201cthe jurisdiction of the Board to adjust such grievances and disputes of the type here involved is exclusive,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the employees may be enjoined from striking over such disputes after they have been submitted to the Adjustment Board. In Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River &amp; Ind. R. R\u201e supra, the Court reviewed the legislative history of the Act, and held that the 1934 amendment was intended to provide for compulsory arbitration in minor disputes<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> so that a strike by employees could be enjoined for failure to submit to arbitration in accordance with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"ank-dedup-0\">The contention here is that since the employees did submit their disputes to the Adjustment Board, which made money awards in their favor, the failure of the Railroad to honor the award leaves them free to strike. This position is premised upon the corollary contention that the provision authorizing an action to be brought in the federal district court is not mandatory.' With these contentions we cannot agree. We think that the rationale of the Supreme Court decisions is to the effect that the statutory proceedings before the Board in minor disputes provide an appropriate and fair substitute for the right to strike, and that the district court action provided in Section 3, First (p) of the Act is the enforcement procedure in the compulsory arbitration machinery adopted by Congress in the 1934 amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>fore is the only course to be followed in obtaining the enforcement of money awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In Union Pac. R. R. v. Price, supra, it was held that a railroad employee could not maintain a common law action for damages on a claim which had' been denied by the Board, even though a carrier has a statutory right to relitigate money awards which the Board has directed it to pay. It is quite obvious that Congress thought that the statutory method for enforcing the Board\u2019s money awards in favor of employees was preferable to the devastating effect of an interruption of interstate commerce caused by a strike on a portion of the nation\u2019s railroad system. It is true that the Act does not provide a judicial review of the Board\u2019s actions when the employee is unsuccessful, but if this provision creates an unfair disparity, as the Supreme Court said in Union Pac. R. R. v. Price, supra [360 U.S. 601, 79 S.Ct. 1359], \u201cit is for Congress to say whether it ought to be removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">It is urged that the injunction entered in this case is prohibited by Section 8 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 108. We think this question was answered in the case of Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River &amp; Ind. R. R., supra, in which it was held that the general terms of the Norris-LaGuardia Act could not be read alone in matters dealing with railway labor disputes, and that it did not prevent injunctions to prohibit strikes growing out of minor disputes which were specifically dealt with in the Railway Labor Act.

Howard, 343 U.S. 768, 72 S.Ct. 1022, 96 L.Ed. 1283. Cf. Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helpers Local Union No. 795 v. Yellow Trans. Frgt.

Such suit in the District Court of the United States shall proceed in all respects as other civil suits, except that on the trial of such suit the findings and order of the division of the Adjustment Board shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated, and except that the petitioner shall not be liable for costs in the district court nor for costs at any subsequent stage of the proceedings, unless they accrue upon his appeal, and such costs shall be paid out of the appropriation for the expenses of the courts of the United States. If the petitioner shall finally prevail he shall be allowed a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, to be taxed and collected as a part of the costs of the suit. The district courts are empowered, under the rules of the court governing actions at law, to make such order and enter such judgment, by writ of mandamus or otherwise, as may be appropriate to enforce or set aside the order of the division of the Adjustment Board.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b315-15\">.

In Union, Pac. R. R. v.

The trial court defined the nature of these disputes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-16\">\u201c \u2018Major\u2019 disputes relate to the disputes over the formation of collective agreements or efforts to secure them. They arise where there is no such agreement, or where it is sought to change the terms of one. They look to acquisition of rights for the 'future, not to assertion of rights claimed to have vested in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-17\">\u201c Minor\u2019 disputes contemplate the existence of a collective agreement already concluded, and the dispute relates either to the meaning or proper application of a particular provision with reference to a specific situation. In other words, a minor dispute relates to rights accrued and not merely to have new ones created for the future.\u201d Denver &amp; R. G. <em>W. </em>R. R. v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, D.C.Colo., 185 F.Supp. 369, 371.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b317-5\">. Slocum v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R.

R., 353 U.S. 30, 34-35, 77 S.Ct. 635, 637, 1 L.Ed.2d 622, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">\u201cSection 3, First (m) declares that\u2014 \u201c \u2018The awards of the several divisions of the Adjustment Board * * * shall be final and binding upon both parties to the dispute * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">\u201cThis language is unequivocal. Congress has set up a tribunal to handle minor disputes which have not been resolved by the parties themselves. Awards of this Board are \u2018final and binding upon both parties.\u2019 And either side may submit the dispute to the Board. The Brother-hood suggests that we read the Act to mean only that an Adjustment Board has been organized and that the parties are free to make use of its procedures if they wish to; but that there is no compulsion on either side to allow the Board to settle a , dispute if an alternative remedy, such as resort to economic duress, seems more desirable. Such an interpretation would render meaningless those provisions in the Act which allow <em>one </em>side to submit a dispute to the Board, whose decision shall be final and binding on <em>both </em>sides. If the Brotherhood is correct, the Adjustment Board could act only if the union and the carrier were amenable to its doing so. The language of \u00a7 3, First, reads otherwise and should be literally applied in the absence of a clear showing of a contrary or qualified intention o'f Congress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">\u201cLegislative history of the provisions creating the National Railroad Adjustment Board reinforces the literal interpretation of the Act. The present law is a composite of two major pieces of legislation. Most of the basic framework was adopted in 1926. In 1934, after eight years of experience, the statute was amended, and in that amendment the Adjustment Board was born.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b317-13\">. The history of the legislation as set forth in Union Pac. R. R. v. Price, 360 U.S. 601, 79 S.Ct. 1351, 3 L.Ed.2d 1460; Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River &amp; Ind. R. R., 353 U.S. 30, 77 S.Ct. 635, 1 L.Ed.2d 622; and Elgin, J. &amp; E. R. v. Burley, 325 U.S. 711, 65 S.Ct. 1282, 89 L.Ed. 1886, sustains this conclusion. In the case of \u201cChicago River\u201d the court, after referring to the pertinent legislative history of changes brought about by the 1934 amendments, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-16\">\u201cThe change was made with the full concurrence of the national railway labor organizations. Commissioner Joseph B. Eastman, Federal Coordinator of Transportation and principal draftsman of the 1934 bill, complimented the unions on conceding the right to strike over \u2018minor disputes\u2019 in favor of the procedures of the Adjustment Board:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-17\">\u201c \u2018The willingness of th\u00e9 employees to agree to such a provision is, in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>judgment, a very important concession and one of which full advantage should be taken in the public interest. I regard it as, perhaps, the most important part of tho bill.\u2019 \u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The Court continued, 353 U.S. at page 39, 77 S.Ct. at page 640:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">\u201cThis record is convincing that there was general understanding between both the supporters and the opponents of the 1934 amendment that the provisions dealing with the Adjustment Board were to be considered as compulsory arbitration in this limited field.
