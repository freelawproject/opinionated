The petitioner asserts that his plea of guilty was made from lack of subjective understanding of the nature of the offense charged and upon the wholly inadequate advice of court-appointed counsel. The trial court denied relief without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">We affirm the judgment for the files and records of the case conclusively show that petitioner is entitled to no relief. He admits \u201centrance into the Bush City State Bank, at Bush City, Kansas, on the <em>wight </em>of August 22, 1956, same bank was at that time a member of and insured by the Federal Deposit Corporation of the United States, and with the acknowledged intent to commit a felony * * He also alleges the intended felony to be that of burglary. The admitted acts constitute the very offense to which petitioner pleaded guilty and for which he was sentenced. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(a) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">\u201cWhoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts \u2022 to take, from the person or presence of another any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any bank, or any savings and loan association; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">\u201cWhoever enters * * * any bank, * * * with intent to commit in such bank, * * * any felony affecting such bank * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-14\">\u201cShall be fined * * * or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">Petitioner received a sentence of five years.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
