Our appellant, licensed to operate station WBEN at Buffalo, New York, on the same frequen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>cy with 5 kw power, unlimited time, requested that the application be designated for hearing under \u00a7 316 of the Federal Communications Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It alleged that such a grant would constitute a modification of its license because \u00a7 3.87(a) of the Commission\u2019s rules and regulations<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> permits operation of daytime facilities between 4:00 a. m. and local sunrise, and that such operation by the intervenor at the increased power would result in objectionable interference within appellant\u2019s normally protected contour. In opposing the requested hearing, the in-tervenor did not deny that it planned such operations. On September 7, 1960, the Commission granted intervenor\u2019s application and denied appellant\u2019s request for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">In- this appeal the Commission concedes appellant\u2019s claim of potential interference but it contends nevertheless that (1) there is no modification because there has been no showing that intervenor intends to utilize its authority under \u00a7 3.87(a); and (2) if intervenor does so operate and undue interference ensues, the Commission will order it to refrain as provided in \u00a7 3.87(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">We think the Commission is in error. Even though intervenor might not choose to avail itself of this privilege, we think its authority to do so is a modification of appellant\u2019s license within the meaning of \u00a7 316 of the Communications Act and consequently requires a hearing. \u201c[Modification * * * of an outstanding license may occur * * * through <em>extension </em>to another station of broadcasting facilities which will cause interference to the outstanding station within its lawfully protected contour * * L. B. Wilson, Inc. v. Federal Communications Comm., 1948, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 176, 182, 170 F.2d 793, 799, emphasis supplied. The Commission\u2019s unconditional grant of a construction permit to intervenor, entailing authorization under \u00a7 3.87(a) to engage in presunrise operations with its increased facilities, constitutes an <em>extension </em>of broadcasting facilities which, if used, will concededly cause undue interference to appellant. And it is no less a modification within the meaning of \u00a7 316 because the authority to broadcast prior to sunrise with increased daytime facilities is subject to the power reserved by the Commission in \u00a7 3.87(b) to order cessation when undue interference ensues.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">The Commission\u2019s reliance on Music Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Comm., 1954, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 12, 217 F.2d 339, is misplaced. There, the Commission withdrew the presunrise authority of a broadcaster licensed only for daytime hours, whose operations thereunder caused interference with a station licensed for nighttime broadcast<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>ing. We held that the withdrawal did not effect a modification of the broadcaster\u2019s license within the meaning of \u00a7 316 of the Act since the authorization was subject to withdrawal. In the present case, however, appellant\u2019s right to engage in presunrise operations is not subject to such withdrawal since the authority is derived from its unconditional license grant and not from \u00a7 3.87(a) of the Commission\u2019s rules. Consequently, the Commission\u2019s action in this instance is a modification upon which a hearing is required by \u00a7 316 of the Communications Act. Federal Communications Comm. v.
