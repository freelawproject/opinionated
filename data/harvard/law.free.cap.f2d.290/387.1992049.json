Wade was an attendant in an ambulance which was struck by Lane\u2019s car. He sued for damages, claiming to have sustained back injuries which for some time prevented him from operating his taxicab. His wife, Marguerite E. Wade, joined as plaintiff, suing for loss of consortium. The jury found for the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">Appellant\u2019s application for a \u201chacker\u2019s license,\u201d filed some months before the end of the alleged period of disability, which stated his physical fitness, was received in evidence against him. He concedes it was admissible, but contends, as the sole ground for reversal on appeal, that it was prejudicial error to receive in evidence the reverse side of his application, which was a certificate from his own physician that a physical examination revealed no disability. On the face of the application, appellant adopted the information shown on the reverse side.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
