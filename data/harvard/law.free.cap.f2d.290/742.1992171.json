After trial by jury he was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced by the District Court to a term of imprisonment. He filed a timely application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, which was denied by the District Court. After filing a number of other motions in the District Court, he filed a motion to vacate sentence, under Section 2255 of Title 28 of the United States Code. This court granted him leave to appeal from the denial of this motion, and appointed counsel to assist him. Counsel so appointed urged reversal of the conviction, as well as vacation of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-22\">Whether this case be considered as a belated direct appeal from the judgment of conviction, cf. Blunt v. United States, 1957, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 266, 244 F.2d 355,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or simply as an appeal from the order denying the motion under Section 2255, we must conclude that appellant is not entitled to relief. We have reviewed the entire record, and perceive no prejudicial error in the conduct of the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>or in the denial of the motion under Section 2255. Compare Ramsour v. United States, 1960, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 49, 280 F.2d 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-23\">. We express no opinion as to whether on the facts here appellant is entitled to have his case so considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
