The contract of sale provided for compensation to plaintiff of a commission of five per cent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Not having received the commission plaintiff sued defendant for $7,000, and the case came on for trial before a jury. At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s evidence the court directed a verdict for defendant. We think this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence was such as to make out a prima facie case for recovery of the commission notwithstanding it showed that the contract of' sale was not consummated. Failure of consummation was not so clearly shown to have been due to the fault of the proposed purchaser as to warrant the court itself in deciding the case adversely to the broker on the ground of such failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">We do not decide whether the procuring of the contract alone warranted recovery by plaintiff, or questions as to the manner in which the. commission should become due or be paid. Further development of the facts may obviate the necessity for such decisions. At present we hold only that defendant should have been required to make its defense and that the case should be decided on the basis of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-12\">. The printed form contract stated the commission to be <em>\u201c5% </em>of -,\u201d and the pretrial stipulation shows the amount thus left blank was $140,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
