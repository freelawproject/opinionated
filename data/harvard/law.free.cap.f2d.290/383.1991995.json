The principal contention urged by appellant is that his right to a speedy trial was violated by the three continuances ordered for various reasons by the District Court. It is clear on this record that no prejudice has been shown resulting from the slight delays, and as no objection was made by appellant thereto (the record shows that his counsel affirmatively consented to the last continuance), we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">We have examined the other contentions urged by appellant and likewise find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
