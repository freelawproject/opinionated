It asserts that there was no evidence to support the finding of illegal conduct as to the remaining two and seeks to have enforcement denied because the proved incidents were infrequent and sporadic.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">We find that there was ample evidence in the record to support the findings as to all incidents relied on by the Board, and we think that it follows that the order must be enforced as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">Enforcement ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
