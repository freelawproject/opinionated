Wade Mark-ley, warden of the United States penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana, respondent, had filed a return which was un-traversed. The record shows that the return contained a full recital of the proceedings which resulted in petitioner\u2019s incarceration in said penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-17\">It appears that petitioner was enlisted in the regular army of the United States and was serving in Korea. He was tried by a United States military court-martial for murder and assault in time of peace and, his conviction and sentence to confinement at hard labor for 30 years having been approved upon review in the manner provided by the law of the United States, and the provisions of Article 71(c) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 871(c), having been complied with, the sentence was ordered into execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-18\">Petitioner attacks the jurisdiction of the court-martial to try him for the offenses for which he was charged, because \u201che was assigned to the United Nations force\u201d and his case should have been referred \u201cto the International Court of Justice\u201d, the \u201cRepublic of Korea was a Sovereign State\u201d and the \u201cCivil Court of Korea was open for Capital Crimes\u201d, and the \u201cUnited States Army * * * could not supersede the jurisdiction of the Sovereign of Korea on Agreements under the United Nations Charter\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-19\">We have carefully considered petitioner\u2019s arguments and we believe they have been fully answered by the learned opinion of the district judge, Jennings v. Markley, D.C., 186 F.Supp. 611. We adopt the reasoning of that opinion and reject petitioner\u2019s contentions as unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">Accordingly we affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-21\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
