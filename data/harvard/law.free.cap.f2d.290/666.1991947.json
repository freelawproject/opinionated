The pertinent provisions thereof are, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45(a) &lt;1) and (6):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">\u201c(a) (1) Unfair methods of competition in commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce, are declared unlawful. #***\u00ab\u25a0*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">\u201c(6) The Commission is empowered and directed to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations * * from using * * * unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">At a hearing before one of the Commission\u2019s Examiners, evidence was introduced in support of the charges. Petitioners offered no evidence. Subsequently they, through their attorney, objected to proposed findings prepared by counsel for the Commission and filed their own proposed findings, which will hereafter be referred to. The Blearing Examiner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao9\">\u201cUpon the basis of the entire record, and after considering the proposed findings of facts, conclusions and legal memoranda submitted by counsel * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">made his findings of fact and conclusions and order thereon. The Examiner found, as alleged in the complaint, that the petitioners are now and have been engaged in the sale and distribution of merchandise including devices commonly known as punchboards; that they were sold in \u201ccommerce\u201d as defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act; that the \u201c* * * punchboards [were] so prepared and arranged as to involve games of chance, gift enterprises or lottery schemes when used in making sales of merchandise to the public\u201d; and that the sale of merchandise by means of such punchboards is contrary to established public policy and accordingly constituted unfair acts and practices in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Examiner issued the proposed order which on appeal was adopted by the Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">In asking this court to review and set aside the order, the petitioners\u2019 primary claim of error is that the evidence fails to support the findings of the Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">We note at the outset that it is now well established that the sale or distribution in interstate commerce of punchboards or other devices designed for the purpose of selling merchandise to the public by means of a game of chance or lottery scheme constitutes \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices\u201d under \u00a7 45(a) of Title 15 U.S.C.A. Zitserman v. Federal Trade Commission, 8 Cir., 1952, 200 F.2d 519, 522; Gay Games, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 10 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 197, 199, rehearing denied May 11, 1953; Surf Sales Company v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 1958, 259 F.2d 744, 746; Goldberg v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 1960, 283 F.2d 299; Feitler v. Federal Trade Commission, 9 Cir., 1953, 201 F.2d 790, 792, rehearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>denied February 19, 1953, certiorari denied 346 U.S. 814, 74 S.Ct. 24, 98 L.Ed. 341, rehearing denied 346 U.S. 880, 74 S.Ct. 117, 98 L.Ed. 386. Cf. Loughran v. Federal Trade Commission, 8 Cir., 1944, 143 F.2d 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The most recent Court of Appeals case on the subject and one which appears, factually, to be on all fours with the instant situation is Peerless Products, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 1960, 284 F.2d 825, 826, rehearing denied December 29, 1960. Therein Peerless Products, Inc., shipped punchboards in interstate commerce.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">\u201c * * * Most of the boards were \u2018plain boards\u2019 which had no legend printed upon them designating the winning numbers and prizes. However, there was substantial testimony from petitioners\u2019 customers that they easily had adapted these plain boards for the distribution of merchandise by lottery and that the adapted boards were used primarily to distribute merchandise rather than cash prizes. In addition, there was testimony that in certain instances Peerless furnished its customers with \u2018flares\u2019 (legends describing prizes and winning numbers) which they could attach to plain boards in adapting them for the distribution of merchandise as prizes. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">By the sale and interstate shipment of its punchboards, petitioners have supplied and placed in the hands of third persons the means of and instrumentalities for engaging in unfair acts of distributing merchandise by lottery in violation of the Act. Since the evidence indicates that such punch-boards were designed and used primarily for the distribution of merchandise by lottery, it is no defense that in the main third parties attached to the boards the legends of winning numbers and merchandise prizes or that such boards could possibly be adapted as money boards giving only cash prizes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Here the record indicates the following : For approximately forty years petitioners have been engaged in the sale and distribution of various kinds of merchandise, including punchboards. They operate from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Petitioners\u2019 sales, including punchboards, for 1957 were in excess of $1,400,000 and approximately the same for 1958. Of this gross amount, approximately 50% represented sales outside the State of Minnesota. The exact volume of petitioners\u2019 punchboard business was not ascertainable since petitioners kept no separate record of punchboard sales, a subpoena duces tecum produced no records of punchboard purchases and a search therefor was fruitless. Punch-board items, however, were carried prominently displayed and described on two full pages in the petitioners\u2019 catalog. Of 40,000 catalogs published, 75% have been distributed outside of the State of Minnesota. Nate Gellman, one of the petitioners, while claiming that they kept no separate records with reference to the sale of punchboards, admitted that they sold \u201ca lot of punchboards\u201d in the State of Minnesota and that \u201c * * * about 50 per cent of our business on punch-boards would be outside the state of Minnesota\u201d. An examination of some of the petitioners\u2019 sales files by investigators for the Federal Trade Commission disclosed the names of a considerable number of out-of-state purchasers of punchboards. This list was given to Gellman. Gellman testified that he thereafter sent form letters to forty or fifty of such out-of-state purchasers of punchboards. Subsequently it was stipulated by petitioners that four of petitioners\u2019 out-of-state customers would have testified, if called as witnesses, (1) that each purchased one board from Gellman Brothers; (2) that each placed upon the board after receiving it a legend to the effect that the person who punched the board and received the lucky number would receive as a prize certain merchandise; (3) that each actually gave to the lucky winner the merchandise referred to as a prize; (4) that the merchandise so given as a prize had a value greater than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the amount paid for any individual punch.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">As to two of the punchboards received as exhibits and as typical of those admittedly sold by the petitioners, each is described in the petitioners\u2019 xcatalog as a \u201cmerchandise board\u201d. The- legend on the face of each board is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">\u201cNumbers Ending in 0 and 5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">Register For Grand Prize</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">Numbers 1 to 15 Are Free</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">Numbers 16 to 35 Pay What You Draw Over 35 Pay Only 35 <em>f\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">A third punchboard exhibit of the type sold by the petitioners carried on its face the legend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">\u201cGetzum Smokes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">Red Tickets 15-35-55-75 115-135 Receive 5 Packs of Cigarettes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-13\">White Tickets 20-40-60-80-100-120 Receive 5 Packs of Cigarettes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-14\">Blue Tickets 22-44-66 Receive 5 Packs of Cigarettes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-15\">Last Punch On Board Receives 5 Packs of Cigarettes\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">Significantly, petitioners in their proposed findings submitted to the Examiner made, in essence, the following statements: (1) That they are now and have been selling punchboard devices to dealers and individuals in the several states; (2) that such sales constitute trade in \u201ccommerce\u201d as defined by the Federal Trade Commission Act; (3) that said punchboard devices are so prepared as to involve games of chance, gift enterprises or lottery schemes when used in selling merchandise to the public; and (4) that by using such punchboard devices, articles of merchandise are distributed to the public wholly by lottery or chance. As to whether these statements constitute pertinent judicial admissions as argued by the respondent, and denied by petitioners, we need not decide; suffice it to say that whether designated admissions or mere statements, their accuracy is clearly established by the record and lend support to respondent\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-17\">Petitioners claim that there is no evidence that there were \u201cmany sales\u201d made by means of the punchboards to \u201cmany members\u201d of the purchasing public \u201cwhich had been induced to trade or deal1 with retail dealers, organizations and individuals selling, distributing merchandise by the means of these particular punchboards\u201d. They contend that the evidence is limited to four sales. The argument hardly justifies reply, when consideration is given to the fact that petitioners\u2019 catalogs prominently display some 19 different types of punch-boards, that they distribute 30,000 copies of their catalogs in interstate commerce, that they have been selling punch-boards in interstate commerce for forty years, that they sell \u201ca lot of punch-boards\u201d in Minnesota, and that 50% of their punchboard business is in interstate commerce; and that a partial investigation disclosed at least forty or fifty out-of-state purchasers of punch-boards. The fact that the prosecution limited the stipulation to the testimony of four of petitioners\u2019 out-of-state customers is persuasive only of the conclusion that further testimony from other out-of-state customers would have been merely cumulative. Cf. Automatic Can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>teen Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 1953, 346 U.S. 61, 65, 73 S.Ct. 1017, 97 L.Ed. 1454; Fox Film Corp. v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 1924, 296 F. 353, 356; Rosten v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 1959, 263 F.2d 620. Moreover, it would appear from the Senate Report on the Wheeler-Lea Amendment (S.Rep. No. 221, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 3-4 (1937) ) amending Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, that the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction is not intended to be affected even if only a single unfair act is involved.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-4\">\u00ab * * * After consideration the committee is of the opinion that, since the powers of the Commission in this respect are injunctive rather than punitive, the Commission should have the power to restrain an unfair act before it had become a method or practice, if, in its discretion, such restraint be in the public interest. <em>A single act may have multiple or continuing effects and may be far reaching.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Petitioners also profess lack of knowledge that the punchboards would be used for selling merchandise. What else could they have meant or intended when they advertised and sold punch-boards as \u201cmerchandise board[s]\u201d and \u201cGetzum Smokes\u201d punchboards designating certain numbers which when punched were to receive stated packs of cigarettes? To accept petitioners\u2019 profession of innocence would require more naivete than this court is willing to admit. Be that as it may, however, whether petitioners knew or did not know of the intended use to which the boards were to be put is without significance. In Jaffe v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 1943, 139 F.2d 112, rehearing denied November 22, 1943, certiorari denied 321 U.S. 791, 64 S.Ct. 790, 88 L.Ed. 1081, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">\u201cMoreover, proof of sales through the use of such push cards was unnecessary. No proof that sales actually resulted from such practices is required to make out a case against the mal-practitioner for a violation of Sec. 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45 (a).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Cf. Drath v. Federal Trade Commission, 1956, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 239 F.2d 452, 453, certiorari denied 353 U.S. 917, 77 S.Ct. 666, 1 L.Ed.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Under the rule set forth supra, we feel that the evidence herein fully justified the Examiner\u2019s findings and the issuance of a cease and desist order and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\"> Petitioners lastly object to the scope of the order, claiming that it is broader than necessary. They seem to infer that if the order is to be sustained it should be changed to include the word \u201clottery\u201d; that is, \u201cother <em>lottery </em>devices\u201d, and the words \u201cintended to be used\u201d should be deleted. We see no reason to change the form of the Commission\u2019s order and little difference between \u201cpunchboards or <em>other devices </em>which are designed or intended to be used in the sale or distribution of merchandise * * by means of a game of chance, gift enterprise or lottery scheme\u201d and \u201cpunch-boards or other <em>lottery </em>devices which are\u201d, etc. The identical form of this order has been approved in the Peerless case, supra.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, unless the remedy bears no reasonable relation to the existing unlawful practices, the Commission\u2019s discretion as to the scope of the order should not be disturbed. Federal Trade Commission v. National Lead Co., 1957, 352 U.S. 419, 428-429, 77 S.Ct. 502, 1 L.Ed.2d 438.

An order will be entered by this court enforcing it in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45 (c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-12\">. For violating a similar cease and desist order issued in 1938, action was brought against petitioners for damages and in-junctive relief. The suit was settled by stipulation in 1943 upon payment of $1500.00 damages. The stipulation for settlement provided that the plaintiff \u201chas abandoned and wishes to have dismissed without prejudice its request for injunctive relief*.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\">.
