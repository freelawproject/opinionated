Eckman, to grant him leave to appeal in forma pauperis from an order of the district court denying him permission to file a complaint and prosecute an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>there without prepayment of fees and costs. The district court certified in writing that the appeal was not taken in good faith within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">A thorough consideration of the matter leads us to the same conclusion as that reached by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Petitioner is imprisoned in the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington, where he is serving a sentence imposed upon him by the Superior Court of Alaska as punishment for the commission of the crime of forgery, a felony under the laws of Alaska. He was taken to the penitentiary on March 31, 1960 following conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\"> The complaint which petitioner unsuccessfully sought to file is entitled, \u201cIn the Matter of Application for a Writ of Mandamus\u201d and several requests are made therein for the issuance of that writ; but it is readily apparent from the complaint and petitioner\u2019s statements accompanying his motion that the action is in fact one to secure a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner contends that his commitment to the penitentiary on March 31, 1960 was void because on that date Alaska had no statute permitting it to contract with the Attorney General of the United States for the care and custody of state prisoners.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He points out that no such statute was in effect until April 16, 1960, when Ch. 133, Alaska Session Laws, 1960, become law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He argues from this that he should be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-15\">However, petitioner would not be entitled to an immediate discharge even if the commitment on March 31, 1960 was void. The validity of the judgment of conviction and sentence imposed upon him by the superior court was in no wise tainted by any invalidity of the commitment and the most that petitioner has shown is the unlawfulness of his place of imprisonment, a matter that could well be corrected by the court in which he was convicted. In re Bonner, 1894, 151 U.S. 242, 14 S.Ct. 323, 38 L.Ed. 149; Annotation 76 A.L.R. 468 at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number> But it appears that the error complained of has already been remedied; attached to petitioner\u2019s complaint as an exhibit is a copy of an \u201cAmended Judgement and Commitment\u201d made and entered by the Superior Court of Alaska under date of April 22, 1960 and this instrument contains a provision, consistent with Ch. 133 of the 1960 Session Laws of Alaska committing petitioner to the custody of the Commissioner of Health and Welfare of Alaska or his authorized representative for imprisonment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The petition is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-7\">. As a state prisoner, petitioner should have but did not exhaust the remedies available to him in the courts of Alaska or show that circumstances existed which would render state process ineffective to protect his rights. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254. His failure to make a showing would have rendered his complaint, if filed, subject to dismissal by the district court; for the same reason an appeal from an adverse judgment would be subject to dismissal here.
