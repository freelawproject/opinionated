BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The specific question raised by this case is whether the Secretary of Labor has the power under the Migratory Labor Act, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1461-1468, to impose a minimum wage scale or minimum wage fixing schedule for Mexican workers which is determined by standards other than the current prevailing domestic wage rate for like agricultural work. The District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the District Director \u25a0of the Labor Department for the Rio Grande Valley area and the Manager of Bracero\u201d Center, each being residents of the Southern District of Texas. No relief was granted against the Secretary of Labor, the Chief of the Bureau of Employment Security, Department of Labor, both residents of Washington, D. C., or the Regional Director of the Bureau of Employment Security who resides in Dallas. the \u201c</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Ordinarily we would not reach the substantive question for on such an appeal the issue is one merely of abuse of discretion pending a final hearing. General Gas Corp. v. National Utilities of Gainesville, Inc., 5 Cir., 1959, 271 F.2d 820, 825; Mansfield Hardwood Lumber Co. v. Johnson, 5 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 45, 46-47. But here it is a paradox that we have to consider (but not decide) the merits extensively to determine whether any relief properly could have been granted in the absence of the Secretary of Labor as a party. If he was indispensable in the sense of effective relief, then clearly the preliminary injunction ought not to have been granted, and these proceedings should terminate without the further cost of precious judicial time. There is also a problem of mootness which is more readily disposed of as the merits illuminate the problem generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">This Act had a triple purpose. First, .to protect migrant Mexican workers \u2014 referred to traditionally as \u201cwetbacks\u201d because of their illegal entry across the Rio Grande \u2014 from exploitation by American employers whose normal economic power was enhanced by the illegal status of the workers. Second, to afford a needed supply of agricultural workers during peak harvesting seasons. And third, to accomplish the First and Second without detrimental effect on domestic workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">The program envisaged a Migrant Labor Agreement between the Governments of Mexico and the United States<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>individual employment agreements in the form of the Standard Work Contract prescribed by the inter-governmental Agreement. United States v. Morris, 5 Cir., 1958, 252 F.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Under the statute the Secretary of Labor is authorized to establish and operate reception centers, to provide transportation to and from Mexican recruitment centers and such reception centers, to supply some temporary subsistence to workers, to assist such workers and employers in negotiating labor contracts and to guarantee performance by American employers of the provisions of the Standard Work Contract relating to wages and transportation. 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1461 (2-6). The American employer is required to agree to indemnify the United States against loss by reason of its guaranty of the individual employment contracts \u00a7 1462. The Act does not prescribe wage standards as such, although the Migrant Labor Agreement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Standard Work Contract<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> do. But it is clear that wages and standard hours of work were not to be such as to deprive willing available American workers of such jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-17\">The key to our present controversy \u2014 \u00a7 1463: \u2014 bears directly on this. It provides that no workers shall be available unless the Secretary of Labor has determined and certified that (1) sufficient domestic workers are not available, (2) the employment of Mexicans will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of domestic workers and (3) reasonable efforts have been made to attract domestic workers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-18\">The specific problem we face relates to piece-work. Apparently on the insist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>\u2022ence of the Mexican Government, the Secretary of Labor has adopted the fixed policy that the piece work rate must produce a minimum of 50^ per hour for reasonably diligent workers. The latter .qualification led to the crux of this dispute \u2014 the celebrated 90/10 formula. In a nutshell this simply means that 90% \u25a0of the Braceros working for any one employer must each week make at least 50^ per hour. The only escape was that if more than 10% averaged less than 50^ per hour, the employer might prove that such workers were incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">During the 1958 season, the Labor Department apparently followed a plan of voluntary compliance, but required a fixed minimum piece rate for specific commodities for those not complying. After numerous protests from American employers and prolonged conferences with the Department of which Congress had cognizance,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this plan was renewed for \u00cd959 but with the minimum piec\u00e9 rate for cottoii now being raised to $2.301 Addendums to the Standard Work Com tract were' required of those not demonstrating compliance and violators were informed that they would not be approved for employment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">That brings us to 1960. On June 28, 1960, the Secretary of Labor through the Regional Director at Dallas established for the Rio Grande area a ceiling of 55,-000 Mexican workers for the period July 1, 1960 through July 31, ,1960, based on the information described in the announcement and on the conditions prescribed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While this implied a need for workers which under the statute could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>be filled by Mexicans only if domestic workers were not available, it did not purport to be the unqualified determination and certification inquired by \u00a7 1463(1) (2) and (3), note 4, supra. This announced ceiling has to be read in conjunction with the order of the Director, Bureau of Employment Security, Washington, D. C., of May 17, 1960. After briefly reviewing the unsatisfactory voluntary compliance program of 1958 and 1959, this order promulgated the 90/10 wage policy for 1960 and specified a piece rate of $2.50 per cwt. for picking cotton or such higher rate as necessary to achieve 50^ per hour.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-20\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>\u201cThe employment of foreign workfers under this ceiling is conditioned on: (1) continued efforts being made to recruit domestic workers for these jobs, (2) 'domestic workers replacing foreign workers wherever possible,' (3) wage offers to 'domestic workers being not less than those made to foreign workers, and (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>posting of this ceiling in appropriate local employment offices and other public places.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">On the argument before us, we became greatly concerned that since the order made specific reference several times to cotton picking \u201cduring the 1960 cotton harvest season\u201d this case was moot. The parties thereafter by formal stipulation made explicit what the record otherwise implies that while the specific minimum piece rate of $2.50 per cwt. for cotton is moot, the 90/10 policy applies to all piece work, and these plaintiffs are employers engaged in year around agricultural activities. As to that limited phase, the case is therefore moot. But as to the basic order imposing the 90/10 policy to achieve a minimum 50{S per hour, the controversy still exists, is real and substantial as is manifested by the District Court\u2019s order enjoining the defendants from requiring compliance with \u201cany other ruling of the Labor Depart-ment which requires Plaintiffs to contract Mexican workers at wages in excess of the wage paid to domestic workers, or at wages in excess of the prevailing wage, or which requires Plaintiffs to agree to abide by the so-called 90/10 policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Attacking this order as one beyond the statutory power of the Secretary, the employers\u2019 argument is essentially this. Mexicans may not be imported if there is an adequate supply of domestic workers. Whether there is an adequate supply of domestic workers who are \u201cable, willing, and qualified * * * at the time and place needed to perform the work * * * \u201d necessarily implies that this is tested against the current domestic wage rate or practice. Consequently, the Secretary\u2019s authority in the first instance extends to determination (and certification) that there is an insufficient supply of domestic workers. He is not concerned with wages except as it is a.part of this determination. This, they say, is proved by \u00a7 1461(5) and by the requirement in the Agreement and the Work Contract that Mexican workers and the employers are to bargain on wages with but one specific qualification \u2014 that it be not less than the prevailing wage. Once Mexican workers are allowed in the area, the Secretary\u2019s authority ceases until domestic workers again become available in adequate supply. If sufficient domestic workers subsequently come into the area, the Secretary must see that preference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>is given both in new employment and in reduction of labor force<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and new employment of such domestics must be at \u201cwages and standard hours of work comparable to those offered to foreign workers.\u201d \u00a7 1463(3). The cumulative thrust of this is that the \u201cadverse effect\u201d element of \u00a7 1463(2) refers only to preference in hiring and retention.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">To this thesis may be added further arguments. Not the least of these is the likelihood that the reciprocal operation of elements (1), (2) and (3) of \u00a7 1463 necessarily relates to the current prevailing domestic wage rate. True, element (2) does not use such terms. But compliance with (3) in the actual efforts to recruit \u2014 \u201cattract\u201d domestic workers at the rate payable to Mexicans \u2014 and the ascertainment of an inadequate supply under (1) almost have to relate to the prevailing domestic wage rate. This argument gains some support from the 1955 amendments to \u00a7 1463, see note 4, supra. The Act as to elements (1) and (2) requires that the Secretary make an actual field survey and then post his findings. Inquiry on wages would have to relate to the currently prevailing domestic wage rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">This total argument has its crucial climax in the express stipulation (note 8, supra) that in promulgating the 500 per hour 90/10 policy the Secretary did not do it on the basis of the current prevailing wage. Indeed, it was further stipulated that no such survey had yet been made for the region and locality in question. If not, then on what basis may the Secretary presume to certify that a lesser wage would \u201cadversely affect the wages and working conditions of domestic\u201d workers?</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Offsetting this thesis is the powerful argument of the Secretary that if the employers are right, then element (-2) was superfluous since on this theory it was necessarily a part of element (1). Further, the Section must be read as a whole and shows a concern for more than <em>preference </em>as to lay-offs and new hirings either initially or after importation of Mexican workers. These arguments, pro and con, are certainly substantial, at least in the sense of meriting a careful analysis. But in view of the disposition we make, we think it inappropriate that we indicate, one way or the other, what conclusion should prevail. We have set them out to illuminate the critical problem of indispensable parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\"> This turns, in our judgment, not on the fact that the regulation was issued by the Secretary in Washington or for him by the Director of the Bureau of Employment Security. Nor is it affected by the stipulated fact that the Regional Director in Dallas and the two enjoined local administrators have no authority to determine policy and are required to execute policies fixed by the Department. The first presupposes that validity of the questioned regulation cannot be determined unless the promulgator is there to champion its legality. The second assumes a duty on the part of the governmental subordinate to carry out orders regularly promulgated by superior authority no matter how illegal they may be. The law, as it has developed, rejects both notions. Given a court which has jurisdiction in the sense of a case within statutory jurisdiction,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> presenting a real, not hypothetical, dispute by virtue of actions taken by local subordinates under such regulations, the superior officer is not ipso facto an indispensable party. Where the regulation is attacked as basically beyond the statutory or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>stitutional power of the Administrator,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a court, subject only to the qualification of the capability of granting effective relief, may, and must, adjudicate the issue. State of Colorado v. Toll, 1925, 268 U.S. 228, 45 S.Ct. 505, 69 L.Ed. 927; Varney v. Warehime, 6 Cir., 1945, 147 F.2d 238; Yarnell v. Hillsborough Packing Co., 1934, 5 Cir., 70 F.2d 435, 92 A.L.R. 1475; Ryan v. Amazon Petroleum Corp., 5 Cir., 1934, 71 F.2d 1, reversed on other grounds in Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 1935, 293 U.S. 388, 55 S.Ct. 241, 79 L.Ed. 446; Rood v. Goodman, 5 Cir., 1936, 83 F.2d 28. The subject is extensively treated in the Annotation, 158 A.L.R. 1126, see particularly Part III b, c, at 1132-36. The Agency or Executive Department has ample means to advance its contentions in support of the regulation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And, as has been pointed out, the court having power over subordinates in such a situation is not required to assume that an authoritative ruling by a competent court will likely be ignored by the superior who is not a party.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In the Federal approach to this problem, the answer turns on practical considerations \u2014 practical in the sense of an orderly effective administration of justice. Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 1955, 349 U.S. 48, 54, 75 S.Ct. 591, 99 L.Ed. 868. The superior is indispensable as a party when, to secure the complainant from unauthorized governmental activity, it is essential that the superior-take .or not take action. If, on the other hand, the complainants\u2019 lawful rights may be vindicated by specific action or non-action of the local subordinates pursuant to court order, the superior\u2019s presence is not indispensable. 158 A.L.R. 1126, especially 1128-1132; 2 Barron &amp; Holtzhoff, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 515 at 82, 84, Wright Supp. at page 37. All of this has been variously stated in Williams v. Fanning, 1947, 332 U.S. 490, 68 S.Ct. 188, 92 L.Ed. 95. \u201cThese [earlier] cases evolved the principle that the superior officer is an indispensable party if the decree granting the relief sought will require him to take action, either by exercising directly a power lodged in him or by having a subordinate exercise it for him.\u201d 332 U.S. at page 493, 68 S.Ct. .at page 189. In cases where a public official invades a private right either by exceeding his authority or by carrying out a mandate of his superior \u201crelief against the offending officer could be granted\u201d if doing so is \u201cwithout risk that the judgment awarded would \u2018expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public administration.\u2019 \u201d 332 U.S. at page 493, 68 S.Ct. at page 189. That the local subordinate \u201cwould be left under a command of his superior to do what the court has forbidden\u201d is, the court points out, \u201cimmaterial if the decree which is entered will effectively grant the relief desired by expending itself on the subordinate official who is before the court. * * * \u201d 332 U.S. at page 494, 68 S.Ct. at page 189. See also Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 1955, 349 U.S. 48, 54, 75 S.Ct. 591, 99 L.Ed. 868; Hynes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>v. Grimes Packing Co., 1949, 337 U.S. 86, 96-97, 69 S.Ct. 968, 93 L.Ed. 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">This means that the problem must be tested in terms of the result if, under the particular setting, the superior \u2014 not a party and hence under no coercive court order \u2014 sits tight and does absolutely nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">On that test the Secretary of Labor is here indispensable. That is demonstrated by a simple hypothesis. Were we to hold completely for the employers and declare this 90/10 policy illegal, they would gain naught by this litigation. That is because this policy is part and parcel of the affirmative determination and certification which the Secretary must make under \u00a7 1463(1, 2) before any workers may become available.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Even though we were to -hold that the Secretary may not include -that as an element, the statute still requires a determination by the Secretary that each of the conditions (1), (2) and (3) of \u00a7 1463 have been met. Until he;-makes that determination, no Mexican worker\u2014 whether awaiting transportation from a migratory station in Mexico or assignment to eligible employers at an American Reception Center \u2014 may be allowed to work or even negotiate for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Measured in terms of action by the local administrators, the result is the same. On this hypothesis, the District Court' order prohibited either of these administrators (or their assistants) from applying in any way the 90/10 \u2014 50^ per hour policy. But until the Secretary of Labor has certified the Mexican workers to be available, the local agents have nothing to operate on. The Mexican workers, wherever they may be physically, may not be assigned to work. The Court order would be ineffectual. It could grant no real relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Of course that is not to say that these employers are necessarily without some legal remedy. If the law, properly construed, does not permit the Secretary to include this 90/10 policy within element (2) of \u00a7 1463, the necessity for his prior determination and certification would not likely give him license to withhold his discretionary duty arbitrarily. Undoubtedly any such conduct is subject to some judicial scrutiny. But by whatever name called \u2014 -review under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1011, mandamus or other extraordinary writ\u2014 this would involve the Secretary directly. And for that he should, and must, be a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-17\">.

This is clearly so here as the plaintiffs\u2019 relief depends directly on a law of the United States, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1331 (a) and a law regulating commerce, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1337 (Wickard v. Filburn, 1942, 317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122). As to the latter there is no required minimum amount in controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b494-5\">. This is the case here. No question arises whether, assuming power to promulgate some minimum wage schedule, practice or policy, the instant one- is arbitrary or unreasonable. Indeed -the briefs state that if the Secretary has authority to fix a wage policy, the- 50$ per hour, $2.50 per cwt. for cotton, or the 90/10 formula is as good as any.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\"><em>. </em>The Attorney General has the statutory responsibility for the interests of the United States in any pending suit. 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 316.

But we need not decide the effect of such a judgment. We cannot assume that a decision on the merits in a court of appeals on a question of this kind, subject to review by this Court would be lightly disregarded by the immigration authorities.\u201d 349 U.S. at page 53, 75 S.Ct. at page 595.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b495-21\">.
