Knowles v. United States of America, Defendant, 1960, 182 F.Supp. 150, in which it carefully analyzed the question of law involved and reached the conclusion that the $25,000 payment was an installment and not one of a series of periodic payments within the meaning of the statute. We think that the conclusion was right, and on the basis of the written opinion the judgment of the lower court dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint is</p>\n<p id=\"b632-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
