Under these circumstances the action of the First Assistant Commissioner in refusing to extend Rusche\u2019s time for docketing the appeal was correct, and dismissal of the appeal is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-22\">Cobi\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted. Rusche\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-23\">SMITH, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
