The ease does not explore the merits of rates but is limited to a jurisdictional attack upon the power of the Commission to question the rate level under the procedural circumstances premising the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-23\">The critical event giving rise to the present issues was a contract change agreed to by Sunray and Northern on March 28, 1960. The original contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>between the parties had provided for the sale and purchase of natural gas from leaseholds in Ochiltree County, Texas, and Beaver County, Oklahoma, at 15% 0 per 1000 cubic feet of gas delivered, reserving, however, to Sunray as seller the right to process and retain all liquid hydrocarbons. On the date indicated Sunray for a consideration of 10 per Mcf relinquished its right to process and reclaim the liquid constituents from the gas then being delivered to Northern. The total contract consideration was thus raised from 15%0 per Mcf to 16%0 per Mcf.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Sunray then reported the contractual change to the Commission by filing a \u201cNotice of Change in Rate Schedule\u201d asserting the change to be effective upon date of authorization or 30 days after date of filing, whichever first occurred. The contract amendment was attached to the filing and the notation made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">\u201cThe subject contract was amended March 28, 1960, to provide for the waiver of Applicant\u2019s right to process the casinghead and gas-well gas reserves for the extraction of liquefiable hydrocarbons, and the payment to Sunray by the Purchaser of one (10) cent for such liquids in each one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of gas delivered. The subject amendment is dated March 28, 1960 and is attached hereto as Exhibit \u2018A-l\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-18\">Sunray\u2019s filing did not include a comparative statement of sales and revenues as required by the Commission\u2019s regulation in respect to change in rate level.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sun-ray succinctly stated its reason for not so doing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-19\">\u201cA comparative statement of sales and revenues in connection with the proposed change is not attached hereto for the reason that the proposed change does not change the rates or charges made for the natural gas sold to Purchaser under this contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-20\">The Federal Power Commission filed these documents on April 11 and notified Sunray of its action by form letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEY\">\u201cThis is to advise you that the rate filings listed at the bottom of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>this letter have been accepted for filing and that such rate schedules have become effective on the dates shown [May 12, 1960] upon expiration of 30 days\u2019 statutory notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aql\">Sunray and Northern interpreted these procedures as authorizing the payment of an increased contract price on and after May 12, 1960 and delivered and accepted gas from such date at 16%^ per Mcf and until July 25, 1960 when the Commission by letter refuted the contracting parties\u2019 construction of the Commission action. The Commission stated its position thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">\u201cBy the foregoing amendment, Northern agreed to increase your contract price by 1.0^ per Mcf in consideration of your relinquishing your rights to process the gas for the removal of liquid hydrocarbons. Your amendment was not accompanied by a comparative statement of sales and revenues nor by a statement in support of the increased rate. Accordingly, such amendment was not considered to be a change in rate but only a contractual vehicle under which Sunray could at a future date file a notice of change in rate. As such, the amendment was accepted for filing by the Commission\u2019s letter dated May 16, 1960.\u201d (The date is apparently a typographical error.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Upon receipt of the Commission letter-order, Northern ceased payment of the additional 1^ per Mcf; Sunray applied for reconsideration of the Commission order and was denied; and the instant petition followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">In presenting to the Commission its claim to an absolute right to payment from Northern of 16%^ per Mcf on and after March 12, 1960, Sunray asserted the finality of its original notice and the invalidity of the Commission\u2019s July 25 letter-order upon several separate jurisdictional grounds. Each was premised upon the consistent claim that Sunray\u2019s original Notice of Change in Rate Schedule was filed under the legal theory that the Commission had no rate jurisdiction over the amendment to Sunray\u2019s contract with Northern. The Commission\u2019s ruling that Sunray\u2019s original notice was entitled to acceptance and was entitled to Commission filing only as a contract change <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> apparently did not require the Commission to reach, in these proceedings, the pivotal question of whether the contract amendment effected a jurisdictional sale. In any event, Sunray in these proceedings does not preserve or press a claim of a non-jurisdictional sale. Rather, petitioner now points out that the Commission was fully apprised of Sunray\u2019s claim that such sale was non-jurisdictional because of the specific negation of a rate change in the Notice of Change in Rate Schedule; that being so apprised the Commission could manifest its disagreement with the theory by rejecting the filing as not complying with the Commission\u2019s regulations (footnote 1, supra) or by waiving the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ficiency and proceeding to examine the rate change pursuant to Sec. 4(e) of the Natural Gas Act. 52 Stat. 822, 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 717c(e). Since the Commission did neither the petitioner claims the 16%{5 price to be effective both through affirmative acceptance of the rate by the Commission in its April 11 letter and the jurisdictional limit of 30 days set upon the Commission in Sec. 4(d) of the Act. See Mississippi River Fuel Corporation v. Federal Power Comm., 3 Cir., 202 F. 2d 899. We deem petitioner\u2019s argument to be basically faulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Sec. 4(d) of the Natural Gas Act requires natural gas companies to file with the Commission all contract changes regardless of whether such changes affect the rate level or whether they do not. The basic contract together with amendments is the rate schedule which at all times must be available for Commission use and public inspection. The compulsion of Sec. 4(d) and the potential of its dual purpose are recognized and clearly set out in the Commission\u2019s regulation 154.94, supra. Paragraph (e) (1) sets forth the information required for all contract changes and (e) (2) of the additional information required when such changes are intended as notice of a proposed change in rate level. And we know of no burden placed upon the Commission to explore, at its peril and that of the public interest, the facets of a notice of contract amendment to determine the subjective legal theory that may influence the extent of notice given. Here, Sunray was required to give notice of the contract amendment regardless of whether a change in rate level was involved. The company negatived in the notice that new rate charges were then being sought and the Commission was justified in accepting the filing of the contract amendment for what it purported to be \u2014 a change of contract not affecting the rates for natural gas sold. The use of a form letter to acknowledge the acceptance of Sunray\u2019s filing, which form we understand is also used for the acceptance of a change in rate level with applicable data added, may have led Sun-ray and Northern into a mistaken interpretation of the Commission\u2019s intended action and may suggest procedural improvement for the future. But the now disputed letter-order of July 25 is not inconsistent with the earlier acceptance of Sunray\u2019s filing and cannot be used as a jurisdictional bar to the Commission\u2019s right to review and determine the question of rates. The Commission was correct in holding that neither by its affirmative action nor by its non-action was it bound to accept a new rate, the existence of which was expressly denied by the filing company.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The action of the Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-6\">.
