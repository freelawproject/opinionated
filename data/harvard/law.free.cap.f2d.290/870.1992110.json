We agree with the result reached by the Tax Court and the reasons given in Judge Bruce\u2019s opinion. Gregg Co. of Delaware v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1956, 239 F.2d 498. We note a minor error in the Tax Court opinion, 34 T.C. 829, at page 837, where the statement is made that the record discloses no dividend payments on petitioner's stock. There were in fact payments of dividends in the amount of $700 in each of two of the years in question, as shown by the balance sheets of the corporate tax returns. Even in those two years by far the greater portion of petitioner\u2019s earnings were distributed, by vote of the directors, to its stockholders in the guise of bond interest. These token payments of dividends, in the light of the entire earning and dividend history, strengthen rather than weaken the Tax Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion as to the nature of the so-called bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-22\">Decision and order of the Tax Court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
