In August of 1958 a complaint was filed against it charging violations of the branding, invoicing and advertising sections of the Fur Products Labeling Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 69 et seq. Counsel for the Commission later moved to amend the complaint to add further alleged violations (both prior and subsequent to the date of the original complaint); the Hearing Examiner denied the motion. Although counsel for respondent failed to appeal that ruling within the prescribed period, they later obtained leave from the full Commission to amend the complaint through a collateral certification proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-22\">After a full hearing, the Examiner found that petitioner had committed numerous violations of the Act. On appeal, the Commission adopted his findings and ordered petitioner to cease and desist from (1) misbranding furs as to all particulars enumerated in \u00a7 4(2) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 69b (2); <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) falsely or de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>eeptively invoicing fur products as to the information covered by \u00a7 5(b) (1) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 69c(b);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) falsely and deceptively advertising in violation of five specific requirements of \u00a7 5(a), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 69c (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">Petitioner here claims that the Commissioner erred in permitting a collateral attack on the Examiner\u2019s denial of the motion to amend the complaint. Further, that Hoving was wrongfully denied an exemption, pursuant to Rule 39,16 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.39,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from compliance with the requirements of the Act. Alternatively, it asserts the invalidity of \u201cthat portion of the rule\u201d limiting the scope of the exemption because the Commission, in promulgating the rules, failed to include a \u201cconcise general statement\u201d of the basis and purpose of the regulations. Finally, Hov-ing urges that the evidence in the case does not support such a broad cease and desist order.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-22\">Evidence was submitted before the Commission showing violations of all three general categories of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Act \u2014 misbranding, false invoicing and deceptive advertising. One group of violations cutting across all categories concerned the marketing of bleached white mink muffs and mink \u201csets\u201d (muff, hat and ascot choker). The fur pieces were made from waste fur of mink tails, flanks, bellies, etc. \u2014 and Bonwit Teller nowhere informed its customers of that fact.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the invoice, the only document likely to be retained by the customer, the petitioner failed to inform the buyer that the fur had been bleached. Hoving argues that the broad order surely cannot be supported by only one provea instance of misbranding of a mink muff. Although Commission investigators actually bought only one muff, the uniformly misleading advertising \u2014 and the invoicing violations \u2014 on that item support the inference that many of the waste fur mink muffs and sets were sold similarly mislabeled.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\">The greatest number of violations shown were in petitioner\u2019s advertising copy. Most of those involved the failure to use properly the Fur Products Name Guide, 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.0, or to identify the country of origin of the fur producing animal. Petitioner\u2019s principal argument is that the majority of violations were \u201ctechnical\u201d and \u201ctrivial\u201d ones and that the Commission abused its discretion in the breadth of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Administrative agencies have great discretion in framing their orders and are empowered to enjoin related unlawful acts which may occur in the future ; there must merely be a reasonable relationship between the facts found and the breadth of the order issued. Federal Trade Commission v. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 1959, 359 U.S. 385, 79 S.Ct. 818, 3 L.Ed.2d 893; National Labor Relations Board v. Express Publishing Co., 1941, 312 U.S. 426, 436, 61 S.Ct. 693, 85 L.Ed. 930. The court, at first glance, might be tempted to agree with petitioner that some of the violations found below are trivial ones not deserving of overly broad prophylactic relief. It is difficult to imagine an area of expert and technical competence, however, where it would be less seemly for this court to second guess an administrative tribunal concerning the seriousness of offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Although petitioner urges upon us the Supreme Court\u2019s apparent reliance on a numerically impressive list of offenses while affirming a broad injunctive order in F. T. C. v. Mandel, supra, footnote 8 at page 393 of 359 U.S., at page 824 of 79 S.Ct., we do not think the number of violations proved in every case should be the sole determinant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The failure to inform the public of the use of waste furs in its labeling, invoicing and advertising is probably a more serious breach of the Act than any of those found in Mandel. The more than a dozen violations characterized as minor by petitioner support the inference that Hoving has been generally rather lax in conforming to the requirements of the Act. If the courts were to start indiscriminately whittling away at the \u201csentences\u201d of administrative agencies, they would soon be inundated with such requests. We cannot in each case substitute our judgment for that of the Federal Trade Commission; the facts of the instant case do not present the clear abuse of discretion necessary to warrant modification of the administrative order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number> There is nothing in petitioner\u2019s first three points. Hoving was adequately put on notice as to the charges against it in the proceedings below. The Commission found that the amended complaint was a proper question for the certification procedure; minus a showing of unfairness or prejudice, this court will not dictate to the Federal administrative bodies concerning minor procedural technicalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The Commission, in making rules for the Fur Products Labeling Act, followed the procedures of Section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1003. Notice of public hearing on the proposed regulations was published in the Federal Register on May 3, 1952, 17 Fed.Reg. 4121 (1952). Interested parties were heard both orally and through submission of written material; among the subjects discussed was the exemption here in question. Regulations so promulgated will not be declared void <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> merely because of a purely technical flaw in failing to include <em>within the Buies themselves </em>a \u201cconcise general statement\u201d of basis and purpose, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1003 (b); Courtaulds (Alabama) Inc. v. Kintner, D.C.D.C.1960, 182 F.Supp. 207, 212. Both the basis and purpose are obvious from the specific governing legislation and the entire trade was fairly apprised of them by the procedure followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The manufacturer\u2019s price of the furs contained in the mink muffs in issue here was less than $5.00. Petitioner claims that therefore it was entitled to the Rule 39 exemption from the disclosure requirements of the Act. The Commission held however that the exemption was inapplicable because Hoving had made \u201crepresentations\u201d concerning the furs, supra footnote 4. Petitioner urges that representations should be interpreted as misrepresentations, of which it asserts its innocence. We think that the Commission was correct in its interpretation. The exemption may have been intended to allow fur accessories, collars, sleeves, etc., to avoid the full disclosure requirements of the Act \u2014 if the accessories were made up of cheap fur and marketed without any separate representations as to the fur. Even if such an interpretation were erroneous certainly the advertising and sale of a \u201cmink muff\u201d without effective notice that it was made of waste fur qualifies as a misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-13\">. \u201cSee. 4.

Such a numerical standard would in all probability seriously hamper the agency in its function of protecting the virtually defenseless modern consumer. See Gib-ney, The Operators, Chapter 2 (1960). If the Commission, to justify a broad order, had to obtain direct evidence of large numbers of labeling and invoicing violations, the strain on the always somewhat inadequate investigatory arm of the agency would be increased tremendously. It is probably significant in this regard that direct evidence of numerous advertising violations, easily and cheaply obtainable, was produced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b855-20\">. Petitioner rather strangely contends that only the limitation on the exemption is void. If proper rule making procedures had not been followed, all of the rules would be nullified, including the exemption upon which petitioner relies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
