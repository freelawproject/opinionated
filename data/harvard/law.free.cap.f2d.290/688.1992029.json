Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>tioner distinguishes the applicant for registration as a broker-dealer from the applicant for registration of securities, since the latter is allowed to make offers, but not sales, while the application is pending. Section 15(a) <em>is </em>a protection, when a broker-dealer applies for registration, that does not exist when an issue of securities is registered. Nevertheless, Section 15(a), alone and isolated, was not intended as the only safeguard of the public interest. Section 15(a) does not stand alone; it is integrally linked with Section 15(b) of the Act, and together they form part of the regulatory scheme for the long-range protection of investors. See Peoples Securities Co. et al. v. S. E. C., 5 Cir., 1961, 289 F.2d 268. When Mr. D\u2019Antoni filed his application for registration, he placed himself under the Commission\u2019s \u201cscrutiny\u201d. The withdrawal of an ungranted application for registration as a broker-dealer may affect the public interest as well as the grant of an application. Cf. Columbia General Investment Corp. v. S. E. C., 5 Cir., 1959, 265 F.2d 559. By attaching important consequences, vitally affecting the applicant and his future status, to the revelation of improper activities on the <em>applicant\u2019s </em>part, Congress indicated that an applicant subjects himself to the Commission\u2019s scrutiny from the moment he files his application for registration. He cannot escape those consequences by withdrawing in the face of an S.E.C. investigation. All the sanctions enumerated in Section 15(b) to be taken <em>before </em>the application becomes effective, would be nullified \u2014 indeed, they would be meaningless \u2014 if we held that an applicant had the absolute right to withdraw voluntarily. This Court did not overlook Section 15(a) in the original opinion, and petitioner\u2019s reliance on its provisions here does not persuade us that the reasons assigned in our first opinion are in any way erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">(2) D\u2019Antoni, Inc., contends the Court erred in holding that the Commission did not have to support its order revoking the Company\u2019s broker-dealer registration by showing that actual injuries or losses were suffered. The petitioner\u2019s argument assumes that the purpose of the Act is merely to protect investors against \u201ccontinuing\u201d injury at the hands of those guilty of misconduct. This interpretation is far too narrow: the Act is also designed to protect the investing public against undue financial risks and future violations. The need for such protection is not \u201cindefinite and equivocal,\u201d as petitioner argues, where, as here, in the face of repeated warnings by the Commission staff, the broker wilfully disregarded one of the most important rules of the Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">The petition for rehearing is</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\">.
