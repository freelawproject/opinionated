Its shares were acquired by a corporation which we shall call \u201cVirginia.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Virginia was a wholly new ownership. Virginia sold the Winfield assets keeping ownership of the corporate shell.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And Winfield never again engaged in the window and automatic stoker business. A new business formerly operated by Virginia was put into its existing shell. The new business made money. Can the Winfield loss incurred before Virginia acquired Winfield be carried over to lessen Virginia\u2019s tax under Section 122(b)?</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Virginia starts out with a finding of fact which it is very happy to have. The Tax Court found that the transactions outlined above were carried on for a business purpose and not with a view to tax avoidance. 33 T.C. 788 (1960). Section 129 of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A., therefore, is out of the way, although the Commissioner is a bit grudging in its acknowledgment of the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-15\">In spite of the taxpayer\u2019s earnest and very able argument, we think Libson Shops, Inc. v. Koehler, 1957, 353 U.S. 382, 77 S.Ct. 990, 1 L.Ed.2d 924, is unmistakably decisive of this ease. In that case 16 women\u2019s apparel shops, separately incorporated but owned by the same people, were merged with a management corporation to form one corporation called Libson Shops, Inc. Three of these corporations, prior to the merger, showed net operating losses. The taxpayer claimed a deduction of these pre-merger losses as a carry over under Section 122. The Supreme Court said no.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-16\">The basis of the Court\u2019s decision is directly applicable to this case and we think leaves no doubt of what it meant. Mr. Justice Burton, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Court, pointed out that the government was contending \u201cthat the carry-over privilege is not available unless there is a continuity of business enterprise.\u201d Id., 353 U.S. at page 386, 77 S.Ct. at page 992. Then the opinion goes on to say that this requirement of continuity of business enterprise accords \u201cwith the legislative history of the carry-over and carry-back provisions.\u201d The Court cites the legislative history pointing out that the provisions were enacted to \u201cameliorate the unduly drastic consequences of taxing income strictly on an annual basis. They were designed to permit a taxpayer to set off its lean years against its lush years, and to strike something-like an average taxable income computed over a period longer than one year.\u201d Ibid. (Footnote omitted.) That case is a stronger case for the taxpayer than the one before us. The shareholders re- \u25a0 mained the same in these various Libson corporations. The same business was carried on after the merger as before. They all continued to sell women\u2019s apparel.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Since the Supreme Court said that was insufficient for the application of Section 122, this is an a fortiori case. Here there was no continuity of business and there was no continuity of ownership. The taxpayer\u2019s hopeful reliance upon footnote 9 on page 390 of the report of Libson, page 994 of 77 S.Ct., is misplaced. The Supreme Court was simply confining its decision to the facts before it. But the thrust of that decision easily includes such a case as this. This result accords with what other circuits have been saying in applying the Libson decision. Bookwalter v. Hutchens Metal Products, Inc., 8 Cir., 1960, 281 F.2d 174; Mill Ridge Coal Co. v. Patterson, 5 Cir., 264 F.2d 713.

As originally presented this case involved a question about a sale of the assets because Virginia claimed a loss was an \u201cordinary and necessary business expense.\u201d But the Tax Court held that the taxpayer had failed to prove its case and taxpayer\u2019s counsel at the argument conceded that that finding of fact could not be disturbed by us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b725-5\">.
