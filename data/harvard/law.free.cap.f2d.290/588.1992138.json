The question is solely one of New Jersey law since all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>operative facts occurred in New Jersey and federal jurisdiction is by reason of diversity only. We conclude that the trial judge was right and that there was not sufficient testimony on which the plaintiff was entitled to have his case submitted to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
