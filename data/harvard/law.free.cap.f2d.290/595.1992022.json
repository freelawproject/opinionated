KIRKPATRICK.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-14\"> United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate in place of Judge O\u2019CONNELL, pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28, United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b644-12\">WORLEY, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">The sole issue here is whether there is likelihood of purchaser confusion within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d) between the marks of the parties when applied to their respective goods. The trademark Trial and Appeal Board held in the negative and dismissed an opposition by appellant, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, to an application by appellee, Crown 400 Corporation, for registration of \u201cScotty\u201d for use on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAT\">\u201cMops for Polishing, Dusting, Washing and Scrubbing Floors, Walls, Ceilings, Woodwork and Furniture.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-18\">First use on September 18, 1957, is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-19\">The opposition is based on opposer\u2019s prior use and registration of a number of trademarks consisting of or comprising \u201cScotch,\u201d and marks connoting \u201cScotch\u201d for a variety of products. Specific registrations pertinent here are \u201cScotch\u201d for pressure sensitive adhesive tape,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and for coated abrasives,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201cScotch Boy\u201d polish for varnished, painted, lacquered, and enameled surfaces.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Opposer also alleges, and applicant does not dispute, that prior to applicant\u2019s alleged date of first use opposer extended usage of its \u201cScotch\u201d trademark to household dusting fabric. The record further shows opposer\u2019s use of \u201cScotch-Tred\u201d for decorative non-slip floor covering material and \u201cScotch-Brite\u201d for abrasive scouring pads.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, opposer uses a cartoon character representing a small boy dressed in Scottish apparel in connection with the goods sold under its \u201cScotch\u201d trademarks and specifically refers to the boy as \u201cScotty MeTape\u201d when the mark is used in association with the display of its pressure sensitive adhesive tape products.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-20\">The majority of the board held that, in view of the differences in the respective marks of the parties and the differences in the goods to which they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>applied, confusion of purchasers was not likely to occur.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Opposer principally contends that, in view of its \u201cScotch\u201d brand marks for various household goods, purchasers seeing applicant\u2019s \u201cScotty\u201d mark on mops would think they had a common origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Applicant, in support of its position, contends that opposer has no monopoly in a Scotch theme or connotation <em>per. se; </em>that opposer does not use the term \u201cScotty\u201d as a trademark for any of its goods; and that the goods upon which it does apply its \u201cScotch\u201d brand marks are not of the same descriptive properties as sponge mops. Moreover, applicant urges that the goods of opposer which are most closely related to mops are sold under marks radically different from \u201cScotty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">While we appreciate applicant\u2019s arguments, together with the authorities cited in support thereof, we are not convinced that there is no likelihood of confusion as to source or origin between the household dusting fabric bearing the \u201cScotch\u201d brand mark, and applicant\u2019s \u201cScotty\u201d mops for polishing, <em>dusting, </em>washing and scrubbing floors.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Under the facts here we find it difficult to disagree with the following views from the dissenting opinion below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">\u201cAlthough mops and dusting cloths are specifically different, they are nevertheless products which might readily be assumed to originate with a single producer or seller if sold under the same or similar marks. And it is my opinion, that the mark opposer uses on its dusting cloths \u2018Scotch\u2019 and applicant\u2019s mark \u2018Scotty\u2019 create substantially similar commercial impressions so that there would be a reasonable likelihood of purchaser confusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">At the very least the matter is doubtful and we feel obliged to resolve the doubt in favor of the first user. The United States Time Corp. v. Tennenbaum, 267 F.2d 327, 46 C.C.P.A. 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">The decision appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-15\">. Reg. No. 417,265 issued October 18, 1945.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-21\">. Reg. No. 577,689 issued July 21, 1953.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b644-22\">. Reg. No. 418,129 issued December 4, 1945.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b644-23\">. The board\u2019s decision listed both \u201cScotch-Tred\u201d and \u201cScotch-Brite\u201d as registered trademarks, although neither certificate of registration appears in the record here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\">. In addition, the board noted that although applicant alleged use of its \u201cScotty\u201d mark since September 18, 1957, it had been affirmatively shown by the testimony of applicant\u2019s president that it had never made any sales under that mark. The board recommended that should applicant prevail on the inter partes issue its application should be re-examined in light of its non-use of the mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b645-16\">SMITH, Judge, with whom KIRKPATRICK, Judge, joins</author>\n<p id=\"AN4\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">The words \u201cScotch\u201d and \u201cScotty\u201d are common and well-understood English words which are so distinct in appearance, sound and meaning that we do not think confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers would be likely when the marks are used on the respective goods of the parties. We would, therefore, affirm the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
