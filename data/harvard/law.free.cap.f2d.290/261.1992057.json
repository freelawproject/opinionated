The order also directed both parties to reimburse members admitted to the union for all dues collected less than thirty days after their admission ; and for initiation fees if they had remained at work for less than thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The facts on which the controversy turned were as follows. The company, a manufacturer of wire products has a factory in Yonkers, New York, where it employs forty or fifty men. It has a \u201chiring hall\u201d in Manhattan, not conveniently accessible to its factory, and for that reason it has arranged with the union of which all its employees are members that, when an applicant wishes to be employed he may go directly to the Company\u2019s general manager in Yonkers who examines him and passes on his qualifications. If he approves the applicant, he accepts him and gives him two cards, one of which is a \u201cfederal income tax form,\u201d and the other an application to be admitted to the union containing \u201ca dues checkoff authorization card.\u201d These he tells the applicant to take to the Union\u2019s \u201cShop Steward,\u201d who explains to the applicant what will be deducted from his pay for initiation fee and dues. The \u201cShop Steward\u201d tells the applicant that he has to sign the cards \u201cwithin a day or two\u201d and the applicant almost always signs within two days. The Board held that this practice was a denial of the delay to all applicants of a period of thirty days granted by the proviso to \u00a7 8(a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Section 8(a) (3) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cby discrimination * * * to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization\u201d and if the statute had stopped there the employer in the case at bar would have violated that section by \u201cencouraging membership\u201d in Local 810. However, Congress attached a proviso to this section which declared that the \u201cAct\u201d shall not \u201cpreclude * * * an agreement with a labor organization * * * to require as a condition of employment membership therein on or after the thirtieth day following the beginning of such employment;\u201d and in the case at bar this gave an employee thirty days after he began work within which to join Local 810. The Board held that the employer and the union were guilty under \u00a7 8(a) (3) because employees were not allowed thirty days within which to decide whether to join the union after they had been employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The testimony is not as clear as we could wish, but it certainly was enough to justify the Board\u2019s conclusion that applicants understood before they would be allowed to work that they must accept liability for the membership due of $4 for the first thirty days and $25 for the initiation fee. The \u201cShop Steward\u201d says that he told applicants to return the card \u201cnext day or the day after;\u201d and the \u201cGeneral Manager\u201d told them that there would be \u201cpartial amounts\u201d deducted from the second, third and fourth weeks\u2019 wages to make up the initiation fee. The first month\u2019s due was also deducted from the wages earned; because, when the applicant \u201cis in the union for thirty days, he automatically owes four dollars for that month, union dues.\u201d Therefore during the first thirty days of employment the employee paid not only an initiation fee, but one month\u2019s dues. We do not see how in the face of the language and of uniform conformity with it, there can be any doubt that it was at least permissible for the Board to find that applicants were told that they must concede the withholding of these sums from their wages during the first month. The Board is affirmed on the issue of an \u201cunfair labor practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>As to the issue of reimbursement the Supreme Court on April 17 in Local 60 etc. v. N. L. R. B., 81 S.Ct. 875, 879, handed down a decision holding that the \u201cBrown-Olds\u201d doctrine may not be used \u201cpunitively,\u201d but only \u201cremedially.\u201d In the case at bar the Board ordered reimbursement of any initiation fee deducted within thirty days after the employee began work, provided the employees did not continue to work for thirty days. The Board was right in reimbursing no other fees, because, although the fee was not due until the period had elapsed, it then did become due and it made no difference if it had been previously paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We understand the Board\u2019s order to require the respondents to reimburse all employees for union dues assessed against them during the first thirty days after they were employed, even though they may have paid their initiation fee meanwhile. Payment of the fee alone may, or may not, have made the employee a member of the union for the first thirty days; that question we need not answer. In either case the statute is peremptory that the employee, if not coerced, has this period free of dues to the union; it is a condition upon the right of the union and the employer to take him on at all. Such a \u201creimbursement\u201d is not \u201cpunitive,\u201d the reason for distinguishing between it and an initiation fee is that the fee covers permanent membership, while any benefit from the first due is limited to the period for which it is assessed. Reimbursement is therefore \u201cremedial\u201d within the language of Harlan, J., in Local 60, etc. v. N. L. R. B., since it enables \u201cthe Board to take measures designed to recreate the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no unfair labor practice.\u201d By hypothesis the unlawful payment of the due was coerced, and the repayment of the whole amount merely put the employee in the same position he would have been in had the statute been obeyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">However, as in our decision in National Labor Relations Board v. Revere Metal Art Co., 280 F.2d 96, 101, we will not direct the Board to make an inquiry in each case how far the employee was coerced. We there said: \u201cThough the Board might have excluded the employees who had voluntarily signed union cards before September 1 from the reimbursement provision, it did not abuse its discretion in not doing so since these employees may well have remained in the union only because of the status it had unlawfully acquired. For the courts to require a determination of the attitude of each employee in every case would impose impossible administrative burdens.\u201d The Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
