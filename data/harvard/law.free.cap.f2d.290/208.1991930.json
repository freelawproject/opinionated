Nicholson, Special Atty., Admiralty &amp; Shipping Section, Dept, of Justice, Washington, D.

A motion for leave to prosecute the appeal in forma pauperis and to obtain a copy of the reporter\u2019s transcript of the trial at the expense of the United States was made to the district court. That court granted leave for libelants to prosecute their appeal in forma pauperis but denied the motion to have the reporter\u2019s transcript prepared at the expense of the United States. The district judge said on that motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-15\">\u201cIt is my view that the questions on appeal can be, or may be presented adequately on the Clerk\u2019s file, namely, the pleadings, findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment in the case, and that a reporter\u2019s transcript is unnecessary to properly test these questions on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 753(f) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"anl-dedup-0\">\u201cFees for transcripts furnished in criminal or habeas corpus proceedings to persons allowed to sue, defend, or appeal in forma pauperis shall be paid by the United States out of money appropriated for that purpose. Fees for transcripts furnished in other proceedings to persons permitted to appeal in forma pauperis shall also be paid by the United States <em>if the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the appeal is not frivolous but presents a substantial question.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-17\">The district judge did not make the certificate mentioned in the above section.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-18\">The appellants were injured when a fellow employee released the Rottmer releasing apparatus on a life boat. The appellants do not contend that the releasing apparatus was defective or unfit for the purposes for which it was being used, thereby rendering the vessel unsea-worthy. They do contend that \u201cfit\u201d apparatus can be used in an improper way, rendering the vessel unseaworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-19\">The trial judge ruled that the only question on appeal is one of law and that in his view a reporter\u2019s transcript is not necessary to determine this question. The appellants have not brought to our attention any facts that convince us that the ruling of the trial judge should be disregarded and that this court should make the certificate referred to in Section 753(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-20\">Libelant\u2019s motion for a transcript at the expense of the United States is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
