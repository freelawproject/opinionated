The question here is whether appellee is, as the District Court held, entitled to recover from appellant the fee for his legal services which had been agreed upon when he ceased being appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-21\">With respect to the advice appellee gave the National Conference, the District Court found that he \u201cdid not do anything militating against the interests of his former client\u201d and that he did not represent the Conference. Though ap-pellee was indiscreet, because we do not think these findings clearly wrong we affirm the judgment. Appellant\u2019s counterclaim was rightly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
