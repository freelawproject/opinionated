Pacific Freight Lines v. United States, 9 Cir., 239 F.2d 191; Wasserman v. Perugini, 2 Cir., 173 F.2d 305; Bullock v. United States, D.C.N.J., 72 F.Supp. 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-17\">Also, it should be noted that some of the problems of Roth v. Davis, 9 Cir., 231 F.2d 681, and Molnar v. National Broadcasting Co., 9 Cir., 231 F.2d 684, lurk here. Plaintiff named First Doe, Second Doe, Third Doe, Fourth Doe, Fifth Doe and Sixth Doe as defendants, saying First, Second and Third were employees of the United States and Fourth, Fifth and Sixth were employees of the City and County of San Francisco. The Does are not listed as parties on the appeal and where they went, we do not know. Anyway, throwing in a bunch of Does in federal pleading without knowing why is a hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-18\">After notice and argument, the case was dismissed in the trial court under the district court\u2019s Rule 14 reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-19\">\u201cAt a time fixed by the Court at least every six months, the Clerk in open court, under the supervision of the Master Calendar Judge, shall call all civil actions pending in which no steps have been taken for six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-20\">\u201cNotice of the calling shall be mailed to all attorneys of record. If none of the parties nor their attorneys appear, or if good cause for the lack of prosecution is not shown, the Court may dismiss the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-21\">Promptly after dismissal, the plaintiff-appellant moved to vacate the order of dismissal. Hearing was had on the motion and relief was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-22\">Due to practical considerations in the district court clerk\u2019s office the dismissal calendar is prepared, we understand, only twice a year. Thus, some laggard plaintiffs can dally for eleven' months and others for ten, nine, eight and seven months. And there is the class that can only dally for six months. This plain? tiff\u2019s docket had the last \u201cstep\u201d on. it six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>months and 28 days before the notice of a dismissal hearing was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The excuses of counsel for not pressing the case are not too good, but there is no evidence of intent to abandon the case. And the policy of the law is to try cases on their merits. Dismissal is what counsel deserves. The client deserves a little better. We hold, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s discretion was improperly exercised. We think in the seventh month the plaintiff is entitled to some more consideration than one in his eleventh month.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The final order of dismissal as to the United States on the federal tort claim is vacated, but if the government can show some particular prejudice suffered in the intervening six months and 28 days in question, then the district court is at liberty to again consider whether the action should be dismissed. Cf. Jarva v. United States, 9 Cir., 280 F.2d 892; Russell v. Cunningham, 9 Cir., 279 F.2d 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">If the case is to go forward, the trial court certainly is justified in expediting the case and putting plaintiff\u2019s counsel on a no-nonsense basis.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
