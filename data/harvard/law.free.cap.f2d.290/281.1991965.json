See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5179, 5173(b), 5180, 5601(a) (1), (4) and (7). He now asserts that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">It appears from the record that the defendant was apprehended by government officers at the still site. There is also evidence that immediately prior to his arrest, he was observed at the still, pouring liquid into one of the fermentation tanks which was later found to contain \u201cspent mash\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">The statute stating the enumerated offenses chargeable for violation of the distilled spirits provisions also erects certain evidential presumptions in favor of guilt, based upon the factum of presence at the still site. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5601 (a) and (b). Specifically it is provided as to each offense charged herein that the presence of the defendant at the still site \u201cshall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury * * The defendant here did attempt to explain his presence at the site by stating that the still was unknown to him prior to the day in question, and he accidentally came upon it while tending cattle and inspecting his fences. The explanation, however, was for the jury and it found against defendant on all four counts. And, in our view, there is substantial evidence to sustain the verdict as to each count in the indictment. See Reynolds v. United States, 10 Cir., 1961, 289 F.2d 698; Corbin v. United States, 10 Cir., 253 F.2d 646; Choate v. United States, 6 Cir., 277 F.2d 804; Johnson v. United States, 4 Cir., 276 F.2d 84; Johnson v. United States, 6 Cir., 271 F.2d 596; McIntire v. United States, 10 Cir., 217 F.2d 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">, In addition, appellant asserts that the court erred in instructing the jury on certain inconsistencies between the government\u2019s proof at the trial and at the preliminary hearing. The court said, \u201c * * * the fact that the officer didn\u2019t say everything in the transcript that he says here today doesn\u2019t mean that he hasn\u2019t told the truth both times. So, I give you that now just to let you understand that there isn\u2019t any vital difference between the testimony here and in the preliminary hearing when you consider the testimony in the hearing.\u201d It was made plain to the jurors, however, that they were free to weigh the evidence and apply the law thereto. The statements made by the court properly served to assist the jury toward an \u201cintelligent understanding of the legal and factual issues involved\u201d, Tyler v. Dowell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Inc., 10 Cir., 274 F.2d 890, 897, and they were in no way prejudicial to the defendant. Cf. Billeci v. United States, 87 U.S. App.D.C. 274, 184 F.2d 394, 24 A.L.R.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
