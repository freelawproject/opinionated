The district court concluded that the appellant did not meet the burden of proof necessary to show that appellee\u2019s husband was within the terms of the exclusion clause stated in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-21\">The insurance policy provided for double indemnity coverage if the insured died as the result of an accident. The insured met his untimely death along with his brother when the plane in which he was riding crashed. The insured\u2019s wife then instituted this present action under review seeking the double recovery under the insured\u2019s policy with the appellant. The appellant defended on the grounds that the double indemnity clause was not applicable to the wife\u2019s claim because of the exclusion clause contained within the insurance contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-22\">The district court noted that it could not say with assurance that there was no adequate basis for the jury\u2019s conclusion. After reviewing the evidence, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>elude that reasonable men could reach different conclusions from the evidence presented. See, Boeing v. Shipman, 411 F.2d 365, 374 (5th Cir. 1969). The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-14\">. \u201cExclusions from coverage . . .
