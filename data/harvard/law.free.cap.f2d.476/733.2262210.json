Nee, the chief Government witness, testified that Newman directed him to undertake the interceptions in order to collect politically useful information of the plans of Newman\u2019s opponents (N.T. 93-94).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The interceptions continued for approximately one week. Each day Nee would service the recording device by removing the tape recorder from the telephone line and later playing the contents of the tape for Newman (N.T. 108-121). The tape recorder was discovered when Nee apparently inadvertently set it on broadcast, rather than record (N.T. 124). Nee was indicted for his participation and subsequently entered a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">The defendant urges each of three contentions as a basis for reversal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">I. The trial court erred when it denied him the opportunity to call the United States Attorney as a witness to impeach Nee\u2019s credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-12\">II. The trial court erred when it refused his request, made in the midst of the trial, to hear the contents of the tape found on the tape recorder. Neither the tape nor its contents were received in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-13\">III. The trial court committed plain error in its charge to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-14\">We shall consider these contentions in the above order.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">Newman contends that he has been denied his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process. Specifically, he argues that the refusal by the trial court to allow him the opportunity to call the United States Attorney thwarted his efforts to impeach the credibility of Nee by showing a bargain had been reached between the Government and Nee concerning the sentence for Nee\u2019s admitted participation in illegal electronic surveillance and his possible prosecution for perjury before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-17\">Newman claims Nee\u2019s explicit denial of a bargain on cross-examination<footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>inconsistent with the following statement made by the United States Attorney during a conference outside of the presence of the jury (\u201che\u201d refers to Nee):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-4\">\u201cHe indicated if we indicate our good faith as best we can that he will disclose these facts at that time and we will then proceed to prosecute those persons who are responsible, but he has a Fifth Amendment right to I think avoid getting into those other offenses.\u201d (N.T. 146)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Newman reads that statement to suggest that Nee had agreed to testify about previous wiretaps he had undertaken involving persons not connected with the trial in return for preferential treatment. However, the record, as a whole, makes clear that the United States Attorney\u2019s statement does not support that contention. Nee, instead of agreeing to testify in future trials, \u201csteadfastly refused to tell about them because he [was] in genuine fear of physical harm\u201d (N.T. 145). The reason behind the out-of-court discussion, as the prosecutor made clear, was a concern that the court, by one of its questions, had opened the door to cross-examination concerning the details of the previous wiretaps. The United States Attorney felt that if Nee refused to answer the questions and relied on his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, his credibility would be damaged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>In the alternative, Newman suggests the United States Attorney\u2019s statement may be read as a suggestion that Nee had agreed to disclose other facts in prosecutions against other persons in return for an indication of good faith by the prosecutor not to prosecute him for his possible previous perjury before the Grand Jury. This suggestion is equally misplaced. The court conducted a lengthy discussion out of the hearing of the jury, where the prosecutor denied the existence of any bargains, and he emphasized that his office had not reached a decision on whether to prosecute Nee for perjury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADL\">Although this court has consistently held that defense counsel has available the right to show that the testimony of a Government witness was given in reliance on a promise of a lighter sentence, or other preferential treatment, United States v. Murray, 445 F.2d 1171, 1174 (3d Cir. 1971); <em>e. g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>United States v. Migliorino, 238 F.2d 7 (3d Cir. 1956), the district court has wide discretion with respect to the examination of witnesses. Hayes v. United States, 329 F.2d 209, 218 (8th Cir. 1964). It may properly refuse to allow the defense to call the prosecutor if it does not believe that \u201che possesses information vital to the defense.\u201d Gajewski v. United States, 321 F.2d 261, 268-269 (8th Cir. 1963); <em>cf. </em>Fisher v. United States, 231 F.2d 99 (9th Cir. 1956); <em>see also </em>United States v. Maloney, 241 F. Supp. 49 (W.D.Pa.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The decision in Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 765, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972), does not aid Newman\u2019s claim that the district court\u2019s refusal to allow him to call the United States Attorney mandates a new trial. The rationale underlying the Court\u2019s determination in <em>Giglio </em>is inapplicable to the facts presented in this record. <em>Giglio </em>dealt with evidence of a promise of freedom from prosecution for a key government witness, discovered <em>after </em>the trial, which was inconsistent with explicit denials of leniency made both by that witness and the prosecutor during the trial. In that situation, the Court felt, the suppression by the prosecutor\u2019s office of what was material evidence deprived the defendant of his due process rights as guaranteed in Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L. Ed.2d 1217 (1959), and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). See Giglio, <em>supra, </em>405 U.S. at 154-155, 92 S.Ct. 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Here, however, there is no evidence that the prosecutor suppressed evidence. The prosecutor explicitly denied to the court, on the record, both as a member of the bar and as an officer of the court, making any bargains or agreements with Nee. In United States v. Hykel, 461 F.2d 721 (3d Cir. 1972), the defendant contended that he had been prevented from showing that the testimony of a witness was prompted by her desire to avoid prosecution. Judge Hunter explained :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-9\">\u201cThe present case is not like Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S. Ct. 765, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). The opinion in that case makes clear that where a key Government witness has been promised that he will not be prosecuted if he testifies, a failure to disclose the promise may deny a defendant due process of law. In the present case, however, there is no evidence that the Government made any such promise to Mrs. Lawson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">461 F.2d at 727; <em>cf. </em>United States ex rel. Dale v. Williams, 459 F.2d 763, 765 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">We believe that on these facts the court properly concluded that Newman\u2019s request was \u201cirrelevant to this case. ...\u201d (N.T. 647).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">Newman next contends that the failure by the trial court to grant his request for the examination and use, if relevant, of a tape of the private phone conversations of the O\u2019Neill family that had been made available to Nee prior to the trial, precluded him from developing his defense. This motion for discovery was made on the morning of the fourth day of the trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defense counsel did not seek to examine this tape even though Nee had concluded his testimony, including his cross-examination, and the prosecution had rested at the end of the third day of trial. The tape could have been requested and examined the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>vious <em>evening </em>without causing a trial delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">An application for discovery under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, \u201cand its ruling will be disturbed only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d United States v. Fioravanti, 412 F.2d 407, 410 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, Panaccione v. United States, 396 U.S. 837, 90 S.Ct. 97, 24 L.Ed.2d 88 (1969); United States v. Randolph, 456 F.2d 132 (3d Cir. 1972). As Judge Aldisert has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">\u201cAppellate courts have been increasingly reluctant to find that the denial of a particular discovery motion was an abuse of discretion in the absence of a showing that the defendant was prejudiced by such denial.\u201d <em>Fioravanti, supra, </em>412 F.2d at 410.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">In addition, Rule 16(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the trial .court may deny an untimely motion for discovery where the defendant has failed to show cause \u201cwhy such motion would be in the interest of justice.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Conder, 423 F.2d 904 (6th Cir. 1970). The 1966 Advisory Committee Note to Rule 16 makes clear that one of the purposes behind Rule 16(f) is \u201cto give the court sufficient control to prevent unnecessary delay and court time consequent upon a multiplication of discovery motions.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s, Federal Practice, \u00b6 16.01 [3], at 16-8 (2d ed. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">After a careful examination of the record, we are unable to say that Newman was prejudiced by the court\u2019s denial of his request. As stated above, Nee had completed his testimony, including his cross-examination, on the previous day. The tape was not introduced into evidence and the prosecutor never listened to it (N.T. 398).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the notes taken by Nee after he listened to the tape were provided to the defense for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">Since the defendant has failed to demonstrate why the grant of his motion, which was made in the middle of the trial, would be in the interest of justice, the court properly denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">The defendant\u2019s final contention that the trial court\u2019s facetious comments made during its charge constituted plain error is also without merit. See United States v. Newman, <em>supra </em>at note 1. Although the alleged \u201cwitty diversities\u201d may have been unwise, we cannot say that they affected the substantial rights of Newman. F.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the June 22, 1972, sentence and judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-16\">. After the jury returned its verdict of guilty, Newman promptly filed a motion for new trial alleging 14 reasons in support. The trial court found the points urged by the defendant to be without merit, but 4% months later <em>sua sponte </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>granted a new trial based on its \u201cinjudicious indulgence in witty diversities.\u201d The Government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the district court to vacate its order granting the new trial on the basis that the court\u2019s order was entered not for reasons in the defendant\u2019s timely new trial motion, but on grounds raised by the district court months after such motion and answer to such petition. The district court\u2019s order was vacated and the defendant directed to appear for sentencing. United States v.

After Newman\u2019s attorney repeated the statement made by the United States Attorney, the following conversation. took place at sidebar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-15\">\u201cME.

LIVINGSTON [defense counsel] : I think it requires Mr. Thorn-burgh to answer the question whether or not he has made any promises not to prosecute Nee for perjury, whether he has made any promises. I think he must answer these questions, whether he has made any promises not to prosecute Nee for intimidating witnesses when the matter has been brought to his attention, and I think if he answers those questions in the negative, I think I fall flat on my face, and I am willing to rest. That is the thing in a nutshell, I think the record is clear, and, very frankly, in the present state of the record, although for the record I insist that he testify with the record clear, it doesn\u2019t upset me a great deal if the court rules that he will not and I walk away and that is the end of the ballgame.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-18\">\u201cTHE COUET: It seems to me that it is unrelated to this case, that it is more about what he hopes to accomplish by a brilliant conviction in this case.

United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 765, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972), the Supreme Court held that discovery, after trial, of the nondisclosure by the United States Attorney\u2019s office of an understanding between that office and a key government witness that the witness had been promised some degree of immunity, or in the Government\u2019s version \u201cwould definitely be prosecuted if he did not testify and that if he did testify he would be obliged to rely on the \u2018good judgment and conscience of the government\u2019 as to whether he would be prosecuted\u201d, <em>Id. </em>at 153, 92 S.Ct. at 765, was ground for the grant of a new trial. Chief Justice Burger reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-17\">\u201cHere the Government\u2019s case depended almost entirely on Taliento\u2019s testimony; without it there could have been no indictment and no evidence to carry the case to the jury.

The only thing was said was if I would testify in this ease that they would mention to the judge that I did testify for the government, which was no promise or no threat or anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-7\">*- * * * * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-8\">Q. Do you know what your sentence is going to be ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-9\">A. I have no idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-10\">Q. Has anybody made any promises or representations to you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-11\">A. No, and this is one reason I have never been able to get a job, because I can\u2019t tell people that I will be here next week, you know, or next month after the sentencing.\u201d (Tr. 140-42).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">On cross-examination Nee was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-13\">\u201cQ. Did you discuss fully your illegal snooping activities with Mr. Thornburgh?\u201d (Tr. 194).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">To put the question in context, the evidence in the Government\u2019s case was that Nee, a telephone company employee, engaged in the moonlighting business of illegal wiretapping, and that the activities which resulted in the Newman indictment were a part of that broader business which included other illegal interceptions. Mr. Thornburgh is the United States Attorney. His objection to this question was sustained. Later in cross-examination Nee was asked and answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-16\">\u201cQ. Did you testify on two occasions before a federal grand jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-17\">A. Yes/</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-18\">Q. On one of those occasions, you admit here today that you did lie under oath?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-19\">A. Yes, sir.\u201d (Tr. 205).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-20\">On several occasions when Nee was cross-examined about other incidents of illegal wiretapping he refused to answer on the ground of possible self-incrimination. Throughout the cross-examination, when other illegal activities were touched upon, both the United States Attorney and the district judge took steps sua sponte to apprise the witness of his Fifth Amendment rights. Following the cross-examination the United States Attorney on redirect, in rehabilitating Nee, asked and was answered :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-21\">\u201cQ. Mr. Nee, you have pleaded guilty to the charges of violation of the federal wiretapping law ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-22\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-23\">Q. And you understand that plea of guilty is just as much a guilty finding as a verdict by a jury ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-24\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-25\">Q. And you did that with the advice of counsel, didn\u2019t you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-26\">A. Yes, sir.\u201d (Tr. 306-07).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-27\">On re-cross Nee was asked and answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-28\">\u2022 \u201cQ. Sir, you have been made no promises or no threats have been made against you concerning your testimony in this case ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-29\">A. No, sir, no threats have been made or no promises have been made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-30\">Q. Have you had any discussion with any member of the U. S. Attorney\u2019s office concerning what information you will provide to the United States Attorney after sentence is imposed upon you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-31\">A. I have promised them nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Q. Have you made any indication to the United States Attorney\u2019s office concerning what you might do in the event that they show their good faith ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">A. No, sir. I told them I would testify fully and truthfully in this ease, and that is all I said I would testify. In fact, I specifically said I would never testify under the other situations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">Q. Was it then your indication to the United States Attorney\u2019s office that you would never testify against anybody except the defendant, Michael Newman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">A. No, I didn\u2019t say anybody. I said under certain situations that they were talking about. I didn\u2019t say anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">Q. Did you indicate a willingness after the United States Attorney\u2019s office shows their good faith to cooperate further with them ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\">A. No, sir. I said I would never testify in other incidents, that they would never get me on the stand.\u201d (Tr. 318-19).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">The overall impression created by Nee\u2019s testimony was that the only discussion with the Government concerned his testimony in the instant case, that the Government gave him no expectation of any consideration beyond calling to the sentencing judge\u2019s attention that he had testified in this case, and that he was in all other respects uncooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">With that overall impression before the jury, we turn to a colloquy which took place ex parte between the United States Attorney and the court during Nee\u2019s direct examination. The United States Attorney asked to see the judge outside the presence of the deeense attorney, who consented so long as a transcript of the conference was made. That transcript discloses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-12\">\u201cMR. THORNBURGH: Your Hon- or, I am afraid through inadvertence we might have stumbled into something here that is troublesome for Mr. Nee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-13\">He has indicated to me that he did perform jobs for other persons of this type. He has never and has steadfastly refused to tell me about them because he is in genuine fear of physical harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-14\">As I size him up, he is not pulling my leg, and it involves some racket connections in McKeesport, and I have tried to studiously avoid getting into that, and I am sure your Honor asked a perfectly logical question and maybe it would have been relevant in cross examination anyway, but I am a little concerned about him being forced to answer these things because he seems to express a genuine fear of bodily harm with expression of distress of any disclosure of for whom these jobs were done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-15\">THE COURT: Well, I presume as long as you don\u2019t prosecute him for having inadvertently admitting something\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-16\">MR. THORNBURGH: Well, his problem is this: This area of Mc-Keesport is something else again. He thinks this whole proceeding is fixed, that Newman is going to \u2018take a walk\u2019 automatically. That is what he tells me. <em>He indicated if we indicate our good faith as best we can that he will disclose these facts at that time and we will then proceed to prosecute those persons who are responsible, </em>but he has a Fifth Amendment right to I think avoid getting into those other offenses.\u201d (Tr. 145-46) (Emphasis Supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-18\">When the transcript of the conference came to the attention of the defense counsel, he asked for a side bar conference at which he informed the court of his desire to call the United States Attorney to the stand to develop what the defense hoped would be testimony casting doubt upon Nee\u2019s testimony that his cooperation was limited to this case and his expectation of reward limited to a representation that his testimony in this case would be called to the attention of the sentencing judge. If Nee\u2019s expectation of reward was greater than he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>indicated, the possible impeaching effect would be greater. The United States Attorney responded at side bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-4\">\u201cWe told him we would bring his cooperation to the attention of the court at the proper time.\u201d (Tr. 642).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOF8\">He objected to taking the stand. The jury was excused. A further colloquy took place in which the defense attorney expanded his argument that he desired to know the extent of Nee\u2019s anticipated cooperation and what offenses were included within any understanding with the Government. This colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">\u201cMR. THORNBURGH: Tom, you know full well the practice of a prosecution office when a man purges himself of perjury. You know that. We don\u2019t go around prosecuting people without giving them a chance. We can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">MR. LIVINGSTON: Now, wait a second. I don\u2019t mean this in the sense of unethical impropriety. I mean in the sense that I think it is improper for you to make the determination that he purged himself of perjury the second time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">MR. THORNBURGH: I make every determination in our office as to who is prosecuted, and you know full well we decline a basketfull of prosecutions every week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">MR. LIVINGSTON: But what you are doing here is saying, in effect, that he has purged himself of perjury the second time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-9\">MR. THORNBURGH: I don't know at this point, but I am not going to prosecute him at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-10\">MR. LIVINGSTON: For example, if it was brought to your attention that he perjured himself the second time\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-11\">MR. THORNBURGH: We could consider it. These are matters within the discretion of the prosecutor\u2019s office, and I think this is just a grandstand play, your Honor, and I resent it very much. There is no basis in that scrap of paper for thinking a deal has been made with Mr. Nee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-14\">MR. LIVINGSTON: I think that becomes a jury question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-15\">MR. THORNBURGH: You\u2019re right, I said I hope we could make some more cases if this person gets rid of the idea everything is fixed in McKeesport, but the idea of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-17\">MR. LIVINGSTON: That he will disclose those facts at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-18\">MR. THORNBURGH: He indicated if we indicated \u2014 and I\u2019m talking in terms of circles within circles here\u2014 we made no deal. I didn\u2019t say to Tom Nee, and there is absolutely no basis in that piece of paper for you making that kind of statement \u2014 \u201d (Tr. 645-46).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-19\">The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-20\">\u201cI consider it to be irrelevant to this case, the hope for the future if the witness should prove more talkative in the future than he has in the past and if nobody shoots him on the way home.\u201d (Tr. 647).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-21\">This is not a case, such as United States ex rel. Dale v. Williams, 459 F.2d 763 (3d Cir. 1972), where the possible impeaching effect of any understanding with the prosecutor went to the credibility of a witness whose testimony was merely cumulative or corroborative of other unimpeached witnesses. Nor is it a case where because of latitude permitted with respect to other impeaching evidence exclusion of the evidence can be regarded as harmless error. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Hykel, 461 F.2d 721, 727 (3d Cir. 1972); United States v. Murray, 445 F.2d 1171 (3d Cir. 1971). The effect of the district court\u2019s ruling was to require that the defendant accept the United States Attorney\u2019s interpretation of the impeaching effect of whatever discussion did take place. Nee was the Government\u2019s case, and he was effectively safeguarded from impeachment. What is perfectly clear is that the discussions between Nee and the Government went beyond the instant case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>that the Government\u2019s undertaking was to inform the court of Nee\u2019s \u201ccooperation\u201d. The United States Attorney never said unequivocally that the \u201ccooperation\u201d referred to testimony in this case only. The jury never knew these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The appellant Newman, and another defendant, Gaea, who was tried separately in March of 1972, were sentenced on June 22, 1972. The witness, Nee, who had pleaded guilty on September 29, 1970, was sentenced at the same time. At the sentencing the United States Attorney appeared and addressed the court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">\u201cThere is one matter which I am bound to bring to the Court\u2019s attention and which the Court is certainly aware of. That is the fact that the defendant Nee, who pleaded guilty to the charges contained in the first indictment, was, from the time that he appeared before the grand jury as a Government witness, wholly cooperative. He appeared at every appointment made with FBI agents or with persons in my office on time. He cooperated to the maximum extent, and I think it\u2019s fair to say that without his cooperation, the convictions of the two \u25a0 other defendants, which resulted from the indictment returned on November 17, 1970, would have been impossible. We would never have been able to determine the full extent of the activity undertaken in this case and the true complexion of the invasion of privacy carried out through electronic means without the cooperation of Mr. Nee. His cooperation extended from the time that he entered a plea of guilty in September of 1970 to this date and appeared at two trials, was subject to rigorous cross examination by skilled defense counsel and in both instances, I think it\u2019s manifest from the findings of guilty the jury accepted his testimony as true in forming a basis for the conviction of defendants Newman and Gaea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">I think it would be a gross defalcation on the part of the Government not to bring this cooperation to the Court\u2019s attention because frankly, the Government is always trying to encourage criminal defendants to cooperate with the Government in bringing others involved in criminal enterprise to the bar of justice and were we not to then stand in open court and make known to the Court the nature and extent of that cooperation, we would be defaulting, not only on the individual defendant, but on the processes of criminal justice within this Western District of Pennsylvania.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-9\">THE COURT: Elaborating a little on that, can you make any statement as to whether the defendant Nee furnished any additional information concerning other cases than the ones which he testified concerning in open court ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">MR. THORNBURGH: He has not, your Honor. As he stated on the witness stand in both trials in this case, he has stated only to us that he asserts his right under the Fifth Amendment of the United States not to testify with respect to other offenses. He expresses to us a fear for his physical well-being and safety, not from these defendants but with respect to other offenses, and I have no manner or means to compel him to testify other than the grant of immunity which we are not at the present time considering due to the pending sentencing and final resolution of this case, but I recognize and I think the Court recognizes his right to refuse to testify on matters that would incriminate himself and while his cooperation has been complete and thorough in this case, we have at this point received no further information from him. That is a matter of continuing concern to us.\u201d (Tr. of Sentencing 6-8).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">The <em>Giglio </em>issue apparently arose in Gaea\u2019s case as well, for at the sentencing Gaea\u2019s attorney contrasted what he referred to as a plea for leniency on behalf of Nee to the position taken at the Gaea trial that there was no understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>with Nee, The United States Attorney responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-4\">\u201cI- repeat again no promises were made to Mr. Nee with respect to any deal. I have made no plea on his behalf today. I merely think it\u2019s appropriate to bring to the Court\u2019s attention, have done so in the past and will do so in the f\u00fature, that a witness has cooperated with the United States Government in securing a conviction.\u201d (Tr. of Sentencing 17).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">With deference, I suggest that the majority has read ungenerously both Chief Justice Burger\u2019s opinion in Giglio v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and the compulsory process clause of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Giglio, </em>it seems to me, is based upon the assumption that the jury is entitled to hear all the facts from which a crucial witness\u2019 expectations of benefit from testimony might be inferred, and to judge for itself whether or not in the light of those facts the witness is entirely credible. The fine lines drawn by the United States Attorney here, between a representation as to the witness\u2019 cooperation and a plea on his behalf, or between a promise and an understanding, are not to be drawn by the attorney for the Government. They are to be drawn by the jury in the light of all the circumstances. And if that relevant information is in the possession of the United States Attorney the compulsory process clause requires that he testify. Thus, Part I of the majority opinion errs in two respects. First, it approaches the <em>Giglio </em>problem as if only a \u201cdeal\u201d or \u201cbargain\u201d in a Willistonian sense would be impeaching. The critical inquiry is not whether the prosecutor made a contract, but what was the witness\u2019 expectation. Second, it assumes that the defense must accept the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of what took place, rather than leaving the defense free to call a witness to lay the facts before the jury. Unlike the <em>Hykel </em>and <em>Murray </em>cases, the circumstances from which the jury could decide whether Nee might have been inclined to testify falsely in favor of the Government were not adequately presented to it in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Nee\u2019s credibility is also directly involved in the district court ruling discussed in Part II of the majority opinion. The telephone conversations interception which resulted in the indictment was made by means of a magnetic tape recorder connected to a telephone line by Nee. The tape recorder was introduced in evidence, but the tape remained in the possession of the police department of McKeesport, Pennsylvania, which had discovered it. Prior to his testimony Nee listened to the tape recording for the purpose of refreshing his recollection. He made notes to which he referred during his testimony. (Tr. 208-10). He also mentioned some of the contents of the tape in his testimony. (Tr. 317).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">The indictment is in two counts. Count I charges unlawful interception in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(1)(a). Count II charges unlawful disclosure of an intercepted communication in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(1) (c). The Government attempted to establish Newman\u2019s violation of \u00a7 2511(1) (c) by testimony that his wife had discussed with third persons information which could only have come from one of the intercepted conversations. Harry Walsh, the son of a state legislator, testified that Mrs. Newman repeated to him remarks he had made over the telephone to Mr. O\u2019Neil. (Tr. 348-59, 382). Nee testified that two conversations between O\u2019Neil and Mr. Walsh were on the tape. At the end of the Government\u2019s case the district court granted a motion for judgment of acquittal on the second count. Thus, to some extent the credibility of Nee\u2019s testimony as to the contents of the intercepted communications became less critical than it would have been had the second count remained in the case. Nevertheless, the jury had heard Nee\u2019s testimony about the contents of the tape, and on Count I his testimony was the Government\u2019s case. His credibility was the central issue of the case. If the defense could have established that he colored his discussion of the intercepted communications so as to reenforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Walsh\u2019s testimony and thus the Government\u2019s theory of proof on Count II, the impeaching effect would remain whether or not that count remained in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">At the end of the Government\u2019s case the defense attorney made a motion for an opportunity to listen to the tape recording so as to determine if it would have such an impeaching effect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In denying the motion the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-5\">\u201cI really think it is theoretically irrelevant and probably no harm will result, so the motion is denied.\u201d (Tr. 402).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The Government advances two theories in defense of this ruling. First, it suggests that permitting the defense attorney to listen to the tape recording would itself be a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511. Second, it urges that the motion was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The first contention is discussed in United States v. Liddy, In re Allen, No. 73-1020 (D.C.Cir. Jan. 19, 1973), which revises a district court order permitting disclosure of the contents of the communication in a prosecution for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511. We need not reach the same issues here, because in this case, correctly or incorrectly, the contents of some of the intercepted communications were in fact disclosed to the jury during the Government\u2019s case. Moreover, the Government, prior to the trial, arranged to have such of the communications as were still preserved on the tape recording disclosed to its key witness, Nee. Elementary due process requires that if disclosure has been permitted in a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 the defense be afforded an opportunity to verify that the disclosure being made is a truthful account of the communication. In any event, the United States Attorney did not rely upon 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 2511 in objecting to the defendant\u2019s motion, and the district court\u2019s ruling was made not on that ground but on the ground of relevancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">The second theory, that of untimeliness, is accepted by the majority. No objection was made by the Government to the timeliness of the motion. There is no indication whatsoever in the record that the trial would in any way have been delayed by the grant of the motion. The district judge did not deny the motion on the ground of untimeliness. The suggestion that the motion for discovery of the tape recording should have been made prior to the trial was not advanced below or considered by the district court for the obvious reason that until Nee testified to the contents of the tape and to having prepared for trial by listening to the tape recording there was no way in which the tape recording would have been relevant to the defense. Undoubtedly, had a motion for leave to listen to the tape been made prior to the trial the court would have ruled that further disclosure of the private conversations preserved thereon was premature and might prove to be unnecessary. The motion was made at the time when it became appropriate; that is, at the end of the Government\u2019s case and before the beginning of the defendant\u2019s case. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>tape were to prove to be impeaching its introduction in evidence would occur not during the Government\u2019s case but during the defense case, which is the only time when in a properly tried case the defense introduces exhibits in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The majority opinion holds that we can affirm because, after a careful examination of the record, we cannot say that Newman was prejudiced by the ruling. The fallacy in that ruling is that we simply do not know whether or not Newman was prejudiced since we do not know whether the tape recording would have been impeaching. The district judge didn\u2019t hear it. The United States Attorney didn\u2019t hear it. The defense attorney didn\u2019t hear it. The judges in the majority didn\u2019t hear it. Only the witness Nee heard it, and almost the sole issue in the case was Nee\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The effect of Part I of the majority opinion is that the defendant must be satisfied with the United States Attorney\u2019s appraisal of the witness\u2019 credibility. The effect of Part II is that the defendant must rely on Nee\u2019s appraisal of his own credibility. The defendant was entitled to have the jury make the appraisal. I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">. He said in making this motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">\u201cIf your Honor please, I think this is one of the prime examples of why counsel rather than the court should be in a position of making the determination as to what would be helpful. Now, I talked in terms of exculpatory evidence, but not exculpatory alone. For example \u2014 and not limiting my request to this particular matter \u2014 here is a witness that testified concerning the conversation which we don\u2019t know was intercepted or not, the witness Walsh, who by his testimony suggests as the conversation came back to him, it therefore must have been on that tape and that tape must have come into the possession of somebody who got it to his secretary directly or indirectly. Now, I think it critical if that conversation does not appear on the tape at all. I think Mr. Newman has a right to know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-15\"><em>}\\t * </em>:\u00a1: s\u00a1: sjc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-16\">Obviously Mr. Thornburgh places a great deal more credence on the testimony of Mr. Nee than I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-17\">* $ $ $ *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-18\">Now, it is my position that this witness [Nee] may be telling the truth and may not be telling the truth, but I as a lawyer am not going to rely on his representation of what is on that tape . . .\u201d (Tr. 399-400).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
