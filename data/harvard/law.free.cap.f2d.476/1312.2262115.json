The court has considered the case without oral argument of counsel and since it agrees with the trial commissioner\u2019s recommended decision, as hereinafter set forth,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it grants plaintiff\u2019s motion and adopts the decision as the basis for its judgment in this ease. Therefore, it is concluded that plaintiff is entitled to recover and judgment is entered for plaintiff with the amount of recovery to be determined pursuant to Rule 131(c) in accordance with the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-14\">OPINION OF COMMISSIONER</p>\n<author id=\"b1372-15\">FLETCHER, Commissioner:</author>\n<p id=\"b1372-16\">This income tax refund suit requires the court, once again, to enter an area which has been aptly described by Judge Nichols as \u201cdevoid of blackletter law, as is true of any tax inquiry seeking the \u2018substance\u2019 of a given transaction.\u201d Jack Daniel Distillery v. United States, 379 F.2d 569, 580, 180 Ct.Cl. 308, 326 (1967). The area is frequently referred to as the \u201cdebt-equity distinction,\u201d and the hundreds of court decisions involving it \u201cdefy symmetry.\u201d Tyler v. Tomlinson, 414 F.2d 844, 847 (5th Cir. 1969). In the context of the present case, the primary question before the court is whether losses suffered by plaintiff, Bordo Products Company (Bordo), upon the failure of C. M. Pitt &amp; Sons Company (Pitt) to repay some $740,000 loaned it by Bordo qualifies as bad debt under Section 166 of the Internal Revenue Code. Alternatively, says Bordo, in the event these loans or advances do not meet the test of bad debt under Section 166, the advances to Pitt should be deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under Section 162 or losses under Section 165(a). Defendant, on the other hand, views the advances made by Bordo to Pitt as having been made to obtain an equity interest in Pitt with an investment motive and thus constituted capital contributions to Pitt. A secondary question is whether Bordo is entitled to claimed deduction for additional depreciation expenses, abandonment losses, salary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>travel expenses, legal and accounting fees, and escrow and settlement expenses, all of which were related to the transactions between Pitt and Bordo which are described in detail in the findings of fact but which now will only be summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">During the years 1958 through 1961 (and for some time prior thereto), Bordo, from its Chicago headquarters, was engaged in the importation, packaging, and resale of dates through a national organization of food brokers. In addition, Bordo also produced and marketed a full line of citrus products from its citrus plant in Florida. The citrus operation was considerably larger than the date operation, although the latter produced by far the larger profit margin. During these years, plaintiff\u2019s principal competitor in the wholesale date market was Dromedary, a division of the National Biscuit Company. Along with dates, Dromedary also marketed glac\u00e9 fruits, cake mixes, and other related food items. Originally, Dromedary had marketed these products through a national food broker organization, but in the first quarter of 1958, Dromedary advised substantially all of its brokers that it was changing its method of marketing and that future sales of these products would be handled by the parent corporation. Accordingly, Dromedary\u2019s brokers were terminated as of the end of the year 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">This termination action by Dromedary became common knowledge in the wholesale date and glac\u00e9 fruit business during the spring of 1958. In late April of that year, Bordo began actively to solicit Dromedary\u2019s brokers, and by the end of May had succeeded in obtaining the services of over thirty of the former Dromedary brokers. All of these newly acquired brokers had formerly marketed both dates and glac\u00e9 fruits for Dromedary, and they advised Bordo that they would be interested in continuing to market a line of glac\u00e9 fruits and peel since it was common for the same buyers to purchase both dates and glac\u00e9 fruits. Bordo\u2019s management tended to agree and reasoned that there were several advantages to having a line of glac\u00e9 fruits to 'sell along with its dates. 1) Such a development would no doubt increase the importance of the Bordo account with its newly acquired brokers, thus stimulating the sale of dates. 2) Increased date sales would enable Bordo to secure additional volume discounts in purchasing bulk dates from abroad. 3) Additional profits should be realized from selling refuse citrus peel to a glac\u00e9 fruit concern rather than to a cattle food processor as had been the custom. 4) Freight costs could be cut by pooling shipments of glac\u00e9 fruits and dates. 5) Sales of glac\u00e9 fruit under the Bordo label should provide increased revenues for Bordo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-9\">Accordingly, in the summer of 1958, Bordo\u2019s management looked for sources of glac\u00e9 fruits and related products to supplement its date line with its food brokers. A former Dromedary broker advised Bordo that C. M. Pitt &amp; Sons Company might constitute a good source of supply of glac\u00e9 fruit and related products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-10\">Pitt, a Maryland corporation, maintained its principal office and place of business in Baltimore at all times relevant to this action. Its principal activity during the years 1958 through 1961, and for some time prior thereto, was the production and sale of glac\u00e9 fruit, dates, cherries, fountain products, flavors, and currants. In 1958, it enjoyed an excellent reputation in the trade as a quality manufacturer and had recently taken occupancy, under a 20-year lease, of a new plant built to its specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-11\">In January of 1959, Arthur Koch, a Bordo vice president, conferred with William Pitt, Sr., president and majority stockholder of Pitt, and another Pitt official at Bordo\u2019s Chicago headquarters. Mr. Pitt brought with him financial reports covering his firm\u2019s last five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>of operations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In March 1959, Bordo\u2019s president, Adolph Ketzler, its auditor, George V. Rountree, C.P.A., and other Bordo employees visited the Pitt facility in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">During these negotiations, Pitt advised Bordo that it was desirous of obtaining both long- and short-term credit, additional sales volume of glac\u00e9 fruit products and assistance in the area of financial management. Bordo advised Pitt that it needed a recognized source of glac\u00e9 fruits for its brokers, an eastern seaboard location to obtain economies in the marketing of its packaged dates, and a market for its citrus byproducts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\">Bordo\u2019s investigation of Pitt disclosed that Pitt\u2019s line of credit with the Fidelity Baltimore National Bank (Baltimore Bank) had been discontinued in 1959, and that as a consequence, Pitt had been forced to factor some of its receivables. Pitt\u2019s credit needs were greatest in March through September, its months of inventory buildup. In contrast, Bordo manufactured its citrus products primarily during the months of November through March and borrowed heavily during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-6\">From an examination of Pitt\u2019s financial statements, it was clear that during the 1950\u2019s Pitt\u2019s profit margins had eroded until it had sustained an operating loss in 1957 and 1958. The operating losses in those two years had depleted Pitt\u2019s working capital. Pitt\u2019s profit (loss) from operations as a percentage of net sales showed a decline from 2.14 percent to (7.08 percent) in the years 1954 through 1958. Additionally, Pitt\u2019s current ratio (current assets to current liabilities), a factor which Bordo found important in evaluating its own performance, had declined from 5.-99:1 in 1954 to 1.16:1 in 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-7\">In March 1959, George Rountree, Bordo\u2019s accountant, a recognized expert in the field of accounting for the food processing industry, prepared a comprehensive document entitled \u201cThe C. M. Pitt and Sons Company Baltimore, Maryland Sales, Production and Cash Budgets Year Ending December 31, 1959.\u201d Budget figures were prepared for three levels of sales, $2,400,000, $2,700,000, and $3,000,000. Net income on these three levels of sales was projected to be $140,000, $171,000, and $209,000, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-13\">In March 1959, Bordo applied for and obtained its seasonal, 2.2 million-dollar line of unsecured credit from its primary banking affiliation, the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago. Bordo described in detail its negotiations with Pitt to Robert Rodgers, an official of that bank, who had handled the Bordo account since 1942. Rodgers understood that the Fidelity Baltimore National Bank would be extending a $200,000 line of credit to Bordo and that Bordo would guarantee the bank\u2019s $450,000 line to Pitt. He thought that, in addition, Bordo would be making a $200,000 advance to Pitt. Rodgers\u2019 understanding that Bordo would provide Pitt with sales and managerial assistance and his receipt of an opinion from counsel that Bordo would not become liable on Pitt\u2019s 20-year plant lease with the Chatim Corporation were important factors in his ultimate decision to recommend approval of Bordo\u2019s credit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-14\">On April 8, 1959, Bordo and Pitt entered into a written agreement whereby Bordo obligated itself to furnish Pitt a 5 percent 5-year term loan of $200,000. As security, Bordo obtained a chattel mortgage on substantially all of Pitt's office and plant equipment (net book value $297,208.58).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-15\">There were certain preconditions to Bordo\u2019s $200,000 loan. Pitt restructured and realigned its management team in order to facilitate success. Upon Bor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>do\u2019s advice, Pitt\u2019s board of directors created and staffed the position of controller in order to insure improved financial recordkeeping, as Pitt\u2019s system of accounting had been characterized by Bordo\u2019s accountant as inadequate and outdated. Pitt\u2019s common stockholders entered into an agreement with Bordo whereby Bordo was granted a five-year option to purchase all (945) or any portion of Pitt\u2019s outstanding common stock at par value ($100 per share).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pitt underwent a recapitalization whereby Pitt\u2019s 8 percent first (1,021 shares outstanding) and second (authorized but unissued) preferred capital stock classes were eliminated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A class of 5 percent preferred stock was issued in their place and offered to holders of first preferred on a one-for-one basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">Bordo informally agreed to make available to Pitt production advances, as needed, and management assistance in the area of financial controls. Bordo\u2019s management projected that Pitt would require $450,000 to $850,000 of such financing in the months of April through September 1959. Pitt and Bordo informally agreed that Pitt would sell Bordo glac\u00e9 fruit under both Bordo\u2019s and Pitt\u2019s label at dealer\u2019s cost, less 10 percent. Bordo anticipated no direct profit on its sales of glac\u00e9 fruit, but contemplated a proportional reduction in its overhead, as well as stimulation of its date sales.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pitt also agreed to purchase Bordo\u2019s refuse peel for use in glac\u00e9 fruit production and promised to make available warehouse space in its Baltimore facility for the storage of Bordo\u2019s dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">Bordo advanced $876,000 to Pitt in calendar year 1959 in exchange for unsecured <em>51/2 </em>percent cognovit demand notes. These advances were based upon Pitt\u2019s cash needs to produce inventory for the 1959 selling season and were to enable Pitt to keep its other creditors on a current basis. Throughout this period, Pitt prepared and submitted to Bordo monthly cash flow statements detailing Pitt\u2019s situation. At Bordo\u2019s request, a telex machine was installed at Pitt as a means of facilitating communication. Ray Watkins, a Bordo employee, spent 124 workdays during 1959 at the Pitt plant. He set up accounting, cost, and financial systems for Pitt; audited Pitt\u2019s first six months\u2019 operations; worked on production control; and assisted Arthur Koch who spent 45 workdays in 1959 at the Pitt facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">In July 1959, George Rountree, Bordo\u2019s accountant, prepared a revised budget for 1959. This budget was less optimistic than his prior projections, and contemplated a $76 net loss for the year (net operating gain $18,718). However, the news was far from totally negative. Even based upon concededly conservative assumptions, the revised budget forecast that Pitt would be able to repay all its existing and projected 1959 borrowings by the close of that calendar year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-12\">In August 1959, however, Bordo became uneasy about Pitt\u2019s condition. Pitt was experiencing production problems, and Bordo\u2019s Arthur Koch expressed concern whether Pitt would be able to make timely delivery of its products. Bordo\u2019s Florida general manager and plant superintendent both spent time at the Pitt plant reviewing its production facilities. Bordo\u2019s executives thought it would be prudent to exert Bordo\u2019s influence as a creditor to force out Pitt\u2019s general manager and with Pitt, Sr.\u2019s agreement, began to search for a professional manager from another company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>Toward the end of the month, Bordo began to doubt that Pitt\u2019s sales would be as high as predicted in the revised budget. Bordo contacted its Baltimore attorneys to determine its creditor\u2019s remedies. Bordo\u2019s attorneys responded in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-4\">It will be seen that if Pitt should make payments or transfer assets to Bordo on account of its existing debts and if bankruptcy proceedings should be started against Pitt within four months thereafter, any payments which may be made to Bordo or any property which may be transferred to Bordo on account of prior loans at a time when Bordo has knowledge of the insolvency of Pitt, may be set aside by a bankruptcy trustee thereafter appointed as voidable preferences and Bordo may be required to repay any amounts so received, so that money can be divided among the creditors in accordance with the Bankruptcy law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-5\">It is important, therefore, if any payments are to be made to Bordo, that no Petition in Bankruptcy can be filed against Pitt within a period of four months after any such payments are made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-6\">To that end, if Pitt is to begin liquidating its assets so as to make payments to Bordo on account of its debt, we strongly recommend that all general creditors of Pitt be paid in the ordinary course of business, and that no unpaid indebtedness be allowed to exist which would form the basis for a Petition in Involuntary Bankruptcy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">In accordance with its attorneys\u2019 advice, Bordo never demanded repayment and advanced another $60,000 in September 1959 to permit Pitt to keep its other creditors on a current basis. By yearend, Pitt had repaid $390,000 of the 1959 production advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-8\">Through contacts in the food industry, Bordo located one Lawrence Weitz, a man exceptionally well-qualified in the production of glac\u00e9 fruit and an experienced executive. Weitz was interviewed in Baltimore for the general managership of Pitt by Bordo\u2019s Ketzler, Koch, and Watkins and by Pitt\u2019s controller, Fred Coover. Upon Bordo\u2019s advice, Pitt\u2019s president offered Weitz the position ; Weitz accepted and began work at Pitt in December of 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-10\">Unhappily, Pitt\u2019s 1959 audit report, available February 1, 1960, revealed a net loss of $264,103. This figure did not take into account the interest owing on Bordo\u2019s advances. In fiscal 1959, Bordo received $941.66 interest from Pitt and waived interest of $28,697.58. Bordo never accrued this interest on its books, financial statements, or tax returns. While a net loss of $76 (net operating gain of $18,718) had been projected as early as July, Bordo\u2019s management was surprised and displeased with the actual results. Mr. Rodgers of the Harris Bank indicated that his bank would be reluctant to continue its line of credit to Bordo unless Bordo got the Pitt operation under control and made sure that Pitt\u2019s management problems were corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-11\">In early 1960, Bordo learned from Weitz that although Pitt\u2019s building was new, much of its plant equipment was old, poorly designed or otherwise inappropriate. Pumps and other equipment were damaged by corrosion and were often leaking because they were made of materials other than stainless steel. These and other equipment defects produced food discoloration, contamination, and similar quality control problems. Additionally, it appeared that Pitt was losing up to $100 per day in sugar syrup due to a defect in a machine fitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-12\">Early in 1960 Bordo\u2019s accountant furnished Bordo with an appraisal of Pitt\u2019s \u201cCompany Procedures.\u201d The report stated that as of January 18, 1960, Pitt\u2019s accounts were not balanced; its bank statements were not reconciled; its social security records were not up to date; its commissions payable were not properly analyzed, and its inventory records were inaccurate. The report also criticized Pitt\u2019s lack of a fixed bill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>ing policy and poor customer credit evaluation procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">Other problems at Pitt came to the attention of Bordo management in late 1959 and early 1960: 1) It appeared that in some cases Pitt had purchased five, ten, or even fifteen times its raw material requirements in order to avail itself of a small noncompensating volume discount. Much of the material purchased was of a quality higher than that needed to be competitive, and even then Pitt failed to follow up with suppliers who furnished defective products. 2) Pitt\u2019s quality control procedures were inadequate as there was a tendency to test products only on completion, rather than at each step in processing. Errors were caught only after large batches had been defectively manufactured. 3) There was no systematic program for analyzing Pitt\u2019s product mix to determine a) why some items were declining in sales; b) whether new products or formulations could be developed; and c) whether each of Pitt\u2019s many low-volume products was profitable to the corporation. 4) It appeared that Pitt\u2019s income in 1959 had been affected by a price war which had developed in the glac\u00e9 fruit business. Intense price competition was initiated by such nationally advised firms as S and W Fine Foods, Inc., and the National Biscuit Company (Dromedary) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">In February 1960, Bordo\u2019s management reappraised its position with respect to Pitt. They consulted Weitz, George Rountree, and Rodgers of the Harris Bank. Weitz expressed the opinion that under his supervision Pitt could break even in 1960, without reference to the interest on or the balance of Bordo\u2019s 1959 advances still outstanding. Bordo saw that it had two alternatives: 1) enforcing its rights as a creditor to the fullest extent, advancing no more money to Pitt and demanding immediate repayment of existing advances, or 2) letting the existing advances remain outstanding and extending additional credit in order to permit Pitt to operate in rehabilitated form in 1960. Bordo determined to finance Pitt through the fall of 1960 in the then reasonable belief that its 1960 advances would be repaid by the end of the 1960 selling season. Bordo hopefully anticipated that Pitt would then be in a position to generate enough profits so as to be able to repay Bordo in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-8\">Bordo advanced $865,000 in cash to Pitt during the calendar year 1960 in exchange for interest bearing, unsecured demand notes. Like their 1959 counterparts, these advances were used to finance Pitt\u2019s 1960 inventory. As was the case with the 1959 advances, Bordo did not intend to profit from the interest it charged Pitt, since the rate which Bordo paid the Baltimore bank for the money was substantially equivalent to the rate which Bordo charged Pitt for these same funds. Bordo expected that the continued availability of a source of glac\u00e9 fruit would stimulate date sales as had been the case in 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-9\">Advice from Weitz on Pitt\u2019s six months\u2019 operating results caused Bordo\u2019s management to conclude that Pitt would operate at least on a break-even basis in 1960. Sometime during the first week of October, Weitz informed Bordo that based upon the third quarter inventory, it now seemed that Pitt would suffer a loss for the year. Upon notification of this fact, Bordo requested that Pitt take all possible steps to reduce cash expenditures until the fourth quarter operating results were ascertained. Bordo made no further advances to Pitt after October 5, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-10\">During the months October through December 1960, Pitt repaid $280,000 in production advances and made a single payment of $20,000 on the loan secured by the chattel mortgage. In addition, Pitt paid $10,112.45 interest on production advances to Bordo in fiscal 1960. Bordo returned this interest to Pitt, and never accrued interest on these advances to Pitt on its books, financial statements or tax return.., Pitt paid interest on its chattel mortgage once on April 14, 1960, in the amount of $1,019.18. There were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>no interest expense accruals on Pitt\u2019s books after June 30, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">Pitt\u2019s 1960 report disclosed net sales of $2,050,492 and a net loss of $348,539 after waiver by Bordo- of interest due it in 1960 in the amount of $46,971. Pitt\u2019s book liabilities exceeded its assets by $201,570. The prices charged for Pitt\u2019s products were reduced approximately 8% percent during 1960. This reduction was essentially a consequence of the above-mentioned price war which was begun in 1959 by industry leaders. If Pitt had maintained the same level of prices in 1960 as it had charged in 1959 and it had not been forced to meet Dromedary\u2019s policy of prepaying freight on Christmas shipments of glac\u00e9 fruit, $200,000 of Bordo\u2019s loss probably would have been eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">After learning of these results, Bordo officials conferred with Messrs. Weitz, Rodgers, and Rountree. Rodgers advised that his bank would not continue its line of credit to Bordo unless Bordo stopped advancing money to Pitt. As a condition to Bordo\u2019s own inventory financing, Rodgers insisted that Bordo take steps to liquidate the funds it had lent Pitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-6\">Rountree was of the opinion that Pitt\u2019s indebtedness to Bordo could be collected, with at worst a loss of $151,000. He recommended that Pitt be sold as a going concern. Bordo representatives were elected to Pitt\u2019s board with a view to facilitating Pitt\u2019s sale or liquidation. Bordo was advised by its Baltimore attorneys that its losses would be increased if it allowed Pitt to be thrown into bankruptcy by its general creditors. Bordo was advised to see that Pitt was liquidated in a manner so as to maintain all of its creditors other than Bordo on a current basis. Bordo supervised the liquidation of Pitt\u2019s assets, and Pitt vacated its plant by August 31, 1961. During the period January 1 to September 30, 1961, Pitt repaid $510,811.40 of the amount owed Bordo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-7\">Pitt\u2019s landlord, the Chatim Corporation, filed an action for damages totaling one million dollars against Pitt and Bordo on April 9, 1962. Chatim alleged that Pitt had broken its lease, and also alleged improper action on the part of Bordo, due to alleged responsibility for the breaking of Pitt\u2019s lease to Chatim. This action was dismissed with prejudice following Bordo\u2019s compromise payment to Chatim of $22,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-9\">Insofar as pertinent to the present controversy, Section 166(a) of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-10\">(1) Wholly Worthless Debts. \u2014 There shall be allowed as a deduction any debt which becomes worthless within the taxable year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1378-11\">The apparent simplicity of this provision is entirely delusive. In the present context, the problem is the meaning of the statutory word \u201cdebt.\u201d Defendant, as pointed out above, contends that Bordo\u2019s loans to Pitt were in reality merely \u201cadvances\u201d of capital contributions for the purpose of acquiring an \u201cequity\u201d interest in Pitt, and hence no debtor-creditor relationship between the two corporations ever came into being. Plaintiff, to the contrary, asserts that under the circumstances of the case, Bordo\u2019s \u201cadvances\u201d were clearly intended to be loans to Pitt both in form and substance. This question of whether a particular corporate obligation is \u201cdebt\u201d or \u201cequity\u201d has been presented to this court on a number of prior occasions. <em>See </em>Affiliated Research, Inc. v.

In his article cited in footnote 7, <em>supra, </em>Mr. Plumb makes the following pertinent observation at 418:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-17\">A demand note, although it sets no definite time for payment, does have an ascertainable due date which is within the control of the purported creditor- [citing cases], and therefore may be recognized as debt if other factors are favorable [citing cases].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEo\">It is clear that both the $200,000 loan secured by the chattel mortgage<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>the 1959-1960 unsecured production advances evidenced by demand notes provided Bordo with the usual rights of a creditor upon default.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">The 1959 and 1960 demand notes contained no provisions compromising Bordo\u2019s position as a creditor, and no subsequent agreements were executed subordinating either those notes or the $200,000 mortgage loan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While subordination may<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> negate \u201can important characteristic of a debtor-creditor relationship: the right to share with general creditors in corporate assets upon dissolution or liquidation\u201d <em>(Liflans Corp., supra, </em>390 F.2d at 971-972, 182 Ct.Cl. at 837) the <em>absence </em>of subordination has been recognized as evidence of debt. Royalty Service Corp. v. United States, 178 F.Supp. 216, 220 (D.Mont.1959). Interest on both the $200,000 loan and the 1959 and 1960 production advances was payable unconditionally, a factor indicative of debt. <em>Liflans, supra, </em>390 F.2d 965, 182 Ct.Cl. at 832. The Government has stressed repeatedly the admitted fact that Bordo did not contemplate making a direct profit from the interest generated by its advances to Pitt. It is not denied that the funds borrowed from the Baltimore bank by Bordo were loaned to Pitt at approximately the same rate as the bank charged to Bordo. Most lenders, of course, do intend to profit directly from the interest charged, and the interest rate is adjusted in accordance with the risk undertaken. Absent countervailing considerations, the failure to charge a rate of interest commensurate with the risk undertaken points to the conclusion that a capital contribution is involved. Here, other factors are involved, however, and this court has recognized as a \u201ccommercial commonplace\u201d certain instances where the <em>quid pro quo </em>is other than a direct profit on the money advanced. <em>American Processing and Sales Co., supra, </em>371 F.2d 842, 178 Ct.Cl. at 379; <em>see also, </em>George E. Warren Corp. v. United States, 141 F.Supp. 935, 938, 135 Ct.Cl. 305, 309 (1956), and Byerlite Corp. v. Williams, 286 F.2d 285, 290-291 (6th Cir. 1960). In the instant case, by its dealings with Pitt, Bordo looked toward a more profitable market for its citrus by-products, increased volume discounts on dates purchased from abroad, and reduced freight charges brought about by the pooling of date and glac\u00e9 fruit shipments. Most importantly, Bordo looked toward the stimulation of date sales which it considered would be brought about by furnishing its newly acquired brokers with a recognized glac\u00e9 line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-9\">At page 13 of its brief to the commissioner, defendant discusses Bordo\u2019s management assistance to Pitt, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-10\">\u00ab\u25a0 * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-11\">While there is some disagreement between the parties as to the degree to which Bordo supervised Pitt\u2019s operations in 1959 and 1960, it is clear from both the testimony and the exhibits that Bordo did participate to a substantial extent in Pitt\u2019s operations. <em>Defendant contends that such participation is sufficient to support a holding that Bordo\u2019s unpaid advances to Pitt were equity as a matter of law. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-12\">* -X- -X- * -X- *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-13\">It is true that courts have listed participation in management as one of the factors to be considered in making the debt-equity distinction, <em>e. g. </em>Berkowitz v. United States, 411 F.2d 818, 820 (5th Cir. 1969). <em>See, </em>Plumb, <em>supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>447-450. However, this factor while meriting close scrutiny can hardly be considered as converting the entire question to one of law. The validity of loans even to a controlled corporation is well established. <em>George E. Warren Corp., supra, </em>141 F.Supp. 935, 135 Ct.Cl. at 312; Wilshire &amp; Western Sandwiches, Inc. v. Commissioner, 175 F.2d 718, 721 (9th Cir. 1949); Byerlite Corp. v. Williams, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">Indeed, as noted in Plumb, <em>supra, </em>at 447:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-7\">* * * it is still almost, correct to say, as one court said long ago, that \u201cThe question of voting rights and a voice in management of the company has frequently been discussed but has never been stressed in the determination of the issue.\u201d Citing Jordan Co. v. Allen, 85 F.Supp. 4377 443 (M.D.Ga.1949).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1381-8\">Even if defendant\u2019s statement of the law were correct, its factual predicates are hardly supported in the record. While the loan agreement and chattel mortgage contain some creditor-type language restricting Pitt\u2019s conduct as a corporate entity, neither agreement grants Bordo a voice in the management of Pitt\u2019s affairs, nor does any subsequent agreement. The substance does not betray the form as defendant urges. From the outset of the negotiations, it was recognized that Pitt was in serious need of assistance in the area of financial management, and that Bordo\u2019s management would endeavor to furnish it. On Bordo\u2019s advice, Pitt hired a controller. Bordo\u2019s Ray Watkins spent considerable time at Pitt\u2019s plant in 1959 where he set up accounting, cost, and financial systems for Pitt, audited Pitt\u2019s operations for the first six months of 1959, worked on production control, and assisted Bordo\u2019s vice president, A. L. Koch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-10\">It is true that during times of unexpected disappointment in Pitt\u2019s operations during August and September of 1959, Koch spent considerable time at the Pitt plant and that he was frequently consulted with respect to overall policy guidance. This fact is partly attributable to the unforeseen inability of Pitt\u2019s general manager to produce an acceptable product at a competitive price and partly to Bordo\u2019s concern as Pitt\u2019s largest creditor for firsthand information on the condition of its debtor. With the prior agreement of Pitt, Sr., Bordo was instrumental in procuring the services of an experienced manager in the glac\u00e9 fruit field, Lawrence Weitz. Once Weitz had been employed by Pitt as its genera] manager, Bordo\u2019s involvement in Pitt\u2019s operations dramatically declined since Bordo had the utmost confidence in Weitz\u2019s managerial abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-11\">Even after giving the matter the close scrutiny it deserves, it can only be concluded that Bordo\u2019s advice and participation in management activities were no more than should be expected of a large creditor sincerely worried about its debtor\u2019s inefficient operations and bad financial plight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-12\">\n<em>Factors Indicating an Intention to Create a Debtor-Creditor Relationship</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-13\">The names ascribed to the Bordo-Pitt documents in question were \u201cloan agreement,\u201d \u201cchattel mortgage,\u201d and \u201cdemand notes.\u201d \u201cWhile the form of the instrument is not controlling, it is relevant and entitled to consideration.\u201d <em>Liflans Corp., supra, </em>390 F.2d at 969, 182 Ct.Cl. at 832. <em>See, also, </em>Crawford Drug Stores, Inc. v. United States, 220 F.2d 292 (10th Cir. 1955). Whatever the nomenclature, of course, any instrument is vulnerable to a challenge that its form does not comport with its substance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On this record, it is be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>lieved that the form and substance of the Bordo-Pitt transaction coincide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">Defendant devotes a significant portion of its brief to the contention that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s declarations of subjective intent are irrelevant and immaterial.\u201d Defendant\u2019s case citations do not support its conclusion, but rather confirm that such declarations are relevant and will be considered but with the caveat that they will never be determinative by reason of being infected with a self-interest that cannot prevail over inferences drawn from objective acts. <em>Cf. </em>Rombach v. United States, 440 F.2d 1356, 1359, 194 Ct.Cl. 530, 534 (1971). The fact that a party has sought to protect its creditor status by obtaining security enhances the possibility that its advances will be considered debt rather than capital contributions. <em>See, </em>Ackerson v. United States, 277 F.Supp. 475, 477 (W.D.Ky.1967). Bordo\u2019s initial $200,000 advance was secured by a chattel mortgage on substantially all of Pitt\u2019s office and plant equipment with a net book value of $297,208.58. Defendant makes much of the fact that the 1959 and 1960 advances evidenced by numerous demand notes were unsecured. Defendant suggests that a true creditor would have sought \u201c * * * the minimal protection of an inventory financing lien * * *.\u201d However, on this record, I have concluded that, by assuring itself through monthly cash flow and production reports that its 1959 and 1960 production advances were being converted into inventory, and by effective restrictions in the mortgage documents of Pitt\u2019s ability to encumber its assets, Bordo was behaving in the manner of a true creditor as distinguished from an equity investor. Only by virtue of 20-20 hindsight is it now possible for defendant to suggest other means whereby Bordo\u2019s attorneys might have more effectively protected Bordo\u2019s rights against Pitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-11\">Proportional holdings of debt and stock have always been considered as indicative of equity rather than debt. <em>American Processing and Sales Co., supra, </em>371 F.2d 842, 178 Ct.Cl. at 363; <em>Liflans Corp., supra, </em>390 F.2d 965, 182 Ct.Cl. at 836-837; <em>Affiliated Research, Inc., supra, </em>351 F.2d 646, 173 Ct.Cl. at 344-345. However, it is also clear from <em>Liflans </em>that something more than this single factor must be present, and this would seem consistent with the fact that a viable debt may be recognized even where the debtor is a controlled corporation. <em>Byerlite, supra; George E. Warren Corp., supra. </em>It is better to characterize the impact of such a fact as rendering the transaction \u201csuspect\u201d and subject to \u201cclose scrutiny.\u201d <em>Sayles Finishing Plants, Inc., supra, </em>399 F.2d 214, 185 Ct.Cl. at 208; <em>George E. Warren Corp., supra, </em>141 F.Supp. 935, 135 Ct.Cl. at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-13\">It is reasoned that the holder of proportionate amounts of debt and equity will not force repayment of the debt if such enforcement would jeopardize its equity interest. Tyler v. Tomlinson, <em>supra, </em>414 F.2d at 849. Bordo owned 125 shares of Pitt Common and 50 shares of Pitt Preferred, as well as an option to purchase the remaining 820 shares of Common at $100 per share. Defendant argues that there was thus an identity of interest between Bordo\u2019s and Pitt\u2019s shareholders which indicates that the \u201c1960 advances were not conceived of as debt,\u201d citing P. M. Finance Corp. v. Commissioner, 302 F.2d 786 (3d Cir. 1962); Indian Lake Estates, Inc. v. Stewart, 448 F.2d 574 (5th Cir. 1971); Foresun, Inc. v. Commissioner, 348 F.2d 1006 (6th Cir. 1965); Motel Co. v. Commissioner, 340 F.2d 445 (2d Cir. 1965); Wilbur Security Co. v. Commissioner, 279 F.2d 657 (9th Cir. 1960); <em>cf. </em>Brown Shoe Co., Inc. v. Commissioner, 339 U.S. 583, 70 S.Ct. 820, 94 L.Ed. 1081 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-14\">None of defendant\u2019s cases present a fact situation truly comparable to the transaction in question. These cases primarily stand for the proposition that the \u201cnon-issuance of shares of stock * * * is not necessarily controlling in determining the character of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>transaction for tax purposes.\u201d <em>Foresun, Inc., supra, </em>348 F.2d at 1009; <em>see Indian Lake Estates, Inc., supra, </em>448 F. 2d at 579. While it is true that the value of Bordo's stock option could be expected to increase with the success of Pitt\u2019s business, it is unreasonable to assume on this record that Bordo would therefore have risked its very substantial loans and advances merely to shore up a potential equity position. The most the Government can expect from the existence of the option is that this will cause the court to scrutinize closely all other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-5\">Failure of a creditor to insist on regular interest payments has been viewed as a pertinent factor in making the debt-equity distinction. Tyler v. Tomlinson, <em>supra, </em>414 F.2d at 849. In 1959 Bordo received a total of $941.66 interest from Pitt. It waived interest of $28,697.58. Bordo never accrued this interest on its books, financial statements, or tax returns. Failure of a creditor to insist on repayment of an installment of a note when due or an inappropriate delay in making demand in the case of a demand note is also indicative of concern for an equity investment, Tyler v. Tomlinson, <em>Id. </em>at 849; <em>Cuyuna Realty Corp., supra, </em>382 F.2d 298, 180 Ct.Cl. at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-6\">However, intent at the time the advances were made is an important consideration, and subsequent unexpected economic developments may well explain the fact of forbearance. <em>Liflans Corp., supra, </em>390 F.2d 965, 182 Ct.Cl. at 830-831. Here, Pitt's inability to make interest payments and to repay production advances was caused by unexpected production problems, lower than anticipated sales, and spiraling manufacturing costs. The advice of Bordo\u2019s attorneys was also important in Bordo\u2019s decision not to make an immediate demand for its production advances or to declare the $200,000 loan in default. In August of 1959, Bordo\u2019s attorneys advised it to see that Pitt\u2019s general creditors were paid in the ordinary course of business in order to insure that a petition for involuntary bankruptcy was not filed against Pitt. Such an eventuality, they advised, would have rendered any payments to Bordo voidable preferences if made within four months of Bordo\u2019s knowlege of Pitt\u2019s insolvency. Additionally, such an eventuality would have interfered with the orderly liquidation of Pitt\u2019s inventory. Thus, Bordo advanced Pitt an additional $60,000 in September 1959 in compliance with its attorneys\u2019 advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-10\">The question whether Bordo\u2019s decision to forbear and continue advances in 1960, once 1959 adverse results were known, was a creditor\u2019s decision or an equity investment will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-11\">\n<em>Factors Bearing on the Reasonableness or Economic Realities of of the Transaction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-12\">This court and others have mentioned the purported debtor\u2019s inability to obtain funds from an outside lender under the same conditions as a factor in making the debt-equity distinction. <em>Cuyuna Realty Co., supra, </em>382 F.2d 298, 180 Ct.Cl. at 886; Lynch v. United States, 337 F.Supp. 1297, 1299 (N.D.Ga. 1971). While it may be an adverse fac- . tor, the inability of a purported debtor to procure such a loan is not an unfailing bar to bad debt treatment for the purported creditor. Brighton Recreations, Inc. v. Commissioner, 20 T.C.M. 127, 135 (1961); <em>American Processing and Sales Co., supra, </em>371 F.2d 842, 178 Ct.Cl. at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-13\">In the present case, it has been found, over plaintiff\u2019s objection, that the Baltimore bank had curtailed its line of credit to Pitt in 1959. That is at least one reason why Pitt sought the financial and other arrangements with Bordo which have been described at length herein.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Ordinarily, this fact would weigh against plaintiff\u2019s claim. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>ever, it is to be remembered that in this case the motivation and effective rate of return to Bordo was much higher than the 5, 5%, or 5% percent interest charged. Bordo contemplated that substantial indirect profits and other benefits would inure to it from this transaction. Thus, the availability of loans to Pitt from outside sources at the 5-5% percent rate with the security offered is not particularly material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">Plumb, <em>supra, </em>ftn. 7, at 526 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-5\">* -X- * * *x* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-6\">Perhaps the most obvious criterion of whether payment of a purported debt may reasonably be expected is the . projection of the sources from which payments may be made. In general, there are only four possible sources for consideration: (1) liquidation of assets, (2) profits from the business, (3) cash flow, and (4) refinancing with another lender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-7\">* * -X- -X- -X- *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-8\">Pitt and Bordo predicted that Pitt would realize a substantial profit in 1959. There was no question in the minds of the respective managements that there would be funds for the repayment with interest of both the $200,000 loan installment and projected production advances. It is true that in July 1959, Bordo\u2019s accountant prepared a revised budget for Pitt projecting a net loss of $76. Even based upon concededly conservative assumptions, however, the revised budget forecast a cash flow sufficient to repay all existing and projected advances with interest at the conclusion of Pitt\u2019s selling season. Thus, as plaintiff contends, the absence of a sinking fund is without significance. Unhappily, Bordo\u2019s and Pitt\u2019s reasonable projections were frustrated by unexpected events: lower than anticipated sales, production problems, and spiraling manufacturing costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-9\">Early in 1960, Bordo was faced with a Hobson\u2019s choice between asserting immediately its creditor\u2019s rights (which no doubt would have meant liquidation of Pitt) or forbearing its right and continuing to advance funds on the same basis as in the previous year. The decision had to be made before Pitt was called upon to commit funds for raw materials. Defendant contends that \u201c * * * Bordo would be repaid only if Pitt\u2019s 1960 selling season were successful; if the season were not successful, Bordo anticipated that it would not be repaid.\u201d If this were true, Bordo\u2019s advances would surely have been \u201cat the risk\u201d of Pitt\u2019s business, and more likely capital contributions than debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-12\">However, defendant errs factually. The predicted cash flow from a breakeven year would have been sufficient to repay 1960 production advances and the mortgage debt installment, with interest. Plaintiff\u2019s decision to continue was based upon the reasonable belief that Pitt\u2019s new general manager could control the production problems and wasteful expenditures which had plagued Pitt in the previous year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-13\">The first six months\u2019 results supported Bordo\u2019s predictions, but third-quarter results indicated that Pitt would again suffer a loss. A buyer for the firm was sought both by Bordo and Pitt principals but without success. Rightly or wrongly Bordo was again advised to see that Pitt\u2019s general creditors were paid in the ordinary course in order to avoid the problem of voidable preferences. This was also necessary to insure the orderly disposition of Pitt\u2019s inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-14\">It is significant that the decision to continue advancing funds to Pitt in 1960 was reviewed by Bordo\u2019s bankers. It will be remembered that the Harris Bank was also consulted when Bordo initially considered the transaction and after problems developed in August of 1959. Rodgers of the Harris Bank made it quite clear at trial that he would not have recommended to his bank an advance of funds to Bordo for its own inventory financing in 1960 if he had fully understood that Bordo planned to commit funds to Pitt other than on a short term basis until Pitt\u2019s inventory was liquidated. Any other type of commitment would have reduced Bordo\u2019s own work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>ing capital and reduced its ability to pay back its own seasonal borrowing to the Harris Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">From the foregoing consideration of all the many factors involved, Bordo\u2019s status as a creditor of Pitt emerges clearly. Accordingly, upon Pitt\u2019s ultimate failure to repay the loan balance of approximately $740,000, Bordo suffered a bad debt loss within the meaning of section 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">There remains only the secondary question of whether, in addition, Bordo is entitled to deductions for certain depreciation expenses, abandonment losses, salary and travel expenses, legal and accounting fees, and stock escrow and settlement expenses, all connected directly to the Bordo-Pitt transaction. The facts with respect to these several items are detailed in findings 84 through 89. (See commissioner\u2019s report of November 29, 1972.) It is sufficient here to note only salient facts as to the major items.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">The depreciation expense and abandonment loss arose out of machinery and equipment admittedly owned by Bordo but loaned by it to Pitt; the salary and travel expenses were those of Bordo\u2019s officials incurred in traveling to Baltimore for consultation with Pitt\u2019s officials; and the legal and accounting fees related mainly to Pitt\u2019s liquidation and the defense of a lawsuit filed against both Pitt and Bordo by Pitt\u2019s landlord, a lawsuit ultimately settled by Bordo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-8\">Defendant agrees that the resolution of this issue \u201cis directly related to the determination of the debt-equity issue.\u201d Since the latter issue has been resolved in favor of plaintiff, it logically follows that this secondary issue must likewise be resolved for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-9\">However, of \u201cadditional concern here,\u201d says defendant, is whether Bordo received the benefit of these expenses so as to be entitled to their deduction. In defendant\u2019s view only Pitt benefited from these expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-10\">This specious argument deserves but little comment. From the record it is entirely clear that, while Pitt was indeed an incidental beneficiary of these expenses, it was Bordo who primarily benefited therefrom. Therefore, Bordo, not Pitt, is the taxpayer entitled to the deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-12\">Plaintiff is entitled to judgment with the exact amount of recovery to be determined pursuant to Rule 131(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1372-12\"> Whereas the court adopts the commissioner\u2019s separate findings of fact, which are set forth in his report filed November 29, 1972, they are not printed herein since such facts as are necessary to the decision are contained in his opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1374-8\">. Whether or not these statements included the statement for 1958 is not clear from the record, as the 1958 statement bears the date January 27, 1959.
