That issue, however, had been raised earlier in a proceeding instituted in the district court pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7402(b) and <em>7604(a)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to enforce compliance with the IRS summons and had been adjudicated against Secor by a decision and order of the district court from which no appeal had been taken within the time prescribed by law. Accordingly, since Secor is barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>from raising the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>issue, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The history of the government\u2019s efforts to interrogate Secor and of the legal proceedings which followed is undisputed. Pursuant to \u00a7 7602 the IRS on June 9, 1971, served upon Secor a summons directing him to appear at its offices on June 30, 1971, to testify regarding his tax liability for the year ended December 31, 1968, and to bring with him specified books and records. The Revenue Agent in charge of the matter, Charles Paletty, was informed by Secor\u2019s attorney that he had advised Secor, who failed to appear, to invoke his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and not to answer any questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">On December 13, 1971, the district court, acting upon a petition of the IRS, issued to Secor an Order to Show Cause why he should not be compelled to comply with the IRS summons served upon him in June. On December 30, 1971, Secor appeared in court and furnished an affidavit of the same date prepared by his counsel, which reiterated his refusal to testify in response to the summons, stating that he was contesting IRS assessments against him for the years 1964-1967, that a tax deficiency had been assessed against him for the year 1968 after he had refused to answer questions with respect to earlier orders, and that he had been convicted in 1966 for failure to register and pay the federal wagering tax. The conviction was set aside pursuant to the subsequent decision in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L. Ed.2d 889 (1968), which held unconstitutional the wagering tax as violative of the Fifth Amendment. Seeor\u2019s affidavit requested that he be permitted the right to invoke his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, that the order to show cause be dismissed, and that the summons issued by the IRS be cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">With the issue thus joined, Judge Pierce in a memorandum opinion entered on February 10, 1972, denied Secor\u2019s application, stating \u201cThe Court is not aware that anyone has suggested criminal prosecution of respondent based on any alleged gambling activities. . . . If such a situation eventuates, respondent may then urge that his constitutional claims be measured against the <em>Marchetti </em>case.\u201d Secor was ordered by the court \u201cto obey the mandate contained in the Internal Revenue Service summons which had been served upon him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">Secor neither obeyed the court\u2019s order nor took an appeal therefrom. On June 27, 1972, the court, upon the written application of the United States Attorney, a copy of which was served on Secor\u2019s attorney, issued a second order directing Secor to comply with the IRS summons by appearing at the IRS offices, this time on July 10, 1972, and by producing the documents and records referred to in the summons. Again Secor neither- obeyed the court\u2019s order nor took an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">On August 22, 1972, the government moved pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(b) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for an order holding Secor in contempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>because of his failure to obey the court\u2019s two earlier orders. An evidentiary hearing was held in which the only witness called by Secor was Revenue Agent Faletty; Secor also offered a limited amount of documentary evidence. Secor\u2019s position was that he was not guilty of contempt because he had been justified in refusing to obey the summons on the ground that interrogation pursuant to it would violate his Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">By decision dated September 13, 1972, Judge Pierce adjudged Secor to be in contempt for his refusal to obey the orders of the court. Imposition of sentence was suspended and Secor was fined $25 per day thenceforth for each day upon which he should fail to comply with the IRS summons. Pending appeal the sentence was stayed. On September 18, 1972, Secor filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment holding him in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Upon this appeal Secor asks us to reverse the judgment of contempt on the ground that interrogation of him pursuant to the IRS summons would violate his Fifth Amendment rights. However, we must first determine whether we are precluded from determination of that issue, interesting though it may be, by Secor\u2019s failure to take a timely appeal from the district court\u2019s earlier orders directing him to comply with the IRS summons. The government urges that when his time to appeal from the February 10, 1972 order expired the district court\u2019s decision in this proceeding became <em>res judicata </em>as to the sole issue which he now seeks to raise and that that order cannot now be collaterally attacked. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The final and appealable nature of a district court\u2019s order enforcing an IRS summons in a proceeding instituted pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7402(b) and 7604 (a) was firmly established by the Supreme Court in Reisman v. Caplin, 375 U.S. 440, 84 S.Ct. 508, 11 L.Ed.2d 459 (1964). There the Court, affirming the denial of declaratory and injunctive relief sought by attorneys for the taxpayers against an IRS summons issued under \u00a7 7602, held that the taxpayers\u2019 constitutional rights were fully protected for the reason that in order to enforce the IRS summons the government would be required to institute an adversary proceeding in the district court (as it did here) for an order enforcing the summons, in which the taxpayer could assert and litigate his constitutional rights and appeal as a matter of right from an adverse decision and enforcement order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-9\">\u201cIf the Secretary or his delegate wishes to enforce the summons, he must proceed under \u00a7 7402(b), which grants the District Courts of the United States jurisdiction \u2018by appropriate process to compel such attendance, testimony, or production of books, papers, or other data.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-10\">\u201cAny enforcement action under this section would be an adversary proceeding affording a judicial determination of the challenges to the summons and giving complete protection to the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-11\">* * * *- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvQ\">\u201cFurthermore, we hold that in any of these procedures either before the district judge or United States Commissioner, the witness may challenge the summons on any appropriate ground. This would include, as the circuits have held, the defenses that the material is sought for the improper purpose of obtaining evidence for use in a criminal prosecution, Boren v. Tucker, 239 F.2d 767, 772-773, as well as that it is protected by the attorney-client privilege, Sale v. United States [8 Cir.] 228 F.2d 682. Finally, we hold that such orders are appealable. See O\u2019Connor v. O\u2019Connell, 253 F.2d 365 (C.A. 1st Cir.); In re Albert Lindley Lee Memorial Hospital, [209 F.2d 122 (C.A. 2d Cir.)]; Falsone v. United States, [205 F.2d 734 (C.A. 5th Cir.)]; Bouschor v. United States, 316 F.2d 451 (C.A. 8th Cir.); Martin v. Chandis Securities Co., 128 F.2d 731 (C.A. 9th Cir.); D. I. Operating Co. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>United States, 321 F.2d 586 (C.A. 9th Cir.). Contra, Application of Davis, 303 F.2d 601 (C.A. 7th Cir.). It follows that with a stay order a witness would suffer no injury while testing the summons.\u201d Reisman v. Caplin, 375 U.S. at 445-446, 449, 84 S.Ct. at 512-513.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-3\">Accord, Daly v. United States, 393 F.2d 873, 876 (8th Cir. 1968) (\u201cThe order of the trial court in enforcing the summons of the revenue agent became an appeal-able order upon its proper entry. . . . [t]he order entered was similar to a final judgment in any other case\u201d); see McGarry\u2019s Inc. v. Rose, 344 F.2d 416 (1st Cir. 1965); Tillotson v. Boughner, 327 F.2d 982 (7th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Since the district court\u2019s February 10, 1972, decision and enforcement order represented a final adjudication of Se-cor\u2019s Fifth Amendment defense, he cannot now turn back the hands of the clock and retry an issue that was litigated on the merits in an adversary proceeding where due process requirements were fully observed. To permit such a collateral attack would be to make a mockery of the well settled doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>See Oriel v. Russell, 278 U.S. 358, 49 S.Ct. 173, 73 L.Ed. 419 (1929); Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men\u2019s Association, 283 U.S. 522, 51 S.Ct. 517, 75 L.Ed. 1244 (1931); Durfee v. Duke, 375 U.S. 106, 83 S.Ct. 509, 9 L.Ed.2d 496 (1963); Daly v. United States, 393 F.2d 873 (8th Cir. 1968). The situation here is in all legally significant respects the same as that before the Supreme Court in <em>Oriel, supra, </em>where it held, in a contempt proceeding for violation of a bankruptcy court turnover order, that the bankrupt was precluded from relitigating defenses raised and tried in the earlier turn-over proceeding itself, resulting in a final order from which no appeal had been taken.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">\u201cIt would be a disservice to the law if we were to depart from the longstanding rule that a contempt proceeding does not open to reconsideration the legal or factual basis of the order alleged to have been disobeyed and thus become a retrial of the original controversy. The procedure to enforce a court\u2019s order commanding or forbidding an act should not be so inconclusive as to foster experimentation with disobedience. Every precaution should be taken that orders issue, in turnover as in other proceedings, only after legal grounds are shown and only when it appears that obedience is within the power of the party being coerced by the order. But when it has become final, disobedience cannot be justified by re-trying the issues as to whether the order should have issued in the first place.\u201d Maggio v. Zeitz, 333 U.S. 56, 69, 68 S.Ct. 401, 408, 92 L.Ed. 476 (1948). See also 9 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 110.-13 [4] at 168-69 (2d ed. 1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">These principles apply with equal force here, where we are not confronted with any contention that Secor was denied due process in the enforcement proceeding or that he was barred from raising his Fifth Amendment claims on a question-by-question basis before the IRS. The latter procedure might have represented at least an effort to furnish non-incriminatory information to the IRS and have permitted the court to rule on specific questions claimed to be incriminatory. But Secor simply refused on Fifth Amendment grounds to submit to <em>any </em>interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Since Secor is thus barred by <em>res judicata </em>from raising again the issue of whether he properly invoked his privilege against self-incrimination, we need not consider on the merits his claim that enforcement of the IRS summons would violate the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Although Secor does not raise the issue, we note that there was ample evidence in the record to support the district court\u2019s finding of contempt. His conduct in refusing to comply with the district court\u2019s February 10, 1972 enforcement order was not free of contumacy. Upon the entry of that order he faced the choice of complying or taking an appeal. Instead of following either course, he deliberately defied the order. Four months later, when the court entered its second enforcement order in the hope that Secor might comply, he adhered to his course of disobedience. The order holding him in contempt was fully justified and is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-9\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-10\">\u201cFor the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, making a return where none has been made, determining the liability of any person for any internal revenue tax or the liability at law or in equity of any transferee or fiduciary of any person in respect of any internal revenue tax, or collecting any such liability, the Secretary or his delegate is authorized\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-11\">\u201c(1) To examine any books, papers, records, or other data which may be relevant or material to such inquiry;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-12\">\u201c(2) To summon the person liable for tax or required to perform the act, or any officer or employee of such person, or any person having possession, custody, or care of books of aceourt containing entries relating to the business of the person liable for tax or required to perform the act, or any other person the Secretary or his delegate may deem proper, to appear before the Secretary or his delegate at a time and place named in the summons and to produce such books, papers, records, or other data, and to give such testimony, under oath, as may be relevant or material to such inquiry; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-17\">\u201c(3) To take such testimony of the person concerned, under oath, as may be relevant or material to such inquiry.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-18\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7402(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-19\">\u201c(b) <em>To enforce summons. </em>\u2014 -If any person is summoned under the internal revenue laws to appear, to testify, or to produce books, papers, or other data, the district court of the United States for the district in which such person resides or may be found shall have jurisdiction by appropriate process to compel such attendance, testimony, or production of books, papers, or other data.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-20\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-21\">\u201c(a) <em>Jurisdiction of district </em>court.\u2014 If any person is summoned under the internal revenue laws to appear, to testify, or to produce books, papers, records, or other data, the United States district court for the district in which such person resides or is found shall have jurisdiction by appropriate process to compel such attendance, testimony, or production of books, papers, records, or other data.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b826-6\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-7\">\u201c(b) <em>Enforcement </em>\u2014 Whenever any person summoned under section 6420 (e)(2), 6421(f)(2), 6424(d)(2), or 7602 neglects or refuses to obey such summons, or to produce books, papers, records, or other data, or to give testimony, as required, the Secretary or his delegate may apply to the judge of the district court or to a United States commissioner for the district within which the person so summoned resides or is found for an attachment against him as for a contempt.

On this issue we do note that claims of self-incrimination in IRS civil investigatory proceedings have been approached differently by different courts. Compare United States v. Roundtree, 420 F.2d 845, 852 (5th Cir. 1969), with United States v. White, 301 F.Supp. 1129, 1131 (D.R.I.1969). See also United States v. Hatch, 31 AFTR2d \u00b6 73-465 (D.C. Idaho, Civ. No. 472-16, June 28, 1972); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>United States v. Runte, 1973 CCH U.S. Tax Cases \u00b6 9265 (W.D.La., Civ. No. 18514, Jan. 18, 1973). United States v. Kordel, 397 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 763, 25 L.Ed. 2d 1 (1970), relied on by Secor, did not rule upon the issue which he seeks to raise on this appeal. There the Supreme Court held that where a defendant did not invoke his privilege against self-incrimination in a civil condemnation proceeding instituted by the government, testimony given by him in that proceeding could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution. To the extent that the Court implied that the defendant could have invoked his privilege in the civil proceeding it should be noted that, unlike the present case, the criminal prosecution was not only contemplated at the time of the civil proceeding but was \u201cnearly contemporaneous\u201d with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-24\">We, of course, intimate no views at this time on the question whether the pendency of a criminal prosecution is an essential prerequisite for invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege in a civil proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
