Moreover, the parties challenge the Board\u2019s finding as to the date that the strike was converted from an economic strike into an unfair labor practice strike. Having carefully considered the arguments advanced by the parties, with one modification indicated below we grant the Board\u2019s application for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-18\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-19\">The Company and Local 289 had a bargaining relationship commencing with the Union\u2019s first certification in 1955. Successive collective-bargaining agreements ensued, the most recent of which expired on July 13, 1969. A series of unfruitful bargaining sessions then transpired, culminating in a union membership vote to strike.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The strike, economic in origin, began on July 21, 1969, and was destined to last until February of the following year. Several incidents which occurred during and immediately after the strike are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-20\">A. <em>Withholding Vacation Pay</em></p>\n<p id=\"AttC\">On May 1, 1969, the Company posted a notice stating that employee vacations would be taken during the first two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>weeks in August.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The notice was posted pursuant to the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement, which further provided that employees would be entitled to vacation pay each year in lieu of an actual vacation. While the Company maintained some discretion under the agreement in setting the precise dates, the vacation period was required to fall between June 15 and September 1. By letter to the Union dated July 28, 1969 \u2014 one week after the strike began \u25a0 \u2014 the Company indicated that it had decided to delay commencement of vacations because of intervening events over which it had no control. The letter stated that the Union would be notified when a new decision concerning the vacation schedule had been reached. At the next bargaining session, held on or about July 31, the Union raised the topic of vacation pay. A Company representative stated that the letter spoke for itself, that no vacation could be rescheduled until after the strike, and that the matter of vacation pay would have to be decided later. The Union pressed the issue at the next bargaining session, held on August 5, asserting that the Company had a legal obligation to give the employees their vacation pay. The response was that \u201c[t]he Company is not legally obligated to subsidize the strike.\u201d Finally, on August 11, the Union president and a group of employees confronted Company officials with the same demand, to which the Company president responded \u201cwe are not going to pay the vacation pay until the strike is over.\u201d The controversy remained unabated, the Company refusing vacation pay to both working and striking employees until October 30, at which time the sums were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">B. <em>Suspension and Discharge of Employees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Between the August 5 session and November 12 there was a bargaining hiatus. During that period several incidents occurred involving employees Fletcher,Brewer, Snyder, Tarpley, Creek and Rollins.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">Some union members who previously had reported to strike returned to work. Among them was George Smith. Smith and several other nonstriking employees formed a car pool for the purpose of transportation to and from work. On the afternoon of September 23, as they were leaving the plant in Smith\u2019s car and with Smith driving, they were followed for some time by a car containing Union president Fred Fletcher and two striking employees, Vernon Brewer and Edward Snyder. No threatening gestures, horn blowing or interference of any kind occurred between the groups. Ultimately, Smith pulled into the driveway of a parking lot opposite the home of one of the occupants of his car. Fletcher followed suit, stopping his car about thirty or forty feet away. Nothing transpired for about half a minute, at which point the doors of Smith\u2019s car were abruptly opened and the occupants rushed to the front seat. It appeared to Fletcher that someone was sick in Smith\u2019s car. Fletcher then started his car and drove off, unaware that the driver of the other car had died of a heart attack. On September 25, Fletcher, Brewer and Snyder were notified by letter from the Company that they were suspended pending investigation for misconduct. Ultimately, on August 10, 1970, the latter two individuals were discharged on the ground of misconduct during the strike.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Whether by design or coincidence, more than the usual number of pickets appeared to picket on the morning of November 3, 1969. By the time nonstriking employees began to report to work, conditions had deteriorated considerably. Stones were thrown, obscenities and invectives uttered, and threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ening gestures made by the strikers. At issue is the alleged misconduct of two picketing employees, Lora Creek and Barbara Tarpley. On the morning in question Tarpley and Creek shouted obscenities at people entering the plant and, on one occasion, yelled to an employee that they would \u201cget\u201d her. One of the two individuals also threw down a picket sign at or near an automobile entering the plant. In addition, they, occasionally joined hands on the sidewalk, thereby forcing employees to walk around them in order to enter the plant. Tarpley and Creek continued to strike and picket until the strike ended, at which point they requested reinstatement and unconditionally expressed their desire to return to work. The Company failed to respond in any manner until September 2, 1970, at which point the two individuals were informed by separate letters that they were discharged for misconduct during the strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">Also discharged for allegedly participating in and leading a secondary boycott, by letter dated February 13, 1970, in response to his application for reinstatement, was striker Leonard Rollins.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Toward the end of October, 1969, at about the same time the Company began hiring permanent replacements for striking employees, Rollins became involved with a local civil rights leader, Reverend H. H. Wright. On or about October 5, following a meeting between Rollins and Reverend Wright, the details of which are undisclosed, the latter addressed a regular meeting of the Union. He expressed concern to the attending members over the hiring of replacements, inferring that this was part of a conspiracy against laborers and poor people. At a November 18 press conference, Rollins and Reverend Wright jointly announced the formation of a coalition between the two allegedly victimized groups to help those who had been \u201cdismissed\u201d by the Company. Rollins, while not mentioning the word \u201cboycott,\u201d did draw attention to the fact that the Company\u2019s sole product was \u201cco6lers\u201d for Coca-Cola and that the \u201cCoca-Cola industry\u201d was its sole buyer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Reverend Wright supplemented that statement by urging the public to buy no more Coca-Cola.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Several marches directed at convincing the public not to buy Coca-Cola were subsequently organized by the Reverend Wright and participated in by Rollins. One such march directly involved a customer of the Company, and during that episode the marchers interfered with ingress and egress to the Coca-Cola Bottling Company in Chattanooga. Finally, a handbill was distributed from the Union hall which found its way into the streets of Chattanooga urging the public to support the strike by refraining from purchasing Coca-Cola. The handbill could not be attributed to the leadership of the Union or to any other individual. Rollins, a rank and file member of the Union, participated in such activities without the sanction of the Union. Indeed, the International president of the Union specifically ordered the officers of the Union not to participate in boycott activities, an order which they heeded, and it was never established that the Union itself was directly involved in such activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">C. <em>Refusal by the Company to Bargain and Events that Followed</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8W\">The parties met in bargaining sessions on August 5 and again on November 12, 1969. On December 2, the Union requested by letter to the Company that further bargaining ensue. The Company replied by letter on December 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-10\">[P]lease be advised that we must at this time defer your request for further bargaining pending disposition by the National Labor Relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Board of the petition which has been filed, apparently raising a question concerning representation. When this matter has been resolved, we shall act accordingly.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The Company\u2019s board chairman testified to several additional factors influencing his decision to terminate bargaining although these were apparently not communicated to the Union at that time. First, he testified that 357 individuals were reporting to work, compared to 307 remaining strikers (some of whom had apparently found employment elsewhere) . Second, he testified to personal knowledge of \u201coverwhelming sentiment\u201d among the working employees to no longer be represented by the Union, although no evidence as to the identity of those expressing such sentiment or their number was proffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">On February 7, 1970, the Union notified the Company that the strike was ended and by letter requested reinstatement on behalf of all striking employees, indicating their willingness to return to work immediately and unconditionally. The Union also requested on that day that the Company supply it with certain information regarding employees who were presently filling production and nonproduction jobs, all job openings as of February 7, and other related matters. The Company responded to both requests on February 10, acknowledging termination of the strike but refusing to furnish the information because \u201cWe can perceive no legal duty to grant your request at this time,\u201d and refusing to reinstate striking employees on the ground that more information was needed. Specifically, the Company indicated, its belief that some striking employees had obtained work elsewhere, others had moved out of the area, and still others did not desire to return to work, thereby raising questions concerning the Company\u2019s reinstatement responsibilities. The Company then requested that the Union furnish it with a list of previous strikers who had not made application for reinstatement individually or who desired to preserve their rights with the Company. The letter concluded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-8\">If we do not receive such a list within a reasonable time, we will assume that none other than those who have made individual application desire to preserve such rights as they may have at Cavalier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">By letter dated February 18, 1970, the Company informed the employees who had been on strike that they must notify the Company individually of their willingness to return to work in order to be reinstated. Thereafter some employees who complied with this request were reinstated. The Union renewed its request of February 7 by letter dated February 27, and the Company replied on March 2 that such an \u201cunconditional offer to return to work on behalf of striking employees is quite obviously too broad and inaccurate to be relied upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">II. <em>Conclusions by the NLRB</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">To this point we have outlined the findings of the Trial Examiner which are of a purely factual nature and which were adopted by the Board. 192 N.L.R.B. No. 37 (1970). Not only are these findings supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) and (f) (1970) and Administrative Procedure Act \u00a7 10(e), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701 and 706 (1970), but they are essentially uncontested by the parties for purposes of this appeal. We proceed now to consideration of whether the conclusions of law by the Board are warranted by the evidence. In agreement with the Trial Examiner, the Board found that the Company violated \u00a7 8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq. (1970), by refusing to bargain with the Company and furnish it with informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It also found that refusal to pay accrued vacation pay was a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act as was the discharge of employees Fletcher, Brewer, Snyder, Creek and Tarpley.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Contrary to the Trial Examiner, the Board found no violation by the Company in suspending employees Fletcher, Brewer and Snyder pending investigation of the incident in question, but it did find a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1) in the discharge of Rollins, the alleged participant in a secondary boycott. Finally, the Board and Trial Examiner were in agreement that the Company further violated \u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1) by unreasonably delaying the reinstatement of unfair labor practice strikers following their unconditional offer to return to work on February 7, 1970. The Board, however, modified the Trial Examiner\u2019s finding that the strike was converted to an unfair labor practice strike on July 29, 1969, substituting therefor December 4, 1969. The Board entered an order requiring certain affirmative and negative acts by the Company directed at effectuating its holding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-19\">III. <em>Conclusions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-20\">\n<em>A. Withholding Vacation Pay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b933-21\">The Company\u2019s challenge to the Board\u2019s finding that it violated \u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act is really twofold, and we shall consider those arguments in order. It first contends that the vacation pay had not accrued prior to its payment on October 30 and that its refusal to pay therefore cannot serve as a basis for violation of the Act. The 1966 contract provided, as did its predecessors, for one or two weeks of vacation pay to employees who had completed at least one or five years of continuous service, respectively.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The relevant portions of the agreement follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-22\">A first-year employee will receive his vacation pay upon completion of his 12 months of continuous service or at the vacation period, whichever comes last. His vacation pay thereafter will be issued to him at the time his vacation is taken, or on the first pay period in July if no vacation is scheduled for that year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-23\">The vacation period will be set by the Company to fall between June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>15th and September 1st. Unless business reasons dictate a specific period the preference of the employees will be followed in choosing the vacation dates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-4\">The dates chosen will be announced not later than May 1st.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-5\">Vacations are not cumulative and must be taken, or paid for, during each calendar year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">It is beyond dispute that vacation pay would accrue and become due and payable in lieu of actual vacation. The question presented is whether it accrued prior to October 30, the date when the sums were finally paid, thereby rendering the Company\u2019s refusal to pay after successive Union demands potentially violative of \u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1). Under any one of several interpretations the answer is indisputably yes, although for reasons which will become apparent it is unnecessary for us to determine the precise date.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The contract unequivocally limits the dates within which the vacation period must fall- \u2014 between June 15 and September 1. Thus, once September 1 passed there can be no doubt that the amounts were due and payable. Moreover, since the vacation period of two weeks must <em>fall </em>rather than <em>begin </em>between those dates, the deadline must be considered to fall sometime in mid-August. Finally, we feel it is likely that the pay accrued at an even earlier date. The Company had no authority to reschedule vacations after the May 1 deadline specified in the contract. When it unilaterally made the decision to do so on about July 28 it was in the midst of an economic strike that may well have been anticipated to last well beyond mid-August. The letter itself arguably may have indicated the Company\u2019s awareness that a vacation could not be scheduled within the time limits prescribed in the collective-bargaining agreement. Thus, the employees\u2019 rights to vacation pay in lieu of actual vacation did accrue prior to October 30.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">The Company next urges that proof of antiunion motive is essential to a violation and that it did not harbor such a motive. The Trial Examiner found that the Company\u2019s action of withholding accrued vacation pay had, indeed, been motivated by antiunion purposes. The Labor Board, while not in disagreement with this finding, held that it was unnecessary to reach the issue of motive in light of NLRB v. Great Dane Trailers, Inc., 388 U.S. 26, 87 S.Ct. 1792, 18 L. Ed.2d 1027 (1967). We feel that clarification is merited. In <em>Great Dane Trailers, </em>the respondent company, faced with an economic strike, refused to pay accrued vacation pay to striking employees while announcing its intention to award such benefits to working employees (which it did). A hearing before a trial examiner resulted in a finding that the company\u2019s action constituted discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment which would discourage union membership as well as unlawfully interfere with a protected activity, thereby violating \u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1). The Labor Board adopted the conclusions but was reversed by the Court of Appeals on the ground that the company may have had any of a number of legitimate business purposes for such conduct. In the process of reversing and remanding with directions to enforce the Board\u2019s order, the Supreme Court clarified the appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>priate considerations for evaluating an alleged violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-4\">[S]everal principles of controlling importance here can be distilled. First, if it can reasonably be concluded that the employer\u2019s discriminatory conduct was \u201cinherently destructive\u201d of important employee rights, no proof of anti-union motivation is needed and the Board can find an unfair labor practice even if the employer introduces evidence that the conduct was motivated by business considerations. Second, if the adverse effect of the discriminatory conduct on employee rights is \u201ccomparatively slight,\u201d an antiunion motivation must be proved to sustain the charge <em>if </em>the employer has come forward with evidence of legitimate arid substantial business justifications for the conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">388 U.S. at 34, 87 S.Ct. at 1798. The Company mistakenly argues that since the conduct must be \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d before it can be \u201cinherently destructive,\u201d and since the Company refused to pay accrued vacation benefits nondiscriminatorily to all its employees, then the \u201ccomparatively slight\u201d test enunciated in <em>Great Dane Trailers </em>must be applied. The Company then sets forth what it considers to be a \u201csubstantial business justification\u201d for its conduct and contends that the Union has failed to successfully refute this evidence with proof of antiunion animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The Company misconstrues \u00a7 8(a) (3). That section requires \u201cdiscrimination\u201d as a prerequisite to a violation whether the conduct be \u201cinherently destructive\u201d or \u201ccomparatively slight,\u201d a point which is absolutely clear in <em>Great Dane Trailers. </em>Not only does the requirement of discrimination not afford a basis for distinguishing between the two standards, but it also fails to afford a basis for arguing that \u00a7 8(a)(3) is inapplicable to the facts of this case. The Company argues that all cases relied upon by the NLRB for authority involve a course of conduct which discriminates between strikers and nonstrikers, citing, <em>inter alia, </em>Flambeau Plastics Corp. v. NLRB, 401 F.2d 128, 135 (7th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1019, 89 S.Ct. 625, 21 L.Ed.2d 563 (1969), and NLRB v. Frick Co., 397 F.2d 956, 961-963 (3d Cir. 1968). It then argues that it did not \u201cdiscriminate\u201d since it was completely impartial between strikers and nonstrikers. While we agree that the courts above were concerned with unequal treatment of strikers and non-strikers, we do not consider that to be dispositive. A practice applied uniformly to all employees may be discriminatory and violate the Act just as a discriminatory practice may be held to be perfectly innocuous. <em>Compare </em>American Ship Building Co. v. NLRB, 380 U.S. 300, 312-313, 85 S.Ct. 955, 13 L.Ed.2d 855 (1965) <em>and </em>United Steelworkers v. NLRB, 405 F.2d 1373 (D.C.Cir.1968) <em>with </em>NLRB v. Brown, 380 U.S. 278, 85 S.Ct. 980, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Conduct by an employer which discourages a union activity protected by \u00a7 7 may also discourage and discriminate against membership in a labor organization.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number> In the present case the Employer conditioned payment of accrued vacation compensation upon cessation of a union-instigated economic strike. It is unnecessary for us to tread the uneasy path between \u201cinherently destructive\u201d and \u201ccomparatively slight\u201d discrimination since the Company failed to prove a substantial business justification for its conduct.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Great Dane Trailers, supra, and </em>NLRB v. Fleetwood Trailer Co., 389 U.S. 375, 88 S.Ct. 543, 19 L.Ed.2d 614 (1967). The Company introduced uncontradicted evidence illustrating financial problems which had recently befallen it. However, no testimony was introduced suggesting that the Company was unable to meet the financial burden of the vacation debt. In its simplist form the Company really argues that both sides anticipated economic hardship during the strike and that it was more appropriate for the Union than for the Company to absorb the loss of vacation funds even though the employees were lawfully entitled to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">B. <em>Suspension and Discharge of Employees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">With respect to employees Fletcher,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Brewer and Snyder, the Trial Examiner found that their purpose in following the automobile driven by Smith was to harass and coerce the riders in that car not to report to work, although he found no acts of physical interference whatsoever between the two vehicles. While the death of Smith was indeed unfortunate, an expert witness was totally unable to attribute it to the car following incident. The Trial Examiner noted that the Company had previously engaged in an unfair labor practice during the course of the strike by its refusal to pay accrued vacation pay, an action which \u201chad an adverse effect . not only upon the outcome of the strike and the morale of the strikers, but against the very pocketbooks of the strikers themselves.\u201d Applying the doctrine established in Local 833, UAW v. NLRB, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 107, 300 F.2d 699 (1962), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 836, 86 S.Ct. 82, 15 L.Ed.2d 79 (1965), and NLRB v. Thayer Co., 213 F.2d 748 (1st Cir. 1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 883, 75 S.Ct. 123, 99 L.Ed. 694 (1954), he found that the Company had violated \u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1). The Board agreed, stating that such conduct, protected by \u00a7 7, \u201cwhile not to be condoned, was not so egregious as to render them unfit for further employment, and that their dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>charge after the strike was therefore violative of Section 8(a)(3) and (1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">A similar conclusion was reached with respect to employees Creek and Tarpley, who had shouted obscenities and engaged in other misconduct on the picket line.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-5\">[N]ot every incident occurring on the picket line, though harmful to a totally innocent employer, justifies refusal to reemploy a picketing employee for acts that exceed the bounds of routine picketing. Impulsive behavior on the picket line is to be expected especially when directed against nonstriking employees or strike breakers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v.

Finally, while the Trial Examiner found that employee Rollins did engage in a leadership role in conduct that ultimately extended the strike beyond the domain of his immediate employer to one entity doing business with the employer, he held that this was not a boycott within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(i)(ii)(A) and (B) of the Act. Nevertheless he found that Rollins\u2019 discharge was for cause, a conclusion which the Board rejected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-7\">In all the circumstances, we find that Rollins\u2019 conduct . . . while not to be condoned, was not so egregious as to render Rollins unfit for further employment ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">While it is true that the Board offers little support for its conclusion, we note that not present here are any remarks or materials disparaging the quality of products of the employer which might bring the case within the rationale of NLRB v. Local 1229, IBEW, 346 U.S. 464, 74 S.Ct. 172, 98 L.Ed. 195 (1953). Nor was the handbill distributed at Union headquarters attributed to Rollins. Furthermore, the record fails to show whether any of the vending machines manufactured by the Company after the strike began were used by the Chattanooga Coca-Cola Bottling Company, nor does it show whether Rollins participated in the only march which directly involved a bottling plant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">Clearly some types of impulsive behavior must have been within the contemplation of Congress when it provided for the right to strike. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Wichita Television Corp., Inc., 277 F.2d 579, 585 (10th Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 871, 81 S.Ct. 113, 5 L.Ed.2d 93 (1960); NLRB v. Thor Power Tool Co., 351 F.2d 584, 587 (7th Cir. 1965). It is not unusual to become involved, as we are today, in balancing the employees\u2019 right to organize and bargain collectively against the employer\u2019s right to maintain order and respect and the public\u2019s right to safety. <em>See, e. g., </em>Local 833, UAW, <em>supra, </em>300 F.2d at 703 n. 10 and NLRB v. Thor Power Tool Co., <em>supra, </em>351 F.2d at 58. This involves consideration of such opaque factors, many of which depend upon a sifting of conflicting testimony in an attempt to envision the totality of circumstances, as whether the misconduct \u201cis so violent or of such serious character as to render the employee unfit for further service,\u201d NLRB v. Illinois Tool Works, 153 F.2d 811, 816 (7th Cir. 1946); whether such misconduct constitutes \u201ca trivial rough incident\u201d or occurs in \u201ca moment of animal exuberance,\u201d Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., 312 U.S. 287, 293, 61 S.Ct. 552, 85 L.Ed. 836 (1941); whether the employer\u2019s unlawful acts were serious or provocative, Local 833, UAW, <em>supra, </em>300 F.2d at 703; and whether reinstatement would effectuate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>the policies of the Act, <em>id. </em>at 703. As the court in NLRB v. Thor Power Tool Co., <em>supra, </em>351 F.2d at 587, aptly summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-4\">Initially, the responsibility to draw the line between these conflicting rights rests with the Board, and its determination, unless illogical or arbitrary, ought not be disturbed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">We find that the Labor Board\u2019s conclusions in these matters were neither arbitrary nor illogical and, with one exception, decline to comment further.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">The one particularly troublesome matter involves the suspension two days after the car following incident of employees Fletcher, Snyder and Brewer \u201cpending investigation for misconduct.\u201d While the suspension letter indicated no specific reason for such action, the Company concedes that it was largely meant \u201cto advise the Company\u2019s other employees . . . that misconduct resulting in death would not be tolerated . \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The fact that the re-' suiting death was apparently the primary reason for suspension leads us directly to the case of NLRB v. Burnup <em>&amp; </em>Sims, Inc., 379 U.S. 21, 85 S.Ct. 171, 13 L.Ed.2d 1 (1964), In <em>Burnup &amp; Sims </em>it was incorrectly brought to the employer\u2019s attention that two employees who were attempting to organize the respondent company\u2019s plant had threatened to dynamite the plant if they did not receive collective bargaining authorization. They were forthwith discharged. After finding that the employees were engaged in an activity protected by \u00a7 7, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-8\">Over and again the Board has ruled that \u00a7 8(a)(1) is violated if an employee is discharged for misconduct arising out of a protected activity, despite the employer\u2019s good faith, when it is shown that the misconduct never occurred. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-9\">That rule seems to us to be in conformity with the policy behind \u00a7 8(a)(1). Otherwise the protected activity would lose some of its immunity, since the example of employees who are discharged on false charges would or might have a deterrent effect on other employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">379 U.S. at 23, 85 S.Ct. at 172. Here the employees in question were alleged to have engaged in what may be characterized as <em>two </em>types of misconduct: First, merely following the Smith automobile; second, and more seriously, engaging in activity which \u201cresult[ed] in death.\u201d It was for the latter reason that they were suspended, yet it later became clear that Smith\u2019s death could not be attributed to these employees. As in <em>Burnup &amp; Sims </em>the Company had acted under a good faith mistake of fact, and that case therefore controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">The Company urges us to distinguish <em>Burnup &amp; Sims </em>on the ground that the employees there, unlike here, were engaged in activities protected by \u00a7 7. <em>Compare </em>NLRB v. Laney &amp; Duke Storage Warehouse Co., 369 F.2d 859, 865-866 (5th Cir. 1966) <em>with </em>NLRB v. Big Three Welding Equipment Co., 359 F.2d 77, 84 (5th Cir. 1966). While some confusion is understandable in light of the Board\u2019s order, its conclusion is nevertheless deducible and contrary to the Company\u2019s contention. The trial examiner apparently concluded that the three employees were not engaged in protected activity, a finding which was rejected by the Board. Although the Board addressed only the issue of whether \u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1) had been violated by the <em>discharge </em>of the employees when it held that the discharge was \u201cin contravention of their rights under Section 7,\u201d it could not in the next breath consistently conclude that the employees were disassociated from \u00a7 7 rights for purposes of the <em>suspension. </em>Having concluded that Fletcher, Brewer and Snyder were not disassociated from \u00a7 7 activities during the car following incident, we find the outcome to be controlled by the rational espoused in <em>Burnup &amp; Sims \u2014i. e. </em>the suspension of the three em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>ployees pending investigation was a violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">We similarly reject the argument that the present case is distinguishable from <em>Burnup &amp; Sims </em>in that the Board here found that the employees <em>were </em>engaged in misconduct, but not misconduct so egregious as to render them unfit for further employment. While we do not hold that all misconduct insufficient for dismissal is prima facie insufficient for suspension under the <em>Burnup &amp; Sims </em>rationale we do note that the only other \u201cmisconduct\u201d in which the three participated was that of following an automobile at 30 to 40 feet with no attempt to interfere or communicate. Thus, even assuming that this was the \u201cmisconduct\u201d for which they were suspended rather than the fact that an employee coincidentally met his death, we find it insufficient to merit suspension for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">C. <em>Refusal of the Company to Bargain and Events that Followed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">The Company refused to comply with the Union\u2019s December 2 request for further bargaining, stating as grounds therefor that a decertification petition was then pending with the National Labor Relations Board. Indeed, such a petition had been filed by an unknown number of dissident employees on December 1, although it was immediately suspended by the Board pending the outcome of the unfair labor practice proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">The Union was originally certified in 1955 and recertified in 1962 as well as by subsequent execution of a series of collective-bargaining agreements. After its first year of certification a rebuttable presumption of the union\u2019s majority status exists. Unless the employer can prove that the union in fact no longer enjoys a majority, it can only overcome the presumption upon a showing of \u201csufficient evidence to cast serious doubt on the union\u2019s continued majority status.\u201d Stoner Rubber Co., Inc., 123 N.L.R.B. 1440, 1445 (1959). The pertinent standard has been interpreted to require both a reasonable basis in fact for the doubt and good faith by the employer. <em>See, e. g., </em>Lodges 1746 and 743, IMW v. NLRB, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 53, 416 F.2d 809, 812 (1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1058, 90 S.Ct. 751, 24 L.Ed.2d 752 (1969); NLRB v. Frick Co., 423 F.2d 1327, 1330 (3d Cir. 1970). The naked showing that a decertification petition has been filed, with no indication of the number of signatories or other related matters, is an insufficient basis in fact for refusing to bargain since it establishes no more than that the petition was supported by the requisite 30% \u201cshowing of interest.\u201d Wabana, Inc., 146 N.L.R.B. 1162, 1171 (1964). In the present case the Employer attempted to bolster this evidence by testifying that on December 4, the date on which it refused to bargain, more persons were crossing the picket line to work than were striking. It has been held time and again, however, that an employee\u2019s return to work during a strike does not provide a reasonable basis for presuming that he has repudiated the union as his bargaining representative. <em>See, e. g., </em>NLRB v. Easton Packing Co., 487 F.2d 811, 814 (3d Cir. 1971); NLRB v. Frick Co., <em>supra, </em>423 F.2d at 1333-34; and NLRB v. Little Rock Downtowner, Inc., 414 F.2d 1084, 1091 (8th Cir. 1969). <em>Compare </em>Terrell Machine Co. v. NLRB, 427 F.2d 1088, 1090 (4th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 929, 90 S.Ct. 1821, 26 L.Ed.2d 91 (1970). Absent supporting evidence it may mean no more than that he was forced to return to work for financial reasons or that he did not support the strike in question. <em>See, e. g., </em>NLRB v. Frick Co., <em>supra, </em>423 F.2d at 1333. Finally, the Employer\u2019s testimony to the effect that he had personal knowledge of \u201coverwhelming sentiment\u201d against the Union, with no indication of the number or identity of workers expressing such views nor any other corroboration, is no more than a \u201cself-serving assertion,\u201d NLRB v. Little Rock Downtowner, Inc., <em>supra, </em>414 F.2d at 1091, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>adds nothing to the preceding evidence. While we must consider the totality of such evidence in determining whether the employer had a reasonably grounded good faith doubt as to the Union\u2019s majority status, we note that on two previous occasions within the course of the strike the Employer had engaged in unfair labor practices: First, by withholding accrued vacation pay; and second, by suspending employees Fletcher, Brewer and Snyder. As found by the Trial Examiner and supported by the evidence, these actions contributed to the loss of Union support and, when considered with the foregoing, preclude any possibility that the Company maintained a good faith doubt as to the Union\u2019s continued majority status. <em>See </em>NLRB v. A. W. Thompson, Inc., 449 F.2d 1333, 1336 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 1065, 92 S.Ct. 1497, 31 L.Ed.2d 795 (1972). We note additionally that refusal to furnish the Union with information essential to its bargaining obligation is yet another indication of bad faith. United Steelworkers v. NLRB, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 103, 405 F.2d 1373 (1968). We think the Board\u2019s conclusion that the Company violated \u00a7 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act by refusing to bargain on and after December 4 is amply supported by the record.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">D. <em>Conversion into an Unfair Labor Practice Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The Board found that by refusing to bargain with the Union on December 4, 1969, in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act the Employer prolonged the strike and consequently it converted as of that date into an unfair labor practice strike.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the strike was economic in nature at its outset. The Union takes issue with the standard applied by the Board in determining which of several unfair labor practices converted the strike. The Union, relying upon an isolated passage from Teamsters Local 992 v. NLRB, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 312 427 F.2d 582 (1970), contends that a strike is converted if the unfair labor practice in question merely \u201caggravates\u201d rather than \u201cprolongs\u201d it. The issue involved in <em>Teamsters Local 992 </em>was whether substantial evidence supported the Board\u2019s finding that a unilateral decision by the employer to increase wages by fourteen cents per hour converted an economic strike into an unfair labor practice strike. While it is true that the court referred to \u201caggravate\u201d and \u201cprolong\u201d disjunctively, reliance upon such usage is misplaced as the following passage indicates :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-9\">\u201c[W]here a strike which initially involved no unfair labor practice is prolonged or aggravated by an employer\u2019s unfair labor practice, the same rule applies as where the strike is the <em>result </em>of an unfair labor practice, and the employer is bound to reinstate all strikers . . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-10\">Once it is shown that an employer\u2019s unfair labor practice is a significant factor in a strike, the burden is \u201con the Company to show that the strike would have continued even if it had [not committed its unfair labor practice] .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>427 F.2d at 587. Thus, it is abundantly clear that the court in <em>Local 992 </em>was concerned with the effect of such practices on the longevity of the strike and not merely with whether the unfair labor practices aggravated the strike. This is consistent with the great weight of authority.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-5\">It has been uniformly ruled and is now well settled that to entitle employees to reinstatement because of unfair [labor] practice of the employer, after a strike has been declared, it must appear that the practice prolonged the strike; and this necessarily follows from the fact that only then can it be that any part of the unemployment for which reinstatement is the remedy has resulted from a violation of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">NLRB v. James Thompson &amp; Co., 208 F.2d 743, 749 (2d Cir. 1953) (footnote omitted). <em>Accord, </em>Electrical Workers Local 613 v. NLRB, 328 F.2d 723, 726 (3d Cir. 1964); Drivers Local 662 v.

Having concluded that the Board applied the appropriate standard, we find the Board\u2019s determination that the strike was, in fact, prolonged by the refusal to bargain to be supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> NLRB v. Frick Co., 397 F.2d 956, 964 (3d Cir. 1968). We therefore conclude that the order of the Board should be modified with regard to the suspension of employees Fletcher, Brewer and Snyder in accordance with this opinion, and so modified we grant the Board\u2019s application for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-13\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.

Here, when the vacation pay demands were first made and refused, virtually all of the plant personnel were out in support of the strike and no serious effort was made to keep the plant in operation. The refusal to pay, as found by the Trial Examiner and not refuted by the Board, was diseriminatorily motivated. The fact that it was ultimately paid and paid to both strikers and nonstrikers does not remove the discriminatory taint \u2014 it was paid at a time when, according to the testimony of the Company, more individuals were working than striking and the plant was substantially operational once again.
