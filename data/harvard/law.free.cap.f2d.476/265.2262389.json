An order to show cause was issued by the late Judge Theodore Levin. The contempt proceeding relates to alleged violations of certain provisions of a consent decree entered in an anti-trust case on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>July 1, 1955. After the contempt proceeding was instituted pretrial conferences were held by the late Judge Levin, as a result of which the Government was directed to produce documents and to enter into conferences with counsel for the respondents in an effort to define and narrow the issues and to ascertain the claims and theories of the Government for the purpose of apprising the respondents of the claims against them and expediting the proceedings upon trial of the contempt action.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">For a period of months Judge Levin complained about the reluctance of the Government to comply with his directions and orders relating to discovery and as to the narrowing of issues and definition of the Government\u2019s claims. After much preliminary skirmishing the respondents filed a motion to dismiss the proceedings. In the motion the respondents\u2019 allegations were that \u201c(1) The statement of the claims and the admissions and definitions of issues made by the Government * * * are such that said petition and claims fail to state or constitute a cause of action of criminal contempt * * *. (2) The statement of the claims and the admissions and definitions of issues * * * clearly show that there is a lack of probable cause * * *. (3) The petition, as construed by admissions and definitions of issues * * * is * * * equally consistent with innocence as with guilt * *. (4) The exercise of appropriate judicial discretion, authority and power * * * should impel the Court at this time to dismiss this action of alleged criminal contempt * *</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">After considering the briefs and arguments of counsel, the District Judge, who took the case over from the late Judge Levin, dismissed the proceedings after rendering a lengthy opinion reciting the theories of the parties, the concessions of the Government, and an analysis of the facts as the trial court considered them to be demonstrated by the pretrial proceedings, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">\u201c[I]t is manifest to the Court as a matter of law that there was no wilful contumacious violation of the Consent Decree by respondents and that, at all events, there is a lack of probable cause or that further prosecution will not serve the public interest and is unnecessary to safeguard or preserve the \u2018authority or dignity of the Court\u2019 or its orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">At the time this case was argued this Court was of the opinion that the order dismissing the action, from which this appeal was taken, was an appealable order within the meaning of the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, prior to its amendment by Public Law 91-644. Clearly, a criminal contempt action is a criminal case within the meaning of the Act. United States v. Sanders, 196 F.2d 895, 897 (10th Cir. 1952), cert. denied 344 U.S. 829, 73 S.Ct. 33, 97 L.Ed. 645 (1952).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">\u201cAn application to show cause why defendant should not be prosecuted for criminal contempt is equivalent to an information charging criminal contempt, under Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C. and a criminal contempt proceeding is a criminal ease within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. An order dismissing a criminal contempt proceeding is appealable under the Criminal Appeals Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">Even more persuasive is the language of the Supreme Court in Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 201, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 1481, 20 L.Ed.2d 522 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-14\">\u201cCriminal contempt is a crime in the ordinary sense; it is a violation of the law, a public wrong which is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both. In the words of Mr. Justice Holmes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-15\">\u2018These contempts are infractions of the law, visited with punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal, we are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic of crimes as that word has been understood in English speech.\u2019 Gompers v. United States, 233 U.S. 604, 610 [34 S.Ct. 693, 695, 58 L.Ed. 1115] (1914).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u201cCriminally contemptuous conduct may violate other provisions of the criminal law; but even when this is not the case convictions for criminal contempt are indistinguishable from ordinary criminal convictions, for their impact on the individual defendant is the same. Indeed, the role of criminal contempt and that of many ordinary criminal laws seem identical \u2014 protection of the institutions of our government and enforcement of their mandates.\u201d (footnote omitted)'.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">See also United States v. Goldman, 277 U.S. 229, 235, 236, 48 S.Ct. 486, 72 L.Ed. 862 (1928); Gompers v. Buck\u2019s Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 444, 31 S.Ct. 492, 55 L.Ed. 797 (1911); United States v. Peterson, 456 F.2d 1135, 1139 (10th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">A motion to dismiss is in effect a demurrer to the indictment, the information or in this case the petition. It has long been the law that matters outside the indictment are not to be considered on a demurrer. Dunlop v. United States, 165 U.S. 486, 17 S.Ct. 375, 41 L.Ed. 799 (1897); United States v. Comyns, 248 U.S. 349, 39 S.Ct. 98, 63 L.Ed. 287 (1919). Some erosion of this rule may be found in United States v. Fruehauf, 365 U.S. 146, 81 S.Ct. 547, 5 L.Ed.2d 476 (1961), and see also United States v. Apex Distributing Co., 270 F.2d 747 (9th Cir. 1959), noted with approval in United States v. Sisson, 399 U.S. 267, 293 n. 22, 90 S.Ct. 2117, 26 L.Ed.2d 608 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">We consider, however, that the issue has been put to rest in United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 92 S.Ct. 2531, 33 L.Ed.2d 507 (1972). In the opinion of the Court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Burger, we find the following at page 506, 92 S.Ct. at page 2534:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">\u201cUnder United States v. Sisson, 399 U.S. 267 [90 S.Ct. 2117, 26 L.Ed.2d 608] (1970), an appeal does not lie from a decision that rests, not upon the sufficiency of the indictment alone, but upon extraneous facts. If an indictment is dismissed as a result of a stipulated fact or the showing of evidentiary facts outside the indictment, which facts would constitute a defense on the merits at trial, no appeal is available. See United States v. Findley, 439 F.2d 970 (CA1 1971).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">Clearly, the District Judge in the instant case relied upon matters outside the petition for an order to show cause and the order pursuant thereto. There can be no doubt that the District Judge relied upon the statement of the claims, the admissions and definitions of issues elicited from the Government during the course of the discovery proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">For the reasons herein stated and on authority of <em>Brewster </em>we conclude that the order in question is not an appeal-able order. The appeal will be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
