We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-25\">Appellant was convicted upon trial by jury of possession of marijuana, a narcotic drug, puruant to Article 725b, Vernon\u2019s Ann.Texas Penal Code. He was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment. In his petition filed below, appellant requested the impanelling of a three-judge court to consider the constitutionality of Article 725b. He urged that the law is constitutionally unsound in that it erroneously classifies marijuana as a narcotic drug and sought to have the crime reduced to misdemeanor status and the penalty reduced in addition to his immediate release.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-26\">This Court has previously found Article 725b to be constitutionally sound, rejecting the same arguments which appellant offers. Rener v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1971, 447 F.2d 20. Appellant is not entitled to relief. The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
