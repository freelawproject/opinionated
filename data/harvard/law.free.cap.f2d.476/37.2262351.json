United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), in the case of \u201cinterlocking\u201d confessions of codefendants. Only because we consider ourselves bound by United States ex rel. Catanzaro v. Mancusi, 404 F.2d 296 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 397 U. S. 942, 90 S.Ct. 956, 25 L.Ed.2d 123 (1970), and its progeny in this circuit,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> do we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-17\">The original conviction was for murder in the first degree in the New York state courts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant, Carlos Ortiz, his brother Alfredo and one Doel Valencia each had confessed to the October, 1964, killing of Alexander Helmer, a resident of the Bronx, in the course of robbing him. The confessions were held voluntary following a <em>Huntley </em>hearing. While there apparently is a pending habeas case relating to the voluntariness of Alfredo\u2019s confession, no claim is advanced here that any of the three were involuntary, much less appellant\u2019s. The only basis for the convictions was the confessions, since there was no evidence independent of the confessions having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>a connection to the appellant. That is to say, there were no witnesses to the slaying, and there was no scientific evidence that would have connected appellant or his codefendants to the scene of the crime. True, two Bazooka bubble gum wrappers were found in the deceased\u2019s apartment, but it was only through appellant\u2019s own confession, in which he stated that he left Bazooka wrappers at the scene, that they were tied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\"><em>Bruton, </em>it will be recalled, held that the sixth amendment confrontation rights of the defendant Bruton, who had made no admissions or confessions, had been violated by the admission of a confession of his codefendant, Evans, who did not take the stand, even though the trial court \u2014 following Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278 (1957)\u2014had charged the jury that the codefendant\u2019s confession should be disregarded in determining Bruton\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>Catanzaro </em>held that because Catanzaro had himself confessed and his confession interlocked with and supported his codefendant\u2019s confession, \u201cno such \u2018devastating\u2019 risk attends the lack of confrontation as was thought to be involved in <em>Bruton.\u201d </em>404 F.2d at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">There is some question here whether the appellant's confession did \u201cinterlock,\u201d or in the words of Judge Lasker below was \u201csubstantially identical,\u201d with the others. Each confession involved appellant, his brother Alfredo, the third defendant, Valencia, and one \u201cNegrito\u201d who is said by appellant and Valencia to have done the actual stabbing of the victim. Appellant\u2019s and Valencia\u2019s confessions each told of the stabbing after the victim put up some resistance. All three confessions said that Alfredo Ortiz was posted as lookout, and in none of them is it claimed that he saw the actual stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Appellant claims that the confessions do not interlock: first, because Alfredo\u2019s confession in no way covered the slaying itself; second, because the confessions placed the crime at substantially different times. Although the three confessions do not all cover the same facts, they do interlock and are consistent as regards the slaying. As to the time of commission, there is a considerable discrepancy. Appellant\u2019s and his brother\u2019s confessions fixed the crime at noon, while Valencia\u2019s confession set it at 9:00 p. m.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This means that one or more of the confessions is false or erroneous. But we do not think it takes away from the \u201cinterlocking\u201d aspect of the confessions. As to motive, plot and execution of the crime they are essentially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Appellant\u2019s principal argument is that <em>Bruton </em>applies here because <em>Catanzaro </em>and progeny are really applications of Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969). <em>Harrington </em>held that admission of co-defendants\u2019 confessions after <em>Bruton </em>was harmless constitutional error because a statement by Harrington placed him at the scene of the crime, and other incriminating evidence was so \u201coverwhelming . . . that this violation of <em>Bruton </em>was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .\u201d 395 U.S. at 254, 89 S.Ct. at 1728. Appellant argues here that because there was no such other evidence \u2014 though on this score the Bazooka bubble gum wrappers do constitute independent evidence, albeit based on Ortiz\u2019s own confession \u2014 the <em>Bruton </em>violation was certainly not \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d We would have to say that while the gum wrappers were perhaps not \u201coverwhelming,\u201d they were substantial, and they do corroborate his own statement as to his presence at the scene. We are not unmindful, moreover, of Mr. Justice White\u2019s dissenting comment in <em>Bruton </em>(which did not involve the defendant\u2019s own confession) that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s own confession is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>be admitted against him.\u201d 391 U.S. at 139, 88 S.Ct. at 1630.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since the voluntariness of the confessions has not been argued, it would seem that here, as in <em>Harrington, </em>the constitutional error would be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The teaching of <em>Catanzaro et al. </em>is, however, that <em>Bruton </em>is inapplicable where co-confessions \u201cinterlock.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Existence of independent evidence linking the defendant to the scene and the crime \u2014though there were some in <em>Catanzaro, </em>not alluded to except in the statement of facts \u2014 is not a factor under <em>Catanzaro. </em>The <em>Catanzaro </em>rationale is that the \u201c \u2018devastating\u2019 risk\u201d that a jury will not be able to disregard the codefendant\u2019s confession is not present when the defendant\u2019s own confession is in evidence. 404 F.2d at 300.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">This rationale does not seem to go, however, to the second underpinning of <em>Bruton, </em>viz., that the credibility of a co-defendant\u2019s confession is \u201cinevitably suspect, a fact recognized when accomplices do take the stand and the jury is instructed to weigh their testimony carefully ...\u201d 391 U.S. at 136, 88 S.Ct. at 1628. The element of unreliability, as the Court said, is \u201cintolerably compounded when the alleged accomplice, as here, does not testify and cannot be tested by cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Despite the defendant\u2019s own confession, the jury may still look to the incriminating statements of a codefendant, or to the cumulative impact of those statements coupled with the defendant\u2019s own statements, to find the defendant\u2019s guilt\u2014 despite the \u201cplacebo\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of curative instructions. <em>Cf. </em>People v. Jackson, 22 N.Y.2d 446, 293 N.Y.S.2d 265, 239 N.E. 2d 869 (1968) (separate trials ordered for three codefendants, all of whom had confessed). And while no issue of voluntariness has here been raised, the fact is that if in the separate habeas case now pending, Alfredo\u2019s confession is held to have been made involuntarily, inadmissible evidence will have been used to convict his brother, the appellant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">Thus, we are somewhat uncomfortable with the implications of <em>Catanzaro. </em>Yet it is now the law of this circuit. It was followed in United States ex rel. Sloan v. McMann, 415 F.2d 275 (2d Cir. 1969), and in United States ex rel. Duff v. Zelker, 452 F.2d 1009 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 932, 92 S.Ct. 1807, 32 L.Ed.2d 134 (1972), although <em>Sloan </em>rested on the alternative ground of harmless error. If it is to be overruled, it will have to be by the Supreme Court, absent the requisite en banc vote which \u2014 through prior circulation of this opinion \u2014 has not ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">Here we emphasize that there is no issue of voluntariness of any of the co-defendants\u2019 confessions. Nor is there any content of the codefendants\u2019 confessions that implicates appellant any more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>in the commission of the crime than does his own confession \u2014 in fact, of the three, his own is the most significant.</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">We therefore affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-11\">.
