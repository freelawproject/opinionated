Both have had substantial sales and advertising expenditures. Op-poser\u2019s priority is clear, its sales dating from 1956, whereas applicant\u2019s business under the mark \u201cMERRY CAPERS\u201d commenced in July 1967. Applicant introduced thirteen third-party registrations of marks consisting of or including \u201cCaper\u201d or \u201cKaper\u201d for clothing of various kinds, granted between 1940 and 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-26\">The sole issue is likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception under section 2(d) of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d)). The board divided on the question, the majority being of the view that \u201cthe mere inclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>the word \u2018caper\u2019 or \u2018capers\u2019 in both marks is insufficient to create a likelihood of confusion or mistake.\u201d The dissenting opinion reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-5\">It is my opinion that the word \u201cCAPER\u201d or \u201cCAPERS\u201d is not only completely arbitrary as applied to the goods here involved, but it is the characterizing feature of the marks of both parties. Such being the case, I would sustain the opposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\"> The marks must, of course, be considered in their entireties. In doing so, however, the term \u201cCasuals\u201d in op-poser\u2019s mark is seen to have the obviously descriptive connotation of casual clothes, leaving \u201cCAPER\u201d as the distinguishing or origin-indicating part of the mark. In applicant\u2019s mark \u201cMERRY\u201d obviously stands in an adjectival or modifying position relative to the word \u201cCAPERS,\u201d which therefore stands out as the dominant feature of the mark. We agree with the dissenting member of the board that \u201cCAPER,\u201d in the singular or plural form, is arbitrary as applied to clothing, though highly suggestive of a fun thing, of frisking, frolicking, romping, prancing, and dancing, and hence of casual clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">Considering the marks as a whole and the total impressions they create, we believe that purchasers, actual or prospective, familiar with the \u201cCAPER Casuals\u201d line of men\u2019s and boys\u2019 slacks and trousers might well think that \u201cMERRY CAPERS\u201d infants\u2019, children\u2019s, and ladies\u2019 casual clothing had a common source, and vice versa. We therefore think there is likelihood of confusion as to the origin of the goods sold by the parties, if sold under these two marks and the prior user is therefore entitled to have its opposition to registration by the latecomer sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">We have considered the cited third-party registrations and accept them as evidence that the term \u201cCaper\u201d has in the past appealed to others in the clothes-merchandising field as an appropriate term to use as a mark, or part of a mark, on various items of clothing. But in the absence of any evidence showing the <em>extent of use </em>of any of such marks or whether any of them are now in <em>use, </em>they provide no basis for saying that the marks so registered have had, or may have, any effect at all on the public mind so as to have a bearing on likelihood of confusion. The purchasing public is not aware of registrations reposing in the Patent Office and though they are <em>relevant, </em>in themselves they have little evidentiary <em>value </em>on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">MARKEY, C. J., and BALDWIN, J., dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1062-17\"> The Petition of Appeal states that appellant has complied with the provisions of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 142 and 143, which pertain to appeals in patent rather than trademark cases. However, we have construed the appeal as if filed pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(a), the provision governing appeals to this court in trademark cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
