On July 12, 1972, Harris filed another application for a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that he had not been retried within 120 days; in response, the State moved for an extension of time on August 2, 1972, and moved that Appellant\u2019s Application be dismissed on August 4, 1972. After considering the motion along with a transcript of the proceedings in the State Court, the District Court, under 28 U.S.C. 2243,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted the State\u2019s motion for an extension of time on August 10, 1972, and on August 16, 1972 granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss the Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">This is not a case of a defendant being denied a speedy trial by delaying tactics by the state. Appellant has made no effort to obtain a speedy re-trial through the available state remedies. On the contrary, Appellant is dissatisfied with the original March 2 order of the District Court entitling him to only a new trial instead of outright release. In its August 10 order the District Court found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHH\">\u201cthat said Petitioner, REUBEN [sic] HARRIS, JR., is attempting to frustrate and prevent the right of State to re-try the case of State v. Reuben [sic] Harris, Jr., (cause No. 68-458), by employing tactics .of recalcitrance and delay. It is apparent that the State has attempted to comply with this Court\u2019s order dated March 2, 1972, and has been standing ready to re-try Defendant HARRIS since the call of the trial docket on May 1, 1972.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">Appellant will not be permitted to obstruct the State\u2019s efforts to re-try him and then obtain a dismissal for failure of the State to provide him with a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">Therefore, the orders appealed from are</p>\n<p id=\"b778-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-17\">. \u201cThe court shall . . . dispose of the matter as law and justice require.\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
