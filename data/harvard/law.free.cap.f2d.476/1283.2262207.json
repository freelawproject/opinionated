It is implicit in our decision that the insurance was purchased for the buyer to accommodate the C.I.F. shipment by appellee, the seller, and not for appellee\u2019s own interest. It is now apparent that the principal question in the ease and one that has not been answered is whether appellee was insured at all. If so, the subsequent question will be to identify such insurable interest as appellee may have, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-25\">So that these questions may be reached we vacate our holding that appellee lacked standing as well as the judgment of the district court and remand with direction that these questions be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-26\">Vacated and remanded with direction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1341-22\">. 19A Florida Stat.Ann. \u00a7 672.2-501(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgP\">\u201cThe seller retains an insurable interest in goods so long as title to or any security interest in the goods remains in him . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1341-39\">. 474 F.2d 8 (5 Cir., 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
