Henry (4th Cir. 1972), 455 F.2d 779, found it constitutionally impermissible for public schools to impose \u201chair codes\u201d on their students. The football coach at Greenbrier East High School, however, decreed that all members of the football squad at that school should observe a \u201chair code\u201d prescribed by him, not merely during football season, but throughout the school year, under penalty of being denied their \u201cletter\u201d for participation as a member of the team. The plaintiff was a student at Greenbrier East High School and a member of the football squad who, by his participation, earned a right to a \u201cletter\u201d in football. He had observed the \u201chair code\u201d ordered by the football coach during the football season but allowed his hair to grow beyond the prescribed length thereafter. Because of his noncompliance with the \u201chair code\u201d in the off-season school year, he was denied at the end of the school year his football \u201cletter\u201d and an invitation to the Athletics Banquet by the coach. This action of the coach, on appeal, was sustained by the school authorities. The plaintiff seeks by this action to void as an unconstitutional deprivation this denial of his right to a football \u201cletter\u201d by the school authorities. The District Court dismissed his action. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">The doctrine of <em>Massie </em>is equally applicable to all school-controlled activities. It extends to school athletic programs, as well as to school academic programs. Awards, properly earned in either field, cannot be used as instruments to enforce compliance with a \u201chair code\u201d, for the enforcement of which there is no compelling necessity. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there might be some hygienic or other reason to support a \u201chair code\u201d, as promulgated by the football coach during football season, such reason would plainly not justify the enforcement of the code after the football season had ended. The action of the football coach was accordingly in violation of the principles enunciated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Massie. See </em>Dunham v. Pulsifer (D.C. Vt.1970) 312 F.Supp. 411. The plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief. Under the circumstances, we do not feel a monetary award is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Reversed with instructions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
