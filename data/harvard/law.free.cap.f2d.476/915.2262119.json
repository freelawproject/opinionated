The order of the district court entered January 26, 1971, 321 F.Supp. 965, contains detailed findings of fact which are not questioned on this appeal. Two issues are presented: (1) whether the district court erred in denying the motion, and (2) whether by reason of events intervening since the order was entered the case has become moot and should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-16\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b974-17\">The appellant Anna Masszonia, a disabled, low-income, welfare recipient, was tenant in a Washington, D. C. substandard apartment complex owned by ABC Realty Co., Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From 1961 through 1967 ABC Realty operated the complex under a license issued by the Department of Licenses and Inspections for the District of Columbia, without, however, applying for Certificate of Occupancy. Because of unabated housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>regulation violations,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> applications for a renewal of the license for 1968 and subsequent years were denied on February 3, 1970, and the denials were sustained by the District of Columbia Board of Appeals and Review on May 20, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">.On February 26, 1970 a tenant commenced a class action against ABC Realty seeking to recover rents from 1961.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Some of the tenants began withholding their rent while others continued paying rent until their June, 1970 rent payment was returned to them. About the time the action was commenced ABC Realty ceased to pay water, gas and electricity bills for the complex, which resulted in termination of water service on May 19, 1970 and threatened termination of gas and electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">This class action was filed May 22, 1970 by appellant Masszonia on her own behalf and on the behalf of all tenants similarly situated against Walter E. Washington, Commissioner of the District; the Water Registrar of the District; and the president of ABC Realty, seeking equitable relief that the utilities be continued. In amended complaints ABC Realty<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the two utilities were added as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">By order entered July 29, 1970 (opinion at 315 F.Supp. 529) the Commissioner and his subordinates were enjoined from refusing to provide water and sewer service and from refusing to enter into contracts with the utilities to provide gas and electricity, pendente lite, so long as the tenants lawfully occupied the premises, the court holding that it was the duty of the District of Columbia under District of Columbia Code, Section 5-313 (1967) to provide these services on a temporary and emergency basis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">Between July 24 and July 27, 1970 the District served the tenants with orders to vacate the premises by August 3, 1970. On August 3 the district court enjoined the Commissioner and his subordinates from prosecuting any tenant for failure or refusal to vacate his apartment, and ordered the Commissioner to provide relocation services to the tenants within two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">On August 14, 1970 the appellant Masszonia moved for a preliminary injunction under a supplemental complaint, seeking the appointment of a receiver and an order requiring the Commissioner to make necessary repairs and assess a tax on the property for the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-15\">\n<em>Order of January 26,1971</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b975-16\">The order of January 26, 1971 enjoins appellees,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> pending appeal, from prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>cuting or attempting to evict any tenant and requires appellees, pending appeal, to furnish utility services and provide the tenants with relocation services. The court refused to appoint a receiver and refused to order appellees to make the repairs sought by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The order of January 26, 1971 adhered to the court\u2019s conclusion in the July 29, 1970 order that \u201cwhere low-income tenants who cannot immediately relocate face the imminent failure of essential utility services which are the landlord\u2019s responsibility, and the landlord is beyond the effective power of the Court, it is the duty of the District of Columbia under District of Columbia Code, Section 5-313 (1967) to provide these services on a temporary and emergency basis.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The court held further that Section 5-313 \u201cconfers only a discretionary authority upon the Commissioner\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to correct conditions existing in violation of law or regulation, and the court could not hold as a matter of law \u201cthat it would be an abuse of that discretion to fail to provide those utilities on a permanent, continuing basis or to fail to make the extensive repairs sought in this Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, the ultimate, permanent relief sought in the Supplemental Complaint.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">\n<em>Events Subsequent to January 26, 1971 Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b976-15\">On April 19, 1971 (after the record and appellants\u2019 brief had been filed in this court) appellant Masszonia filed in the district court a \u201cmotion to modify the injunction pending appeal entered January 26, 1971\u201d to order the defendant Washington to terminate the utility services and secure the buildings at 1401 and 1405 Girard Street, N.W., and to require proper securing of the buildings at 2804 Fourteenth St., N.W. in compliance with the January 26, 1971 order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">Pursuant to this motion, the district court on April 22, 1971 ordered the Commissioner \u201cto immediately secure the premises at 2804 Fourteenth Street, N.W. to prevent further access thereto * * * \u201d, to terminate the utilities at 1401-1405 Girard Street, N.W., and to \u201cproceed immediately to make said premises secure by boarding up basement and first floor doors and windows and blocking fire escapes.\u201d The Commissioner was also authorized to proceed with normal condemnation procedures with respect to the premises at 2804 Fourteenth Street, N.W. He was \u201cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>joined to take no other or further action in any way affecting the premises at 1401 and 1405 Girard Street, N.W., without further order\u201d of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">On June 29, 1971 the district court, upon the motion of plaintiffs, vacated <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of January 26, 1971 the paragraph of the January 26 order requiring the deposit of plaintiffs\u2019 public assistance rent allotments into the Registry of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">\n<em>Issue of Mootness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">Subsequent to oral argument, appellees filed a \u201cSuggestion of Mootness\u201d, with supporting affidavits, from which it appears that following the order of April 22, 1971 the premises at 2804 Fourteenth Street, N.W. were condemned and razed, and the premises at 1401-1405 Girard Street, N.W. were barricaded; that the Girard Street property has not since been inhabited, and is \u201cuninhabitable by reason of its insanitary and structurally defective condition;\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that all tenants seeking assistance were relocated.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">Appellees contend that \u201cagainst this background\u201d, the \u201cappellants have effectively abandoned the plainly uninhabitable Girard Street property, without likelihood or right of return and that they currently have no possessory interest in that property.\u201d Accordingly they argue that the case should be remanded to the district court with directions to vacate its order of January 26, 1971 and to dismiss the case as moot.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">In her original and supplemental complaints and motion for a preliminary injunction, appellant Masszonia seeks an injunction which would require the Commissioner to (1) provide utilities on a permanent, continuing basis and (2) make whatever repairs might be necessary to bring the three buildings into compliance with the housing regulations. Ancillary thereto appellants seek the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the property and manage it, pendente lite. When the complaint was filed 66 units of the apartment complex were occupied. All were vacated prior to the district court\u2019s order of April 22, 1971. Subsequent thereto the building at 2804 Fourteenth Street, N.W. was demolished, as authorized in the April 22 order. Under this order, however, the Commissioner was enjoined \u201cto take no other or further action in any way affecting the premises at 1401 and 1405 Girard Street, N.W. without further order\u201d of the court. If the district court finds, as stated in appellees\u2019 affidavits, that these premises are now uninhabitable, barricaded, and scheduled for demolition, it would appear that the district court should revoke this provision of the April 22 order and dismiss the action as moot.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>We conclude that the questions here on appeal have become moot and do not reach the merits of the controversy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">This appeal is dismissed as moot and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-9\">. The complex consisted of three six-story apartments located at 2804 Fourteenth Street, N.W., and 1401 and 1405 Girard Street, N.W. Approximately 66 units were occupied at the outset of this litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-8\">. The court found' that a \u201csubstantial number of housing regulation violations\u201d had been noted from 1966 to July 21, 1970, when 1,053 unabated violations were noted in the three building complex, the violations consisting of \u201cleaking ceilings, falling plaster, broken windows, inadequate locks, absence of shades and screens, backed-up and broken plumbing fixtures, insufficient heat and hot water, holes in walls, accumulations of trash, rats and roaches\u201d which were \u201cso numerous, extensive and substantial that the buildings constitute a danger to the health and safety of the occupants.\u201d 321 F.Supp. at 968.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b975-9\">.

Appellees are the Commissioner and the Water Registrar of the District of Columbia. As noted <em>stipra </em>(Note 4), ABC Realty, Inc. and Lyman C. Delle, its president, were not personally served and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>did not enter an appearance. Nor have they participated in this appeal. Their liability to the tenants and to the District of Columbia is not before this court. On the merits, this appeal concerns solely the duty of the District of Columbia to appellants to act upon the failure of ABC to correct conditions existing in violation of the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b976-8\">. 321 F.Supp: at 970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b976-9\">.

Supporting affidavits indicate also that District authorities will recommend that the Girard Street property be condemned when the order of April 22, 1971 is vacated, and that in December, 1971 the area in which these buildings are located was added to the Neighborhood Development Program and designated for demolition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b977-10\">. With respect to appellant Masszonia, the affidavit of the Assistant Executive Director, Office of Relocation and Administration, recites that Mrs. Masszonia \u201cmoved to an address unknown on May 17, 1971. Various efforts had been made to relocate Mrs. Masszonia to standard housing, but she expressed plans to move on her own.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b977-15\">. In oral argument counsel for appellees relied heavily on the contention that the case is moot. Appellees were granted leave to file a motion to dismiss on that ground, and appellants were granted time for a reply. The motion and supporting memorandum and affidavits were filed by appellees. Appellants have not responded. In the absence of counter affidavits or other response, we accept as true the facts set forth in appellees\u2019 affidavits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b977-17\">. As noted <em>supra, </em>the order of April 22, 1970 was entered after the appeal was taken to this court. In view of our disposition of the appeal it is unnecessary to consider the effect of this order or whether the district court was authorized to enter the order after the appeal was taken from the prior order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b978-7\">. Those provisions of the orders favorable to appellants, from which no appeal was taken, have been complied with or are no longer effective by reason of appellants\u2019 abandonment of the property. All relief sought by appellants was based upon their occupancy of the property. If the affidavits filed by appellees are found by the district court to be true, nothing now remains to be litigated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b978-5\">SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A3L\">(dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">With the appeal now moot,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and resultantly the need for its dismissal plain, the sole question remaining for our decision is the disposition which the District Court is to make of its order of January 26, 1971, to aspects of which the appeal is exclusively addressed. My views on this phase of the case differ significantly from those of my colleagues. I think appellees\u2019 request that we direct the District Court to vacate the order should be denied as to the portions thereof which were not subjected to the appeal. But I also think United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to which this circuit has long adhered, requires vacation of so much of the order as appellants sought to have us review. The court\u2019s disposition of the present appeal leaves the order intact and that, I believe, is a clear departure from the wholesome practice which <em>Munsingwear </em>approved and which this court has adopted as its own. From such a disposition, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">As <em>Munsingwear </em>reveals, the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cestablished practice in dealing with a civil case from a court in the federal system which has become moot while on its way here or pending . decision on the merits is to reverse or vacate the judgment below and remand with a direction to dismiss.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The objective of this procedure, the Court explains, is to \u201cclear [] the path for future relitigation of the issues between the parties and eliminate [] a judgment, review of which was prevented through happenstance.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[w]hen that procedure is followed, the rights of all parties are preserved; none is prejudiced by a decision which in the statutory scheme [is] only preliminary.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">The practice noted in <em>Munsingwear </em>has found frequent acceptance in the federal circuits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this jurisdiction, we have taken <em>Munsingwear </em>as a mandate. In Acheson v. Droesse,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> decided shortly after <em>Munsingwear, </em>we read the latter as \u201capparently intended by the Supreme Court to announce a rule for the guidance of the United States Courts of Appeals in disposing of cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>which become moot pending appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he language of the Supreme Court in the <em>Munsingwear </em>case,\u201d we said, \u201cclearly directs the Courts of Appeals that in all civil cases in the United States courts which become moot pending appeal, and in which a motion to dismiss as moot is accompanied by a motion, to direct that the judgment below be vacated, both motions should be granted.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And down through the years since <em>Acheson, </em>we have consistently adhered to that understanding.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The opinion in <em>Munsingwear </em>makes clear, however, that a party ordinarily entitled to the relief <em>Munsingwear </em>affords may debar himself from obtaining it. There the Government had filed a two-count complaint against Munsingwear alleging violations of a regulation establishing maximum prices for commodities which it sold. The first count sought an injunction, and the second treble damages; and, by agreement and an order of the court, proceedings on the second count were held in abeyance pending final determination of the first-count claim for injunction. A similar arrangement was made in a separate suit for treble damages raising the same issues for a different period. The District Court held that the questioned prices complied with the regulation and entered a judgment of dismissal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Government appealed, and during the pendency of the appeal the involved commodity was decontrolled. On Munsingwear\u2019s motion, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal for mootness, making no provision for vacation of the District Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Munsingwear then moved in the District Court for dismissal of the treble damage claims on the ground that the unreversed judgment of that court on the injunction phase was res judicata of those claims. The District Court granted the motion, the Court of Appeals affirmed,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the case then went to the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">As the Court stated, had the Government insisted upon vacation of the District Court\u2019s judgment when the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal for mootness, it would have been entitled to a direction to that effect.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But the Government did not pursue that course; it made no motion to vacate the judgment, but simply acquiesced in the dismissal. Consequently, the Court held, it was not entitled to relief \u2014 -in the form of an exception to the doctrine of res judicata \u2014 from the District Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">It is against this backdrop that the disposition appropriate to the case at bar is to be fashioned. One question to be addressed is whether the situation presented falls within the general ambit of the <em>Munsingwear </em>doctrine. Another is whether the parties on either side of this appeal have disabled themselves from sharing in the benefits <em>Munsingwear </em>confers. To a consideration of these I now proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">The order subjected to this appeal\u2014 the order of January 26, 1971<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>\u2014 favored appellants in some respects and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>appellees in others. To appellants\u2019 detriment, it rejected the demand that the court direct repairs putting the premises in suit in habitable condition through the medium of a receivership or by imposition of that responsibility upon appellees.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It was the refusal to grant the request in either alternative that appellants sought to have altered on this appeal. Now that the appeal must be dismissed for mootness, their entitlement under <em>Munsingwear </em>to vacation of those portions of the January 26 order appealed would normally follow. In my view, indeed it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">I am mindful of the fact that appellants here, like the Government in <em>Munsingwear,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>have not requested vacation of any part of the order, but that, I think, could hardly justify us in ignoring the teachings of <em>Munsingwear. </em>Long before <em>Munsingwear </em>was decided, the Supreme Court declared that the practice it was later to describe in <em>Munsingwear </em>was \u201cthe duty of the appellate court.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To such a duty <em>Munsingwear </em>took pains to itself advert.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As a judge, I endeavor to discharge what by higher authority I am told is my plain duty whether I am asked by litigants to do so or not. I perceive no obstacle to discharge of our <em>Munsingwear </em>duty here simply because the court reviewed in <em>Munsingwear </em>omitted a response to it there.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In sum, I would abide <em>Munsingwear sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-19\">I am mindful, too, that relitigation of the issues on which appellants lost in the District Court seems unlikely, but that does not argue effectively against an application of <em>Munsingwear. </em>That very consideration was advanced to us in Aeheson v. Droesse,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> where it was urged that we distinguish <em>Munsingwear </em>on that basis.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We declined the invitation, pointing out that \u201camong the cases cited by the Supreme Court in the\u201d <em>Munsingwear </em>opinion<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cthere are instances in which there was no possibility of further litigation of the issues between the parties in the case on appeal even arising, and yet the Court ordered the lower court\u2019s judgment vacated.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The fact of the matter is that offtimes courts are not in position to know whether the controversy has ground to a definite halt or not, and this case is no exception.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The better part of justice is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>to liberate the parties from the shackles of res judicata rather than hazard a guess as to what the future may hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Turning now to appellees\u2019 motion that the January 26 order be vacated in its entirety, that relief in their favor is neither warranted nor possible. The appeal in this case brought before us for review only the parts of the order appellants complained of \u2014 the provisions which were unfavorable to them. Since appellees took no appeal from that order, two consequences disastrous to their request follow. In the first place, the unappealed portions of the order have long since become final,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and we now lack jurisdiction to disturb them.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In the second place, the <em>Munsingwear </em>doctrine was never intended to afford protection to parties in the position occupied by appellees. Their evident objective is to avoid the conelusiveness of the declaration of principles representing appellants\u2019 partial victory in the District Court.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> But obviously, as an eminent author has stated, \u201c[i]t would be quite destructive of the principle of judicial finality to put such a litigant in a position to destroy the collateral eonclusiveness of a judgment by destroying his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>own right to appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Nothing in <em>Munsingwear </em>supports such an approach; rather, the rule is well settled that the operation of the doctrine of res judicata is unaffected by the fact that the party sought to be concluded did not appeal from the adversity wrought by the judgment.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The situation as to appellees is not one in which the January 26 order should at their behest be vacated <em>in toto </em>\u201cto prevent a judgment, unreviewable because of mootness,\u201d as distinguished from failure to appeal, \u201cfrom spawning any legal consequences.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It is only as to the rulings against appellants which have since become \u201cunreviewable because of mootness . \u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> that vacation is called for, but as to them the call, in my view, is clear.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b978-8\">.

While appellants have thus far invoked only' equitable remedies, the possibility of relief of a different character is not foreclosed. And, as the District Court\u2019s findings vividly attest, there is much that can be complained about. The apartment complex in which they resided was permitted to operate for eight years without a certificate of occupancy, and for two years within an apartment house license, Masszonia v. Washington, 315 F.Supp. 529, 531-532 (D.D.C.1970); Masszonia v. Washington, <em>supra </em>note 17, 321 F.Supp. at 967, and during those periods the premises deteriorated appallingly. In the words of the District Court, \u201c [a]s of May, 1970, the housing inspectors noted over 1,000 violations of the Housing Code on the premises in question, reflecting the general intolerable conditions that have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>existed for many years, unattended and unabated. ... In addition, the owner's rental of these structures was apparently contrary to law, and the authorities, who were aware of the situation, tolerated noncompliance.\u201d Masszonia v. Washington, <em>supra, </em>315 F.Supp. at 531. See also Masszonia v. Washington, <em>supra </em>note 17, 321 F.Supp. at 968. \u201cThese violations,\u201d the court was later to add, \u201care so numerous, extensive and substantial that the buildings constitute a danger to the health and safety of the occupants.\u201d Masszonia v. Washington, <em>supra, </em>note 17, 321 F.Supp. at 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Even after the premises degenerated to this unsavory condition, the occupants\u2019 woes continued to increase. The corporate landlord walked out on the 66 families then residing in the complex and the corporate officers could not be located. <em>Id. </em>at 967. But for the intervention of the District Court, the occupants would have been without basic utility services from mid-1970 onward. <em>See </em>Masszonia v. Washington, <em>supra, </em>315 F.Supp. at 532-533. Matters finally worsened to the point that they had no choice but to move out.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">The original and primary transgression producing this shameful state of affairs was the landlord\u2019s. But those legally charged with the duty of supervising leased housing in the District of Columbia do not appear to be free from blame. In this very litigation, \u201c[t]he Corporation Counsel . . . point[ed] out that there are perhaps some 100,000 persons living in the District under conditions quite comparable to those which this complaint portrays.\u201d Masszonia v. Washington, <em>supra, </em>315 F.Supp. at 532. \u201cEnforcement of the housing laws and regulations,\u201d the court declared, \u201cwould have prevented the present situation from arising.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">The consequences of this lack of enforcement have fallen upon the group most dependent upon their local government for protection, for, as the District Court found, the named plaintiff in the litigation is \u201ca disabled, low income welfare recipient, representing a class that is best described as generally Tow income with at least twenty-six (26) public assistance recipients. . . . \u201d Masszonia v. Washington, <em>supra </em>note 17, 321 F.Supp. at 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">In these circumstances, T cannot say that these hapless victims of official indifference would not have justiciable complaints against the public servants responsible for their plight. My colleagues, however, leave standing the adverse rulings of the District Court which appellants endeavored to have reviewed on this appeal. Since I am unable to say that those rulings might not bar any effort undertaken hereafter, I would vacate them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b981-16\">. See Fed.R.App.P. 4(a).
