The collateral pledge agreement contained a \u201cdragnet clause,\u201d a common provision in collateral agreements purporting to give a secured lender the right to look to all the debtor\u2019s assets in the lender\u2019s hands to cover all the debtor\u2019s liabilities to the lender, past and future as well as present. After he had concluded the loan transaction by pledging his stock as collateral in this open-ended fashion, the borrower entered into an equipment-lease agreement with the same bank. No new collateral was pledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Still later, Iredale defaulted on the loan agreement, and the bank sold the stock. From the proceeds of the sale the bank satisfied Iredale\u2019s unpaid balance on the loan. The bank then applied the surplus to the amount due, and in arrears, under the equipment lease. The referee decided that this application was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">The district court sustained the referee\u2019s decision that the dragnet clause could not authorize the bank\u2019s application, as against other creditors, of the surplus collateral to the equipment lease. This view finds some support in the result of National Acceptance Co. v. Blackford, 408 F.2d 20 (5th Cir. 1969). However, <em>National Acceptance </em>turned in part on statutory considerations not applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">After the district court had ruled, this court decided Kesling v. Bank of America Nat\u2019l Trust &amp; Sav. Ass\u2019n, 449 F.2d 770 (9th Cir. 1971). <em>Kesling </em>holds that a security agreement is not rendered invalid merely because it creates a lien to secure future indebtedness. In the absence of evidence indicating that the dragnet clause was not intended to mean what it says, or that it contravened some provision of local law, the clause will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">The district court failed to give effect to the expressed intentions of the parties to the agreement, and thereby denied the lender the benefit of its security. The trustee does not argue that the security agreement or the lease was in conflict with California\u2019s version of the Uniform Commercial Code, Cal. Commercial Code \u00a7 9402. Accordingly, we do not reach questions that could arise if a security agreement is challenged on statutory grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
