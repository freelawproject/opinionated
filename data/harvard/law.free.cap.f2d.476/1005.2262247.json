(Hezler). The counts correspond to claims of Hezler patent No. 3,214,213, issued October 26, 1965, on an application filed April 30, 1963. Abeel et al. (Abeel) copied the counts in application serial No. 388,350, filed August 5, 1964, which was accorded, through an intermediate parent application, the benefit of the May 31, 1962, filing date of grandparent application serial No. 199,118 (\u2019118 application).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">The invention relates to the structure of a vehicle body having a curved window opening and suitable window closure guides in combination with a cooperating flexible window pane. The pane, which may be flexible glass, is preformed to some predetermined degree of curvature differing from the curvature of the window opening and possibly from the curvature of the guides.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">Count 1 reads (paragraphing ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL2\">In a vehicle body, the combination comprising,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-13\">means defining a curved window opening in said body,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-14\">guide means mounted on said body adjacent said opening and merging with said window opening defining means,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-15\">said guide means being adapted to guidingly restrain edges of a window closure and having a degree of curvature substantially differing from the degree of curvature of said opening,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Air\">and a window closure of resilient semirigid construction mounted for movement in said guide means between a retracted position within said body wherein edges of said closure are substantially wholly restrained within said guide means and an extended position wherein edges of said closure are substantially wholly without said guide means and otherwise substantially wholly unrestrained,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-16\">said closure being preformed into a degree of curvature substantially differing from both the degree of curvature of said window opening and of said guide means,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-17\">said closure upon movement to said extended position thereof being resiliency bendable from said preformed curvature into a degree of curvature conforming to that of said window defining means and upon movement to the retracted position thereof being resiliently bendable from said predetermined curvature into a degree of curvature conforming to that of said guide means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-18\">Count 2 is similar, containing substantially the same limitation which we find decisive of the appeal as to count 1. That limitation, as well as an additional pertinent requirement in count 2 only, is described more fully hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-19\">The sole issue is whether appellants\u2019 \u2019118

wagon type vehicle rear window or the like, wherein a window pane 90, consists of a flexible glass sheet which is either prebent, partially prebent or flat. Window tracks 92, disposed at opposite sides of said pane, engage the pane edge portions of pane 90 in the lowered position and form a desired path for said pane, which path may be oblique to the pane edges. As pane 90 is raised by suitable means, such as handle 94, the pane edges are engaged by window tracks 96 disposed within the roof portion 98 of the vehicle. Window tracks 96 may be formed to conform generally with the contour of said roof portion and form a path for said pane which is oblique to the pane edges. As pane 90 is raised, tracks 96 confine the pane edges causing the pane to follow the curved path, thereby bending said pane to substantially conform to the contour of said roof portion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">The board found, with the parties agreeing, that the count language is not ambiguous, and it held that the language was thus entitled to \u201cthe broadest interpretation which it reasonably will support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-11\">Considering the limitation in count 1 concerning the \u201cdegree of curvature\u201d of the elements, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-12\">* * * we feel that contrary to the implications Abeel seeks us to draw from his arguments, the \u201cguide means\u201d must be those within the roof of the vehicle body since the window closure is \u201csubstantially wholly restrained within said guide means\u201d only in the body. Turning to Abeel\u2019s disclosure, it cannot accurately be said that the tracks 96 clearly have a \u201cdegree of curvature substantially differing from the degree of curvature\u201d of the window opening.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-14\">The board next expressed the view that certain of the language of count 1 setting forth characteristics of the window closure was met by the \u2019118 application. However, it pointed out that \u201ccount 1 (and count 2 as well<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) explicitly requires that the \u2018window closure\u2019 \u201d be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-15\">mounted for <em>movement </em>in said guide means <em>between </em>a <em>retracted position </em>within said body wherein edges of said closure are substantially <em>wholly restrained </em>within guide means and an <em>extended position </em>wherein edges of said closure are substantially wholly <em>without </em>said guide means and <em>otherwise substantially wholly unrestrained. </em>[Emphasis by board.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxZ\">and count 1 (and count 2 as well) then <em>further </em>requires that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoHf\">said closure upon movement to said extended position thereof</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEA\">have the capability of bending as set forth in the language of the * * * lines of count 1 quoted above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-16\">With respect to these requirements, the board then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-17\">We have found no basis in the overall disclosure of Abeel and he has failed to point out any disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>clearly providing any basis for the concept defined in the above-quoted count language. There is nothing in Abeel\u2019s application indicating any such concept much less providing <em>clear </em>support for the count language defining it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">The board next turned its attention to limitations appearing only in count 2 and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-5\">Further, solely in the interest of completeness we hold that the language of count 2, \u201csealing abutment shoulder means mounted adjacent said window opening\u201d considered in the overall context of the count language with the recitation that the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-6\">closure upon movement to said extended position thereof (\u201cwholly without said guide channel means and otherwise substantially wholly unrestrained\u201d) being resiliently bendable . . . into engagement with said abutment should [er] means . . . (our insertions)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-8\">finds no support in Abeel\u2019s disclosure; and particularly none in the structure adjacent to the handle 94 and in the cooperating spaced wall structure of the tail gate. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-9\">Before us, appellants have filed a brief, including appendix, of 76 pages. Rather than limiting their argument to the \u2019118 application, which they admit must support the counts if they are to prevail, appellants refer at some length to their other applications which include additional subject matter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-11\">Various different embodiments of automobile door and window assemblies illustrated in the application, along with a statement therein that \u201cthe window tracks may be either suitably grooved and shaped channels or shaped bars,\u201d are relied on as teaching that the channel-like tracks shown in the Fig. 9 structure, supra, be replaced by a <em>single </em>bar <em>on the inside </em>at each side of the opening to provide a condition where the edges of the pane are outside the guide means and unrestrained. While appellants\u2019 application does describe an embodiment using curved bars, engaging only one side of the pane, that embodiment uses the bars to <em>constrain </em>the pane against its prestressed curvature when the window is open. Nowhere in the application is there even the remotest suggestion that appellants\u2019 preformed pane might be allowed to protrude <em>outside </em>of the window opening, unrestrained by any window <em>tracks. </em>Indeed, whether the window tracks be channels or bars the term \u201ctracks\u201d itself suggests some means which would conduct the pane into the shape of the window. It is thus clear that the modification of the Fig. 9 structure, that appellants advance is not disclosed in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-12\">We have thoroughly considered all of appellants\u2019 arguments that are even remotely related to the issue, but we find that appellants have failed to show any error in the board\u2019s decision or its reasons therefor. Accordingly, the decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">. Appellees initially raised this issue through a motion to shift the burden of proof. Consideration of that motion, along with one questioning appellants\u2019 right to make in their involved application, was deferred to final hearing because the Board of Appeals had rendered a decision touching on these matters, favorable to appellants. See Janeway v. Nystrom, 77 USPQ 229 (Com\u2019r.Pats.1946).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1065-18\">. The pertinent language of count 2 is not precisely, the same as that the board quoted from count 1 but is very similar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1066-10\">. Appellants identify their second or intermediate application as a continuation-in-part of \u2019118 and the involved application a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of the second.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
