United States (Civil No. 72-24, W.D.Pa.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-17\">We agree that the record must demonstrate that the district court has made the finding that \u201cthe youth offender will not derive benefit from treatment under subsection (b) or (c)\u201d in order to sentence a defendant-youth offender under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d). See Cox v. United States, 473 F.2d 334, Part III (4th Cir., 1973), and cases cited in notes 2-4 below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-18\">After consideration of this record, we have concluded that the district court order of March 2, 1972, denying the motion to vacate the conviction and sentence, must be affirmed. We note that other federal courts considering subdivision (d) and other subdivisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010 have held that a sentence under such subdivisions is valid if \u201cthe record as a whole\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201ceither explicitly or implicitly\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> shows that the findings required by the applicable subdivision have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>In view of the increasing number of federal cases raising problems similar to that involved in this appeal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and for the guidance of the district courts of this Circuit, we suggest that the findings prescribed by Congress in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b-d) be made in open court on the record so that the transcript or tape of the sentencing proceeding will clearly disclose that such findings have been made. We do not consider it necessary that the district courts of this Circuit adhere to all the requirements<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> stated as mandatory in United States v. Coefield, 476 F.2d 1152 Part III (D.C.Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">For the above reasons, the order of March 2, 1972, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-12\">\u201c(d) If the court shall find that the youth offender will not derive benefit from treatment under subsection (b) or (c), then the court may sentence the youth offender under any other applicable penalty provision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">The purposes of the Youth Corrections Act have been set forth in Brisco v. United States, 368 F.2d 214 (3d Cir. 1966), and its terms as applied to persons under 22 years of age described in United States v. Waters, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 437 F.2.d 722, 724 (1970), on remand, 324 F.Supp. 1056 (D.C.1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1029-20\">. See Rogers v.
