Stone of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the Treasury Department. All of the sales took place in Day\u2019s home in Morehead, Kentucky. A search warrant, obtained by Treasury agents after relating the above mentioned four sales in an affidavit to a United States Commissioner, was executed on March 20, 1970, at which time a total of 96 firearms, worth about $12,000, were seized from Day\u2019s home and adjacent house trailer. Sixty of the guns were new hand guns still in the manufacturer\u2019s original packages. There also was testimony from Day himself on cross-examination that he had sold at least one other gun to at least one other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">During the trial, the Government called as one of its witnesses Special Investigator Sylvester Yockey of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division. The apparent purpose of Yockey\u2019s testimony was to show that the guns possessed by Day had been manfactured outside the state of Kentucky and had moved in interstate commerce before Day possessed and received them.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Two separate and distinguishable types of testimony were offered by Yockey. First, he testified where the guns were manufactured and gave testimony, based on a document prepared by the historian of the Smith &amp; Wesson gun manufacturing firm, as to the approximate dates of manufacture of the guns bought by the agents in the sales and seized in the search of Day\u2019s house. The document from which Yockey was testifying listed the various models produced by Smith and Wesson and the serial numbers of the models and the periods during which they had been produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">For example, at one point in his testimony Yockey was asked the approximate date of manufacture of a .38 Smith &amp; Wesson model 12, serial number C951878. He replied as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-13\">\u201cThe .38 Smith and Wesson model 12 was produced by Smith and Wesson from 1948 through 1968. The serial number range started at C-l and ended at C-l,000,000. At the serial number range C-951,878 would appear to be about the first of 1968.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">The defense objected to this evidence as hearsay. The objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">After a trial recess, Yockey testified as to the exact dates of manufacture and shipment of the guns in evidence. Apparently this information was obtained by telephone during the recess from an agent in Yockey\u2019s office and was the result of the investigation conducted under Yockey\u2019s supervision. The report itself was never introduced as evidence by the Government, nor was its introduction or presence ever sought by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\">On appeal, Day asserts error in his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(1), his conviction under 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(2), and in the admissibility of certain testimony of Yockey. We examine these contentions separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-17\">I. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(1) Conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-18\">Three contentions are urged upon this court regarding Day\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 922(a)(1) for engaging in the business of dealing in firearms without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>First, Day claims that Congress, in enacting the statute, intended to punish only those who deal in firearms in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">His reliance on United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), to support this interpretation of the statute is misplaced. <em>Bass </em>was a decision interpreting \u00a7 1202(a) (1) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Although convictions under one statute often accompany conviction under the other, as in this case, the statutes are not identical and, actually, are quite different.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The statute interpreted by <em>Bass </em>makes it a crime for a person in any one of five categories to \u201creceive[s], possesses], or transport[s] in commerce or affecting commerce, . . . any firearm <em>. \u201d </em>The Supreme Court, in its majority opinion announced by Mr. Justice Marshall, ruled that the phrase \u201cin commerce or affecting commerce\u201d modifies \u201creceive\u201d as well as \u201cpossess\u201d and \u201ctransport.\u201d The Court held this as a matter of statutory construction on the basis of a reading of the statute and the accompanying legislative history. It is important to note that <em>Bass </em>was based on statutory construction grounds, .not constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The <em>Bass </em>decision and its analysis of \u00a7 1202(a)(1) are totally inapposite to the question before this court \u2014 the proper interpretation of \u00a7 922(a)(1). The statute at issue here provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\"><em>\u201c922. Unlawful acts. </em>\u2014 (a) It shall be unlawful\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">(1) for any person, except a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer, to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms or ammunition, or in the course of such business to ship, transport, or receive any firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">The indictment below made no reference to any interstate nexus and Day claims this was fatal error. He asserts that Congress intended to bar only interstate unlicensed dealing in firearms. He apparently contends that the phrase \u201cin interstate or foreign commerce\u201d modifies \u201cimporting, manufacturing or dealing in firearms.\u201d This statute, unlike the section construed in Bass, is not ambiguous. The statutory language is unmistakably clear. Two separate classes of offenses are outlined. One type is the engaging in \u201cthe business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms or ammunition.\u201d The other type of proscribed activity is shipping, transporting or receiving any firearm \u201cin interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d A license is required for both types of activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">Section 922(a)(1) was first enacted as part of Title IV of the Omnibus Crime Control &amp; Safe Streets Act of 1968. P.L. 90-351. It was later re-enacted as part of Title I of the Gun Control Act of 1968. P.L. 90-618. The section is the same in both Acts. Unlike the <em>Bass </em>statute, there is available in the case of \u00a7 922(a)(1) clear and convincing legislative history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-14\"><em>\u201cSection 922(a)(1). </em>\u2014 This paragraph proscribes any person from engaging in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms or ammunition (destructive device) without a license. The prohibition goes to both an unlicensed person engaging in a firearms business and such a person who, in the course of that business, ships, transports, or receives, a firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce. Thus, the paragraph makes it clear that <em>a license is required for an intrastate business as well as an interstate business. </em>The present Federal Firearms Act (15 U.S.C. 902(a)) merely prohibits the interstate or foreign shipment or receipt of firearms by a manufacturer or dealer unless he has a license.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 2114, 2202 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The House report on the same section when it was later passed as part of the Gun Control Act of 1968 reflects the identical Congressional intention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\"><em>\u201cSection 922(a)(1). </em>\u2014 This paragraph proscribes any person from engaging in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms or ammunition without a license. The prohibition goes to both an unlicensed person engaging in a firearms business <em>and such a person who, in the course of that business, ships, transports, or receives, a firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce. Thus, the paragraph makes it clear that a license is required for an intrastate business as well as an interstate business. . . . </em>\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4410, 4418 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">There can be no doubt that the Congress intended, and through its words accomplished, the regulation of unlicensed intrastate sales of firearms. Three other circuits have been asked to impose the language of <em>Bass </em>to \u00a7 922(a)(1) and have found, as we do, that it is inapplicable. Mandina v. United States, 472 F.2d 1110 (8th Cir. 1973); United States v. Redus, 469 F.2d 185 (9th Cir. 1972); United States v. Ruisi, 460 F.2d 153 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 914, 93 S.Ct. 234, 34 L.Ed.2d 176 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The second argument advanced by Day regarding his \u00a7 922(a)(1) conviction is that even if Congress intended to punish unlicensed intrastate firearms sales, it was powerless to do so and was acting unconstitutionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 91 S.Ct. 1357, 28 L.Ed.2d 686 (1971), the Supreme Court analyzed anew the scope of Congressional power to regulate purely intrastate activities under the Commerce Clause. As the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">\u201cThe Commerce Clause reaches, in the main, three categories of problems. First, the use of channels of interstate or foreign commerce which Congress deems are being misused, Second, protection of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, Third, those activities affecting commerce.\u201d 402 U.S. at 150, 91 S.Ct. at 1359.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">The <em>Perez </em>Court reaffirmed, under the third category of Congressional power, that Congress can constitutionally regulate a class of activities if that class has an effect on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">\u201cWhere the <em>class of-activities </em>is regulated and that <em>class </em>is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power \u2018to excise, as trivial, individual instances\u2019 of the class.\u201d 402 U.S. at 154, 91 S.Ct. at 1361. <em>See also </em>Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 258, 85 S.Ct. 348, 13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964); United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 120-121, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941). At issue in the <em>Perez </em>case was a federal act banning intrastate extortionate credit transactions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 891 et seq. The Supreme Court, it should be noted, repeatedly has upheld Congressional regulation of purely intrastate activity. United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U.S. 110, 62 S.Ct. 523, 86 L.Ed. 726 (1942) (intrastate milk prices); Mulford v. Smith, 307 U.S. 38, 59 S.Ct. 648, 83 L.Ed. 1092 (1938) (intrastate tobacco markets); Simpson v. Shepard, 230 U.S. 352, 33 S.Ct. 729, 57 L.Ed. 1511 (1913) (intrastate rail rates). As the Supreme Court wrote in the <em>Heart of Atlanta </em>case, <em>supra: </em>\u201cIf it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter how local the operation which applies the squeeze.\u201d 379 U.S. at 258, 85 S.Ct. at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">Just as Congress made findings that intrastate credit transactions were part of a class of activities amenable to federal regulation, the Act before this court reveals detailed findings of the interrelationship between the business of selling guns and interstate crime and inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>state trafficking in guns. Congress found specifically that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201c[0]nly through adequate Federal control over interstate and foreign commerce in these weapons, and <em>over all </em>persons engaging in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in them, can this grave problem (interstate trafficking in firearms) be properly dealt with <em>. \u201d </em>P.L. 90-351, \u00a7 901(a)(3), 82 Stat. 225 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-7\"><em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 1097, <em>swpra, </em>at pp. 2163-66. This court is unwilling to strike down these findings. Congress need not make specific findings that there is an effect on interstate commerce by a specific activity. 402 U.S. at 156, 91 S.Ct. 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">There has been federal legislation regulating interstate commerce in firearms since the Federal Firearms Act, 52 Stat. 1250, was enacted in 1938. This regulation has been upheld by the courts. Cases v. United States, 131 F.2d 916 (1st Cir. 1942), cert. denied sub nom., Velazquez v. United States, 319 U.S. 770, 63 S.Ct. 1431, 87 L.Ed. 1718 (1943), rehearing denied, 324 U.S. 889, 65 S.Ct. 1010, 89 L.Ed. 1437 (1945). Congress certainly had the power to regulate intrastate gun sales which have an effect on interstate commerce in firearms. We hold \u00a7 922(a)(1) to be constitutional. <em>Accord, Mandina, supra, </em>472 F.2d at 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Day\u2019s final assertion of error regarding his \u00a7 922(a)(1) conviction is that there was insufficient evidence presented to the jury that he was \u201cengaged in the business ... of dealing in firearms.\u201d The District Judge in this case instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">\u201cDealer . . . means one that is engaged in any business of selling, repairing or pawning firearms and that business is that which occupies the time, attention and labor of the man for the purpose of livelihood or profit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">This definition of what \u201cengaged in the business\u201d means apparently was borrowed by the District Judge from the decision in United States v. Gross, 313 F.Supp. 1330, 1333 (S.D.Ind.1970), aff\u2019d, 451 F.2d 1355 (7th Cir. 1971). <em>See also </em>Stone v. District of Columbia, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 140, 198 F.2d 601, 603 (1952); <em>cf. </em>Kaneshiro v. United States, 445 F.2d 1266 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 992, 92 S.Ct. 537, 30 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971). There is no statutory standard defining \u201cengaged in business.\u201d We hold that this judicial definition is an adequate reflection of the plain meaning of the phrase and approve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-16\">The evidence shows that four separate sales over two months were made by Day to the Government agent. Day admitted on cross-examination to at least one other sale. Ninety-six guns, including 60 in their original packages, were found in the search of the house. It should also be pointed out that the Government agent testified that each time he made one of the purchases, Day told him that he could get him any kind of gun he wanted. This evidence, we hold, was sufficient to show that Day was engaged in the business of selling guns. II. 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(2) Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b625-17\">Day attacks his conviction for possessing guns in violation of \u00a7 1202(a)(2). It was established at trial by uncontroverted evidence that Day was dishonorably discharged from the United States Army on April 13, 1945. His objection is not specific but apparently he contends that the punishment of one who was dishonorably discharged from the service over 25 years before possession and receipt of the firearms in question is unreasonable and violative of the concept of equal protection. He also claims that the right to bear arms is somehow fundamental and protected by the Constitution. Day also claims that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 1202(a)(2), as part of Title VII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, acted without hearings or a committee report. Lacking this, he contends there is no support for legislative findings in \u00a7 1201(1) of the Act, 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1201 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>(1), that the possession of firearms by those who have been dishonorably discharged constitutes \u201ca burden on commerce\u201d or the finding in \u00a7 1201(3), 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1201(3) that it is \u201can impediment or a threat to the exercise of free speech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">As to the alleged right to bear arms, Day\u2019s claim is meritless. There is no absolute constitutional right of an individual to possess a firearm. United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S. Ct. 816, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 303-304, 85 S.Ct. 377, 383, 13 L.Ed.2d 290 (1964), the Supreme Court set out the applicable standard under which the Congressional classification here presented must be tested:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201c[W]here we find that the legislators, in light of the facts and testimony before them, have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce, our investigation is at an end.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">This court, in Stevens v. United States, 440 F.2d 144, 151 (6th Cir. 1971), examined the validity of the statute forbidding convicted felons from possession of firearms. 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1). We upheld this classification. Although <em>Stevens </em>is no longer good law on the statutory interpretation of \u00a7 1202(a), in light of <em>Bass, </em>its viability on the constitutional question of whether the Congress can forbid certain classes of people from possessing firearms is hereby reaffirmed. Other courts have also upheld the statute\u2019s bar of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in the face of equal protection attack. United States v. Synnes, 438 F.2d 764, 771 (8th Cir. 1971), vacated on other grounds, 404 U.S. 1009, 92 S.Ct. 687, 30 L.Ed.2d 657 (1972); United States v. Rubino, 320 F.Supp. 613 (M.D.Pa.1970); United States v. Wiley, 309 F.Supp. 141 (D.Minn.1970), aff\u2019d, 438 F.2d 773 (8th Cir. 1971), vacated on other grounds, 404 U.S. 1009, 92 S.Ct. 686, 30 L.Ed.2d 657 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Possession of a firearm by a person dishonorably discharged from the Armed Services, while not as dangerous, perhaps, as possession by a convicted felon, is sufficiently risky to justify Congressional regulation. As Senator Russell Long stated in the debate on the bill on the floor of the Senate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">\u201c[T]his is a matter of saying that if he cannot be trusted to carry arms for Uncle Sam, he cannot be trusted to carry arms on the streets. This kind of person is part of the criminal element in many instances, the kind of person who does not know how to behave properly, and is a hazard to others when he possesses firearms.\u201d <em>Stevens, supra, </em>440 F.2d at 155.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Although it is true, as Day contends, that there were no committee reports on \u00a7 1202(a), there was considerable debate on the floor of the Senate. This is set out at 440 F.2d 152 as an appendix to this court\u2019s <em>Stevens </em>opinion. We hold that the finding by Congress that possession of guns by those dishonorably discharged from the armed services is hazardous was rational. We decline to overturn it.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">Day voices concern that although he was convicted under \u00a7 1202(a) for possession of these guns in 1970, his discharge under less than honorable circumstances took place 23 years before the enactment of the statute. Viewing this concern as an allegation that the statute was an <em>ex post facto </em>law, we reject it. United States v. McCreary, 455 F.2d 647, 648 (6th Cir. 1972). Day\u2019s assertion that the statute is somehow fatally tainted by lack of hearings or committee reports is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">III. Yockey\u2019s testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">Day objects to the admission of Special Investigator Yockey\u2019s testimony regarding the approximate dates of manufacture and then the exact dates of manufacture and of shipment in interstate commerce. It is asserted that this testimony was inadmissible hearsay. The Government seeks to justify the Yockey testimony concerning the approximate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>dates of manufacture of the guns by claiming that, as an expert witness, Yoekey had a right to testify from hearsay documents in the expression of his opinions. Jenkins v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 300, 307 F.2d 637 (1962) (in banc); <em>but see </em>McCormick, Law of Evidence, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Government seeks to justify the admission of the testimony as to the precise dates of manufacture and shipment by reference to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732, which is a codification of the business records exception to the hearsay rule. The Government claims that the investigative report was part of the business of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the Treasury Department.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">This court finds it unnecessary to decide the hearsay question, however, because we find the testimony objected to irrelevant and its admission not prejudicial. The apparent purpose of the testimony was to show that the guns found in the possession of Day and sold by him to the agent had moved in interstate commerce and had moved after the effective date of \u00a7 1202(a)(2), which was June 19, 1968. This was apparently thought necessary to satisfy the requirement of <em>Bass, supra, </em>that there be shown in a \u00a7 1202(a) prosecution for possession and receipt of firearms a \u201cnexus\u201d with interstate commerce. As the <em>Bass </em>Court stated: \u201c. . . the Government meets its burden here if it demonstrates that the firearm received has previously traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d 404 U.S. at 350, 92 S.Ct. at 524. If there is competent evidence to show that the guns possessed and received by the defendant were manufactured in a state outside of Kentucky, the state of possession in the present case, the conclusion is inescapable and the inference is permissible that the gun has traveled in interstate commerce before reaching the defendant. It should be noted that there is no requirement that the interstate commerce be shown to have been directly to Day. United States v. Brown, 472 F.2d 1181 (6th Cir. 1973). In this case, there was competent evidence before the jury to indicate that the guns found in appellant\u2019s possession were manufactured in Hartford, Connecticut, and Springfield, Massachusetts. Thus, the interstate nexus requirement of <em>Bass </em>was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">It should be pointed out that the testimony placing the date of manufacture and interstate commerce movement of the guns after the effective date of the statute was similarly unnecessary. There is no requirement that the guns move in interstate commerce after the effective date of the Act. United States v. Oclit, 343 F.Supp. 447 (D.Hawaii, 1972). The statute punishes the possession, which obviously took place after the Act was passed, not the interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-17\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a) (1) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-18\"><em>\u201c922.

Although we find it unnecessary to rule on the question of whether the special investigator was actually qualified as an expert at the trial, it should be pointed out that there was no declaration \u25a0 of the witness as an expert and when the District Judge overruled the defense objection to Yockey\u2019s testifying from the Smith &amp; Wesson document, he did not do so on the basis of Yockey\u2019s alleged status as an expert witness. In fact, the <em>Government made no </em>request at the trial to qualify Yoekey as an expert witness. It is extremely doubtful whether the subject matter of Yockey\u2019s testimony, the dates of manufacture of the guns, was amenable to -expert testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-13\">. The Government does not explain how \u00a7 1732, which permits introduction of a \u201cwriting or record\u201d into evidence, would permit an oral statement of a telephoned report as evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
