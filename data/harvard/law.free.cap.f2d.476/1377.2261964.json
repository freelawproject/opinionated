W. Myers &amp; Co. v. United States, 67 Cust.Ct. 75, C.D. 4256 (1971), sustaining appellee\u2019s protests against the classification of certain crawler tractors imported from Canada under TSUS 692.-35 as \u201cTractors * * * Other,\u201d and holding the imported tractors classifiable free of duty under item 692.30 TSUS as \u201cTractors suitable for agricultural use * * We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-12\">The imported crawler tractors were of two types, the J-5 and the Muskeg M (the latter hereinafter referred to simply as the \u201cMuskeg\u201d tractors). The parties stipulated that the J-5 tractors are in fact \u201csuitable for agricultural use\u201d thus narrowing the issue to whether the Muskeg tractors are \u201csuitable for agricultural use.\u201d The J-5 tractors are similar to the Muskeg tractors and are important here, however, because the parties have, by stipulation, incorporated an earlier case, F. W. Myers &amp; Co. v. United States, 59 Cust.Ct. 445, C.D. 3182 (1967), in which it was held that both the J-5 and Muskeg tractors were \u201csuitable for agricultural use\u201d and thus free of duty within item 692.30. The Customs Bureau has thus acepted the decision in the prior case with respect to the J-5\u2019s, but now disagrees with respect to the Muskegs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-14\">The lower court here found the incorporated case to have established that the basic construction of the J-5 and Muskeg tractors was the same, reviewed the record and decision in that case and the testimony of the witnesses presented by appellant in this case, and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-15\">The difference between the J-5 and Muskeg tractor is in degree and not in kind. Plaintiff has met the suitability for agricultural usage test. It, therefore, follows that the protests must be sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1436-16\">The Customs Court noted that the \u201cExplanatory Notes\u201d to the Tariff Classification Study dated November 15, 1960, at pp. 325-26 show that item 692.30 changed the prior treatment of tractors chiefly used for agricultural purposes by providing for tractors \u201csuitable for agricultural use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-17\">The parties agree with the Customs Court\u2019s analysis of the history of item 692.30 as indicating that the item changed the prior concept of \u201cchief use\u201d to one of \u201csuitability for use,\u201d and both admit that \u201csuitable for use\u201d means \u201cactually, practically, and commercially fit.\u201d Keer, Maurer Co. v. United States, 46 CCPA 110, C.A.D. 710 (1959). In <em>Keer, Maurer, </em>this court said (p. 114):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-18\">The words \u201csuitable for use,\u201d as applied in the Customs law means \u201cactually, practically, and commercially fit\u201d for such use. Kahlen v. United States, 2 Ct.Cust.Appls. 206, T.D. 31947; United States v. Lorsch &amp; Co., 8 Ct. Cust.Appls. 109, T.D. 37222; United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>States v. Amerman &amp; Patterson, et al., 9 Ct.Cust.Appls. 244, T.D. 38205; United States v. Geo. S. Bush &amp; Co., Inc., et al., 26 CCPA 145, C.A.D. 8; Coro, Inc. v. United States, 41 CCPA 215, C.A.D. 554. Such suitability does not require that the merchandise be chiefly used for the stated purpose, United States v. Lorsch &amp; Co., <em>supra, </em>but it does require more than \u201c * * evidence of a casual, incidental, exceptional, or possible use. * * * \u201d Kahlen v. United States, <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">We have reviewed the evidence of record including the testimony in the incorporated case and by the appellant\u2019s witnesses in this case and have concluded that the evidence fully supports the findings by the Customs Court below that the basic construction of the Muskeg and J-5 tractors is the same and the Muskeg tractors are actually, practically, and commercially fit for agricultural purposes, and such findings are not clearly contrary to the weight of the evidence. United States v. F. W. Myers &amp; Co., 45 CCPA 48, C.A.D. 617 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-7\">The Customs Court quoted the following statement from its opinion in the incorporated case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-8\">The unrefuted evidence that the involved tractors are used on farms for spreading manure and lime and other fertilizer, used in sugar bushes for gathering maple sap, used for plowing, used to pull hay balers, used for seeding, used to pull harvesters in harvesting corn, and used in disk harrowing is sufficient to show that said tractors are actually, practically, and commercially fit for agricultural purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAq\">Appellant, in contending that the records failed to establish a substantial use of the Muskeg tractors in agriculture, asserts that the statement in the incorporated case relied upon by the Customs Court does not represent findings of the court in the incorporated case with respect to the Muskeg, tractors, but represents that court\u2019s findings with respect to the J-5 tractors, which appellant maintains are substantially different from the Muskegs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-12\">With respect to this question, whether the record in the incorporated case supports the findings of the Customs Court here that the Muskeg tractors, as opposed to the J-5\u2019s, are suitable for use on farms we have reviewed the record and are satisfied that the evidence supports appellee\u2019s view that at least some of the witnesses in the incorporated ease were testifying to the use of <em>both </em>types of tractors or the Muskegs alone in agricultural pursuits, and that there is ample support in the record for the finding of the court below that the Muskegs are actually, practically, and commercially fit for agricultural purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-13\">The judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">. As appellant states it, \u201cthe additional power, tractive capability and flotation of the Muskeg, causing it to be a far more expensive vehicle, is what dedicates the Muskeg to the more rigorous non-agricultural use to which the records establish it is overwhelmingly put.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">. Appellant has noted that there are involved in the present case \u201cdiffering models of the Muskeg tractor itself,\u201d some of which models may not have been involved in the prior case, but it lias not argued tliat any such model differences represent differences in the suitability of tiie Muskegs for agricultural pursuits. The importations here involve some \u201cCarrier\u201d models of the Muskegs which are basically the same as the regular Muskeg tractors except that the engine is located closer to the front of the frame. The incorporated case may have involved only the regular Muskeg tractors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
