See Isbell Enterprises, Inc. v.

Hall, were charged in a two count indictment with (1) attempting to escape from federal custody, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a), and (2) assaulting two Deputy U.S. Marshals engaged in the performance of their duties, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. A jury trial was held and both were found guilty as charged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-34\">The appellants assert that the trial court committed the following reversible errors: (1) failed to give an adequate definition of \u201cattempt to escape\u201d; (2) denied appellants\u2019 motion for transfer from the Sherman Division; (3) denied appellants\u2019 motion for a continuance and (4) refused to grant appellants\u2019 motion for the employment of a court appointed polygraph examiner. Frogge makes the additional contention that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>was insufficient under count II to convict him of assaulting the two Deputy U.S. Marshals. We have carefully reviewed the briefs and record in this case and find all of these contentions to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">The trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury concerning the appellants\u2019 defense to the attempt to escape count were, in our opinion, eminently fair. If we were to assume arguendo that the two Deputy U.S. Marshals in charge of appellants accepted the alleged bribe offer and acquiesced in the escape plan as contended by them on appeal, it is highly doubtful that such acquiescence would rise to the level of an affirmative defense. Cf. United States v. Allen, 432 F.2d 939 (10th Cir. 1970); United States v. Greenwell, 379 F.2d 320 (4th Cir. 1967); Mullican v. United States, 252 F.2d 398, 403 (5th Cir. 1958). The trial court, nevertheless, treated the appellants\u2019 acquiescence theory as an affirmative defense and told the jury to return a verdict of acquittal if they believed it. This was done without a specific request on the part of either appellant. We hold that the trial court gave full and adequate instructions to the jury as to all defenses raised for which there was a foundation in the evidence. Perez v. United States, 297 F.2d 12, 15-16 (5th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\"> We are similarly unconvinced by the argument that the trial court erred when it refused to authorize the polygraph examinations requested by the appellants. Though a trend may be emerging towards loosening the restrictions on polygraph evidence, see e. g., People v. Houser, 85 Cal.App.2d 686, 193 P.2d 737 (1948), the rule is well established in federal criminal cases that the results of lie detector tests are inadmissible. United States v. Rodgers, 419 F.2d 1315, 1319 (10th Cir. 1969); Frye v. United States, 54 App.D.C. 46, 293 F. 1013 (1923). Nothing in United States v. Ridling, 350 F.Supp. 90 (E.D.Mich. Oct. 6, 1972), heavily relied upon by the appellants, persuades us to abandon the traditional view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">No discussion of the appellants\u2019 remaining contentions is necessary except to state that the appellants failed to establish reversible error as to any of them. The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1027-35\">. The trial court sentenced each appellant to 5 years under Count I and 3 years under Count II.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
