We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>Fowler was arrested as a suspect in the burglary of the post office in Colp, Illinois. Thereafter he was interrogated by a postal inspector in the Carbondale, Illinois police station. He orally confessed to his participation in the offense and subsequently joined two juvenile accomplices in a common affidavit admitting the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">As permitted by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5032,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fowler consented to be prosecuted as a juvenile rather than an adult. The government then filed an information instead of an indictment charging him with the burglary offense. Fowler\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress his confession was denied, and the confession and joint affidavit were introduced into evidence over objection at the subsequent bench trial. He was found to be \u201cdelinquent\u201d and his commitment followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">The first issue presented is whether Fowler was entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings before he confessed to his participation in the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">The Supreme Court in a series of cases has departed from the Parens Patriae Doctrine which denied juveniles vital rights accorded their elders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is particularly true in the case of In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed. 2d 527 (1967), where the Court struck down the Arizona Juvenile Code as unconstitutional. The Court found that the Code permitted the denial of due process to a fifteen year old during a juvenile delinquency proceeding because the Code deprived juveniles of the exercise of the rights to confrontation, cross-examination, appellate review and notice to the juvenile\u2019s parents of the right to counsel in the proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In finding that the juvenile was denied the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court said \u201c[i]t would indeed be surprising if the privilege against self-incrimination were available to hardened criminals but not to children.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 47, 87 S.Ct. at 1454.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-15\">We hold therefore, by virtue of In re Gault, that Fowler had the right to <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to confessing to his participation in the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-17\">The next issue raised is whether Fowler was adequately warned of his rights prior to interrogation as required by <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-18\">The evidence at the trial which implicated Fowler in the alleged burglary was the testimony of the postal inspector and - the joint affidavit which read \u201cwe\u201d confess.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-19\">The inspector\u2019s trial testimony shows that he did not tell Fowler, before the confession, that any answers he gave to questions could be used against him later in court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And the joint affidavit omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>ted to warn defendant that he had a right to an attorney before answering questions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We think these deficiencies indicate that on neither occasion were the \u201cfull\u201d <em>Miranda </em>warnings given defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">It might be argued that although both the oral and written warnings were each deficient, when considered together they were complementary so as to meet the requirements of <em>Miranda. </em>We reject the argument in this case, since we cannot see that either warning or both considered together were meaningful to Fowler.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">When his confession was made Fowler was sixteen years of age. So far as the record shows he had not previously been arrested, had not previously been in jail, nor had he ever been interrogated by law enforcement officials. One need only recall his own adolescence to appreciate the impact upon this boy, alone in a jail room, in custody of a postal inspector, being warned of his constitutional rights. \u201cThat which would leave a man cold and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a lad in his early teens [fifteen years old].\u201d Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 599, 68 S.Ct. 302, 304, 92 L.Ed. 224 (1948). In these circumstances it is difficult to accept the notion that defendant fully comprehended what he was being told.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">Fowler\u2019s father was sent for, and was present in the jail at some time while the joint confession was being prepared. He was not present, however, when the oral interrogation began so that Fowler could be helped in understanding the gravity of his answers to the postal inspector\u2019s questions. When the father was present, he did not ask for advice about, or any explanations of, his son\u2019s rights so that he could aid in his son\u2019s understanding of them. Seemingly unconcerned with his son\u2019s understanding of the seriousness of what he was doing in signing the affidavit, he encouraged his son to \u201ctell the truth.\u201d His concern appeared to be mostly whether his son\u2019s trouble would prevent him from getting into the \u201cJob Corps.\u201d What Fowler needed at the time was \u201ccounsel and support if he [was] not to become the victim first of fear, then of panic.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 600, 68 S.Ct. at 304. The father, however, did not fill this need.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\">We hold that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings as given Fowler were inadequate and that the admission of his confession and the affidavit into evidence requires reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-12\">The government\u2019s argument places reliance on two cases which do not militate against our holding. In West v. United States, 399 F.2d 467 (5th Cir. 1968), full <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given, and the record disclosed several circumstances indicating the juvenile\u2019s maturity and independence. Those circumstances are not present here. In the case\u2019 of United States ex rel. Richardson v. Vitek, 395 F.2d 478 (7th Cir. 1968), the matter had been tried before In re Gault was decided. Moreover, this court\u2019s affirmance of the dismissal of the juvenile\u2019s habeas proceeding was based on the Illinois Supreme Court record and on the fact that both the Illinois and district courts reached the same conclusion that the juvenile had been advised of his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>to remain silent, was able to inform his parents of his whereabouts, and his confession was \u201cfreely given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">In the recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court case, Commonwealth v. Porter, 449 Pa. 153, 295 A.2d 311 (1972) (two justices dissenting), the court decided that a sixteen year old boy\u2019s murder confession was not involuntary simply because his mother was not permitted to be present during the interrogation. A comparison of the facts of the instant case and those in <em>Porter </em>demonstrates that the two cases differ in significant respects. First, the <em>Porter </em>facts reveal that full <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given to the juvenile defendant with no question remaining as to right to counsel or to remain silent. Secondly, the <em>Porter </em>facts are similar to the <em>West </em>facts, because a showing of independence is evident. More precisely, the evidence in <em>Porter </em>indicated that the juvenile defendant did not want his mother to be present during his interrogation. The facts of the present case, however, are void of any showing of independence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">We limit our holding \u2014 that the district court committed constitutional error in admitting Fowler\u2019s confession and the affidavit \u2014 to the facts in this case. We need not hold that a juvenile\u2019s confession, or that absence of an attorney for a juvenile at interrogation, per se renders the confession involuntary. <em>But see </em>Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U.S. 49, 54, 82 S.Ct. 1209, 8 L.Ed.2d 325 (1962), and Lewis v. State, 288 N.E.2d 138 (Ind., 1972). Neither do we consider the governments\u2019 argument that Fowler was competent to waive his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">For the reasons given, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A3h\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 2115.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">. \u00a7 5032.
