His mother, a devout churchgoer, saw to it that he was a steady attendant at Sunday school and church services. He achieved honor status in the Boy Scouts. In his early teens, he became disaffected with organized religion because, in his view, the adherents were hypocritical. When he became 17 in 1967, he dropped out of high school and enlisted in the Army where he received- training as a field wire maintenance man. In 1968, his father fell ill and his family\u2019s financial condition was precarious. He reenlisted in the Army at that time because he could thereby give greater support to his family. He was thereafter trained as a crewman for the Nike missile program. In late 1969 and early 1970, he began to think seriously about his beliefs. He read books, talked to people about war, and participated in some peaceful antiwar demonstrations. Sometime in June 1970, he received orders to report to Korea; he knew that there was a possibility of going to Viet Nam. Richmond testified that his conscientious objector beliefs began to crystallize when he knew that he would have to face war and killing. He received orders of reassignment to Viet Nam in July 1970. He refused his orders and was imprisoned for 51 days. A general court martial was authorized. During the investigation made as a part of the court martial preliminaries, he testified that he was not afraid for his own life, but he could not kill. He was told that a general court martial could result in his imprisonment for up to six years and that the court martial would be dropped if he agreed to go to Viet Nam. He refused the offer. (The general court martial was later dropped anyway.) His efforts to file conscientious objector application were briefly delayed while the court martial proceedings were commenced, but before the end of July 1970 he filed his application. He was interviewed by a chaplain, Captain Towne, on October 23, 1970. Captain Towne recommended that the application be granted, stating that he believed Richmond \u201cis conscientiously opposed to participating in the Army in any way. He has convinced me that the basis for the application is religious . . . . He believes it is wrong to kill and, also, that it is just as wrong to be a contributor to the act of killing, irregardless of how small or far removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">On November 9, 1970, a hearing was held before Captain C. D. Waite, a full transcript of which is in the record. Captain Waite recommended disapproval of Richmond\u2019s application. He gave these reasons: \u201cBased upon my two-hour plus interview with him, it is my opinion that Pfc. Richmond should not be granted conscientious objector status. I do feel that he is essentially a moral person. However, it seems to me that his primary motive is to evade military service in the interest of his own personal safety and even more importantly, to stand up for his current political convictions. He repeatedly indicated that he wanted \u2018to stand up and be counted\u2019 as one who didn\u2019t support war. Furthermore, his objections seemed geared almost entirely to a particular war (Viet Nam).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-11\">The decision was reviewed by an Army board. The board rejected the application, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-12\">The Board finds that the applicant\u2019s request is based solely upon considerations of policy, pragmatism, or expediency and uses the following evidence from the record to support its find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>ings. The timing of PFC Richmond\u2019s application casts serious doubt on the sincerity of his professed beliefs. He applied only after receipt of orders of reassignment to the Republic of Vietnam. \u201cSudden excessions of belief may be utterly sincere, as the memorable one on the Damascus Road; but they seldom synchronize so perfectly as (Richmond\u2019s) with external facts making them convenient . . .\u201d United States v. Corliss [D.C.S.D.N.Y.1959) 173 F.Supp. 677]. The Board also noted from the report of the psychiatrist that the applicant is presently applying for a hardship discharge in addition to this application for discharge as a conscientious objector.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-4\">Additionally, the Board noted that PFC Richmond\u2019s application lacks the depth of conviction required to qualify for discharge as a conscientious objector. There is no reason stated in the application for this change in the basic beliefs of the applicant which now make him feel that he can no longer continue in the military service. The Board is left to conclude that the orders for Vietnam play an important part in this decision to file for conscientious objection. In the letter of support from PFC Richey A. Clark it is stated \u201cBruce\u2019s beliefs have matured since I\u2019ve known him and even more so since he found out he was on orders for Vietnam.\u201d CPT C. D. Waite, an officer knowledgeable in the policies and procedures relating to conscientious objection matters and before whom PFC Richmond personally appeared stated in his report of that interview \u201cHowever, it seems to me that his primary motive is to evade military service in the interest of his own personal safety and even more important to stand up for his current political convictions. He repeatedly indicated that he wanted to stand up and be counted as one who didn\u2019t support war. Furthermore, his objections seem here almost entirely to a particular war (Vietnam).\u201d In answer to one of CPT Waite\u2019s questions \u201cIf you had the opportunity, would you leave the United States than go to Fort Levinworth to prison for not going to Vietnam for refusing orders ?\u201d The applicant answered \u201cI\u2019ve thought about this quite often and I don\u2019t know it\u2019s kind of another balance I have made yet, whether it would be worth it to go to Canada and be against it there or go to jail and show people who believe that the war is wrong, show them that somebody has stood up \u2014 just showing people that there\u2019s other people against the war. It\u2019s an example to follow if you want to say as such.\u201d This leaves the Board to find that the applicant\u2019s request is based on objection to a particular war rather than opposition to war in any form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">Richmond exhausted his Army remedies by applying for further review to the Secretary of the Army. The Secretary disapproved the application, stating \u201cApplicant lacks the depth of conviction required to qualify for discharge as a conscientious objector, also, applicant\u2019s request is based solely upon considerations of policy, pragmatism, or expediency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">The sole objective facts in the record that can be cited to support these multiple conclusions are that Richmond did not file his application for conscientious objector status until he received orders to report to Viet Nam and that he had also filed for a hardship discharge after his father was disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">All of the letters filed with Richmond\u2019s application attest to his sincerity and to the depth of his convictions. His mother expressed her opposition to his decision to seek discharge from the Army, but she affirmed that his conscientious beliefs were sincere. She observed that \u201cpunishment will not change his views, even if it were possible to force him into subjection.\u201d The transcript of the hearing before Captain Waite is replete with testimony to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>The record is barren of any evidence to sustain Captain Waite\u2019s conclusion that Richmond was motivated by his political views.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is full of evidence that Richmond\u2019s aversion to war was not selective.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board quoted the only passage in the entire transcript which remotely suggests selectivity. Read in context, the statement does not support an inference that his objection to war was limited to Viet Nam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">The record also fails to sustain the board's statement that Richmond gave no reasons for a change in his beliefs which now make him feel that he could not continue in military service. He stated the growth and development of his ideas, the increasing struggle with his conflicts, and the crystallization of his beliefs that occurred when he received orders to Viet Nam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">The key to the board\u2019s decision is its statement: \u201cThe Board is left to conclude that orders for Vietnam play an important part in this decision to file for conscientious objection.\u201d The record fully supports that statement because, according to Richmond\u2019s consistent testimony, it was his orders that compelled him to resolve his conflict and to make his choice between duty to the Army and duty to his conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>Each level of Army consideration was pinned to the timing of his application. Each officer inferred that a claim of crystallization based on receipt of orders could not be sincere. Yet, human experience repeatedly contradicts the inference: We again and again fail to decide what we think about a situation until we must confront it. Recognizing this reality, we have held that crystallization of conscientious objector views upon receipt of orders to Viet Nam is not an indicium of insincerity. (Tressan v. Laird (9th Cir. 1972) 454 F.2d 761; cf. Rastin v. Laird (9th Cir. 1971) 445 F.2d 645.) We also recognize how extremely difficult it is for career military personnel to accept as sincere convictions of persons such as Richmond when those views are directly opposed to their own. (Some of the literature on the subject is collected in Ehlert v. United States (1971) 402 U.S. 99, 108, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (Douglas, J., dissenting).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">For these and reasons further expressed in <em>Tressan, </em>we reverse the order and remand the cause with instructions that the Army be allowed a reasonable time within which to grant discharge to Richmond pursuant to Army regulations applicable to conscientious objectors, failing which the writ shall be granted by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">. Tangential references to politics were made by the interrogator, not by Richmond. Typical exchanges are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-9\">\u201cQ. What do you think about the present administration\u2019s handling of the war in the last few months</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-10\">\u201cA. That\u2019s a strange thing \u2014 I don\u2019t know really what to think of it. It\u2019s confused and the reports on it, I can\u2019t believe them all so I can\u2019t really say because we get conflicting reports such as the Laos reports, so I can\u2019t be sure exactly what they\u2019re doing. I can\u2019t know exactly what their policies are because they don\u2019t always say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-11\">\u201cQ. Do you know the difference between politicians and professional diplomats?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-12\">\u201cA. Not really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-13\">\u201cQ. Do you happen to know Senator Muskie\u2019s political beliefs as far as the war in Viet Nam?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-14\">\u201cA. No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-15\">\u201cQ. Do you know of any Senators or Congressmen who are opposed to the war in Viet Nam and have beliefs similar to you or many of these people that aren\u2019t in government that have been discussed here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-16\">\u201cA. From what I understand McGovern and Hatfield are against it and the Massachusetts governor was trying to pass laws on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1099-17\">. For example: \u201cQ. Is that the only reason that you refused those orders [to Viet NamJ ?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-18\">\u201cA. Because I could not kill and I could not go along with the war, any war.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-19\">Asked about whether he would have joined the war effort in World War II, he replied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-20\">\u201cIf I was placed in the situation where I was in World War II and I believed the same as I do now, how would I react? Is that what you\u2019re asking? If I reacted at all towards the war, I would stay at home and I would work for the people at home \u2014 the ones that were suffering during the time of the war at home. I could not join the war.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-21\">\u201cQ. Just give me a rundown of what you feel now about war, killing, people\u2014 tell me what your beliefs are that you based your application as conscientious objector on and how you felt you arrived at those beliefs. You can do this however you want.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-22\">\u201cA. As far as my beliefs go, I believe that killing is wrong and especially war. It seems unnecessary to waste these lives and I think that we have reached a stage where war can be avoided. It could have been avoided before but especially now. Through things that have happened towards mass media, towards getting things out to the people, I think that war can be avoided. I think that killing is just a waste of human life which could be put to some constructive use. Every individual life is worth so much more than just a piece of dirt to be sent out and killed. I think that human lives are not just numbers, they\u2019re people and that they <em>are </em>important. It\u2019s just unnecessary to kill especially en masse. I\u2019ve reached these beliefs through books that I\u2019ve read, people that I\u2019ve known, things that I\u2019ve done, seen, in everyday life these things have come through. Even in some simple books that don\u2019t seem like they have anything in them, you can find where there\u2019s beauty and there\u2019s a necessity for people to live. It is possible for people to live and pass productive lives that are useful.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1100-5\">ALFRED T.
