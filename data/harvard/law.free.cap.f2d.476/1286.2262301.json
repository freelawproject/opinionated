That judgment was affirmed. 298 F.Supp. 435 (W.D.Mich., 1969), aff\u2019d. 430 F.2d 221 (6th Cir. 1970), cert. denied 401 U.S. 939, 91 S.Ct. 932, 28 L.Ed. 2d 218 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-4\">The proceedings resulting in these appeals involved the appellee\u2019s challenge to certain modifications of the appellant\u2019s device made in an effort to avoid the claims of the patent previously found to be valid. The trial court concluded that there was infringement of the patent by the modified device and found the appellant in contempt of court. We conclude that the District Judge\u2019s findings were free from error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">Appellant now claims that it was prevented from introducing evidence of pri- or art and further claims that the trial court did not consider the pertinent prior art. A careful examination of the transcript of the trial convinces us that these claims are completely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">For the reasons herein stated and for the reasons stated in the opinion of District Judge Noel P. Fox, 338 F.Supp. 1240 (1972), the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
