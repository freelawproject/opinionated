Code \u00a7 2901 (1967), as amended, (Supp. V, 1972). After the appeal was heard by a division of the court it was reheard by the court en banc to consider important and recurring problems arising from the administration of the Federal Youth Corrections Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5005-5026 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-22\">I. APPEAL FROM THE CONVICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-23\">Appellant testified that he engaged in conversation with two young ladies on the street, who in no way complained of his company as the three walked together toward a bus stop. Indeed, it is not disputed that they exchanged telephone numbers. Both ladies testified that at the bus stop one of the ladies reached into her slacks for bus fare, and when she removed a $10.00 bill, appellant snatched it and ran.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon conviction of the robbery thus ascribed to appellant he was sentenced to imprisonment of two to six years, to be served consecutively to any sentence then being served.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-24\">Appellant claims on appeal, as he did at trial, of an unnecessarily suggestive photographic identification by the two ladies, from which it is said to follow, under the \u201cpoisonous tree\u201d doctrine of Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>(1963), that subsequent lineup and in-court identifications were inadmissible as stemming from the photographic identifications. At the conclusion of a hearing on a motion to suppress the identification evidence, the District Court, we think correctly, ruled that the lineup and in-court identifications were admissible as based on a source independent of the photographic identifications. We accordingly affirm the conviction and turn to consideration of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">II. CONSIDERATION OF COE-FIELD\u2019S POSSIBLE SENTENCE UNDER THE YOUTH CORRECTIONS ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">Because appellant was 20 years of age at the time of his conviction, a discussion arose at oral argument of the appeal as to a possible remand of the case for reconsideration of the sentence under the Youth Corrections Act. Appellant\u2019s counsel was unable then to advise the court as to his client\u2019s wishes in that regard. As arranged, however, he filed a memorandum after argument advising the court that appellant was amenable to consideration of his sentence under the Act. The Government in a responding memorandum took the position that a remand was unnecessary, contending that the sentencing court, by imposing an adult sentence consecutive to the other adult sentence of two to six years appellant was already serving, implicitly found that appellant would not derive benefit from a sentence under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-6\">In passing the Youth Corrections Act, Congress provided the federal sentencing judge with four alternatives. The first allows the judge to suspend imposition or execution of sentence entirely and place the youth offender on probation. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a). The second allows the judge upon finding that the convicted person is a youth offender and that the offense is one punishable by imprisonment under other applicable provisions of law, to sentence the youth offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment and supervision in a special youth facility. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b). Under this alternative, the youth offender must be unconditionally discharged no later than six years after the date of his conviction. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017(c). Because the maximum-limitation of commitment under the second alternative may not be sufficient time in the judgment of the court for full rehabilitation of the youth offender, the judge may sentence the youth offender to commitment in a youth institution but specify the term, which may exceed six years but may not exceed the maximum period authorized by law for any applicable penalty. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(c). Under the fourth alternative, the court, provided it finds that the youth offender will not derive benefit from treatment by commitment to a youth institution under either the second or third alternatives noted above (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) or (c)), may sentence him under any other applicable penalty provision. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d). The court in selecting among these several alternative sentences has available to assist him, and the sentence to be served is subject to, the additional statutory provisions, and operation under them, outlined hereinafter in Part III of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-8\">Since appellant was not placed on probation, or sentenced under either the second or third alternative above outlined, the question arises whether there has been a finding as required by section 5010(d) that he would not derive benefit from treatment under subsections (b) and (c), resulting in his sentence as an adult under the fourth alternative. In construing section 5010(d) in United States v. Waters, 141 U.S. App.D.C. 289, 291; 437 F.2d 722, 724 (1970), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1212-9\">Under the Youth Corrections Act, \u00a7 5010(d), the court must affirmatively find that the youth offender will <em>not </em>benefit from rehabilitative treatment before the offender can be sentenced as an adult pursuant to the statute governing the offense for which he was convicted. (Footnote omitted.) [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>Likewise, in United States v. Ward, 147 U.S.App.D.C. 149, 454 F.2d 992 (1971), in reserving its ruling on appellant Ward\u2019s motion for summary reversal, the court remanded the record to the District Court for elucidation of its reasoning why Ward could be denied sentencing under the Act notwithstanding the fact that the sentencing court recommended he be sent to \u201c \u2018an institution where they usually send youth offenders such as Petersburg, Virginia, or some institution of that type.\u2019 \u201d 147 U.S.App.D.C. at 151, 454 F.2d at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">The purposes of Congress in requiring an affirmative finding under section 5010(d) are explained in Judge Wilkey\u2019s opinion for the court in <em>Waters, </em>are restated in <em>Ward, </em>and need not be repeated here at length. We note, however, the recognition that the trial judge retains discretion \u201cto deny such rehabilitative treatment to those youths in the exceptional case where the judge determines that the special youth treatment afforded by the Act would be of no value.\u201d 141 U.S.App.D.C. at 291, 437 F.2d at 724. Not only was there no finding of no benefit in <em>Waters, </em>but as in <em>Ward </em>the failure of the sentencing court to sentence under the Act was accompanied by a recommendation based on Waters\u2019 youth. Since this was inconsistent with the failure to sentence under the Act, this court required the sentence as an adult to be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing pursuant to the finding requirements of section 5010(d). The court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1213-7\">[W]e believe that this discretion [of the sentencing court] is circumscribed by the findings of fact in the individual case which the District Judge is required to make either explicitly or implicitly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1213-8\">141 U.S.App.D.C. at 292, 437 F.2d at 725; and see, to like effect, <em>Ward, </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. at 151, 454 F.2d at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-11\">These references to an implicit finding are advanced by the government now to support the adult sentence of Coefield. But the sentencing transcript contains no reference whatever to the Act nor does any reference to it appear in the presentence report submitted to the judge. It would seem, therefore, necessary to remand the case to the District Court for reconsideration of the sentence unless we are to imply the \u201cno benefit\u201d finding. This we are unable to do. In the first place, the record does not support such an implication. The fact that Coefield was already serving an adult sentence not imposed under the Act, does not establish by implication the requisite finding. The papers before us indicate that appellant has been quite successfully serving out his previous sentence, having completed high school equivalency during the sentence, and that he is now participating in a rehabilitative furlough program under which he is released for short periods of time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, it appears from the presentence report of the first robbery that prior to sentencing for that offense appellant was confined for at least a part of the time under a program of work release, and responded favorably. From such a record we can draw no clear inference that the trial judge found no benefit. Given Coefield\u2019s promising response to the correctional program and his earlier history free of encounters with the law, an equally compelling inference is that the judge failed to consider the Youth Corrections Act. True, Coefield\u2019s record is not all favorable, but its hopeful indications strongly suggest that now is hardly the time to place him for two to six more years in an environment where there is greater likelihood that his responsive attitude toward rehabilitation could be reversed. To avoid the \u201cdegenerative and needless transformation of many of these young persons into habitual criminals\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>purpose of the Act. There is an additional reason why the finding of no benefit should not be left to implication, as now set forth in Part III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">III. STANDARDS OF SENTENCING UNDER THE ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">1. The ambiguity illustrated by the <em>Coefield </em>sentence' has led the court en banc to give further consideration to the question whether the finding required by section 5010(d), as a condition to an adult sentence, should be left to implication. The passing reference in <em>Waters </em>to this possibility, a reference not necessary to the court\u2019s decision, we think must give way to the statements in <em>Waters </em>that as a condition to an adult sentence the court is required affirmatively to find that the youth offender would not benefit from rehabilitative treatment, and, also, that the judge\u2019s discretion \u201cis circumscribed by the findings of fact in the individual ease which the District Judge is required to make.\u201d The main thrust of the opinion thus is definitely toward explicitness, and we now adopt that as the rule; for when a youth offender is sentenced as an adult, and nothing more appears, it cannot be said with certainty that the Act was considered and a negative finding with respect to its possible benefits was made. <em>Cf. </em>Hubb v. United States, 298 A.2d 512 (D.C.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">2. The present consideration of the Act by the court en banc also furnishes an especially appropriate occasion for the adoption of some further guides in administering the Act, centering upon the relation of section 5010(d) to the Act as a whole. No federal statute having to do with sentencing compares in comprehensiveness with the Youth Corrections Act. In addition to the four alternative sentences available to the judge in the case of a youth offender, outlined in Part II, <em>supra, </em>a number of special provisions have been made available for assisting the judge, the youth, and the public, emphasizing the distinctive character of the sentencing of a youth offender, as compared with the larger freedom of the sentencing judge in adult cases. United States v. Bryant, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 53, 442 F.2d 775, cert. denied, 402 U.S. 932, 91 S.Ct. 1534, 28 L. Ed.2d 866 (1971). A special Division is created under the Board of Parole to assist in administering the Act. Section 5005. The Division functions under the Attorney General and in collaboration with the Director of the Bureau of Prisons. Sections 5005, 5007. The Director shall provide classification centers and agencies, which shall make a complete study of each committed youth offender. Section 5014. A report of the findings of the centers or agencies, with their recommendations for the youth\u2019s treatment, goes to the Director and to the Division. <em>Ibid. </em>At least one member of the Division shall interview the committed youth, \u201creview all reports concerning him, and make such recommendations to the Director and to the Division as may be indicated.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>On the basis of the report and recommendations the Director has a choice of recommendations : conditional release under supervision, transfer or allocation to another agency or institution for treatment, or confinement for treatment under conditions believed best designed for the protection of the public. Section 5015. Periodic examination of all committed youth offenders, and reports to the Director as to each, are required, and the Director shall report to the Division as the Division may require, as also shall probation officers and supervisory agents with respect to each youth under their supervision. Section 5016. Details are set forth as to the authority of the Division, upon notice to the Director, to release conditionally under supervision a committed youth offender, and with respect to recommendations in this regard by the Director to the Division. Section 5017(a). The periods of detention before discharge, with the differences due to whether the youth offender has been committed under sections 5010(b) or 5010(c), are contained in sections 5017(c) and (d). Revocation by the Division of its previous orders is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>permitted by section 5018, except an order of unconditional discharge. Committed youth offenders at liberty under supervision or conditionally released are supervised as detailed in section 5019.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">Such attentiveness by Congress to this correctional system for youth offenders, developed over a period of many years of congressional study, calls for no less attentiveness on our part in administering the legislation, such as was given by .this court in <em>Waters. </em>We there pointed out that only in \u201cthe exceptional ease where the judge determines that the special youth treatment afforded by the Act would be of no value,\u201d 141 U.S.App.D.C. at 291, 437 F.2d at 724, may a youth offender be sentenced other than under the Act, and then only upon the basis of an affirmative finding in the individual case that a sentence under the Act would not have the rehabilitative benefit contemplated by the Act where, for example, the judge, on the basis of a prior sentence under the Youth Corrections Act, which was followed by a subsequent offense, reached a decision, perhaps based on the section 5010(e) report, that the defendant would not derive rehabilitative benefit from a second sentence under the Act. This is an illustrative example, and is not the only or exclusive basis upon which a \u201cno benefit\u201d finding can be made <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; we have not attempted to spell out all the grounds that might form a basis for an affirmative \u201cno benefit\u201d finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">The approach in <em>Waters </em>and <em>Ward </em>would seem to presuppose a statement of reasons by the sentencing judge if these special provisions are not being utilized and the youth offender is sentenced as an adult. To require reasons to be stated is clearly not inconsistent with those decisions; and we now deem this to be essential to a knowledgeable administration of the Act as intended by Congress. When, however, prior to imposing a sentence, the judge has availed himself of the assistance afforded by section 5010(e),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and after considering the report in light of the other data before him, follows its findings or recommendation in imposing sentence, additional reasons need not be stated, although, of course, the judge is not precluded from adding reasons of his own.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the other hand when section 5010(e) is not invoked, or the judge imposes a sentence contrary to the recommendation in a report following a referral under section 5010(e), the need for more detailed statement of reasons is more obvious. In providing for reasons to be stated by the District Court we are not seeking to elicit any litany or prescribed formula. We do consider it essential, however, to assure in every case: firstly, that the District Judge manifest not only an awareness that the Act is applicable to the case, but also an accurate understanding of the scope of his discretion under the Act; secondly, that the District Judge has been informed of the pertinent facts relating to the individual defendant before him, either by evidence coming to his attention in the trial, by a presentence report, or by a recommendation and report made under section 5010(e); and thirdly, that the District Judge, by his statement of reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>where required,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> has given consideration and related the facts of the individual case to the applicable law. If these requirements are satisfied, there should be no large number of appeals calling for review of sentences which call for consideration of the Youth Corrections Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">3. We add that none of the existing rights of a person convicted of crime and which pertain to the sentenceing process, including the right of allocution, are impaired by the Act, and reasonable opportunity to the youth offender, if requested, to adduce evidence bearing on the sentence to be imposed, shall not be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">IV. APPELLATE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">1. The sentence of a youth offender as an adult is reviewable for legal error, such, for example, as a failure to utilize the Act because when sentenced the offender has reached the age of 22, although when the verdict or finding of guilt was rendered he was in the youth offender range of 18 to 22 years. Such an error was the basis of decision in United States v. Carter, 225 F.Supp. 566 (D.D.C.1964), opinion by Judge Youngdahl, recently followed by our court <em>in </em>United States v. Carmichael, 152 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 469 F.2d 937 (1972), and now reaffirmed in Coefield\u2019s ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-15\">2. Review is also permissible, as heretofore illustrated by both <em>Waters </em>and <em>Ward, </em>to determine whether the sentencing process has conformed with the standards set forth in those cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These standards we have now amplified as above set forth when the youth offender is sentenced as an adult and not under subsection (b) or (c) of section 5010. In such event the finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>required to be made under section 5010(d) as a condition to an adult sentence is to be explicit \u2014 \u201caffirmative\u201d as said in <em>Waters </em>\u2014 and must be supported by reasons from which it can be determined that it is consistent with the purposes of the Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed. The sentence is vacated and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">The Senate Report, states that the \u201cpurpose of the proposed legislation is to provide a new alternative sentencing and treatment procedure for persons under the age of 24 . . . \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> S.Rep.

Waters, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 437 F.2d 722, 724 (1970); United States v. Ward, 147 U.S.App.D.C. 149, 454 F.2d 992 (1971). We agree with these decisions and have concluded to follow them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-12\">In the instant case the district court made no finding that Cox would not benefit from treatment as a youth offender; and when on motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255, the absence of the finding was urged as a ground warranting relief, the district court found as a fact that \u201c[i]n sentencing Petitioner, the court made no finding that Petitioner would not benefit from treatment under [the Act],\u201d and specifically rejected the holding of <em>Waters </em>on the ground that the legislative history of the Act made it clear that the Act was not intended to remove the discretion of the district judge whether or not to sentence a convicted youthful offender under the statute governing his offense or under the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-18\">Irrespective of the legislative history, the language of the Act is quite specific. It requires a finding that a youth offender will not benefit from treatment under the Act before the district court \u201cmay\u201d sentence the youth as an adult. We agree with the language in <em>Waters </em>that \u201c[w]hile the District Court does have discretion to sentence a 19-year-old \u2018youth offender\u2019 under either the applicable statutory offense provision or the Youth Corrections Act, we believe this discretion is circumscribed by the findings of fact in the individual case which the District Judge is required to make either explicitly or implicitly,\u201d 437 F.2d at 725, and \u201c[w]hile the District Court is given discretion in regard to sentencing, that discretion must be exercised in accordance with the intention of Congress underlying the statutory provisions . . . \u201d, 437 F.2d at 727. Like <em>Ward, </em>the implications which can be drawn from the failure to make an explicit finding in this case are too uncertain for us to conclude that there was an implicit finding that Cox would not benefit from sentencing under the Act, especially when the district court found that it had made no finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1216-21\">Earl French Cox, Jr. v.

The imposition of an adult sentence of a youth offender when such sentence amounts to a final judgment involves an implicit finding that the youth offender would not benefit from Youth Act treatment. Moreover, ten months <em>after </em>Judge Green sentenced appellant, Judge Robinson denied a motion specifically requesting a Youth Act sentence and this decision is final. It was not appealed. This forecloses the subsequent litigation of that issue between the parties. In addition since the statute only provides that the sentencing judge shall \u201cfind\u201d that the youth offender will not derive benefit, this does not require a statement of \u201creasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">Appellant Coefield was born on December 31, 1948. On July 31, 1968 he committed two robberies, by snatching, in which he obtained a total of $45. The victims were both women. His indictment for such offenses charging robbery in violation of D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2901 was returned on September 30, 1968 (Criminal No. 1548-68).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">During the time he was released from custody awaiting trial he committed a similar robbery by snatching on April 26, 1969 in which he stole $10. Again the victim was a woman. The second indictment, which was for this offense, was returned on July 29, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">Appellant was tried on the first indictment by a jury before Judge Aubrey E. Robinson, Jr., found guilty on both counts and on December 16, 1969 was sentenced to serve an adult sentence of two (2) to six (6) years concurrently on each count. He appealed this conviction and made a motion for release on work release program pending appeal. In denying said motion on September 15, 1970, Judge Robinson found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-12\">[T]his Court concludes that the defendant is a sophisticated predator and a danger to the public and would continue to be so if released. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACPV\">Coefield\u2019s appeal to this court on the first indictment was \u2022 dismissed <em>sua sponte </em>on November 2, 1970 by Judges Spottswood Robinson III and Robb when counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">Appellant was tried on the second indictment by a jury before Judge June L. Green on December 17, 1969, <em>the day after he was sentenced on the charges of the first indictment. </em>A guilty verdict was returned on this charge of the second indictment and Judge Green adjudged another adult sentence for him on March 3, 1970 (two months and 18 days after he was awarded an adult sentence by Judge Robinson) of imprisonment of two (2) to six (6) years, to run <em>consecutively </em>to the <em>adult </em>sentence on the first indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-14\">By petition dated November 1, 1971 appellant requested that his adult sentence adjudged by Judge Robinson be modified to one under the Federal Youth Corrections Act. This motion effectively raised the issue as to his eligibility for a Youth Corrections Act sentence. The motion was denied by order on December 21, 1971. <em>No appeal was taken from this order, </em>so that judgment is final.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-16\">It thus appears that when appellant came on for sentencing before Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>Green on March 3, 1970 he was already-serving an <em>adult sentence </em>which had been adjudged by Judge Robinson only two months and 17 days previously on December 16, 1969.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In imposing sentence on the second indictment, apart from facing the practical impossibility of imposing a concurrent or consecutive Youth. Corrections Act sentence, Judge Green had the right to rely upon the regularity of Judge Robinson\u2019s sentence and that regularity necessarily included a finding by Judge Robinson that appellant would \u201cnot derive benefit from treatment under [the Youth Corrections Act]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d). The decision by Judge Robinson to impose an adult sentence made it unnecessary for Judge Green to reconsider the appellant\u2019s eligibility for a Youth Corrections Act sentence as that issue had been <em>necessarily involved </em>in Judge Robinson\u2019s decision just two and one-half months before and Coefield is collaterally estopped from raising the issue in a subsequent action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">The doctrine of collateral estoppel is an aspect of the broader principle of <em>res judicata; </em>it applies to both civil and criminal proceedings, and extends to facts <em>necessarily involved </em>in an issue or necessarily implied by a judgment, Sealfon v. United States, 332 U.S. 575, 578, 68 S.Ct. 237, 92 L.Ed. 180 (1948), Pena-Cabanillas v. United States, 394 F.2d 785, 786 (9th Cir. 1968) as well as to facts actually decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">If there were any doubt as to the conclusive nature of the first sentence on file issue of Coefield\u2019s eligibility for YCA treatment, that doubt was completely removed by Judge Robinson\u2019s order of December 21, 1971 which <em>denied a specific motion </em>to modify appellant\u2019s sentence so as to impose one under the Youth Corrections Act. That same issue cannot again be raised by appellant. I thus see no necessity to discuss any of the considerations treated by the opinion of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-9\">The majority opinion imposes the requirement for the future that the sentencing court state the \u201creasons\u201d upon which it may base its finding</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-10\">that the youth offender will not derive benefit from treatment under [the Youth Corrections Act] ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-12\">The Youth Corrections Act, however, only requires that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-13\">[T]he court shall <em>find </em>that the youth offender will not derive benefit from [youth] treatment under subsection (b) or (c) .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d) (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-15\">\u201cReasons differ from findings in that reasons relate to law, policy, and discretion rather than facts.\u201d 2 K. Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 16.12 (1958). The opinion of the majority in requiring \u201creasons\u201d thus imposes a requirement not imposed by Congress and goes even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>further than the Supreme Court went in S.E.C. v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943), where it refused to enforce \u201cformal requirements\u201d upon an <em>administrative agency. </em>And courts have always been permitted wider latitude in this respect than administrative agencies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I thus see no justification for placing our trial courts in an administrative straight jacket on sentencing youth offenders, which incidentally involves a subject over which we have very little control. It is accordingly my conclusion that the majority opinion in this respect exceeds our authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">I also dissent specifically from the statement at page 1155, <em>supra, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1221-7\">The fact that Coefield was already serving an adult sentence not imposed under the Act, does not establish by implication the requisite finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">This fails to give adequate consideration to the prior judgment and completely overlooks the effect of the contemporaneous sentence and judgment on the issue of \u201cno benefit.\u201d Judge Green\u2019s trial began <em>the day after Coefield was sentenced on the first offense </em>and she was not ignorant of his sentence thereon. She confirmed her awareness of his prior sentence by fashioning her sentence to run consecutively to the prior sentence. The prior sentence was also referred to by counsel at the time of allocution. While a sentence which was adjudged long after a prior adult sentence, for some purposes, might not be controlled by an implicit \u201cno benefit\u201d finding in a prior offense because of changed circumstances, such is not this case. The two sentences here were practically contemporaneous, with no material intervening circumstance, except that appellant was convicted upon a second indictment which charged his third offense. This additional conviction was not a factor likely to cause any fair-minded judge to impose more lenient punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-12\">In addition, I would refrain from relying upon the claimed conduct of appellant <em>while serving his sentence in prison </em>as a basis of our interfering in the sentencing function of the trial court. We are in no position to evaluate a prisoner\u2019s conduct in prison. We have no jurisdiction to impose our judgment or philosophy as to sentences. Such matters are for the trial court and the Parole Board and the facts necessary to such a determination are not a proper part of this record on appeal. It is improper for the majority opinion to rely upon the sketchy facts here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-13\">' In conclusion, I repeat that I see no reason to remand this case to the trial court to consider the eligibility of this appellant for a Youth Corrections Act sentence when appellant was given an adult sentence by another court shortly, before the instant sentence and when the identical issue as to whether appellant was entitled to an adult sentence was raised on motion in the first case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>and determined adversely to appellant by Judge Aubrey E. Robinson, Jr. shortly after appellant\u2019s sentence by Judge Green.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">. It should also be noted that the sentence adjudged by Judge Robinson of two to six years would mean that appellant would be 22 years, 11 months and 16 days of age before he would have served the <em>minimum </em>portion of his sentence on the charges of the first indictment. An offender to be eligible for sentencing under the Youth Corrections Act must be under the age of 22 years at the time of conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5006(e). The obvious intent of this provision was to place a top ceiling on the age when an offender could enter the youth correction treatment program. Appellant here could not enter the program on his second sentence at a minimum until he was 15 days short of his 23rd birthday and he might be considerably older before he would have fully served his sentence. Thus, while he would satisfy the literal requirements of the statute that he be under 22 at the time of conviction he would not satisfy the real objective that Congress had in mind when it imposed the 22 year age limitation, <em>i. e., </em>that the youth offender not be above 22 when he starts serving his Youth Act sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1221-9\">. Since most courts, including the Supreme Court, often decide cases without opinions, administrative opinions can hardly be a requirement of due process of law. The Court of Claims once asserted that the requirement of written opinions is a \u201ccardinal principle of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.\u201d Of this dictum Professor Radin has written that \u201cthe word \u2018cardinal,\u2019 the word \u2018principle\u2019 and the word \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 are somewhat excessive.\u201d Professor Radin points out that courts in California, Arkansas, and Montana have held statutory requirements of written judicial opinions to be unconstitutional, and courts in eight states have interpreted such requirements to be directory and not mandatory. For compelling unwilling agencies to prepare opinions, due process is a much less promising weapon than section 8(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act which, for determinations required by statute to be made on the record after opportunity for agency hearing, requires not only findings and conclusions but also a statement of \u201cthe reasons or basis therefor . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-15\">2 K. Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 16.13 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1222-15\">. It conceivably may be argued from the reference to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 in Judge Robinson\u2019s denial of the motion to impose a youth sentence, that the trial court merely did not consider Coefield to have been \u201cillegally sentenced,\u201d and still did not consider the YCA. But this argument refuses to recognize the even more obvious implication that in the denial by the trial court of Coefield\u2019s specific motion to sentence him under the Youth Corrections Act, the court found that Coefield was not eligible under the statute for YCA treatment, because if he had been eligible, the court was required to sentence him under the YCA. I would conclude from Judge Robinson\u2019s citation of Fed.R.Crim. P. 35 that he considered \u201can illegal sentence\u201d was not involved because he had properly considered Coefield\u2019s eligibility for Youth Corrections Act treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
