The district court declined so to instruct the jury. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-17\">Carl Wallin was killed on August 16, 1970, when his Volkswagen, which he was driving, collided with a Pontiac driven by Allen Fuller on a two-lane highway near Lowndesboro, Alabama. Wallin held a policy of insurance with Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, which contained a standard uninsured motorist clause. Fuller was an uninsured motorist within the meaning of this clause. Marsha Lee Wallin, widow of Carl Wallin, brought suit in. federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment against Nationwide under the policy, alleging that Fuller\u2019s negligence had caused the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-18\">On September 20, 1971, the district court held a pretrial hearing and entered an order specifying the issues agreed upon by the plaintiff, Mrs. Wallin, and defendant, Nationwide. The plaintiff\u2019s theory of recovery, as recited in the pretrial order, was that Fuller negligently drove onto his left side of the highway, thus causing the collision with Wallin\u2019s ear. The defendant denied that Fuller had been negligent. Further, the defendant contended that Wallin had been contributorily negligent in pulling out onto <em>his </em>left-hand side of the highway to pass another car when there was insufficient room to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-19\">Most of the plaintiff\u2019s case at the trial was devoted to showing that the collision had occurred in Wallin\u2019s right-hand lane, and that Fuller therefore had been on the wrong side of the road. Mrs. Wallin, the plaintiff, identified photographs which she had taken showing that the left side had been torn off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>Wallin\u2019s Volkswagen. The plaintiff also submitted the testimony of two investigating officers, who stated that the point of impact was on Wallin\u2019s right side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">The defense offered the deposition of George Mayes, who had been riding in Fuller\u2019s car at the time of the accident, and called Fuller himself to the stand. Both Mayes and Fuller testified that Wallin had pulled out to pass, and that the cars had collided while Wallin was still in the left lane and Fuller was in his right lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">The testimony of both Mayes and Fuller revealed a possibility that, even if Wallin had been contributorily negligent, Fuller might have been guilty of subsequent negligence or wanton conduct. Under Alabama law a showing of subsequent negligence or wantonness defeats a defense of contributory negligence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counsel for the defendant made no objection to the admission of any of this testimony at the trial. Mayes, the passenger, testified at his deposition that Fuller did not slow down when he first became aware that Wallin was trying to pass; that he finally shouted at Fuller to slam on his brakes; and that Fuller then applied his brakes and skidded into Wallin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defense took the deposition of Mayes on September 8, 1971, before the pretrial hearing. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney was present at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>this deposition, but made no mention of the issues of subsequent negligence and wanton conduct either at the pretrial hearing or when the deposition was introduced into evidence at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">Fuller, called as a witness by the defense, gave testimony on cross-examination by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that tended to corroborate Mayes\u2019s version of the events.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On recross, asked by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney whether the accident would not have happened if he had slowed down the least little bit, Fuller replied: \u201cI guess not.\u201d Counsel for the defendant made no objection to any of this examination by the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">Neither attorney drew the court\u2019s attention to the fact that this testimony might show subsequent negligence or wanton conduct, or to the fact that the pretrial order precluded these issues, until after both sides had rested. The defendant then submitted requested written charges to the court. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney objected to one of these charges on the ground that it failed to include the issues of subsequent negligence and wanton conduct, and requested leave to amend the pleadings to include these issues. The trial court denied leave to amend, applying the standard of Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that, where the issues have been narrowed by a pretrial order, amendment will be permitted only when necessary to prevent \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d The court proceeded to submit the case to the jury without instructions as to the legal effect of subsequent negligence or wanton conduct. The jury found for the defendant. The court then denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, and the plaintiff brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-25\"> The pretrial conference serves the purposes of expediting litigation and eliminating surprise at the trial. Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure establishes that the pre-trial order ordinarily governs the course of the trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the Rule 16 \u201cmanifest in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>justice\u201d standard, the question whether to permit amendment of the pretrial order in the course of the trial is generally a matter within the discretion of the trial judge, and an appellate court will intervene only if the trial judge has acted arbitrarily. See Ely v. Reading Co., 3 Cir. 1970, 424 F.2d 758; McKey v. Fairbairn, 1965, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 250, 345 F.2d 739; Case v. Abrams, 10 Cir. 1965, 352 F.2d 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">Unbending adherence to the strictures of Rule 16 would, however, frustrate another broad policy of the Federal Rules favoring liberality of amendment. This policy is principally embodied in Rule 15, which deals with amendments to the pleadings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is unlikely that the pretrial order under Rule 16 was intended to make the pleadings, and therefore Rule 15, obsolete. See Commentary, The Pre-Trial Order, 4 Fed.Rules Serv. 16.3, at 906 (1941) ; Note, Federal Pre-Trial Practice: A Study of Modifications and Sanctions, 51 Geo.L.J. 309, 312 (1963). Even though the parties have the advantage of discovery before the pretrial conference, events not anticipated at the pretrial stage may often occur at the trial. See Clark, To an Understanding Use of Pre-Trial, 29 F.R.D. 454, 459 (1961); Clark v. United States, 1952, D.Or., 13 F.R.D. 342, 345-346. And attorneys would be reluctant to enter agreements at the pretrial conference if later amendments were strictly forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-12\">Courts have therefore widely recognized that Rule 16 must be read in light of Rule 15, and that in some circumstances the policy of Rule 15 should moderate the strictures of Rule 16. Bucky v. Sebo, 2 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 304, 305; Brooks v. Wootton, 2 Cir. 1966, 355 F.2d 177; Dering v. Williams, 9 Cir. 1967, 378 F.2d 417; Blackwell v. Regal Cab Co., 1963, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 397, 316 F.2d 398; Meadow Gold Products Co. v. Wright, 1960, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 33, 278 F.2d 867; see Rosden v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>Leuthold, 1960, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 89, 274 F.2d 747; 3 J. Moore, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 15.13[1], at 982 (1972); 6 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 1491, at 455-56 (1971); Christenson, The Pre-Trial Order, 29 F.R.D. 362, 375 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\"> At a minimum the accommodation of Rule 16 to Rule 15 should mean that the more liberal standard of Rule 15 should apply when one of the parties seeks amendment to conform the pleadings to the issues actually raised by the evidence introduced at the trial. Monod v. Futura, Inc., 10 Cir. 1969, 415 F.2d 1170, 1173-1174; McDowall v. Orr Felt &amp; Blanket Co., 6 Cir. 1944, 146 F.2d 136, 137; Mayfield v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, 6 Cir. 1943, 137 F.2d 1013, 1016-1017. Rule 15(b) provides that when issues outside the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, \u201cthey <em>shall </em>be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings\u201d (Emphasis added.) Amendment is thus not merely discretionary but mandatory in such a case. 3 J. Moore, \u00b6 15.13 [2] at 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">The trial court erred in applying Rule 16 rather than Rule 15(b). Under the standards of Rule 15(b) the defendant impliedly consented to the trial of issues outside the pretrial order, and the pleadings should therefore have been amended. A substantial quantity of evidence tending to establish subsequent negligence or wanton conduct was brought before the jury, through the deposition of Mayes and the testimony of Fuller, without objection by defense counsel. Indeed, both Mayes and Fuller were defense witnesses, and Fuller was himself a defendant. Cf. Vogrin v. Hedstrom, 8 Cir. 1955, 220 F.2d 863, cert. denied, 1955, 350 U.S. 845, 76 S.Ct. 86, 100 L.Ed. 753. Having deposed Mayes well in advance of the trial, defense counsel cannot complain of having been unaware that the evidence might tend to establish subsequent negligence and wantonness. In these circumstances the failure of the defense to seek to limit the evidence during the trial in accordance with the pretrial order establishes consent to the trial of these issues. See Pan-American Casualty Co. v. Reed, 5 Cir. 1957, 240 F.2d 336; 3 J. Moore, \u00b6 15.13 [2] at 994; 6 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, \u00a7 1493 at 463-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">The possibility of prejudice to the opposing party may of course be reason to find a lack of consent to amendment under Rule 15(b). See 6 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, \u00a7 1493 at 468. Any danger of prejudice to the defendant in this case could have been averted by the trial court. All witnesses to the accident had testified, as had the investigating officers. It would not have been impractical for the court to have reopened the trial, recalled the witnesses, and granted a short continuance if necessary to enable the defendant to prepare and present a defense. See Meadow Gold Products Co. v. Wright, 1960, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 33, 278 F.2d 867; Brooks v. Wootton, 2 Cir. 1966, 355 F.2d 177; Central Distributors, Inc. v. M.E.T. Inc., 5 Cir. 1968, 403 F.2d 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">The defendant, Nationwide Mutual, argues that the testimony of Mayes and Fuller was relevant to the issues of negligence and contributory negligence, and that therefore the admission of this evidence without objection cannot establish consent to the trial of any other issues. It is true that part of this testimony tended to rebut the plaintiff\u2019s theory that the collision occurred on Wallin\u2019s right side of the road, and tended to show that Wallin might have been contributorily negligent in pulling out to pass. But the testimony as to Fuller\u2019s failure to apply his brakes, and the conversation between Mayes and Fuller, was not relevant to the plaintiff's theory of recovery, which was founded solely on the theory that Fuller was on the wrong side of the road. Nor did it establish or rebut the contention that Wallin was contributorily negligent. This evidence was much more strongly relevant to the theories of subsequent negligence and wanton conduct, and this should have been apparent to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>Nationwide also points out that the trial court instructed the jury to consider whether Wallin created an immediate hazard, and told the jury that a finding of impact in Wallin\u2019s right lane would not itself show negligence. In sum, Nationwide contends that the jury was instructed to consider fully in light of all the evidence whose negligence was the proximate cause of the accident, and that this in effect substituted for an instruction on subsequent negligence and wantonness. We cannot agree that these instructions were an adequate substitute for full instructions on subsequent negligence and wantonness. Even if the jury had found Wallin\u2019s negligence to be a proximate cause of the accident, a showing of subsequent negligence on the part of Fuller might still have entitled the plaintiff to recovery. See W. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts \u00a7 66, at 427-28 (4th ed. 1971). Nor, in view of the testimony of Mayes and Fuller, can we agree with Nationwide\u2019s contention that there was insufficient evidence of subsequent negligence to present a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">Certainly the plaintiff\u2019s attorney should have raised these issues at the pretrial conference. He attended the deposition of Mayes, and was thus well aware before the pretrial conference that there was some evidence of subsequent negligence and wanton conduct. Where a party is aware of an issue before a pretrial conference, his failure to raise it there may in some circumstances be grounds for denying later amendment. See McKey v. Fairbairn, 1965, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 250, 345 F.2d 739; Marble v. Batten &amp; Co., 1964, D.D.C., 36 F.R.D. 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">But the failure of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in this case to raise these issues before or during the trial is offset by the failure of the defendant\u2019s attorney to attempt to exclude any of the evidence. We find no reason to conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney was acting in bad faith by trying to smuggle in issues for the purpose of surprising the defense at the trial. See McDowall v. Orr Felt &amp; Blanket Co., 6 Cir. 1944, 146 F.2d 136; Burton v. Weyerhaeuser Timber Co., 1941 D.Or., 4 Fed.Rules Serv. 16.32. Case 2. Moreover, we are reluctant to penalize the plaintiff for the errors of her attorney. See Link v. Wabash R. R. Co., 1962, 370 U.S. 626, 646-648, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (Black J., dissenting); Ferrell v. Trailmobile, Inc., 5 Cir. 1955, 223 F.2d 697; Clark, 29 F.R.D. at 456-457; Note, 51 Geo.L.J. at 341-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-8\">We therefore hold that the district court erred in applying the standards of Rule 16 rather than Rule 15(b), and that under Rule 15(b) the plaintiff was entitled to amendment. The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">. See, e. g., Birmingham Ry., Light &amp; Power Co. v.
