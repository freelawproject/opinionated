Mrs. Fisher thereafter brought an action against the members of the board under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that constitutionally impermissible reasons underlay their dismissal action. The district court ordered her reinstatement,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the board members bring this appeal. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Mrs. Fisher, a middle-aged<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> divorcee, was employed at the high school in Tryon, Nebraska,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from 1970 to 1972. Her married son, then 26 years old, lived and taught in the neighboring town of Stapleton, Nebraska. Mrs. Fisher lived alone in a one-bedroom apartment. On several occasions, young ladies, married couples, and young men, who were friends of her son, visited Tryon. Because hotel and motel accommodations were generally sparse and unavailable in Tryon, Mrs. Fisher followed the advice of the secretary of the school board and allowed these guests to stay overnight at her apartment. Cliff Rowan, age 26, was a particularly frequent visitor. Rowan\u2019s parents lived in California. He, therefore, regularly visited Mrs. Fisher during his school vacations and at other times, and she referred to him as her second son. In the spring of 1972, Rowan spent about a week in Tyron visiting school classes as a means of fulfilling certain of his college requirements. Mrs. Fisher made arrangements with school administrators for this visitation and it was reported in the local newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">Following Rowan\u2019s visit, the school board notified Mrs. Fisher that her contract would not be renewed at the end of the 1972 school year. At her request, pursuant to provisions of Nebraska law, the board afforded Mrs. Fisher a hearing relating to the notice of dismissal. Following this hearing, the board made findings justifying the dismissal which, as here pertinent, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-13\">(a) Frances A. Fish [sic] is a single woman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-14\">(b) That on several occasions during the current school year men, not related to Frances A. Fisher, stayed in her apartment in Tryon, McPherson County, Nebraska, on several occasions ranging from one night to a period of at least one week, this constitutes conduct unbecoming a teacher.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVn\">The district court held the dismissal impermissible as arbitrary and capricious in violation of Mrs. Fisher\u2019s right to substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. As a further basis for its decision, the court determined that the board, in dismissing Mrs. Fisher, invaded her constitutionally protected rights of association and privacy. Affirming on the substantive due process ground, we do not reach the issues of association or privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">Nebraska by statute requires that notice and a hearing be given nontenured teachers who are to be terminated. Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 79-1254.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>pellees concede that the school board, in dismissing Fisher, complied with the statute, and its judgment, therefore, must be afforded judicial deference \u201cso long as the board does not act unreasonably, arbitrarily, capriciously, or unlawfully.\u201d Smith v. Board of Educ., 365 F. 2d 770, 782 (8th Cir. 1966); <em>see </em>Bradford v. School Dist. No. 20, 364 F.2d 185, 189 (4th Cir. 1966); Johnson v. Branch, 364 F.2d 177, 180-181 (4th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1003, 87 S. Ct. 706, 17 L.Ed.2d 542 (1967); Brooks v.

[McEnteggart v. Cataldo, 451 F.2d 1109, 1111 (1st Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 408 U.S. 943, 92 S.Ct. 2878, 33 L.Ed.2d 767 (1972).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Drown v. Portsmouth School District, 451 F.2d 1106, 1108 (1st Cir. 1971); <em>see </em>Cook County College Teachers Union, Local 1600, AFT v. Byrd, 456 F.2d 882, 889 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 848, 93 S.Ct. 56, 34 L.Ed.2d 90 (1972); Freeman v.

Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, 239, 77 S.Ct. 752, 1 L.Ed.2d 796 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Thus, while a school board may legitimately inquire into the character and integrity of its teachers, <em>see </em>Beilan v. Board of Public Educ., 357 U.S. 399, 405, 78 S.Ct. 1317, 2 L.Ed.2d 1414 (1958); Adler v. Board of Educ., 342 U.S. 485, 493, 72 S.Ct. 380, 96 L.Ed. 517 (1952); Jenkyns v. Board of Educ., 111 U.S.App.D.C. 64, 294 F.2d 260, 261 (1961); James v. West Virginia Bd. of Regents, 322 F.Supp. 217, 228-230 (S.D.W.Va.1971), it must be certain that it does not arbitrarily or capriciously dismiss a teacher based on unsupported conclusions drawn from such inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">In seeking to justify the dismissal in this case, the school board argues that the evidence developed at the board hearing supported its finding Mrs. Fisher guilty of conduct unbecoming a teacher. In the board\u2019s view, \u201cthe inferences from her social behavior are that there was a strong potential of sexual misconduct.\u201d The board does not actually accuse Mrs. Fisher of immoral conduct but \u201cof social misbehavior that is not conducive to the maintenance of the integrity of the public school system.\u201d [Appellants\u2019 Brief at 12,13.]</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">But here, there is no proof of improper conduct. The only whit of evidence offered as support for the board\u2019s conclusion that Mrs. Fisher was guilty of unbecoming conduct was the fact that she had overnight guests. But the presence of these guests in her home provides no inkling beyond subtle implication and innuendo which would impugn Mrs. Fisher\u2019s morality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Idle speculation certainly does not provide a basis in fact for the board\u2019s conclusory inference that \u201cthere was strong potential of sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ual misconduct\u201d and that, therefore, Mrs. Fisher\u2019s activity was \u201csocial misbehavior that is not conducive to the maintenance of the integrity of the public school system.\u201d We agree with the district court that \u201cAt most, the evidence may be said to raise a question of Mrs. Fisher\u2019s good judgment in her personal affairs, when measured against an undefined standard which someone could suppose exists in a small town in Nebraska.\u201d <em>Fisher, supra, </em>346 F.Supp. at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The record, furthermore, contains considerable evidence tending to negate any inference of improper or immoral conduct by Mrs. Fisher. She did not attempt to conceal the presence of her house guests but instead openly inquired of the school board\u2019s secretary about motel accommodations in Tryon for these guests. She was advised to keep them in her home because other accommodations were so limited. She formally introduced one of her guests at school so that he might observe classes to satisfy college requirements. The local Avon lady, wife of the pastor of a church in Tryon, called at Mrs. Fisher\u2019s residence on a Saturday morning during the 1970-1971 school year. Although Mrs. Fisher was apparently awakened by the visit, she invited the pastor\u2019s wife into her apartment. A young man who had been an overnight guest was also present in the apartment, and the three drank coffee together.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Two citizens of Tryon called as witnesses for the school board were subpoenaed. Their testimony cast no aspersions upon Mrs. Fisher\u2019s character or her fitness as a teacher. No evidence of a community reaction against Mrs. Fisher has been presented, <em>compare with James, supra, </em>322 F.Supp. at 229 (student teacher denied student teaching assignment in circumstances of strong community reaction to published accounts of his radical activities), nor has she been shown incapable of maintaining discipline in her classes because of any inferences of impropriety drawn by her students or their parents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">This evidence, in the context of our review of the entire record, convinces us of the correctness of the district court\u2019s determination. The openness of the association, and the age differential between Mrs. Fisher and her guests, would seem to belie any inference of impropriety. The school board\u2019s inference of misconduct was arbitrary and capricious and therefore constituted an impermissible reason for terminating her employment, since the inference lacked any valid basis in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-5\">.
