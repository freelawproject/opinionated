We have carefully examined the record and conclude that each of these contentions is without merit. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-17\">The district court opinion fully sets forth the facts. See United States v. Miller, Crim. No. 71-229 (E.D.Pa. May 22, 1972). For our purposes, it is only necessary to briefly summarize the events that transpired prior to Miller\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-18\">Miller had been indicted along with six others on charges relating to the illegal transportation of a ton of marijuana. After his arrest, Miller offered to act as an informer for the Government. On November 5, 1971, he filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>a motion to dismiss the indictment against him, or, in the alternative, to permit him to enter a plea of guilty to a non-mandatory count of the indictment. His motion was premised on the claim that the Government breached its agreement to dismiss the charges against him. He alleged that the Government\u2019s promise had been made in return for his promise to act as an informer and to provide sufficient information that would lead to the successful prosecution of other persons involved in the sale and distribution of narcotics. The Government opposed this motion, claiming Miller failed to perform his side of the bargain. A series of evidentiary hearings were conducted beginning on November 11, 1971, and continuing until November 23, 1971, where Miller produced evidence in support of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Meanwhile, the trial, with Miller and four other defendants, commenced on November 15 and continued on a daily basis until December 3. However, on November 23, 1971, Miller, in the presence of the court and his counsel, agreed to withdraw his motion, with prejudice, and requested leave of the court to change his not guilty plea to Counts I and V of the indictment to guilty. The court accepted his plea. Sentencing was postponed from February 24, 1972, until May 4, 1972. On the day of sentencing, Miller presented the court with a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to F.R.Crim.P. 32(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Although Rule 32(d) does not establish a standard governing the withdrawal of a plea prior to sentencing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court may, in its discretion, permit a defendant to substitute a plea of not guilty \u201cif for any <em>reason </em>the granting of the privilege seems <em>fair and just. . . .\u201d </em>Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 224, 47 S.Ct. 582, 583, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927) (emphasis supplied); United States v. Young, 424 F.2d 1276, 1279 (3d Cir. 1970). However, this is not an absolute right to be made in a vacuum without reference to surrounding circumstances. See United States v. Stayton, 408 F.2d 559, 561 (3d Cir. 1969); <em>cf. </em>United States ex rel. Culbreath v. Rundle, 466 F.2d 730 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">Acceptance of a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and its determination will only be disturbed where it has abused its discretion, United States v. Stayton, <em>supra, </em>408 F.2d at 561. There has been no abuse of discretion in denying Miller\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The trial court properly considered the substantial prejudice that would have resulted to the Government if Miller\u2019s motion had been granted. It noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-13\">\u201cWitnesses for the government who were presented in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment and who were trial witnesses had been assembled to appear in Philadelphia from several far western and southwestern states. Testimony most damaging to the defendant and which resulted in guilty verdicts against co-defendants had been received in evidence prior to the defendant\u2019s change of plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-14\">\u201cFinally it appears appropriate to again point out that Miller changed his plea on November 23rd, 1971. He waited until the day of sentencing, a time factor of almost six months, before filing the motion under consideration.\u201d United States v. Miller, <em>supra, </em>at 7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-15\">Furthermore, Miller\u2019s request to withdraw his plea appears to be merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>a reassertion of the same allegations raised in his earlier motion. Miller withdrew that motion with prejudice on the advice of his counsel on the basis of a carefully worked out stipulation between him and the Government. Nevertheless, he claims that at the time he entered his plea of guilty to the mandatory count of the indictment, he relied upon United States v. Stephens, 449 F.2d 103 (9th Cir. 1971), which provided that one who was convicted before the effective date (May 1, 1971) of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) and (b) (The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970), but sentenced after such effective date, could receive less than the sentence provided under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d). 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a specified mandatory sentences of not less than five, nor more than twenty, years. The new Act does not prescribe any mandatory minimum sentence and permits the grant of probation. After Miller entered his plea and prior to March 11, 1972, the Second Circuit, in United States v. Fiotto, 454 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1972), and the First Circuit, in United States v. Bradley, 455 F.2d 1181 (1st Cir. 1972), aff\u2019d, 410 U.S. 605, 93 S.Ct. 1151, 35 L.Ed.2d 528 (1973), rejected the rationale of <em>Stephens.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Supreme Court in <em>Bradley </em>stated (410 U.S. 609, 93 S.Ct. 1155):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahc\">\u201cThe District Judge had no power to consider suspending petitioners\u2019 sentences or placing them on probation. . . . The mandatory minimum sentence of five years must therefore be imposed on offenders who violated the law before May 1,1971. And Congress specifically provided that \u00a7 4208(a) does not apply to any offense \u2018for which there is provided a mandatory penalty.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">We note that Judge Adams\u2019 opinion in United States v. Caldwell, 463 F.2d 590 (3d Cir. 1972), relied, in part, on the reasoning of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Bradley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">A change in the law subsequent to the entry of a guilty plea is not, in and of itself, a ground for its withdrawal, where the plea is knowingly entered on the advice of counsel. See McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 773-774, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970); Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 757, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970). While Miller may have harbored a wistful hope that he would be sentenced to less than five years, the court made abundantly clear prior to accepting the guilty pleas, as the following colloquy indicates, that he knowingly ran the risk of a substantial jail sentence and fine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-12\">\u201cQ. Are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty to the two counts ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-14\">\u201cQ. What is the maximum?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-15\">\u201cA. Thirty years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-16\">\u201cQ. What is the fine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-17\">\u201cA. Thirty-five thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201cQ. Knowing that you wish to enter the plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">\u201cQ. Has anybody brought any pressure to bear on you from the government?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">\u201cQ. Anyone made any promises of \u25a0leniency from the government or anywhere else ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\">\u201cQ. Anybody told you what I am going to do with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-11\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-12\">\u201cQ. Are you making this of your own volition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-13\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">(N.T. 56, Nov. 23, 1971)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-15\">Therefore, we are unable to say the district court abused its discretion when it denied Miller\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-16\">The defendant\u2019s other contention that Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969), required the trial court to advise him. of his privilege against self-incrimination is equally without merit. <em>McCarthy </em>did not require the courts to develop a litany, or fixed formula, when addressing a defendant; but, rather, requires the courts \u201cto inquire into the defendant\u2019s understanding of the nature of the charge against him, and whether the defendant possesses an understanding of the law in relation to the facts.\u201d United States v. Cantor, 469 F.2d 435, 438 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-17\">This court, in Davis v. United States, 470 F.2d 1128 (3d Cir. 1972), rejected a similar contention that a failure to specifically advise a defendant of his privilege against self-incrimination invalidated his plea. In <em>Davis </em>we held that \u201c. . . once the court has satisfied itself . . . that the guilty plea was made knowingly and voluntarily, an independent warning against self-inerimination becomes unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1132. The record makes clear that the defendant acted knowingly and voluntarily with full realization of the effect of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-19\">The district court judgment of conviction will be affirmed. However, the illegal three-year sentence on Count 1<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> will be vacated and the case will be remanded to the district court for sentencing on both Counts I and V in accordance with Bradley v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\">. Miller entered a plea of guilty to Counts I and V of the indictment. Count I charged him with conspiring to import marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a. Section 176a specified a mandatory sentence. See <em>infra. </em>Count V charged a conspiracy to transport marijuana in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4755(b), which does not contain a mandatory sentencing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-20\">Miller only sought to withdraw his plea to Count I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">. Rule 32(d) provides, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">\u201cA motion to withdraw a plea of guilty . . . may be made only before sentence is imposed or imposition of sentence is suspended. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b727-16\">. Compare a Rule 32(d) motion to withdraw a plea of guilty prior to sentence with the standard after sentence is imposed. \u201c. . . [T]o correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his plea.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\">. The Supreme Court in Bradley v. United States, <em>supra, </em>granted the petition for writ of certiorari in order to resolve the conflict between the First and Ninth Circuits. Our decision in United States v. Caldwell, 463 F.2d 590 (3d Cir. 1972), relying on the reasoning of the First Circuit opinion in <em>Bradley, </em>is in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and held that the penalties prescribed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4705(a) and 7237(b) and (d) are preserved for prosecutions commencing prior to May 1, 1971, even though the sentence was imposed after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">The issues discussed by the Court in <em>Bradley </em>were whether the trial court may impose a sentence of less than the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4705(a) (1964 ed.) and 7237(b) (1964 ed. and Supp. V), suspend the sentence, place the offender on probation, or specify that he be eligible for early parole, where that offender had been convicted of a federal narcotics offense committed before May 1, 1971, but sentenced after that date. See <em>id. </em>at 606 of 410 U.S. 93 S.Ct. 1151. The reasoning of <em>Bradley </em>establishes that the District Judge in this case had no choice but to impose sentence on Count I in accordance with the five-year mandatory minimum sentencing requirements of \u00a7 176a (see also 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(b) and (d)), which were in effect prior to May 1, 1971.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b729-27\">. Miller was sentenced on May 4, 1972, on Count I to three years\u2019 imprisonment. The sentence of three years under Count I does not conform with our decision in <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>or the recent Supreme Court decision in <em>Bradley, supra. </em>See note 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
