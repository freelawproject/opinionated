The court ruled it would only admit the most recent conviction \u2014 for assault with intent to commit robbery in 1968. The trial judge thus appears to have exercised his discretion, foreclosing any challenge to the 1970 amendments to the <em>Luck </em>statute in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defense counsel seems to have acquiesced in the trial court\u2019s decision \u2014 there was no mention of a <em>Luck </em>hearing nor argument for the judge to exercise his discretion to exclude the most recent conviction as well. This court has repeatedly held that the burden is on defense counsel to invoke <em>Luck </em>and to show why the court should exercise its discretion to render a prior conviction unavailable for impeachment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The failure of the court to hold a <em>Luck </em>hearing is therefore not grounds for reversal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">Appellant notes that there is substantial indication that defendants with court-appointed lawyers fare far worse than those with retained attorneys.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As he points out, an indigent\u2019s advocacy alternatives are limited and the efforts of his appointed counsel are often hampered by institutional pressures.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, appellant asserts, sole reliance on the adversary system to protect the defendant\u2019s rights is unrealistic. Appellant would have us take these facts into consideration in applying the plain error rule when a court appointed counsel has failed to register an objection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant urges that these con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>siderations should also apply to ameliorate the burden on counsel to invoke the <em>Luck </em>rule. But we think it would be unwise to act on that suggestion now.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\"> There is nothing in the record before us to indicate whether counsel\u2019s failure to ask for a <em>Luck </em>hearing was an informed tactical choice or a decision undertaken out of ignorance of the relevant law<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or indifference to her client\u2019s interests. Although appellant\u2019s counsel on appeal (who is not trial counsel) disclaims reliance on ineffectiveness of counsel, that issue necessarily lurks in the suggestion that the defendant should not be bound by the failures of his trial attorney. This court has held, however, that we will not resolve the matter of the effectiveness of trial counsel where, as here the record is inadequate for the purpose of deciding whether counsel\u2019s challenged decision was a deliberate, knowing and rational tactical choice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellant is not deprived of a remedy for a meritorious claim; he may seek to raise the issue of ineffectiveness and support his claim with evidence <em>dehors </em>the record either on a timely motion for a new trial<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or on collateral attack.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-15\">.

Appellant also asserts as error the improper admission of evidence of the factual circumstances of his arrest and the prosecutor\u2019s discussion of the legal concept of possession in his summation.
