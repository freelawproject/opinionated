We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">No. 8906<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> involves the mark PACOL<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sought to be registered for \u201cresearch, development, evaluation, market and economic studies, consultation, design, engineering, and technical services in connection with a process for the dehydrogenation of normal paraffins\u201d in Class 100 and for \u201cconstruction, installation. operation and servicing for others of a process for the dehydrogenation of normal paraffins\u201d in class 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-22\">No. 8933<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> involves the mark PENEX<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sought to be registered for \u201cresearch, development, evaluation, market and economic studies, consultation, design engineering and technical services for others in connection with an isomerization process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-23\">The applicant, Universal Oil Products Company, is the same in each case and the evidence it supplied to support the applications is in large part identical. The same legal issues are present in the two appeals. The board decision in PENEX was rendered two months after the decision in PACOL and largely relies thereon for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-24\">Refusal of registration for both marks was on the ground that the specimens did not evidence use thereof to identify <em>the services </em>named in the applications. The specimens filed demonstrate that PACOL is used by appellant as the name of a <em>process </em>for converting n-paraffins to corresponding n-olefins by direct catalytic dehydrogenation and that PENEX is used as the name of a <em>process </em>for the continuous catalytic isomerization of normal pentane and hexane and mixtures thereof. In each case one specimen is a 12-page brochure entitled \u201cUOP Processing Guide\u201d which describes briefly the PACOL and PENEX processes as well as eleven other processes of \u201cUOP.\u201d Nowhere in this brochure, however, is there a reference to PACOL or PENEX services. The back page of the brochure is headed \u201cWHAT\u2019S YOUR PROBLEM?\u201d and contains a column of description under the subheading \u201cUOP\u2019s engineering, technical and marketing services are available to help you find the answer.\u201d There is no question but that it shows appellant to be in the business of rendering such services. Particularly relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>on are the statement in the subheading, just quoted, and the statements thereunder that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">UOP is equipped to design and build any plant incorporating any of its processes and to train refinery personnel for its operation and maintenance. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">Additionally, UOP offers economic, marketing, and management services to the petroleum industry \u2014 * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The essence of the argument in these appeals is that appellant would have us rule that the use of the marks sought to be registered on processes which, presumably, it licenses others to use, coupled with its rendition of services, constitutes use of PACOL and PENEX as service marks under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Section 3 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1053) provides for the registration of \u201cservice marks.\u201d Section 45 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127) defines \u201cservice mark\u201d as \u201ca mark used in the sale or advertising of services to identify the services of one person and distinguish them from the services of others.\u201d The Patent Office position is that, so far as the records in these appeals show,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> neither PACOL nor PENEX has been so used. We see no error in that conclusion. The requirement that a mark must be \u201cused in the sale or advertising of services\u201d to be registered as a service mark is clear and specific. We think it is not met by evidence which only shows use of the mark as the name of a <em>process </em>and that the company is in the business of rendering services generally, even though the advertising of the services appears in the same brochure in which the name of the process is used. The minimum requirement is some direct association between the offer of <em>services </em>and the mark sought to be registered therefor. See Ex parte Phillips Petroleum Co., 100 USPQ 25 (Com\u2019r. Pats.1953). There is no evidence of such association before us. The advertising of the services is under no mark at all and is in a brochure offering to license or install processes bearing a dozen or more different names.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">Appellant would have us hold that \u201cthe <em>association </em>of services with a name of a process\" is sufficient to warrant registration of that name as a service mark. The argument starts from the premise that PACOL and PENEX <em>are </em>process names rather than marks associated with services. The proposition put to us is that the names of processes ought to be registrable as \u201cservice marks\u201d under the Lanham Act. The tenuous reasoning in support of this proposition is based on dictum in In re Radio Corporation of America, 205 F.2d 180, 40 CCPA 1025 (1953), where this court, in discussing registration of the slogan \u201cThe Music You Want When You Want It,\u201d said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-13\">We believe it equally true that Congress intended a service mark to function in such a fashion as to identify and distinguish those things of an intangible nature, such as services, in contradistinction to the protection already provided for the marks affixed to those things of a tangible nature such as goods and products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">From this statement appellant argues that service mark registration was set up \u201cnot for services alone, but for \u2018intangible things\u2019,\u201d that a process is an intangible thing, therefore, a mark or name used for a process should be registrable as a service mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">We reject this argument. Whatever the court in the <em>Radio Corporation </em>opinion may have intended, we are sure it was not that every mark used in connection with an intangible is registrable as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>a service mark. No such question was under consideration and the next sentence of the opinion is, \u201cClearly had Congress intended service marks to apply to <em>goods or products, </em>we believe it would have so stated.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) The discussion was whether the slogan was being used on a radio program or to promote the sale of RCA Victor Red Seal Records. The court held it was being used to promote the sale of records \u2014 tangible things \u2014 and was therefore not registrable as a service mark and affirmed the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">It is clear enough to us that a \u201cprocess,\u201d per se, is not a \u201cservice.\u201d A process can be carried out for oneself or for others; it can be licensed to others to carry out for themselves, which appears to be what UOP does. Carrying out a process for others could be rendering a service as, for example, operating a laundry. But that is not the kind of thing UOP does. It helps others to carry out processes but in so doing or in advertising its willingness to do so in the specimens of record it has not associated PACOL or PENEX with its services. Direct association is the minimum it must show.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The decisions of the board in both appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-17\">.

Appellant\u2019s brief states that in another application to register PENEX as a service mark a specimen therein includes the statement \u201cPenex and Platforming engineering, technical, and marketing services are available upon request,\u201d and that the application was approved. The Patent .Office brief confirms that registration No. 940,145 was issued thereon on Aug. 1, 1972. The solicitor says this merely \u201chighlights the deficiency in the cases on appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
