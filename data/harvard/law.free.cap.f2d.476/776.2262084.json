He asserts here that the district court erred in regard to jury selection, jury instructions, and sentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-20\">The circumstances of the two sales are essentially the same. The police employed one Carlos Encarnaci\u00f3n to purchase the drugs. According to the testimony of the police and Encarnaci\u00f3n, on October 14, 1971, and again on October 19, 1971, the police searched Encarnaci\u00f3n, gave him money, and told him to buy drugs from defendant. Encarnaci\u00f3n sought out defendant and, as he stated, purchased heroin from him. Then Encarnaci\u00f3n returned to the police, who searched him and found in his possession heroin but no money. On both occasions the police officers had trailed Encarnaci\u00f3n. On October 14 they witnessed an exchange between Encarnaci\u00f3n and defendant. On October 19, however, they saw only that Encarnaci\u00f3n and defendant entered an apartment house together; the police officers did not observe the alleged sale itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-21\"> Encarnaci\u00f3n was similarly employed to obtain evidence against a number of other suspected drug pushers. Four of these individuals were brought to trial before defendant Hendricks was, and, as a result, the jury array from which defendant\u2019s jury was selected contained jurors who had sat on some of such earlier cases and had heard Encarnaci\u00f3n testify during such cases. Defendant challenged the entire array,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, after that challenge was rejected, requested that the district court ask certain questions designed to elicit whether jurors who had sat on such earlier cases had formed an impression about the credibility of Encarnaci\u00f3n or of the police officers involved in defendant\u2019s case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court declined to ask the requested questions, but did determine which jurors had sat on such earlier cases and did inquire of these persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>whether they were able to confine themselves solely to the evidence which would be presented.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court denied defendant\u2019s motion to strike such jurors for cause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">While we acknowledge that the credibility of Encarnacion\u2019s testimony was crucial to this case, we adhere to the view that the mere fact that a juror has sat on a prior case involving similar issues and some of the same witnesses does not, absent some showing of resulting prejudice, disqualify the juror. See Government of Virgin Islands v. Williams, 476 F.2d 771 (3d Cir.1973). We note that of the nine jurors who had sat on such earlier cases, eight had sat on one such case and one had sat on two such cases. Consequently, we reject defendant\u2019s claim that the district court erred in the above-mentioned rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">Defendant requested two instructions involving the credibility of Encarnaci\u00f3n, one relating to his being a drug addict<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the other to his being paid by the Government.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court refused to give the former on the ground that there was no evidence in the record to show that Encarnaci\u00f3n was an addict as of the time of the trial, February 15, 1972. The district court did give the latter, but with significant modification.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant took exception to the refusal to give the proffered instruction on addicts,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>make any objection to the instructions eventually given by the court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">It is undisputed that, <em>inter alia, </em>Encarnaci\u00f3n was an addict at the time he allegedly bought drugs from defendant,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that he was to be paid $2,000 by the Government for obtaining evidence and then testifying against from 10 to 20 persons, that he had been convicted of forgery and was still subject to sentencing for this conviction, and that he had pending against him a number of felony charges. The questions before this court are whether, under these circumstances, the district court should have given defendant\u2019s instruction that \u201ca drug addict is inherently a perjurer\u201d and, if not, whether the district court\u2019s instructions were plain error, <em>see </em>F.R. Crim.P. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Defendant took this \u201cinherently a perjurer\u201d language from Fletcher v. United States, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 306, 158 F.2d 321, 322 (1946). While the court-in <em>Fletcher </em>was concerned with the reliability of an addict-informer, the court\u2019s decision was to allow such testimony but to require that a cautionary instruction be given. To suggest that the cautionary instruction should contain the words \u201cinherently a perjurer\u201d is to misread <em>Fletcher, </em>for such an instruction would in effect make the testimony incompetent altogether. The district court was correct in not giving the proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">One recent case has held outright that it is plain error for a district court not to instruct the jury <em>sua sponte </em>about the unreliability of an addict-informer\u2019s testimony when that testimony is corroborated only in minor details.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> United States v. Griffin, 382 F.2d 823 (6th Cir. 1967). <em>Griffin, </em>however, is easily distinguishable on its facts. In <em>Griffin </em>there were two co-defendants, Griffin and a woman. The woman made two sales to an addict-informer; Griffin was not present at the first sale and was only seen in the vicinity of the second. While there was corroboration by police officers as to the woman\u2019s guilt, only the word of the addict-informer connected Griffin with the crimes. In the present case, on the other hand, police witnessed one transaction and provided significant corroboration for Encarnacion\u2019s testimony about the other transaction, even though they did not witness the sale itself. Moreover, the district court did instruct the jury that because Encarnaci\u00f3n was an informer his testimony had to \u201cbe scrutinized with care and received with caution.\u201d In these circumstances, we decline to hold that there was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">We do not, however, mean to suggest that, if it is requested, a special cautionary instruction is not proper when a witness is in the Government\u2019s pay and either is an addict at the time of trial or was an addict at the time of the events concerning which testimony has been given. Similar scrutiny must be used in weighing the testimony of a present or former addict who recognizes, or may recognize, the possibility of being rewarded by the Government. Examples of possible rewards are the dropping of charges presently pending against the witness and the recommending of a lighter sentence for a crime of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the witness has already been convicted. An instruction would be appropriate whether or not it is shown that the Government intends to reward the witness. It would be especially useful when the testimony of such a witness is uncorroborated as to a material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">While the precise formulation of the instruction is up to the trial court,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it should set out the rationale for examining the testimony of such a witness with special caution. As United States v. Kinnard, 150 U.S.App.D.C. 386, 465 F.2d 566, 570-571 (1972), points out, an addict-informer faces the immediate threat of being jailed and thereby kept from access to the drugs to which he is addicted, as well as the prospect of a long term prison sentence and possible retaliation from various persons in the drug trade. These factors substantially increase the danger that the addict-informer may color his testimony so as to place guilt on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Defendant Hendricks\u2019 final contention is that the sentence he received \u2014two consecutive terms of ten-to-fifteen years \u2014 was excessive. Although this is a very long sentence, it is within the statutory limits, and, therefore, not subject to review here. Government of Virgin Islands v. Venzen, 424 F.2d 521 (3d Cir. 1970). <em>See </em>Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958); United States v. Frank, 245 F.2d 284, 288 (3d Cir. 1957). <em>Cf. generally </em>ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice (Approved 1968), Standards Relating to Appellate Review of Sentences, including Appendix 3, pp. 86-90. We note, however, that defendant may apply under F.R.Crim.P. 35 for a reduction of sentence after the issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"ArN\">The March 10, 1972, judgment and commitment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-17\">. Motion of February 9, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-22\">. Supplemental Proposed Questions to the Jury on Voir Dire, questions Nos. 28-33, filed February 9, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b836-5\">. The judge addressed the jury as a group. At various times during the court\u2019s questioning of the group, jurors responded. When the district court asked the jurors if they would be prejudiced because the defendant was charged with a narcotics violation, one juror raised his hand and, when questioned, said he would be prejudiced in such a case. AVhen the jurors were asked if they knew Encarnaci\u00f3n, one raised her hand and stated that she was his cousin.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The district court began its discussion of the earlier cases in which Encarnaci\u00f3n had testified by asking the jurors who sat on Government of the Virgin Islands v. Ventura to identify themselves. The court then asked, as a group, the five who raised their hands whether they would be able to \u201cjudge the credibility of the witnesses entirely upon the evidence adduced at this trial? \u201d Transcript of Voir Dire at 17. No juror indicated any inability to do so. The district court repeated this procedure for each of the other three such cases. Transcript of voir dire at 17-22. The district court then addressed all such jurors together, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">\u201cYou heard the testimony of the witnesses in those cases and you obviously formed some impression as to their credibility in those cases; would you be able to form an opinion as to the credibility of those same witnesses in this case based entirely upon their testimony in this case even to the point where you would change your opinion as to their credibility which you had in the prior case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-9\">\u201c(No response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-10\">\u201cIs there anyone who would not be able to do so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-13\">\u201c(No response.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABA\"><em>Id. </em>at 24.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-14\">In light of these extended inquiries, we believe that the voir dire was adequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-15\">AVe note that, under appropriate circumstances, it may be desirable for the district court, in conducting a voir dire examination of jurors, to require an audible response to important questions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b836-16\">. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27. Defendant apparently exhausted all peremptory challenges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b836-17\">. \u201cI instruct you that a drug addict is inherently a perjurer where his own interests are concerned and therefore the testimony of a drug addict should be carefully scrutinized and received with caution.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Proposed Jury Instructions, filed January 7, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b836-18\">. \u201cI instruct you that the testimony of a paid informer must be scrutinized with care and received with caution. This is because there is a serious question of credibility inherent in the use of such a witness by the government and his usefulness is dependent wholly upon his ability to make out a case in favor of the government.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b836-19\">. \u201cAVe have a rule that the testimony of an informer must be scrutinized with care and received with caution. And it is within your exclusive province to determine the weight to be given the testimony of an informer.\u201d N.T. 2.124. The court deleted the second sentence of defendant\u2019s proposed instruction quoted in the preceding footnote because the court found that Encarnaci\u00f3n was to be paid whether or not convictions were obtained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b836-20\">.

Another case, United States v. Kinnard, 150 U.S.App.D.C. 386, 465 F.2d 560 (1972), disregarded defendants\u2019 failure to object to the instructions given, <em>see id. </em>at 583 (Adams, J., dissenting). However, the holding of <em>Kinnard </em>is that a trial court must give a cautionary instruction in these circumstances, <em>tut only upon request.. </em>Hence, the failure to give such an instruction could not be plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b838-26\">. <em>See </em>United States v.
