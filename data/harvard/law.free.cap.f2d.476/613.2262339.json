This Court is urged to hold that petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights were violated and that error, not harmless in nature, was committed, when at his state trial, the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>commented during his summation to the jury the petitioner consulted an attorney the day after the alleged crime was committed and suggested that from this the jury should question the innocence of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Petitioner, Isiah Macon, was convicted in state court of manslaughter and sentenced to serve a term of not less than seven nor more than ten years. It appears that petitioner and one Abrahms had been in a minor traffic accident in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The deceased, Ralph Sasso, arrived at the scene of the accident and became' involved in the discussion between Macon and Abrahms. Both Sasso and Macon had been drinking that evening. During the ensuing altercation Sasso was killed by Macon\u2019s gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The details of the events leading up to Sasso\u2019s death are in dispute. The state\u2019s evidence indicates that when, in the course of the argument, Sasso placed his hand on Macon\u2019s shoulder, Macon stepped back, drew a gun, shot Sasso twice, and then drove away with friends. Petitioner\u2019s version of the events indicates that Sasso interfered in a racially abusive and aggressive manner, punched Macon twice, assaulted Macon with the help of friends, and was shot by Macon\u2019s gun, which was fired accidentally by Macon during the course of the struggle.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">It is uncontradicted that after the incident, Macon and his friends drove away and Macon instructed them to give no statements and to take no action until he had consulted his attorney. Macon testified that, alone, he then drove aimlessly around, threw the gun out the car window, parked his car in a place he could not recall, walked home, put his blood-stained shirt away, went to bed, and the next morning telephoned his lawyer and was later arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In view of the different accounts of what had happened at the time of the shooting, it thus became crucial for the jury to determine which characterization of the facts was true, the state\u2019s or Macon\u2019s. If the jury credited the state\u2019s evidence, it could very well have brought in a verdict of murder. On the other hand, a belief in petitioner\u2019s testimony and other defense evidence might have supported the view that Sasso\u2019s death was either accidental or the result of Macon\u2019s attempt to repel aggression.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">During his summation to the jury, the prosecutor commented upon Macon\u2019s actions following the shooting incident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-14\">\u201cThen what does he do? He drives along and can\u2019t tell us where. The gun goes out the window. An act of innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-15\">\u201cThe car is left somewhere and he doesn\u2019t remember where. An act of innocence ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-16\">\u201cHe goes home and puts the shirt down in the chest, a torn shirt. Then he goes to bed. He says he had trouble sleeping. He gets up the next morning and lo and behold, what does he do? He calls his lawyer. <em>These are acts of innocence? </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-17\">\u201cI say, ladies and gentlemen, his story is implausible, impossible and you can judge by his own <em>conduct, </em>unbelievable.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-18\">The defendant made no objection to the comment and did not request the trial judge to offer any instruction to the jury regarding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-19\">Macon\u2019s appeal of his manslaughter conviction to the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court was rejected. The conviction was later affirmed by the New Jersey Supreme Court, State v. Macon, 57 N.J. 325, 273 A.2d 1 (1971), which lowered his term of incarceration from seven to ten years to two to seven years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Having exhausted his state remedies, Macon sought federal habeas corpus relief, asserting that the prosecutor\u2019s statement about his call to a lawyer violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court denied the writ, holding that, although constitutional error was committed, \u201cthe effect on the trial was not sufficiently prejudicial as to require the granting of petitioner\u2019s request for the Writ.\u201d 336 F.Supp. at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">It should be noted that petitioner does not argue that he was denied counsel or that his defense was presented by a lawyer of less than adequate ability. Rather, Macon claims that the prosecutor\u2019s statement concerning his telephone call to counsel sought, or at least may reasonably be expected to have tended, to raise in the minds of the jurors an inference of guilt and, as a result, penalized him for the exercise of his constitutional right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">New cases deal directly with the question whether a prosecutor\u2019s comment to the jury concerning a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to counsel is constitutional error. The district court concluded that Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), presented a situation sufficiently analogous to require recognition that constitutional error was committed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In <em>Griffin, </em>the prosecutor stressed the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand and urged upon the jury the inference that such failure demonstrated the defendant\u2019s inability to deny his guilt. Holding such prosecutorial comment violative of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the Supreme Court deemed the statement \u201ca penalty imposed by the courts for exercising a constitutional privilege. It cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.\u201d 380 U.S. at 614, 85 S.Ct. at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">The <em>Griffin </em>Court focused its inquiry upon whether the petitioner had been .\u201ccompelled . . . to be a witness against himself,\u201d U.S.Const. Amend. V, whereas in the present case, the relevant constitutional provision called into question is the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. For the purpose of the \u201cpenalty\u201d analysis, however, we perceive little, if any, valid distinction between the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to counsel. It can be argued, with equal vigor and logical support, as to. either the <em>Griffin </em>situation or the present case, that a prosecutor\u2019s comment seeking to raise in the jurors\u2019 minds an inference of guilt from the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected conduct constitutes a \u201cpenalty\u201d on the free exercise of a constitutional right.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">If we were writing on- a tabula rasa, the \u201cpenalty\u201d argument perhaps could be examined from different viewpoints. One mode of analysis would focus upon the <em>person </em>asserting that his rights have been \u201cpenalized\u201d and determine whether he has been adversely affected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>state\u2019s use of his constitutionally protected conduct. An alternative analysis would focus upon the particular constitutional <em>right </em>in question and determine whether, and if so to what extent, the state\u2019s use of constitutionally protected conduct has or will \u201cburden\u201d the right, i. e., deter the defendant or others from engaging in the particular constitutionally protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The <em>Griffin </em>majority has accepted the former analysis, at least in the criminal context. In contradistinction to the \u201cabsolutist\u201d approach to the \u201cpenalty\u201d question employed by Justice Douglas in <em>Griffin, </em>Justice Stewart, in a dissenting opinion in <em>Griffin, </em>urged utilizing an approach that would examine \u201cthe concept of compulsion [within] reasonable bounds,\u201d 380 U.S. at 620, 85 S.Ct. at 1236, and would measure the advantages and disadvantages of a rule permitting the prosecutor or judge to comment upon a defendant\u2019s silence at trial. His view, however, was not accepted by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">It would appear that the \u201cabsolutist\u201d <em>Griffin </em>approach to the \u201cpenalty\u201d argument has been diluted somewhat in other contexts. <em>See </em>Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 634, 638 n. 21, 89 S. Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969) (right to travel interstate); Walker v. Yucht, 352 F.Supp. 85 (D.Dela., filed Dec. 6, 1972) (3-judge court). Whatever the proper \u201cpenalty\u201d approach may be under different circumstances, however, <em>Griffin </em>holds broadly that, at least in the criminal context, the relevant question is whether the particular <em>defendant </em>has been <em>harmed </em>by the state\u2019s use of the fact that he engaged in constitutionally protected conduct, not whether, for the particular defendant or for persons generally, the state\u2019s reference to such aetivity has or will <em>burden </em>the exercise of the constitutional <em>right. </em>This particular \u201cpenalty\u201d analysis would appear to apply equally to the present case as to the <em>Griffin </em>situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">Thus we are constrained to agree with the district court that the prosecutor\u2019s comment to the jury was constitutional error. However, we are unable to conclude, as the district court did, that such error was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). The Supreme Court has stated that an error of constitutional dimension is not harmless if \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility that [it] might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 230, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963). The state must \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u201d <em>Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. at 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">In the present case, because critical portions of the evidence were disputed, the credibility of the petitioner as a witness was a central issue. This is not a situation where the case against the petitioner was otherwise \u201cso overwhelming\u201d that the constitutional error did not, beyond a reasonable doubt, contribute to the conviction. <em>Cf. </em>Milton v. Wainwright, 407 U.S. 371, 92 S.Ct. 2174, 33 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972); Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969). The prosecutor\u2019s comment concerning Macon\u2019s consultation with counsel the day after the shooting incident would appear to have been directed to, and may have had the effect of, raising in the jurors\u2019 minds the inference that petitioner was, or at least believed himself to be, guilty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Such an inference might certainly tend to cause the jury to disbelieve Macon\u2019s version of the story. Under these circumstances, the possibility of prejudicial impact is present and we, therefore, are unable to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was <em>\u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">We recognize that in reversing the district court\u2019s harmless error ground for decision this Court may be thought to be simply substituting its subjective judgment for that of the district court and the state courts. Thus, the New Jersey Supreme Court, in a well-reasoned and articulate opinion by Chief Justice Weintraub, concluded, much like the district court judge, that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was \u201cthoroughly harmless\u201d because \u201cthe point defendant attributes to the prosecutor was indeed pointless and a jury would readily understand this to be so. Nor does the result of the trial even faintly suggest harm. Defendant fared as well as he could have hoped.\u201d 57 N.J. at 335, 273 A.2d at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">While the error may not have contributed to petitioner\u2019s conviction, this Court is simply unable to conclude, on the basis of an independent examination of the record, that \u201cthere is [not] a reasonable possibility that [it] might have contributed to the conviction,\u201d and this is the test mandated by the Supreme Court in Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 230, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963). Frequently, appellate courts are called upon, in performing an appropriate reviewing function, to determine whether any error that has been committed may be adjudged \u201charmless.\u201d So often, this is an assignment not free from deep concern. But because it is required, we must resolutely and objectively discharge it, whatever our own personal predilections may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed, and the case remanded to the district court for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-31\">. United States ex rel. Macon v. Yeager, 336 F.Supp. 69 (D.N.J.1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">. In addition to covering at some length the constitutional right and harmless error issues raised in the present appeal, <em>infra, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court discussed the point that by failing to object and to request a disapproving instruction concerning the prosecutor\u2019s comment, Macon waived his right to claim error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>57 N.J. at 333-335, 273 A.2d 1. Although the state has an interest in treating errors raised at trial differently from those not timely challenged, <em>see </em>Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 452, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965), federal courts considering habeas corpus petitions are not bound by the state procedural rule and must permit a petitioner to raise constitutional issues for the first time in the federal proceeding so long as state procedures have not been deliberately bypassed. <em>See, e. </em>g., Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963). There is nothing in the record to indicate that any deliberate bypass occurred in this case. Accordingly, there is no warrant for remanding the cause to the district court to deal with this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-16\">. <em>See </em>Baker v.
