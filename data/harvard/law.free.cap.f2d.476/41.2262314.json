The two appeals were separately filed and briefed but were argued together and have been consolidated in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-18\">On February 18, 1971, Police Detective Childers received information from an informant that a whiskey still was being operated in the north section of Memphis, Tennessee. Accompanying the informant to the still site, Detective Childers found that the still was located in an open field which was filled with junk cars, garbage and trash. The cooker, covered with garbage and debris, was concealed in a hole in which a fire had been burning. Concealed beneath the trash and garbage was a cave about three feet high and four feet wide. Inside the cave was a large pot made of two 55-gallon drums welded together, eight barrels, some plywood, a tarpaulin and some boxes. No signs were posted around the area designating it as a distillery that was registered with the United States Treasury Department. It was estimated that the still had been in operation for approximately two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-19\">Having located the still, a surveillance of the still site was begun on February 18, 1971. On the evening of February 23 it was determined that the still was in operation and the officers took their various positions in connection with the surveillance. Some of them remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>in automobiles on Levee Road, which ran alongside the dump, and two agents concealed themselves in the dump about 25 yards from the still. At approximately 7:00 or 7:30 p. m. Appellants Stanford and Becton were seen walking eastwardly on Levee Road. They left the road \u00e1nd walked through the dump, stopping approximately 60 yards from the position of the two agents and approximately 85 yards from the still. They crouched down, got up, walked back onto Levee Road and began walking along the road. The agent in charge of the operation ordered by radio the other officers in the vicinity to stop them and the officers stationed in automobiles stopped and arrested Appellants. The officers testified that both smelled of wood-smoke, Stanford\u2019s right pant leg was wet from the knee down and he had mash residue on his trousers, and both had mud on their shoes. Becton made a statement to the effect that he had been arrested for liquor violations before \u201cbut not for a little toy like that little thing down there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">After the arrest, the still was observed by the agents and found to be in operation. A plaster cast of a footprint located about twenty paces <em>from </em>the still site was found to match Stanford\u2019s boot. Also, soil samples taken from the area around the still site were found to match soil taken from both Appellants\u2019 boots. Stanford\u2019s motion to suppress, based on a lack of probable cause for his arrest, was denied by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Appellants attack the validity of their arrests and the seizure of their clothing and contend that the District Court improperly denied their motions of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to sustain their conviction. Because we find that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions we find it unnecessary to consider the validity of the arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">In considering whether the evidence is insufficient to support a judgment of conviction, an appellate court will reverse the judgment only if it is not supported by substantial and competent evidence. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), rehearing denied, 315 U.S. 827, 62 S.Ct. 629, 86 L.Ed. 1222. \u201cIn making such a determination the Court must take that view of the evidence with inferences reasonably and justifiably to be drawn therefrom most favorable to the Government, without weighing the evidence or determining the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d United States v. Conti, 339 F.2d 10, 13 (6th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Having carefully reviewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we do not find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>it is sufficient to sustain Appellants\u2019 convictions. Neither Appellant was seen closer than 75 to 85 yards from the still. Neither had been seen in the area during the five previous days of surveillance. While evidence of footprints and soil samples was introduced, there was no evidence from which could be inferred Appellants\u2019 presence at the still during its operation. Presence at the still site, without more, is not sufficient to support a conviction for illegal possession and control of distilling apparatus. United States v. Romano, 382 U.S. 136, 86 S.Ct. 279, 15 L.Ed.2d 210 (1965); Bozza v. United States, 330 U.S. 160, 67 S.Ct. 645, 91 L.Ed. 818 (1947). In both <em>Romano </em>and <em>Bozza </em>the defendant was seen at the site of the still, inside a private building. Here, Appellants were seen in a field used as a public dump, some 85 yards away from the still. The statutes relating to the operation of an illegal still require proof of the specific offense charged. As the Supreme Court said in Bozza v. United States, <em>supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">\u201cThe Internal Revenue statutes have broken down the various steps and phases of a continuous illicit distilling business and made each of them a separate offense. Thus, these statutes have clearly carved out the conduct of making mash as a separate offense, thereby distinguishing it from the other offenses involving other steps and phases of the distilling business. Consequently, testimony to prove this separate offense of making mash must point directly to conduct within the narrow margins which the statute alone defines. One who neither engages in the conduct specifically prohibited, nor aids and abets it, does not violate the section which prohibits it.\u201d 330 U.S. at 163, 67 S.Ct. at 647.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Appellants were charged with the specific acts of possession, making and fermenting of mash, and working in an illegal distillery. The evidence does not sustain the commission of any of these specific offenses by the Appellants. The Government failed to show that Appellants committed an act specifically proscribed by the statutes under which they were charged. Their convictions must be reversed. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court denying Appellants\u2019 motions for acquittal is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\">.

The United States, in its brief, has summarized the evidence in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">\u201cThe record shows that Detective Childers received information on February 18, 1971, that a whiskey still was being operated east of Thomas Street, north of Levee Road, on the south side of the Wolf River, in Memphis, Tennessee. A surveillance was set up on that date at the still site at 7:00 p. m. on February 28, 1971. The defendant and Joe Louis Becton were seen approaching the still site from Levee Road. The defendant and Joe Louis Becton dropped down in the tall grass upon noticing that the whiskey still was under surveillance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">\u201cThe Defendant and Joe Louis Becton were fifty yards from the point where Special Agents Robert W. St. John and Jerry W. Robinson were positioned near the whiskey still. The Defendant and Joe Louis Becton then changed their direction and headed south toward Levee Road where they were arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-15\">\u201cDetective Childers testified that as he approached the Defendant John Stanford he noticed his right pants leg was wet from the knee down and he smelled the unmistakable odor of wood smoke on the Defendant John Stanford and Joe Louis Becton. 1-Ie further testified that he saw mash on the front of John Stanford\u2019s clothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-16\">\u201cThe whiskey still was observed that night and was found to be in operation and a fire was underneath the still cooking pot. There was a washtub with several gallons of whiskey in it. The smoke pipe that had been placed inside the cave was taken out and it was in the outside of the cave and smoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>was protruding out of the stack. The tops liad been taken off the barrels and they were open. There was a drip bucket underneath tire thumper coil and the drip bucket was almost full of whiskey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201cA plaster of paris cast was taken of the footprints of the Defendant John Stanford twenty paces from the whiskey still.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">\u201cThe soil sample taken from the boots of the Defendant John Stanford was the same that was found in the bootprints of the Defendant John Stanford twenty paces from the still site. The soil removed from Defendant John Stanford\u2019s pants leg was the samo soil that was taken from his bootprint at the still site. The soil taken from inside the cave was the same soil that was taken from John Stanford\u2019s boots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-20\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s pants contained mash residue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-21\">\u201cThe soil removed from the shoes of Joe Louis Becton was the same soil as that from the cooker inside the cave.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
