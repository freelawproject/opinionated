After its first plan was rejected, the School Board submitted a modified plan, which was approved by the Attorney General. The district court, faced with impending School Board elections, denied each party\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiff\u2019s request for a trial, but did allow the parties tefi days to submit depositions on the merits. Based largely on these depositions, the district court, 347 F.Supp. 132, concluded that the plaintiffs had not satisfied their burden of proof, upheld the plan against the constitutional challenge, and ordered its immediate implementation. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">As this court stated in Thompson v. Madison County Board of Education, 5 Cir., 1973, 476 F.2d 676:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-10\">Due process mandates that a judicial proceeding give the affected parties an opportunity to be heard on the allegations asserted in the complaint and to present evidence and argument on the contested facts and legal issues framed by the answer to the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">This did not occur in the court below. The district court, in an attempt to avoid undue interference with the upcoming elections, entered its judgment without affording the parties \u201ca full and fair trial on the claims properly before the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678. We thus must return this case to the district court so that the plaintiffs may have an adequate opportunity to develop their case in accordance with the principles stated in <em>Madison County School Board, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">With the case in this posture it would, of course, be inappropriate for us to indicate our views on the constitutionality <em>vel non </em>of the School Board\u2019s reapportionment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-7\">. The plaintiffs also challenged the apportionment of the parish Police Jury. This aspect of the case below was settled by a consent decree after the Police Jury\u2019s reapportionment plan was approved by the Attorney General of the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
