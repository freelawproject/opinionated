Appellant alleged that she suffered physical and emotional injuries requiring hospitalization, seeking actual and punitive damages.' She and her husband joined common law tort violations in separate counts with this \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-10\">Appellants subsequently were allowed to dismiss the suit without prejudice with respect to Noffke, whom they believed to be \u201cjudgment proof\u201d and to have been discharged by the Board of Police Commissioners. This appeal is from a dismissal under Rule 12(b) (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of the \u00a7 1983 claim against the remaining defendants, who are: The five members of the Board of Police Commissioners of the Kansas City Police Department; Clarence M. Kelley, the Chief of Police; Carr, the desk sergeant and Lewis, a patrolman at the 63d street station; and Divilbiss, the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-12\">All defendants, save Noffke, moved to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Each attached an affidavit to his motion. The Chief of Police and the Board of Police Commissioners members each stated, under oath, that he had no personal knowledge of the incident, was not present at the time and did not direct or order the arrest or subsequent action relating to appellant. Lewis stated that although he was present at the time of the incident, he was in no way involved in any act directed toward appellant and had no supervisory authority. Carr stated that he was present but did not direct, order or become involved in the incident and was unable to intervene. Divilbiss admitted giving appellant a speeding summons but stated he was not present and had no knowledge of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-13\">The trial court, D.C., 339 F.Supp. 919, dismissed the complaint against the Chief of Police and the Board members holding that, as a matter of law, where damages are sought under \u00a7 1983 \u201cthe doctrine of respondeat superior is not available to impose vicarious liability upon a defendant who has no personal involvement in the alleged deprivation of plaintiff\u2019s federally-protected rights.\u201d In a separate ruling the trial court dismissed the cause against Divilbiss, Lewis and Carr, holding that under the facts alleged in the complaint, no constitutionally protected right had been violated by the three.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-14\">Although the action was dismissed under Rule 12(b) (6), matter outside the pleadings was presented by way of affidavits and exhibits which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>not excluded by the trial court. Under Rule 12(b), the dismissal constitutes disposition by summary judgment as provided in Rule 56 on the basis that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Carter v. Stanton, 405 U.S. 669, 92 S.Ct. 1232, 31 L.Ed.2d 569 (1972); Minnesota Bearing Company v. White Motor Corporation, 470 F.2d 1323 (CA8 1973) and Abramson v. Mitchell, 459 F.2d 955 (CA8 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, of course, must \u201cbe read against the background of tort liability that makes a man responsible for the natural consequences of his actions.\u201d Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187, 81 S.Ct. 473, 484, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">THE ARRESTING OFFICER</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint with respect to patrolman Divilbiss. The only allegation in the complaint in regard to this appellee was that Divilbiss arrested appellant for speeding on the day of the incident and told her to report to the 63d street station. The appeal with respect to this defendant is patently frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-7\">THE POLICE CHIEF and BOARD MEMBERS</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-8\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s holding that this action is not maintainable against the appellees under the doctrine of respondeat superior, nor do we find the complaint sufficient on any other basis of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-9\">The appellants admittedly placed heavy reliance upon the respondeat superior theory in pursuing this action. We, of course, are to afford remedial statutes such as \u00a7 1983 a liberal construction, but expressly reject the application of the doctrine on this set of facts, as have the vast majority of federal courts in cases such as this. <em>See, e. g., </em>Adams v. Pate, 445 F.2d 105 (CA7 1971); Madison v. Gerstein, 440 F.2d 338 (CA5 1971); Dunham v. Crosby, 435 F.2d 1177 (CA1 1970); Campbell v. Anderson, 335 F.Supp. 483 (D.Del.1971); Sanberg v. Daley, 306 F.Supp. 277 (N.D.Ill.1969) and Jordan v. Kelly, 223 F. Supp. 731 (W.D.Mo.1963). But, compare, Carter v. Carlson, 144 U.S.App.D.C. 388, 447 F.2d 358 (1971), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 409 U.S. 418, 93 S.Ct. 602, 34 L.Ed.2d 613 (1973) and Hill v. Toll, 320 F.Supp; 185 (E.D.Pa.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-14\">The respondeat superior principle holds liable the \u201cinnocent\u201d master (with the infamous \u201cdeep pocket\u201d) for the torts committed by his servant in the course of his employment. The modern justification for respondeat superior is that it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1332-15\">. a rule of policy, <em>a deliberate allocation of a risk. </em>The losses caused by the torts of employees, which is a practical matter are sure to occur in the conduct of the employer\u2019s enterprise, are placed upon that enterprise itself, as a required cost of doing business. They are placed upon the employer because, having engaged in an enterprise which will, on the basis of all past experience, involve harm to others through the torts of employees, and sought to profit by it, it is just that he, rather than the innocent injured plaintiff, should bear them; and because he is better able to absorb them, and to distribute them, through prices, rates or liability insurance, to the public, and so to shift them to society, to the community at large. Added to this is the makeweight argument that an employer who is held strictly liable is under the greatest in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>centive to be careful in the selection, instruction and supervision of his servants, and to take every precaution to see that the enterprise is conducted safely, (emphasis added) W. Prosser, Law of Torts, 458-459 (4th ed. 1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqQr\">With such justification in mind the \u201cmaster\u201d of course, is and can only be the municipality employing the appellees. It is the city who set the enterprise in motion, who \u201cprofits\u201d from the appellees\u2019 labor and who, if held liable in such instances, can by its powers of taxation spread the resulting expenditures amongst the community at large.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kansas City, however, is not a defendant in this action, nor could it be under \u00a7 1983. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187-192, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">We also believe that appellants\u2019 claim cannot succeed on the theory of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">The two requisites for a \u00a7 1983 cause of action are: (1) an allegation that the conduct complained of subjected the complainant to a deprivation of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and (2) an allegation that the conduct complained of was done or caused to have been done by a person acting under the color of law. Basista v. Weir, 340 F.2d 74, 79 (CA3 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">Generally, liability for negligence arises only from affirmative action. Where, however, one has an affirmative duty to act and he fails to act accordingly, he may be held liable for his nonfeasance if his omission is unreasonable under the circumstances. Huey v. Barloga, 277 F.Supp. 864, 872 (N.D.Ill.1967). Appellants have not alleged any affirmative conduct so their claim against the appellees obviously is grounded upon nonfeasance. But no Board member or the Chief is alleged to have been present at this incident or to have had the duty, opportunity, or the ability to intervene in order to prevent Noffke\u2019s alleged unreasonable search and seizure of Mrs. Jennings. And to extend the general duty of these appellees to prudently select, educate and supervise police department employees to an isolated, spontaneous incident such as this would be beyond reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-13\">CARR and LEWIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-14\">Carr was the Desk Sergeant and Lewis a patrolman who the complaint alleged were both present at the 63d street station when Noffke seized and searched Mrs. Jennings. Nothing further is alleged in the complaint with respect to these police officers. While the complaint against these appellees might be sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss under a negligence theory,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as previously indicated we here treat the motion as one for summary judgment. Carr in his affidavit stated that he was neither involved in the incident nor was he \u201cable to intervene between plaintiff and defendant Noffke at the time of the alleged occurrence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court thereupon issued an order for the appellants to show cause why the action should not be dismissed \u201cIn view of the absence of any factual allegations tending to implicate defendants ... in a deprivation of the federally-protected rights of Betsy Jennings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-15\">In such instance, appellants could not then rest upon the mere allega-' tions of their pleadings, but should have \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>Rule 56(e).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since appellants did not so respond, summary judgment could appropriately be entered against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">We further find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the pendant state claims against the appellees. United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1332-10\">. Rule 12(b) reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1332-11\">If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1333-8\">. It has not been shown that under the circumstances of this case, the doctrine could be applied in Missouri state courts. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1333-10\">. Both were bystanders at the incident and one or both may have had a duty to intervene (assuming the opportunity existed) in order to prevent the alleged deprivation of Mrs. Jennings\u2019 constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. See, Byrd v. Brishke, 466 F.2d 6 (CA7 1972). See also, Via v. Cliff, 470 F.2d 271, 275-276 (CA3 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1333-18\">. Lewis in his affidavit admitted that he was present at the station but stated he \u201cwas in no way involved in any act directed toward plaintiff nor had he any supervisory authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1334-16\">. Rule 56(e) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADcE\">[A]n adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations of denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
