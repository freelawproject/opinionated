His offenses were committed, and he was indicted, before May 1, 1971, the date when the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., became effective. That Act repealed the provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d), which had provided for mandatory sentences for offenses such as those committed by Garcia and had further provided that the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202, permitting parole, should not be applicable to such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-21\">On this appeal, Garcia makes only one contention, i. e., that he was entitled, contrary to the District Court\u2019s interpretation, to the application of the mSre lenient provisions of the 1970 Act. He bases his contention on the fact that his conviction and sentence occurred after the effective date of the Act. Very re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>cently, a similar contention was rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States. Bradley v. United States, 410 U.S. 605, 93 S.Ct. 1151, 35 L.Ed.2d 528 (1973). Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
