Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5th Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b652-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b652-23\">Alleging that his work aboard the M/V SNIPE aggravated or caused his silicosis or pneumonoconiosis condition, plaintiff sued Insurance Company of North America, State Automobile and Casualty Underwriters, and Coating Specialists, Inc. for damages under the Jones Act and maintenance under the General Maritime Law. The district court granted summary judgment for the Insurance Company only and declared in its judgment \u201cThis is a final judgment within the meaning of Rule 54(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Defendant Coating Specialists, which had purchased Jones Act liability coverage from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the Insurance Company, appeals from this summary judgment. We dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"> In a multiple party suit, such as this one, a summary judgment adjudicating the claims or rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties. is not a final appealable judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 unless the district court makes (1) an \u201cexpress determination that there is no just reason for delay\u201d and (2) \u201can express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ. P. 54(b). Since the district court did not make the requisite \u201cexpress determination,\u201d this court is without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Bailey v. Rowan Drilling Company, 5th Cir. 1971, 441 F.2d 57; United States v. Crow, Pope and Land Enterprises, Inc., 5th Cir. 1973, 474 F.2d 200; see 6 J. Moore, Federal Practice, \u00b6 54.34 [2.2] n. 10 (2d Ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">After .summary judgment for the Insurance Company was granted, Coating Specialists moved for leave to file a third party complaint against the Insurance Company, and the district court denied this motion without any reference to the final judgment status of its order or to the question whether any just reason for delaying an appeal from the order existed. Coating Specialists appeals from the denial of the motion, and this appeal has been consolidated with the summary judgment appeal for consideration by this court. This second appeal must also be dismissed. Even if, as we assume here without deciding, the denial of Coating Specialists\u2019 motion to file a third party complaint might be appealable if certified by the district court under Rule 54(b), <em>see </em>6 J. Moore, Federal Practice, \u00b6 54.36 (2d Ed. 1972), it is clear that the denial of the motion is not appealable without the requisite Rule 54(b) certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">If the trial court enters a new judgment and accompanies it with .a proper Rule 54(b) certificate, the second appeal may be submitted on the record and briefs prepared for this appeal as supplemented by the new judgment and certificate. <em>See </em>3 Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1193 at 26 (Wright Ed. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
