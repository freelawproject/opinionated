Additionally, we find that the panel did not err in refusing to admit the results of the polygraph examinations. Relator did not agree to their admission as required by <em>Souel, supra. </em>See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Jamison </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St. 3d 182, 190, 552 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>N.E. 2d 180, 188. Moreover, we neither ordered the evidence admitted nor have we overruled <em>Souel. </em>We also reject respondent\u2019s contention that the panel and board inappropriately considered respondent\u2019s prior misconduct reported at <em>Toledo Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Westmeyer </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St. 3d 261, 520 N.E. 2d 223. The prior misconduct was considered only in relation to consideration of an appropriate sanction. Moreover, the panel and board only recommend what this court\u2019s order should be. Therefore, we conclude that respondent\u2019s prior misconduct, based on similar charges, is relevant to the choice of sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for one year.
