This focus, however, obscures a more significant error \u2014 the commission\u2019s apparent failure to consider all the claim\u2019s allowed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-21\">The commission\u2019s order, the statement of facts and Dr. McCloud\u2019s report (on which the commission exclusively relied) all listed the allowed conditions as \u201cleft leg, low back, right leg.\u201d The numerous serious conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>additionally allowed in 1982 are conspicuously absent from all documents. A similarly deficient order was remanded for clarification and additional consideration in <em>State, ex rel. Johnson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 339, 533 N.E. 2d 720. Similar action is warranted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed to the following extent: that a limited writ issue ordering the commission to clarify whether it considered the conditions additionally allowed in 1982, to additionally consider, if it has not already done so, the nonmedical disability factors set forth in <em>Stephenson, supra, </em>including the vocational report submitted by appellee, and to indicate with specificity, pursuant to <em>State, ex rel. Noll, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St. 3d 203, 567 N.E. 2d 245, which of those factors were considered in its order, and to briefly explain its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed as modified.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b184-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
