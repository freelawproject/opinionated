Rudes, </em>v. <em>Rofkar </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 69, 71-72, 15 OBR 163, 165, 472 N.E. 2d 354, 356. This court has held, time and again, that it is incumbent upon the legislative authority to provide funds which are reasonable and necessary to operate a court which requests such funding. See, <em>e.g., State, ex rel. Giuliani, </em>v. <em>Perk </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St. 2d 235, 43 O.O. 2d 366, 237 N.E. 2d 397, and <em>State, ex rel. Arbaugh, </em>v. <em>Richland Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St. 3d 5, 14 OBR 311, 470 N.E. 2d 880. Therefore, a board of county commissioners must provide the funds requested by a court of common pleas unless the board can show that the requested funding is unreasonable and unnecessary. <em>State, ex rel. Britt, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Franklin Cty. Commrs. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 1, 2, 18 OBR 1, 2, 480 N.E. 2d 77, 78. The burden of proof is clearly upon the party who opposes the requested funding. <em>Id. </em>In effect, it is presumed that a court\u2019s request for funding is reasonable and necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>for the proper administration of the court. The purpose of this \u201cpresumption\u201d is to maintain and preserve a judicial system and judiciary that are independent and autonomous.</p>\n<p id=\"AMl\">In the case at bar, the court of appeals determined that appellant failed to meet its burden of establishing that the appropriation ordered by appellee was unreasonable and unnecessary. We find no compelling reason to disturb that determination. Accordingly, we conclude, as did the court of appeals, that appellee is entitled to a writ of mandamus ordering appellant to fund the juvenile court in accordance with appellee\u2019s journal entry. Given this determination, it follows that appellant is not entitled to the issuance of a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Appellant also contends that the court of appeals erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s request for a writ of prohibition. We disagree. In effect, appellant sought to prohibit appellee from operating the juvenile court under the salary schedule contained in appellee\u2019s journal entry. However, it was appellee\u2019s function to direct the operations of his court. To have provided appellant with the relief it sought would have permitted appellant to control the operation of the court even though appellee was conducting the court\u2019s business in a lawful manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
