By authorizing placement of the ad, respondent committed a willful violation of DR 2-105(A)(5). That rule prohibits use of the term \u201cspecialize\u201d except under proper certification or in the patent, trademark or admiralty bars. We believe that \u201cspecialize\u201d connotes formal recognition. The American Bar Association agrees. In its Comment to Rule 7.4 of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-13\">\u201c* * * \u2018[The terms] \u2018specialist,\u2019 practices a \u2018specialty,\u2019 * * * [and] \u2018specializes in\u2019 * * * have acquired a secondary meaning implying formal recognition as a specialist and, therefore, use of these terms is misleading. * * *\u201d Codes of Professional Responsibility (2 Ed. 1990) 382.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">In this case respondent\u2019s use of the term was clearly misleading in fact because it did not derive from formal recognition, or even from experience, but from his personal aspirations. We note further that under DR 2405(A)(5) respondent may state that his practice \u201cconsists in large part or is limited to\u201d medical malpractice cases whenever these assertions can be made truthfully. Accordingly, we find no over-breadth in the rule with respect to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">Respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded.
