Grieshammer, </em>assistant public defender, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b128-12\">Douglas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeS\">The issue presented by this appeal is whether the indictment sufficiently charges a criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">The applicable statute in this case is former R.C. 2919.25, which provided in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-14\">\u201c(A) No person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to <em>a family or household member.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-17\">\u201c(E) As used in this section * * * of the Revised Code:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-18\">\u201c(1) \u2018Family or household member\u2019 means * * * <em>a child </em>* * * who is residing or has resided with the offender.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 142 Ohio Laws, Part I, 36-37.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-19\">The elements of the crime of domestic violence (R.C. 2919.25[A]) are that a charged defendant must have knowingly caused, or attempted to cause, physical harm to a family or household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-20\">R.C. 2901.01(C) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-21\">\u201c \u2018Physical harm to persons\u2019 means <em>any injury, </em>illness, or other physiological impairment, regardless of its gravity or duration.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-22\">Appellant contends that appellee\u2019s conduct, as set forth in the indictment, constitutes a chargeable criminal offense of domestic violence pursuant to the terms of R.C. 2919.25(A). We agree and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-23\">Herein, appellee was indicted for knowingly causing or attempting to cause physical harm to his child. Appellee\u2019s conduct as charged in the indictment clearly constitutes a violation of R.C. 2919.25(A), and the indictment apprises him of each and every element of the offense. Therefore, the indictment was not defective and should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-24\">Appellee argues that if he can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>charged pursuant to R.C. 2919.25(A), it effectively prohibits him from using corporal punishment to discipline his child. Appellee contends that the General Assembly, in enacting R.C. 2919.22,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> recognized the right of a parent to administer reasonable corporal punishment so long as <em>serious </em>physical harm to the child does not result. Thus, according to appellee, there is a conflict between R.C. 2919.25 and 2919.22. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Nothing in R.C. 2919.25(A) prevents a parent from properly disciplining his or her child. The only prohibition is that a parent may not cause \u201cphysical harm\u201d as that term is defined in R.C. 2901.01(C). \u201cPhysical harm\u201d is defined as \u201cany injury[.]\u201d \u201cInjury\u201d is defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed. 1990) 785, as \u201c* * * [t]he invasion of any <em>legally protected interest </em>of another.\u201d (Emphasis added.) A child does not have any legally protected interest which is invaded by proper and reasonable parental discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">While appellee denies the' assertions of the state, the only facts presently before us are those contained in appellant\u2019s memorandum in opposition to appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. Appellant contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">\u201c* * * [Appellee] came home intoxicated after his wife and two children had fallen asleep. The children were pulled out of bed by * * * [appellee], who threatened to beat them all. Eight year old Matthew was ordered to stand at attention while * * * [appellee] punched him in the stomach with his fist. Matthew was consecutively pushed to the ground and then ordered to stand at attention seven times. * * * [Appellee\u2019s] wife and daughter left the room. * * * [Appellee] slammed the door shut and repeatedly pounded Matthew\u2019s head against the wall. * * * [Appellee\u2019s] wife was able to grab the ch\u00fcd, clad only in his underwear, and run to a neighbor\u2019s house. According to * * * [appellee\u2019s] wife, Matthew\u2019s lip was bloody. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">We find the foregoing to be sufficient to meet all the elements of an R.C. 2919.25(A) charge for domestic violence. Therefore, the indictment should not have been dismissed. The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the indictment is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b129-16\">Moyer, C.J., Holmes, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b129-17\">Sweeney and Wright, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-9\"> R.C. 2919.22 provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">\u201c(B) No person shall do any of the following to a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">\u201c(1) Abuse the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">\u2018 \u2018(2) Torture or cruelly abuse the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-18\">\u201c(3) Administer corporal punishment or other physical disciplinary measure, or physically restrain the child in a cruel manner or for a prolonged period, which punishment, discipline, or restraint is excessive under the circumstances and creates a substantial risk of <em>serious </em>physical harm to the child[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
