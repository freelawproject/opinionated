Such reserves are proper items of expense to be utilized when estimating the true value of real property through an income approach.

The annual allowance for each component is usually estimated as the anticipated cost of its replacement prorated over its anticipated remaining economic life, provided this does not exceed the remaining economic life of the structure. * * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450. The BTA should analyze the reserves to determine if they include any inappropriate items, or if they are otherwise excessive, which would warrant a modification in the amount deducted as expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-26\">The decision of the BTA is reversed and the cause is remanded for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>reconsideration of the components included in, and the deductibility of, the reserves for replacements and for a redetermination of the true value of the subject property in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\n<em>Decision reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-6\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
