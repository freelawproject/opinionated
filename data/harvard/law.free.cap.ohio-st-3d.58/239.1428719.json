Under the facts of this case, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The elements of felonious assault are set forth in R.C. 2903.11, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-12\">\u201c(A) No person shall knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-14\">\u201c(2) Cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance, as defined in section 2923.11 of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-15\">\u201c(B) * * * If the victim of the offense is a peace officer, as defined in section 2935.01 of the Revised Code, felonious assault is an aggravated felony of the first degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-16\">\u201cKnowingly,\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2903.11, is defined in R.C. 2901.22(B) as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-17\">\u201cA person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-18\">And, \u201cattempt\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2903.11 is defined in R.C. 2923.02(A) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-19\">\u201cNo person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-20\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 127, 2 O.O. 3d 289, 357 N.E. 2d 1059, paragraph one of the syllabus, this court explained that a person is guilty of criminal attempt where he or she \u201c* * * purposely does or omits to do anything which is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime. To constitute a substantial step, the conduct must be strongly corroborative of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>actor\u2019s criminal purpose. (R.C. 2923.02[A] construed.)\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St. 3d 185, 542 N.E. 2d 636, we were confronted with a case similar to the one at bar concerning the propriety of a felonious assault charge. In <em>Brooks, </em>the defendant was involved in a \u201cheated conversation\u201d with a barmaid which resulted in the defendant pointing a handgun at the woman\u2019s face and stating, \u201cBitch, I will kill you.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 542 N.E. 2d at 638. We upheld Brooks\u2019 felonious assault conviction based upon the totality of the circumstances; however, we went on to say that, \u201c[t]he act of pointing a deadly weapon at another, without additional evidence regarding the actor\u2019s intention, is insufficient to convict a defendant of the offense of \u2018felonious assault\u2019 * * <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">It can be readily gleaned from our holding in <em>Brooks, supra, </em>that the additional evidence needed to uphold a felonious assault charge could include verbal threats as perceived by a reasonable person under the circumstances. Thus, the act of pointing a deadly weapon at another coupled with a threat, which indicates an intention to use such weapon, is sufficient evidence to convict a defendant of the offense of \u201cfelonious assault\u201d as defined by R.C. 2903.11(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>defendant held a rifle aimed at Mongold\u2019s head. The rifle was <em>loaded, </em>the <em>hammer was cocked, </em>and the weapon was subsequently determined to be a fully func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>tional firearm. Moreover, at the instant defendant positioned his weapon in the direction of the officers, he shouted, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a warrant get the fuck out of my house.\u201d Clearly, under these circumstances a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could have concluded that defendant\u2019s actions were strongly corroborative of his intent to cause physical harm to the officers by means of his deadly weapon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra, </em>at 192, 542 N.E. 2d at 643. Therefore, we determine the court of appeals erred in finding that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the conviction of defendant for the offense of felonious assault with a firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the court of appeals\u2019 decision is reversed and defendant\u2019s conviction is reinstated, with the cause remanded to the trial court for imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b296-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b296-10\">Sweeney and H. Brown, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"> Comment 6(a) to Section 5.01 of the Model Penal Code explains the requirements of \u201csubstantial step\u201d and corroboration of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adf\">\u201c(a) * * * Whether a particular act is a substantial step is obviously a matter of degree. To this extent, the Code retains the element of imprecision found in most of the other approaches to the preparation-attempt problem. There are, however, several differences to be noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">\u201c <em>\u2018First, this formulation shifts the emphasis from what remains to be done, the chief concern of the proximity tests, to what the actor has already done. </em>That further major steps must be taken before the crime can be completed does not preclude a finding that the steps already undertaken are substantial. It is expected, in the normal case, that this approach will broaden the scope of attempt liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">\u201cSecond, although it is intended that the requirement of a substantial step will result in the imposition of attempt liability only in those instances in which some firmness of criminal purpose is shown, no finding is required as to whether the actor would probably have desisted prior to completing the crime. Potentially the probable desistance test could reach very early steps toward crime, depending on how one assesses the probabilities of desistance; but since in practice this test follows closely the proximity approaches, rejection of a test of probable desistance will not narrow the scope of attempt liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-14\">\u201cFinally, the requirement of proving a substantial step generally will prove less of a hurdle for the prosecution than the res ipSa loquitur approach, which requires that the actor\u2019s conduct itself have manifested the criminal purpose. The basic rationale of the requirement that the actor\u2019s conduct shall strongly corroborate his purpose to commit a crime is, of course, the same as that underlying the res ipsa loquitur view. But framed in terms of corroboration, the present formulation does not so narrowly circumscribe the scope of attempt liability. Rigorously applied, the res ipsa loquitur doctrine would provide immunity in many instances in which the actor had gone far toward <em>the </em>commission of an offense and had strongly indicated a criminal purpose. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)
