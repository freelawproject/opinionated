For the reasons to follow, we find that the wage was properly set.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">R.C. 4123.59 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">\u201cIn case an injury * * * to an employee causes his death, benefits shall be in the amount and to the persons following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-13\">\u201c(B) If there are wholly dependent persons * * *, the weekly payment shall be sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the average weekly wage * * * <em>if</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the AWW should be based on wages for the year preceding death is negated by R.C. 4123.61, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-16\">\u201cIn death claims * * * the decedent\u2019s average weekly wage for the year preceding the injury * * * shall be the weekly wage upon which compensation shall be based. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-17\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s representation, the fact that a dependent\u2019s cause of action does not accrue until decedent\u2019s death does not transform the AWW formula of R.C. 4123.61 into one based on pre-death earnings. A dependent\u2019s right to participate in workers\u2019 compensation benefits is \u201cwholly statutory.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Bessler, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 297, 299, 47 O.O. 179, 180, 105 N.E. 2d 264, 266; <em>Indus. Comm. </em>v. <em>Kamrath </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 1, 160 N.E. 470, paragraph one of the syllabus. Moreover, <em>Kamrath </em>ruled, at paragraph-two of the syllabus, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-18\">\u201cThe provisions of the General Code relating to compensation of * * * the dependents of killed employees in force at the time the cause of action accrues are the measure of the right of such employees and dependents to participate in the state insurance fund.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-19\">Here, the Revised Code sections \u201cin force at the time the cause of action accrue[d]\u201d clearly state that the AWW for death claims is calculated based on wages for the year preceding injury. Appellant\u2019s entreaty that we liberally construe R.C. 4123.61, citing R.C. 4123.95, is misplaced. \u201cA direction to liberally construe a statute in favor of certain parties will not authorize a court to read into the statute something which cannot reasonably be implied from the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Szekely </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 213, 218, 22 O.O. 2d 214, 217, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>188 N.E. 2d 424, 428. As to R.C. 4123.61:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\u201cThe statute fixing the average weekly wage at the time of injury as the basis of compensation is about as plain as language can make it.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Kildow, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 573, 581, 1 O.O. 235, 238, 192 N.E. 873, 876. Accordingly, we find that the accrual date of a dependent\u2019s cause of action does not change the computational formula of R.C. 4123.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Appellant also argues that calculation of AWW based on wages for the year prior to injury as applied to her violates equal protection. The commission initially contests appellant\u2019s right to make this argument, claiming that it was not previously raised. We disagree, finding that equal protection implications, while not precisely articulated, were evident below and therefore preserved appellant\u2019s constitutional challenge. See, generally, <em>In re M.D. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 149, 527 N.E. 2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Examined on its merits, however, appellant\u2019s equal protection argument fads. She maintains that dependents of decedents who die immediately from an industrial injury receive an AWW based on wages for the year prior to death, while all others, like herself, have the AWW based on wages for the year prior to injury. Appellant contends that this is discriminatory treatment with no rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s representation, however, no disparate treatment exists here. <em>All </em>AWWs are based on wages for the year prior to injury. Appellant overlooks the obvious: Where injury and death are simultaneous, wages for the year preceding death and injury will be the same. This does not, however, mean that two different calculations are being used.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>State, ex rel. Doersam, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 40 Ohio St. 3d 201, 533 N.E. 2d 321, is misplaced. First, <em>Doersam </em>involved the benefit cap of R.C. 4123.59(B), which is not at issue here. Moreover, in <em>Doersam </em>the relevant provision clearly set forth two different benefit categories based on decedent\u2019s date of injury: Dependents of decedents injured before January 1,1976 were limited to a maximum of two thirds of the statewide average weekly wage, while others could get one hundred percent of the same figure. Here, there is no comparable distinction \u2014 the statute directs that <em>all </em>dependents receive benefits based on earnings in the year prior to injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Appellant finally proposes that the lengthy period preceding decedent\u2019s death and his continued employment therein is a \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d that warrants an alternative calculation pursuant to R.C. 4123.61. We find, however, that appellant has waived this argument by failing to raise it, even in general terms, below. <em>State, ex rel. Gibson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St. 3d 319, 530 N.E. 2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">For these reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b156-13\">Moyer, C.J., Holmes, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b156-14\">Sweeney, Douglas and Res-nick, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
