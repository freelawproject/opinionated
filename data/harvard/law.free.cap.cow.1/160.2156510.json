The cause was commenced in the Common Fleas, and removed into this Court by <em>hab. corp. </em>On trial at the Circuit, the Verdict was general for the plaintiff, with 11 dollars damages.

To entitle him to these, the verdict should have been in terms upon the first count. <em>(Newcomb </em>v. Butterfield, 8 <em>John. </em>342.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-12\">The plaintiff would not have been entitled to single costs, had the suit been brought here originally; <em>(Crane </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>11 <em>John. </em>404) and as to this action, the same rule applies, though removed by <em>hab. corp. </em>The costs upon the certificate are asked for upon the 7th section,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> but this provides for those cases only, which are not provided for in the 5th section, and applies to the Common Pleas and Mayor\u2019s Court only. The 4th section<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> contains no provision in favour of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit, </em>as such, removed by <em>hab. corp. </em>into this Court. In <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>Benschotten, </em>(13 <em>John. </em>425) this Court refused costs beyond the damages,, in <em>ease </em>for slander, removed here by the defendant, on a verdict for the plaintiff of 10 dollars : and the Court say, that because tbe-e is no saving of an action of slander in the 4th section, \u201c there can be no ground for any distinction between actions originally commenced here, and those removed from an inferiour Court by <em>habeas </em>corpus.\u201d Nor does the act of <em>April </em>15, 1817, <em>(sess. </em>40, <em>ch. </em>278, <em>s. </em>2) reach this case. That act was passed after, and in consequence of the decision in <em>Witerman </em>v. <em>Benschotten, </em>but extends only to assault and battery, false imprisonment and slanderous words, giv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ing costs where these actions are removed <em>on hab. 'corp. </em>by j-|le defendant, and the plaintiff shall recover any thing. It leaves this action precisely as it stood before. If costs on a certificate had been intended, the legislature would have said so.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-6\">No power to certify is given by the 7th section to the Circuit Judges. Why this is the case, it is not material to inquire. <em>Bennet v. Rathbun, </em>(17 <em>John. </em>37) will be relied on, but is distinguishable from this case. The plea of title is evidence there, that the defendant relies on title only. It was a case from a Justice\u2019s Court, under the 25 dollar act, (sec. 7, 1 R. <em>L. </em>390) and costs are given by the 4th section <em>of the statute </em>concerning costs, (where title is in question in this Court) without regard to the amount of damages. A <em>hob. 'corp. </em>is not the continuance of an <em>old, </em>but the commencement pf a <em>new </em>suit. <em>(Bank of Niagara </em>v. <em>M'Cracken, </em>18 <em>John. </em>494.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-mo\">He moved that costs be allowed to the defendant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-8\"><em>Hastings, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2c\">The Court will, in several cases, receive a certificate of the Judge, in order to entitle to costs, as that freehold was in question. <em>(Farrington </em>v. <em>Rennie, </em>2 Caines\u2019 <em>Rep, </em>220. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>11 <em>John. </em>405.) A certificate has also been received, to entitle to costs against an \"executor or administrator. And it is equally proper that treble costs should be given on the same ground. The objection, that we are not entitled to the treble costs, upon the certificate, is merely technical, and arises from the verdict not happening to be upon the first count only, that alone being under the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-9\">We should clearly have been entitled to our single <em>costs </em>in the Common Pleas. A <em>habeas corpus </em>is considered a continuance of the suit, in protection of the plaintiff\u2019s rights.. It is so for the purposes of bail. <em>(Bell </em>v. <em>Hall, 12 </em>John. 152.) And the case of the <em>Miagara Bank </em>v. <em>McCracken, </em>will be found to go this length, when examined. The Court declare, in that case, that they will notice the suit below, where it is necessary to protect the plaintiff against manifest injustice, The 7th section of the statute, (1 <em>R. L. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>345) would have given us costs, had we recovered in the <em>\u00b0 </em>. . . Court bel,ow ; and if we are deprived of those costs, it is by the act of the defendant. <em>Waterman </em>v. Benschotten, (13 <em>John. </em>425) has no application. That case proceeded upon the ground, that the action of <em>slander </em>was expressly .excepted in the 4th section. That section declares that nothing contained therein shall extend to the action of slander; so that its being removed, by a <em>habeas corpus, </em>could make no difference. It is the same as to assault and battery, and false imprisonment, which rendered the act of 1817 necessary, in order to remedy the evil. But <em>Bennet </em>v. <em>Rathbun, </em>(17 <em>John. </em>37) fully bears us out, in our claim for single costs. In that case the <em>habeas corpus </em>was considered a continuation of the suit, for the purposes of costs. There was only 5 dollars damages, yet double costs were allowed, the action having been commenced before a Justice, and a plea of title, interposed, which carried it to the Common Pleas, whence the defendant removed it to the Supreme Court. Thus the Court allowed costs, upon the very ground which we take here, viz. that we cannot be deprived of costs by the act of the defendant. In the language of the Court, in that case, \u201c a diiferent construction would lead to great injustice ; for, unless we consider it a continuance of the same action, the plaintiff could not recover even single costs, unr less the title actually came in question.\u201d</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AjE\"><em>L </em>345-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AxNg\">344-</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b175-8\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AVZ\">It is a sufficient answer to the application for trebling the damages, &amp;c. that the verdict is general on both counts. To entitle the plaintiff to have the damages and costs trebled, it should have been on the first count only, which was upon the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">As to the application for single costs, the argument seems to have proceeded upon a misapprehension of the 7th section, which does not give costs, in the Common Pleas, in trespass on land, riot concerning freehold or title, though the; Court should certify that the trespass was wilful and mali-. cious. This is an action provided for in the 5th section, which expressly regulates costs <em>in all actions </em>(in the Com? mon Pleas) <em>not concerning any freehold or title, of land, </em>nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>for any <em>assault, battery </em>or <em>imprisonment, replevin, slander </em>or <em>malicious prosecution, </em>nor <em>by or against executors or administrators. </em>It denies costs to the plaintiff, unless he recover more than 25 dollars, and gives costs to the defendant. Now ' here is a recovery of 11 dollars only, in an action which does, not concern <em>freehold </em>or <em>title, </em>or <em>assault, battery, fyc'. </em>in the words of that section. Then comes the 7th section, within which this case is supposed to be; but the 7th section extends, in terms, to those actions of trespass only, which are hot provided for in the 5th section. In this Court, the plaintiff cannot have costs, unless he recover more than 50 dollars, except where freehold or title'is brought in question, which was not done by the present action. In this view of the case, it is not necessary to pronounce whether the <em>habeas corpus </em>shall be deemed a continuation of the action in the Common Pleas. ' It being a case provided\" for by the 5th' section, if it were a continuancp, the result would be the same upon the question of costs ; which we deny to the plaintiff, and order a judgment, in favour of the defendant, for his costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Rule accordingly, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\"><em> </em>Vid. <em>sess. </em>41, <em>ch. </em>94, <em>s. </em>5 <em>and </em>16. The revision of <em>Kent &amp; Radcliff, (vol. </em>1, 530, <em>s. </em>8) gave costs in all Co.urts of Record, where the verdict, in trespass, was for the\" plaintiff, and the <em>Judge </em>certified, upon the record, that the trespass was wilful and malicious. This being inapplicable to the Common Pleas, (composed of Judges, and <em>taxing </em>before any record was made,) the statute,\" <em>(sess. </em>27, <em>ch. </em>59, 3 <em>Webster, </em>461) gives the same effect to an entry in the minutes of the Common Pleas,\" under their direction, that the trespass was wilful smd malicious. These provisions seem to have been virtually repealed by the revision of 1813; \"and thfe plaintiff in most cases of small trespasses, though wilful and malicious, is now left to his remedy in a Justice\u2019s Court, if he does not mean to be mulcted in costs.
