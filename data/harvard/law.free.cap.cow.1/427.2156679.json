The plaintiff then, with a view to try the validity of the discharge, proceeded against the defendant, <em>Thorp, </em>by a <em>sci.fa. </em>upon the judgment, which was personally served on him, and a judgment was taken hy def&lt;ult, upon which a <em>fi.fa. </em>issued, and was returned <em>nulla bona, fyc. </em>and a <em>ca. sa. </em>was issued and returned <em>non est invent</em>ns. <em>A capias ad respondendum </em>against <em>Thurber, </em>the hail, was then issued, returnable the 16 <em>Ih </em>day <em>o\u00ed August </em>last, being the last return day of that term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-13\"><em>A.

But the reason of that rule does not apply here, where a <em>sci. fa. </em>has been issued against the defendant, upon the judgment\u2014been personally served, and a default taken for not pleading the discharge. There is no circuity to be avoided, for were the defendant applying to the Court in person, we could not discharge him from execution upon this judgment on the <em>scire facias. </em>But, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, however, let the bail have <em>thirty </em>days, within which to surrender the principal; the. proceedings on the part of the plaintiff tq be stayed in the mean time, and on making the surrender and payment of the costs which have\" accrued against the bail, let the proceedings against them be perpetually stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Rule, accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
