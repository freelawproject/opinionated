Notice of this assignment, under the hand of the attorney, and that they should not settle with <em>Bigalow, </em>or make any payment to him of the cos*s\u2019 was the same day served on <em>Cooper </em>and <em>Henry.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-15\"><em>H.

The attorney stands in the character of an assignee for a valuable consideration, and has given notice to the opposite party not to interfere. This Court have decided, at the present term, that the attorney\u2019s <em>lien, </em>and <em>actual notice </em>of it, shall prevail against the equity of the opposite party, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-16\"><em>Storrs, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiqH\">said the attorney was not an assignee upon any new consideration; and, therefore, stands in no better light than before. He has himself acted with full notice of our equity, and the Court will say to him, \u201c you remain precisely as you did before, claiming in virtue of your lien as attorney.\u201d He looked to the credit of his insolvent client, by which he must abide; and not take his money from the pocket of the adverse party. This is <em>not equitable, </em>while the opposite course <em>is so. (Porter </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>8 <em>John. </em>357. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Dole, 13 id. </em>306.)</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b218-17\"><em> </em>I suppose the counsel alluded to <em>Power </em>v. <em>Kent et al. ante, </em>172.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b219-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AoJQ\">We had no doubt, at the last- term, about allow'ing this set off, had it not been for the then subsisting imprisonment of <em>Bigalow Searls </em>upon the <em>ca. </em>sa.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> By their discharge under the insolvent act, that obstacle is removed. Their discharge left two mutual unsatisfied judgments, which were the proper subject of an equitable set off, upon application to this Court, unless the subsequent assignment and notice give preference to the lien of the attorney. The right of set off had attached; and the attorney had full notice that it was claimed, at the time he took the assignment from <em>Bigalow. </em>These circumstances do not, in our opinion, alter the question, and the motion must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><em> </em>Mr. <em>Foot, </em>who opposed the set off in that case, mentioned the <em>lien </em>of the attorney, as one ground of opposition to the motion, which I forbore to notice in the report of the ease, because the matter turned on the impris\u2022enment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
