He cited <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Hasbrouck et al. </em>(3 <em>John. Rep. </em>538;) <em>Rosevelt et al. </em>v. <em>Soulden et al. </em>(16 <em>John. </em>44;) <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>(4 <em>T. R. </em>697, <em>n. </em>b ;) <em>Tidd's Pr. </em>80 ; 1 <em>Dunlap's Pr. </em>122, 126 ; <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>(1 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>19 ;) <em>Lewin v. Smith, </em>(4 <em>East, </em>589 ;) <em>Kerval </em>v. <em>Fossett, </em>(7 <em>Taunt. </em>458 ;) <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Eland et al. </em>(2 <em>New Rep. </em>82;) 1 <em>Moore, </em>147 ; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Cotter et al. </em>(1 Maule &amp; Selw. 55 ;) <em>Stables et al. </em>v. <em>Ashley et al. (1 Bos. </em>&amp; Pull. 49.) In <em>Tidd, </em>632, it i*. laid down, that a <em>nolle prosequi </em>cannot be entered against one \u25a0 defendant, except for some matter operating to his personal discharge. Upon the same principle, the plaintiff cannot, declare against one, omitting the others.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-7\"><em>Beck, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFH\">admitted the distinction between process <em>bailable, </em>and <em>not bailable, </em>as established by the cases cited'; but he raised the question, to which class the process under consideration belonged ? The defendants have endorsed their appearance as upon a <em>capias not bailable ; </em>and does it now lie with them to make this objection ? The rights of hail are not in question, for none has been taken or exacted. It appeared to him that the principle of the cases cited did not apply; and that, after the1 endorsement of an appearance, though there was an <em>ac etiam, </em>the process was to be considered <em>not bailable.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-9\"><em>Paige, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsA\">said the distinction is between process <em>bailable </em>or <em>not, upon its face. </em>The reasoning of the Court, in the cases cited, applies to the character of the process, disconnected, altogether, with the circumstance of bail having been put in. That character is determined by the <em>ac \u2022 etiam.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b206-10\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ai\">Both according to the English rule and our own, the plaintiff may declare separately against the defendants, upon process <em>not bailable ; </em>but it is otherwise as to process <em>bailable. </em>This distinction is abundantly established by several of the cases referred to by the defendant\u2019s counsel; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>and the only question is, whether the <em>capias </em>is bailable or v A not, within the meaning of the rule. We think the circumstance of an appearance having been indorsed, does not vary the case, for the purposes of this proceeding. The true inquiry is, whether the action, as expressed in the <em>ac </em>etiam, calls for bail. The description of the process turns on the nature of the action, and the <em>ac etiam clause. </em>These being bailable, the process is so, without regard to the question, whether bail is, <em>in fact, </em>required, or not. We are, accordingly, of opinion, that the declaration is irregular.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Motion granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Note. Mr. <em>Paige </em>also urged in this case, and made it a part of his motion, that the <em>capias </em>should be set aside, also, as being against several defendants jointly, some of them in <em>their own right, </em>and others <em>en autre droit. </em>The Court refused to grant this part of the motion, by confining the rule \u2022to the declaration. On this point, <em>Paige </em>referred to 1 <em>Ch. Pl. </em>37 ; 1 <em>Dunlaps\u2019s Pr. </em>33; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Huffam, </em>(2 <em>Lev. </em>228;) <em>Vin. Abr. Actions, Joinder, </em>(C. d.) <em>pl. </em>5 and 6. It was probably deemed unnecessary, by the Court, to notice this part of the application, because, by setting aside the declaration, they put the plaintiffs to declare <em>de novo, </em>against all the defendants, in which case the mis-joinder, if any, must be carried forward into the declaration, and give the defendant full benefit of this objection, upon demurrer, or plea, according to the case there made by the plaintiffs. Indeed, this seems, by the authorities cited, to be the proper mode by which to take advantage of such a mis-joinder.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
