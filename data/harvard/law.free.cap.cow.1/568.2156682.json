One of the pleas was leave and license; to which the plaintiff replied, taking issue. On the trial, the defendant, amongst other things, set up a license from the plaintiff, to draw wood over the <em>locus in quo. </em>Upon this question the evidence was conflicting, but the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed the damages at 75 cents. The Court below were moved, in behalf of the plaintiff, for judgment, with full costs, which was denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-13\">Rule to shew causes</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-14\">At this terrri,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b580-15\"><em>I.

Y. sess. </em>41, <em>chi </em>94, <em>s. </em>5, Which provides, that in any suit cognizable before a Justice\u2019s Court, the plaintiff shall not have costs, unless his recovery exceed 50 dollars ; and contended that this action might have been tried there. It did not draw the freehold or title of land in question, within the meaning of the 1st sections in fhe 25 and 50 dollar acts, (1 <em>R. L. </em>387 ; <em>L. N. </em>Y. <em>sess. </em>41, <em>ch. </em>94, <em>s. </em>1) or the statute of costs. <em>(Farrington v. </em>R<em>ennie, </em>2 Caines\u2019 <em>Rep. </em>220. <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Hall, 3 John.

Iti that case it was decided, that where the action brings a right of way in question, the plaintiff is entitled to costs. But there is a wide difference between a right of way and a license. The license here was by parol\u2014a mere permission to pass over the land. A right of way is always by grant or prescription. It is a permanent interest, for an injury to which an action lies, and when set up by a defendant it al-</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ways draws the title to freehold in question, <em>pro tanto. </em>A lidense is a mere gratuity, revocable at the pleasure of the one who gives it. One gives his neighbour leave to go on foot through his field, or to enter his house\u2014does this vest any interest in the soil ? Or shall it be said that a litigation upon the question, whether such a license was granted, draws the title in question ? In <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>the effect of setting up a license to use another\u2019s land, was considered in reference to this very question; and the Court say, \u201c here \"was no claim of a right of entry into the plaintiff\u2019s land, n\u00f3r of any direct use or enjoyment of it.\u201d Again, they say, the nature of the defence was, \u201c that any consequential injury to the plaintiff was waived by his express license for that purpose; and that it was a mere <em>damnum absque injuria, </em>for which the plaintiff had no right of action.\u201d And they expressly distinguish a license from a right of way, and say, \u201c the case bears no analogy to that of <em>Heaton </em>v. Ferr\u00f3.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b581-5\"><em>Starkweather, </em>in support of the rule.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A82\">The plaintiff was entitled to costs, if the freehold or title to land in any wise came in question. (1 <em>R. L. </em>344, <em>s. 5.) </em>Freehold, with us, is property in its highest degree, and the owner hath <em>absolutum et directum dominium. </em>(2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>105.) Any act disputing or impairing this right, in the least degree, is bringing the freehold in question. Both the issue and the testimony went to question the unqualified interest of the plaintiff. The defendant claimed a limited right, as extensive as a right of way\u2014a kind of easement\u2014and had it been pleaded as a private right of way, the plaintiff would clearly have been entitled to costs. <em>(Heaton </em>v. <em>Ferris, 1 </em>John. <em>Rep. </em>146.) A way is an easement\u2014not an appurtenance. (2 <em>Ch. Pl. </em>358-9, <em>in the notes. Yelv. 159.) </em>It is as well granted by parol as otherwise, and does not imply any interest in the soil. It may be of limited duration, and for the very same purpose as claimed by the defendant here. <em>(The precedents in </em>2 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>575 <em>to </em>579.) And in <em>Wynkoop </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>(12 <em>John. </em>222,) a way, which had been granted by deed, was altered by parol, and the acts and acquiescence of the parties. Our case presents, the-, substantially, a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>upon a right of way. The question properly belonged t\u00a9 the Court of Common Pleas, and was not cognizable before a Justice. The Court will find the inquiry, when freehold or title is to be deemed in question before \u00e1 Justice,very fully considered and illustrated in <em>Comen\u2019s </em>Treatise, 14 to 16. He also cites <em>Griff elk\u2019s New-Jersey </em>Treatise, for several\u2019 cases on this subject. The case of <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Hall </em>is placed, by the Court, expressly on the ground, that \u201c there was no claim to a right of entry into the plaintiff\u2019s land, nor of any direct use or enjoyment of it. \u201c The defendant,\u201d say the Court, \u201c merely sets up a right to use his own land in the. manner he has done, by erecting the dam.\u201d They compare it to a consequential injury by a nuisance erected on the defendant\u2019s land, which does not bring,the plaintiff\u2019s title in question, though it injure him. In the case before the Court, the injury is not consequential, but direct.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b582-3\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AuK\">This is not like a right of way to which it <em>has been </em>likened in the argument. A right of way is an assignable property: it is a real or chattel interest, according to the' term of its duration, and the former is well known in the law as that sort of real property belonging to the class of incorporeal hereditaments. Not so of a licence to enter upon another\u2019s land, without consideration. This is not an interest. It is a mere authority, revocable at any moment, not in its nature assignable, but limited to the person of the grantee.Giving permission to walk across one\u2019s land is but an excuse for a trespass. The case of <em>Heaton </em>v. Ferris, referred to on the argument, views the subject in this light, and we think,disposes of the'question. That was an action on the case for consequential damages, occasioned by the defendant\u2019s mill dam, erected on his own land, overflowing the' plaintiff\u2019s land. The defendant set up'\u00e1 licence, which appeared to have been revoked. The plaintiff\u2019s verdict being but nine dollars, he applied for costs, on the ground that the freehold or title came in question, which the Court denied. There' Is no difference in principle, whether the action be case for a consequential injury, or, as here, trespass for a direct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Rule discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
