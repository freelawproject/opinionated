(2 <em>W. Bl. </em>1031, <em>and vid. </em>2 <em>T. R. </em>281.) But it will be sufficient, if, for instance it be proved, that the deed upon which the action is founded was enrolled within the county, <em>(Peake\u2019s Ev. </em>213,) or in an action by the assignees of a bankrupt, to prove that the commission issued, and the bankruptcy was declared in the county. (2 <em>M. </em>&amp; S. 36, but <em>vid. </em>1 <em>New Rep. 310,contra,) </em>or, it seems, to prove that the cause of action arose abroad, (1 H. <em>Bl. </em>280,) or, in an action in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Middlesex, to prove a payment of money into Court, even though the money were paid in after the rule to retain the venue was obtained. (2 <em>T. R. </em>275.) But the undertaking in this case must be understood to have reference only to the evidence necessary to support the declaration : and, therefore, if the defendant confess and avoid the whole cause of action, or plead a tender to the whole declaration, the plaintiff will not be bound to produce at the trial, the material evidence he undertook to give.
