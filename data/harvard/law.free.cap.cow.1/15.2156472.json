Bail in error was put in, and the recognizance was filed with the writ of error, and on <em>the same day </em>notice of these proceedings was served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The writ of error purported to have been issued out of the <em>Court of Chancery, </em>and was <em>tested </em>in the name of the <em>Chancellor, </em>sealed with the seal of <em>that Court, </em>and made <em>returnable </em>in the <em>Supreme Court of Judicature of the State of New-York, </em>on the first day of <em>May term, </em>1823. On the <em>18th </em>of <em>January, </em>the day before the writ of error, &amp;c. were filed, and notice given, a fieri <em>facias </em>was issued, which, on the next day, was executed by a levy upon the property of <em>Greenwood. </em>The Court of Common Pleas set aside this <em>fieri facias, </em>as irregular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\"><em>Blunt, </em>agreed that that the party has four days, after sign' ing judgment, within which to sue out and file his writ of error, or to put in bail upon a writ of error previously filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>That this was so, he referred to <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Bracebridge, (IT. Hi </em>280, <em>note </em>a;) <em>Brisban </em>and <em>Brannan </em>v. <em>Caines, </em>(11 <em>John. Rep\u00bf </em>197;) and <em>Lane et ah </em>v. <em>Bacchus, </em>(2 <em>T. R. </em>44.) But he denied Party was bound to wait one moment, after perfecting his judgment, to take out execution. This might be don\u00e9 <em>instanter. </em>True, it was at the plaintifl\u2019s <em>peril. </em>If <em>error </em>was brought, and bail put in within <em>the four </em>days, this <em>superseded </em>the execution; but did not affect its original regularity. And he said that the cases he had referred to, in 11 <em>John, </em>and 2 <em>T. R. </em>went upon this distinction ; and <em>Tidd,sBrae. </em>1073, laid down the same rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-5\">\u201c But it will be said, that the bill of exceptions stayed the proceedings. This is true of bills taken in the Supreme Court, since the <em>Stat. sess. </em>36, c. 3, <em>s. </em>4. (1 <em>R. L. </em>319.) The decision in <em>Hasbrouch </em>v. <em>Tappen, </em>(1 6 <em>John. Hep. </em>182,) that a bill of exceptions stays the proceedings, is grounded Upon this statute, which has no application to the Common Pleas. Under this statute, the Supreme Court still retain \u00e1 jurisdiction over the bill <em>quoad hoc ; </em>but the inquiry here, is how the matter stood at the common law. There the cause proceeds, and judgment is given, as if there were no bill of exceptions. This was decided in <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Bailie, </em>(1 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>32,) and the same rule is in 1 <em>Sell. Prac. </em>470. These authorities show, that a bill of exceptions in the Common Pleas does not, <em>per se, stay </em>the proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-6\">\u201c But this writ is a nullity. By statute <em>(Sess. </em>38, <em>c. </em>38, <em>s. 1,) </em>all original writs, formerly issuing out of Chancery, returnable in this Court, for the commencement of any <em>suit or proceeding, </em>shall hereafter issue out of and under the seal of this Court. The words are imperative; and writs of error can no longer issue out of Chancery. This Court, in regard to writs returnable here, are made the <em>oficina brevium, </em>instead of Chancery.\u201d <em>(Lynch </em>v. <em>MechanicIJs </em>Bank, 13 <em>John. </em>127. <em>)</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-7\"><em>Greenwood, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5\">The defendant has four clear days, after final judgment, within which to file his writ of error. <em>(Bennet </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>4 <em>T. R. </em>121.) And these are four clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>juridical </em>days. <em>(Hales </em>v. <em>Owen, Salk. </em>625.) The judgment being perfected on the <em>11th, </em>which was <em>Saturday, </em>we were then in season with our <em>writ of error </em>and <em>bail, </em>On <em>Friday </em>the <em>11th. Saturday </em>is excluded as being the first day, and <em>Sunday </em>as being <em>dies non juridicus. </em>And after the allowance of th\u00e9 writ of <em>error, </em>he had in this case, four <em>additional </em>days, within which to put in bail. The distinction is, that where the writ of <em>error </em>is allowed, and the allowance served <em>after </em>judgment signed, the party then has four days to put in bail, after <em>serving </em>the allowance. (2 <em>Sell. Pr. </em>373.) But if such service of th\u00e9 allowance be before judgment, he then has four days after <em>signing </em>judgment. <em>(Ibid, </em>1 <em>Rich. C. P. pr. </em>252. 2 <em>Tidd. </em>1084. 1 <em>Archbold, </em>224. <em>Gravall </em>v. <em>Stimpson, 1 B. &amp; P. </em>478.) And so long as the execution is executable but not executed, th\u00e9 writ of error is a supersedeas.\u2014 <em>(Perkins </em>v. <em>Woolaston, 1 Salk. </em>321. <em>Meriton </em>v. <em>Stevens, Willes, </em>271.) These rules apply to ordinary cases, where the record is complete, and all the matters appear upon the face of it. But this is a much stronger case. Where there is a <em>bill of exceptions, </em>the writ cannot be brought, until the record is perfected, by the signing and filing the <em>bill of exceptions. (1 Archbold, </em>186.) It was the duty of the Judge on <em>'tendering </em>the bill, to have set his <em>seal </em>to it, and we ought not to be prejudiced by any delay, which arose from taking time, by the Judge or the parties, to <em>settle </em>it, according to the facts. Until the bill is settled, the defendant cannot know whether to bring his writ of efror or not. The course is, to take out the writ, and after the bill is settled, it is attached-to the writ and takes effect. <em>(1 Archbold\u2019s Pract. </em>186. <em>Tidd, </em>791.) The Court below, then, having jurisdiction of the subject matter, had a right to make such rule in relation to this <em>fi. fa. </em>as it should think just and equitable, under the special circumstances of the case. It was a mere matter of practice ; and no case can be found, where this Court have interfered by <em>mandamus, </em>in a proceeding of this kind. The granting or refusing the rule to set aside the <em>fi.fa. </em>was matter of discretion, and having been passed upon, it is <em>res judicata, </em>and can no more be opened or disturbed, than the</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq8l\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>matters adverted td by the Chancellor, in <em>Gelston v. Codwise. </em>(1 John. Ch. Cas. 189.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMb\"><em>It is doubtful </em>whether <em>writs of error </em>are within the words <em>writs, </em>used by the statute. <em>(Sess. </em>38, <em>c. </em>38, s. 1.) If they are not, then the writ of error is regular, and is a <em>dear supersedeas </em>to the <em>fi. fa.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A2\"><em>T. A. Emmet, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqM\">agreed that where the Court below has a <em>discretion, </em>a <em>mandamus </em>will not lie, to control them in the exercise of it. But here is no <em>discretion. </em>The execution was regular, and it follows, that the Court had no power to prevent its issuing. Can the Judges supersede an execution <em>at discretion, </em>without any <em>reason </em>whatever ?\u25a0- ' The statute was intended to take away all jurisdiction over writs, formerly issued by the Court of Chancery, returnable in Courts of law ; and to transfer the whole of this power to the Court where the writ is returnable. The bill of exceptions is no stay of proceedings, and in <em>Hasbrouk </em>v. <em>Tappen, </em>(15 <em>John. </em>182,) the Court put it upon the <em>words of </em>the act, and recognize the ancient practice as being <em>different.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b28-8\"><em> Wells, arguendo, </em>p. 136,7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b30-7\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AiW\">In this ease the four <em>clear juridical </em>days, Which are allowed for bringing d writ of error, had not elapsed when execution issued. But here is no irregularity. Though the defendant has four days to bring error, the plaintiff may, in the mean time, issue execution, at his peril, Which is subject to be <em>superseded, </em>by filing a Writ of error, and putting in bail. <em>(Brisban &amp; Brannon </em>v. <em>Caines, </em>11 <em>John. Rep. </em>197.) But it is objected, <em>that here is no writ of error ; </em>and this draws in question the construction of the statute. <em>(Sess. </em>38, <em>ch. </em>38, <em>s. </em>1.) As far as we can learn, the practice under this act has been, to issue out of this Court <em>all writ\u00e1 </em>formerly issuing out of Chancery, returnable here, as well, <em>original writs, </em>properly so called, as <em>writs of error. We </em>are of Opinion, that this is the correct practice. The words ef the statute are, <em>original writs </em>for the commencement of any suit or proceeding. It is imperative ; <em>they shall hereof ter issue out of and under the seal of the Court, in which such writs may be returnable. </em>This was, undoubtedly, the commencement of a <em>proceeding, </em>within the words of the act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>In this view of the case, <em>the paper </em>purporting to be a <em>writ of </em>error, and filed as such, was a <em>nullity. </em>But as it did not appear that notice of the motion had been served on the Judges, the Court granted</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">A rule to show cause, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">On the <em>nth </em>of <em>May, </em>the time appointed in the rule .to show cause, <em>Blunt </em>moved to make the rule for a mandamus <em>absolute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\"><em>Greenwood, </em>produced the answer of the Judges, which did not vary <em>materially </em>from the facts, as they appeared on moving for the first rule. It appeared, however, that shortly after the writ of error, which issued out of Chancery, had been filed, the attorney for the defendant, supposing it might be <em>defective, </em>had procured a writ of error to be issued out of <em>this </em>Court, and filed with the Clerk, in the Court below, upon which, bail was put in. It farther appeared, that after the trial, the bill of exceptions had been drawn up by the attorney for the defendant, and amendments proposed by the attorney for the plaintiff; in consequence of which it was not settled and signed by the Judge who tried the cause, until the <em>lQth </em>of <em>January, </em>more than a <em>week </em>after the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\"><em>Greenwood, </em>now referred to <em>Wathen et al. </em>v. <em>Beaumont et al. </em>(11 <em>East, </em>271,) where it was holden, that <em>Sundays </em>and <em>Holy days </em>were excluded from the computation of time given to plead upon a <em>sci.fa. </em>though these may not happen on the last day. He also referred to <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Stacy, </em>(13 <em>East, </em>21,) which decides that the <em>first </em>and <em>last </em>days, as well as <em>Sundays, </em>9-re excluded, in counting time, upon a rule for judgment. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The principle of these decisions, he said, would give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>same time for bringing a writ of error. [Woodworth J, Admit this to be so ; was your writ of error a good one ?\u2022 We thought on granting the rule to show cause, that it was not.]</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><em>T. A. Emmet, </em>referred to the case of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Finely, </em>(4 <em>Taunt. </em>289,) as onp which he should use in his reply. He mentioned this case now, that the counsel opposed to the motion, might have an pppprtunity to answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"Az3\"><em>Fessenden, </em>for the defendant, said he supposed, that court-, se^ answering a rule to show cause, had the right of <em>reply, </em>which he should claim to exercise, if he thought it necessary ; to which the <em>Court </em>agreed. He insisted that the writ of error, <em>out of Chancery, </em>was not a mere <em>nullity. </em>It was <em>voidable </em>only, not <em>void. </em>If voidable, it would operate as a <em>supersedeas </em>till set aside ; and the Court below had no right to question its regularity. The statute does not declare, that an <em>original writ, </em>issued out of Chancery, shall be <em>void. </em>This Court have decided that a writ, though <em>not tested </em>in the name of the <em>Chief Justice, </em>is voidable, and may be amended. <em>(U. Slates </em>v. <em>Hanford, </em>19 <em>John. </em>173.) Yet this <em>test </em>is absolutely required by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">But the counsel and attornies in the Court below, did what was equivalent to an order to stay proceedings, in that Court. A bill of exceptions was drawn up, and amendments interchanged. The attorney for the plaintiff appearing, and ta'king part in settling the bill, was calculated to mislead,the attorney for the defendant, who was thereby prevented from obtaining an order. This Court have decided, that where the counsel for the parties submit to the Court a motion in arrest of judgment, it operates, <em>per se, </em>as a stay of proceedings. What the parties have done here is the same in effect. But if not, the Court below had a right to relieve against this strict practice, on the ground of misapprehension. <em>(The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York </em>v. <em>Sands, </em>2 <em>Caine's Rep. </em>378.) The same thing is done at every term of this Court. Here ample bail is given, and no evil can arise in allowing, full operation to the second writ of error. In granting a <em>mandamus, </em>this Court'exprcisp a discretionary power ; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>they will not interfere, in the exercise of that discretion, <em>merely </em>because the Court below may have erred in a <em>minute </em>particular. At any rate we now have a good writ of error, and though it may not stay execution, yet the Court will con- , , <em>J . </em>troi the money when collected, so as not to sufier it to pass into the plaintiff\u2019s hands. <em>(Miriton </em>v. <em>Stevens, Willes, </em>272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\"><em>Blunt fy T. A. </em>Emmet, contra, said that the writ of error was <em>void. </em>And there had been no surprise, to warrant the interference of the Court below. The writ issued out of a Court having no authority to grant it. Suppose it had issued from one of the <em>United States\u2019 </em>Courts, would the Judges have been bound to obey it ? The judgment having been perfected, it passed beyond the control of the Court below. Nor does the answer of the Judges put their proceeding upon the ground of <em>discretion. </em>True, a writ may be amended in the <em>test, </em>because it issues out of a proper Court; but you cannot amend the <em>fact, </em>that it issued out of the Court of Chancery. It is as much void to all intents, as if it had been issued by the <em>Common Pleas of Chenango. </em>Nor is this case like submitting a motion in arrest of judgment; for <em>that </em>comes before the Court in due and proper course ; and the <em>submission </em>would, in its nature, stay the proceedings. As to the disposition of the money when collected, they submitted it to the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"b33-11\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AZ5\">The facts <em>shewn for cause, </em>appear to be precisely the same, to every material purpose, as on granting the rule to shew cause ; and we see no sufficient reason for changing the opinion which we then expressed. The Court below misapprehended the practice, in supposing that execution could not go, within the <em>four days. </em>The plaintiff had a <em>qualified </em>right to his <em>fi. fa. </em>The <em>words </em>of the statute, undoubtedly, embrace <em>writs of error </em>; and this construction is \u25a0conformable to the general practice and understanding of the bar. Here there was no writ of error, and no bail. All is void. But a <em>second </em>and <em>valid </em>writ of error has been filed, and bail put in. This was not till after the <em>fieri facias </em>was executed ; and therefore, does not operate as a <em>superset</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3l\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>deas.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As here has been a misapprehension of the practice ; and as the defendant\u2019s counsel <em>insists, </em>and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel <em>submits, </em>that this Court should make such disPosition of the money, to be collected, as shall be equitable; let the money be paid into Court, to abide the event of the writ of error.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> The Clerk may pay it-to the plaintiff, on his giving security to refund; or it may be placed at interest, by the Clerk, on ,such security as he shall think proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Rule absolute, but without costs.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b31-12\"> In <em>rules </em>plead, in actions in general, a <em>Sunday </em>or <em>Holyday </em>reckons as a day, unless it be the <em>last.
