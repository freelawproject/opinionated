Spencer, </em>late Chief Justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The plaintiff, to support his action, produced <em>Abijah </em>0. <em>Houghton, </em>one of the acting deputies of the plaintiff as a witness ; who testified, that by virtue of an execution, issued out of the Court of Common Pleas, of <em>Orange </em>county, for $ 1332,17, in favour of one <em>Smith, </em>against the defendant, <em>Bull, </em>the witness, on the <em>9th September, </em>1818, levied on the goods and chattels in question, then in the possession of Bull; that after having made the levy, and taken an inventory, the defendants executed a receipt, annexed to the inventory, dated the same day, in the words following : \u201c Whereas, the goods and chattels specified in the above inventory, have been levied on by execution, by <em>Thomas S. Lockzoood, </em>Sheriff of <em>Orange County, </em>and left in the possession of us, the undersigned, at our special instance and request; in consideration of the above, we do engage and promise, that said property shall be forth coming, whenever called for by the said Sheriff, or any of his deputies.\u201d Upon the execution of this receipt, the witness left the property, and advertised the same for sale, for <em>Friday, </em>the <em>18th September, </em>on the premises of Bull; on which day he went there, for the purpose of selling, and demanded the goods. The defendants informed him that they were all there. Another witness proved, that the goods were there, as represented by the defendants. <em>Eager </em>expressed an unwillingness to stand security any longer for the forthcoming of the property; and wished to be relieved from his responsibility: At which moment, <em>Edzoard N. James, </em>who acted as <em>Bull's </em>attorney, served an order on the deputy, under the hand of the first Judge of the <em>Orange Common Pleas, </em>directing a stay of proceedings under the execution ; and, after considerable dispute in relation to the effect of the order, he went away, and left the premises and property. On the <em>Sunday </em>evening of the <em>20th September, James </em>took and carried away from the premises, a part of the property, consisting of a <em>clock, bureau </em>and <em>table, </em>and the next morning, th,e deputy went to <em>Bull's, </em>for the purpose of securing the property, but never did repossess himself of the goods in question. After being there a short time, <em>James </em>also came. A dispute immediately ensued, between <em>James </em>and the deputy, about the property. <em>James </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>said the deputy was a trespasser, and had no business with * the property, as long as the order was not vacated. During \u25a0 the dispute, <em>James </em>and the defendants often conferred together, and the defendants at length concluded to become responsible again, for the forthcoming of the property. The; inventory and receipt were shown to them in the presence of <em>James, </em>and they agreed, that this inventory and their undertaking should remain as formerly; and . that they would continue responsible: in consideration of which undertaking, the deputy then went away, and, a few days thereafter, advertised the property for sale, as before. On the day of sale, he again attended, and sold all he could find. <em>James </em>and the defendants were also present at the sale ; and after thus selling, he presented to the. defendants the inventory and receipt, and demanded the remainder of the property, which was not delivered ; having been removed several days before by <em>James, </em>and then being in his possession. A short time after the sale, in a conversation with <em>Eager, </em>in relation to his responsibility for the property, <em>Eager </em>said, he did not care a fig about it, , for. he weis indemnified. It also appeared that <em>Eager </em>acknowledged that <em>James </em>had indemnified him. The plaintiff also-proved, that after the re-assumption, <em>James </em>took and carried away the most valuable part of the goods and chattels, from off the premises, in the presence of, and with the as-\u00a1 sent and knowledge of <em>Eager. </em>It was then proved, that the goods and chattels\u2019, (except the <em>bureau, clock </em>and <em>table) </em>which were demanded, and not delivered, and had not been sold, were worth $576,77. \u25a0 It was then admitted, on the part of the plaintiff, that the property had, ever since the levy, remained in the county of <em>Orange </em>; that it was taken by <em>James, </em>claiming to be the owner, openly, and kept open-r ]y a short distance from the place where the levy was made, with the full knowledge of the Deputy Sheriff, and has be.en, at all times, accessible to him. A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, for $576,77, subject to the opinion of the Cour(, the above case,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Booth, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0ei\">The plaintiff, having shewn property in himself, relies on the demand and refusal, as legal evidence of a conversion. Even if there had been no evidence of what became of the property, the plaintiff would bp entitled to recover upon this evidence, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Again: here was an actual conversion, by surrendering the property to <em>James, </em>which the defendants knew would defeat the intended sale, and subject the Sheriff to hazard and expense.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Neither James\u2019 acts, nor the Sheriff\u2019s knowledge of tjhem, form any excuse for the defendants. The fair inference from the .ease is, that the defendants were privy to the designa of <em>James, </em>and ,acted in concert with him. Th ere is reason to believe, that they received the goods, originally, with the design of favouring his claim.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-10\"><em>Wisner, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArN7\">1. There was no consideration for the second agreement of the defendants. The goods were at the place, according to the first undertaking ; the order to stay proceedings was served : and it appears from the case, that the Sheriff never re-possessed himself of the goods ; so that he could not r.e-deliver them to the defendants, as a consideration fbr their second undertaking.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-11\">2. The plaintiff, if he can recover at all; has mistaken his remedy. The action should have been <em>assumpsit. </em>The basis of the suit was the written promise ; on which assumpsit would clearly have lain. Where the party has a clear remedy, it is against the policy of the law, to allow him to resort to a doubtful one. This case is not distinguishable from <em>Serjeant </em>v. <em>Blunt, </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> There the defendant received the goods for sale ; and thereby assumed to obey the plaintiff\u2019s directions. He sold them contrary to orders ; and the Judge, wh,o delivered the opinion of the Court, says, (p. 70) \u201c if every departure from instructions is to expose a man to an action of trover, I should consider it as introducing a new rule, which might operate injuriously. There is no need of this refinement. An action on the case is well calculated to redress any injury arising from a breach of instructions.\u201d To maintain trover, the act must be tortious. <em>Bull </em>cannot be liable | for no tortious act is shewn on bis part. He rq-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>ceived, and assunied with Eager, to return the goods, but they were out of his possession, when the demand was~ i~iade. They were removed without his interference, directly or indirectly. No tortious act of Eager is shewn. The goods were merely removed in his presence ; and he did not object to it. Indeed, he had no authority to object, after having surrendered the goods to the Sheriff on the 18th. Not being re-delivered, he had no longer any control over theme. No conversion is shewn. The plaintiff ~s right, derived from n levy under the fi. fa. could not be changed, while the goods remained in the county, openly, with his knowledge~ and at all times accessible to him. To shew a conversion, e~ vi termin~i, implies that some change must be shewn in the property of the goods. In the case of Syeds v. Hay,<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> which goes farthest- to maintain the action, <em>Buller, J. </em>says, \u201c If a person take my horse to ride, and leave him at an inn, that is a conversion; for, though I may have my horse on sending for him, and <em>paying for the keeping of him, yet it brings a charge upon me.- </em>So has the defendant, by putting these goods into the custody of the wharfinger, <em>brought \u25a0a charge on the plaintiff.n- </em>It will be seen by a subsequent part of the opinion, that the wharfage became due by the delivery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-6\">3. The damages are too high. It is evident, from the case, that they are for the value of the goods, excepting the <em>bureau, clock </em>and <em>table, </em>(which had been taken away by <em>James, </em>before the second agreement) and such articles as were sold by the Sheriff. Of the articles which <em>James </em>took and carried away, a part only were removed in the presence of <em>Eager, </em>or with his assent or knowledge.. How many were taken by <em>James </em>privately, or by others, is unknown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-7\"><em>Booth, </em>in reply. The defendants now say, what they should have alleged only at the time of .the re-assumption. By the re-assumption, they adopted the receipt, which contains an acknowledgment of the property being in them. It is said the Sheriff could not deliver possession. But, on the 22d, the Sheriff was at the premises, and fully resumed his possession of all the property, except the three articles taken away by <em>James. </em>\u25a0All the residue of the property was\u00a1 present. All opposition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>at length, ceased ; and all parties concurred in renewing the assumption. By this, the order to stay proceedings was waived ; and the property was left in the hands of the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-4\">Trover is the proper action. The safe keeping of the property, and having it in readiness for the Sheriff, was the only object. This object the defendants have altogether departed from and violated. They are not complained of for doing their duty negligently. They have violated their whole duty 3 and the case is most palpably distinguishable from that of <em>Serjeant </em>v. <em>Blunt, </em>where the defendant had express authority to <em>sell. </em>The complaint was, \u201c that he <em>sold </em>for a less sum, and thus violated his orders,\u201d as was observed by the Chief Justice. There was a permission to do the act. In the present case, if the defendants can be deemed, in judgment of law, to have acted at all, in parting with the possession of the property, their act must be considered tortious. \u201c The defent dants come with an ill grace, to turn the plaintiff round to another form of action, which may better accommodate their own views. It is a sound rule that no man shall found any claim of defence upon his own iniquity,'<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> In Syeds v. Hay,<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> Ld. Kenyon says. \"If no wharfage be due, of which there is not satisfactory evidence, I think this action may be maintained against the</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-9\">~ <em>Bull </em>is chargeable with a conversion. The property, origi- nally his, when levied on, was delivered into the joint posses- sion of him and <em>Eager, </em>who received it as his friend. It was afterwards delivered by <em>Eager to James, </em>the attorney of <em>Bull, </em>doubtless with the consent of the latter. But this was not- made a point at the trial. The attorney for <em>Bull </em>should have applied for his separate acquittal, when the plaintiff might have supplied the requisite proof of his agency, if any was necessary. The question reserved was the general one, whether trover would lie ? The defendants have joined in their plea, and \u201c the Court cannot sever them, and say that one is guilty, and the other not, when they have put them- selves on the same</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-11\">terms.\"<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> The goods did not remain so far in the power of the plaintiff that his rights were, not altered. In Syeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Bizller, J. says, \"If one man, who is entrusted with th~ goods of another, put them into the hands of a third person, contrary to orders, it is a conversion.\" The property was taken with the assent of the defendants, and Eager was indemnified by Jainss. They stop the sale, and the Shcriff must incur the trtuble and expense of re-possessing himself of the property, or institute a suit or suits at law thus they bring a charge upon him. \"It is this charge which is to regulate the damages, but whether it be more or less, ~ann vary the question as to the conversion. It is the breach of the trust, or the abuse of such lawful possession, which ccinstitutes the conversiOn. Whether the party has to pay more or 1ess~ to get back his property, does not alter th~ principle.\"<footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-10\">The damages are not too high. It is plain, from the case, that the va1ue of those goods only, taken by Jan~es, with the assent of Eager, were allowed by the jury. The verdict is one, by consent, for that amount, subject to the opinion. of the Court on distinct questions.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\"><em> Durell </em>v. <em>Mosher, </em>8 <em>John. </em>445. <em>Bristol v.

That extends to such part as then remained in their possession.</p>\n<p id=\"A0O5\">It is contended that, as the Sheriff never re-possessed him- \u25a0 s'elf of the goods, he could not deliver them as the consider--\u2022 ation for the last agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"AoN\">When the plaintiff called the second time, the defendants mpst be considered as having the custody of all the-goods, except a clock, bureau and table, which, the case states, were taken away from the premises by <em>James, </em>on the \u2018 20 <em>th September. </em>The Sheriff made a levy previously; they were legally in his possession; he might have removed the goods, but did not. The consideration for the promise, is his suffering them to remain in the defendants\u2019 hands.-</p>\n<p id=\"b340-20\">It is also urged, that the plaintiff has mistaken his actionift bringing trover ; that assumpsit was the proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-22\">That assumpsit may be maintained, \u00cd am not disposed to - dtfny. If, however, the plaintiff can prove all that is neces:* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>'\u2022\u00a1try to support trover, he may well adopt that form of action. He had his election. Thus, where goods are deliv\"ered by way of pledge, after the payment of the money, or a tender and refusal, the pawnor may either bring \u00e1n action of assumpsit, and declare that the defendant promised t\u00f3 return the goods, upon request, or trover, the property being vested in him by the tender. <em>(Yelvefton, </em>178; <em>Buller's </em>N. P. 72.) So, also, where goods ar\u00e9 delivered to a carrier j the plaintiff may either bring trover, or an action on the case, on the custom. If the former, he incurs this risk; that the defendant may give in evidence, that the goods were stolen ; and, if h\u00e9 does, then he is guilty of no conversion, though he would be liable in \u00e1n action on the custom. (2 <em>Salk. </em>655.) In the present case, by electing to bring trover, the, plaintiff must prove \u00e1 conversion. If he had brought assumpsit, it would be immaterial whether there was a conversion or not. There is nothing in the case of <em>Serjeant </em>v. <em>Blunt, </em>(16 <em>John. </em>74) to support the objection. There trover was brought for selling the plaintiff\u2019s goods at a less price than that fixed on. The action failed, because the defendant, having authority to sell, the s\u00e9lling was not a conversion, but \u00e1 breach of duty. It did not turn on the question, whether the plaintiff could waive the assumpsit. The only remaining enquiry then, is, whether the plaintiff has proved a conversion ag\u00e1inst both the defendants ? for, without this, the verdict Cannot be sustained. If a conversion is proved against one only, the joinder of the other, in an action in form, <em>ex delicto, </em>is no objection ; for one may b\u00e9 acquitted, and a verdict taken against the other. (1 <em>Ch. Pl. </em>74.) Such ought to have been the finding here. If a conversion, by both, is not proved, the verdict must be set aside, unless modified by assent of parties. In <em>Nicol </em>v. <em>Glennie and others, </em>(1 <em>M. </em>&amp; <em>S. </em>588) a joint conversion against all not being proved., it was held that the evidence did not warrant the finding, and a new trial was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">With respect to <em>Eager\u00a1 </em>there is proof of an actual conversion ; for the goods were taken by <em>James, </em>in his presence, and with his assent. This was assuming the right to dispose \u25a0of the property1, and exercising a dominion ever it, to the eje - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>elusion of the pia'miifps right. <em>(Bristol </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>7 <em>John </em>254.) Wherever'a person, entrusted with the goods of an\u00bb other, puts them into the hands of a third person, without orders, it is a conversion. <em>(Syeds </em>v. <em>Hay, </em>4 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>264. 1 Ch. <em>Pl. </em>153.) It does not appear that <em>Bull </em>acted in concert with' his eo-dfefendant, 'in ,delivering the property to <em>James, </em>or that he had any knowledge Of the <em>fact. </em>The demand. made <em>by </em>the plaintiff will not sustain the verdict\u00bb The law is well settled, that Where the defendant comes to the possession of the chattel; in a lawful way, and an actual conversion is, not proved, evidence of a demand and refusal is, generally, <em>prima facie, </em>evidence of a conversion. (3 <em>Bac. Trover, G. Bull. N. </em>P. 4.) Had it not appeared that, previous to the demand, the property Was taken away, the evidence Would have been sufficient; it wtiuld, in that case, be considered, that the property, being in possession of the defendants, was unlawfully withheld. (6 <em>Bac. </em>606, <em>Trover, G.) A </em>demand, and non-compliance, are, <em>prima facie, </em>evidence of a conversion, and \u2022will induce a jury <em>to </em>find it; unless the defendant adduce evidence to negative the presumption. (1 <em>Chitty, </em>155. <em>Buller, </em>44. <em>Peake, </em>298. 2 <em>Saund. </em>[47 e] <em>n. </em>1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\">But it is competent for the defendants to give, in evidence, every thing Which tends to prove there was no conversion. (6 <em>Bac. </em>707. <em>Buller, </em>48.) In this, I think, they have succeeded, so far as respects the defendant, <em>Butt. It </em>is not shown that he ever exercised any control over the property. It was left in Ms possession; and, for aught that appears, was taken without Ms knowledge or consent. The law will not, without evidence, indulge a presumption that he did an unlawful act. .</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Trover cannot be supported for a mere non-performance. Where the goods are lost, by negligence, the remedy must be case or assumpsit\u00bb (2 <em>Saund. </em>[47 e] <em>n. 1. </em>1 <em>Ch. Pl. </em>150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">If it appear that the chattel was lost, by the defendant, or that he was robbed before it was demanded, evidence, of\" a; refusal is not evidence of a conversion. (6 <em>Bac. </em>706.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>The property in question was left with the defendants, for safe keeping. In such case, it is held, they are not answerable to the person in whom the general property is, for the conversion by a stranger, unless the conversion be owing to some gross neglect. (2 <em>Lord Raym. </em>913,914, 915. 6 <em>Bac. </em>686.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Without, however, considering the extent of the liability, had the action been on the agreement fo deliver, it is very clear that no conversion, by Bull, is proved. That being \u2022 indispensable, in this form of action, to warrant the finding, the verdict must be set aside, and a new trial granted, with costs, to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The objection to the amount of damages is not well founded. As I understand the case, the verdict is for the value of the goods taken by <em>James, </em>after the defendants b\u00e9came a second time responsible.</p>\n<author id=\"b343-7\">Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkO\">The principal questions arising upon this case, are two. 1. Whether the undertaking of the defendants is one upon which they can be charged at all: and, 2. Whether, admitting them to be liable, the action should not have been <em>assumpsit, </em>instead of <em>trover.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The case states that, on the 21st of <em>September, </em>three days after the first undertaking of the defendants had expired, the plaintiff, by his deputy, went to the house of <em>Bull, </em>where all the property in question was, (except a clock, a bureau, and a table, which had been taken away by <em>James) </em>for the purpose of recovering the articles which had been removed, and of taking them, together with the others, into his custody and possession ; that the defendants, after conferring together, at length concluded to become responsible again, for the forthcoming of the property. The inventory and original receipt were then shewn to them; and <em>they agreed that said inventory and undertaking should remain as formerly, and that they would continue responsible : </em>In consideration whereof, the plaintiff went away and left the property. All the articles upon the inventory, except those which had been taken by <em>James, </em>were then in the house and on the premises of <em>Bull, </em>in the presence and within the reach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the parties, at the time of the arrangement. They werti not only in construction of law, but in fact, in the possession? of the plaintiff. He had a. legal right to protect that possession by force, or to remove the articles to. any other place. Being thus in possession, and having such rights, and intending to exercise them, the defendants, in consideration of being permitted to have the possession and use of the property, undertook to be responsible fon its forthcoming, on demand. No formal delivery of possession was necessary, from the plaintiff to the defendants. The property was before them, under their control, and so left by the plaintiff. This was a sufficient delivery. The possession of the property was a valuable and sufficient consideration, to support the promise of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The promise not being in writing, forms no ground of objection to it. The statute of frauds has no application to the case. The defendants, therefore, are clearly responsible for the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">2. Trover will well lie for its non-delivery- It is not questioned, that a Sheriff, after having levied upon goods and chattels, by virtue of a <em>fi. fa. </em>has a sufficient property in them to enable him to maintain trespass, or trover, against any person who takes them away and converts them. (2 <em>Saund, </em>[47 <em>a] n. </em>1. <em>Barker </em>&amp; <em>Knapp </em>v. Miller, 6 <em>John. Rep. </em>195. <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. M\u2019<em>Vickar, </em>12 <em>John. </em>403.)</p>\n<p id=\"AP60\">The evidence of the conversion, by the defendants, as stated in the case, is conclusive. The plaintiff went to the house of <em>Bull, </em>to sell the property: he sold all he could find, and then presented the inventory and receipt to the defendants, and demanded the residue, which was not delivered. This demand and refusal were all that it was necessary for the plaintiff to show, in order to prove the conversion by the defendants.<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark> What had become of the goods;1 whether they had been lost, or sold, or secreted by the defendants, was a.matter concerning which he was not bound to inquire. \u2019 Nor was it his duty to pursue and take them fr\u00b0m *h\u00ae possession of <em>James. </em>Admitting he had a right to do so, he had his election, either to do that, or resort to thy1<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>defendants. He determined that election, by bringing this action. A case in which the action of trover is more peculiarly proper, can hardly be imagined.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The evidence of a conversion is sufficient, against both defendants. The goods were left upon the premises of <em>Bull, </em>in his immediate care. It is difficult to perceive how they could have been removed in the manner stated by the case, without his consent, connivance, or gross neglect. It is not enough, that there is no evidence of his agency in their removal. The demand and refusal are admitted to be, <em>prima facie, </em>evidence of a conversion, in <em>Bull </em>as well as <em>Eager. </em>Thus a case is made out against <em>Bull. </em>This is not repelled by the mere circumstance, that the goods were taken away by another, without its appearing that the removal was accompanied with such force or fraud as did not leave the goods perfectly within <em>BulPs </em>control. He gave no explanation at the time of the demand. He made no effort, nor even expressed a wish to see them restored, although they are admitted, by the case, to have been perfectly accessible. These circumstances, and the relation in which he stood, both to <em>Eager </em>and <em>James, </em>render it difficult to resist the conclusion, that he participated in their acts. To my mind, so far from affording a satisfactory reason for <em>BlulPs </em>refusing to deliver the goods, their removal, connected with other facts appearing in the case, tend rather to prove an <em>actual </em>conversion by both defendants. I am, accordingly, of opinion, that the plaintiff is entitled to a judgment upon the verdict.</p>\n<author id=\"b345-9\">Savage, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4J\">To maintain trover, the plaintiff must shew property in himself, general or special; and a conversion by the defendant. The special property acquired by the levy, is sufficient to maintain the action ; and the demand and refusal ar <em>e,prima facie, </em>evidence of a conversion. They are, however, but <em>prima facie </em>evidence, and it is contended, that from the whole case, no conversion appears. The plaintiff, being lawfully possessed of the property, on /the <em>9 th </em>of <em>September, </em>delivered it to the defendants, to be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>delivered on demand. On the 18th, the plaintiff\u2019s deputy-demanded the property ; and it was virtually returned to him. On the <em>20th, </em>it became again the subject of negotiation ; and the defendants renewed their former contract and liability. <em>James </em>was permitted to take away the articles in question, on a claim of title in himself, and <em>Eager </em>received an indemnification from <em>James, </em>for this breach of trust. \u201c It is the breach of trust, or the abuse of such lawful possession, which constitutes the conversion.\u201d<footnotemark>(j)</footnotemark> Again, \u201c if one man who is entrusted with the goods of another, put them into the hands of a third person, contrary to orders, it is a ppnversion.\u201d<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark> Indeed, in the case last cited, the Court sustained the action, where the defendant, being entrusted with the gopds, delivered them to a wharfinger <em>for the plaintiff S-use. </em>Here the case is stronger. <em>James </em>is permitted to take the goods, with the avowed intention of <em>defeating the plaintiffs claim, </em>|t is no answer, in a case of bailment, to say that the plaintiff has his remedy on the agreement, or that he might have gone and retaken the goods. He may also have trover. Bailment presents a familiar instance of the election of remedies.<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-24\">It is contended, that this case is not distinguishable froni Serjeant v. Blunt.<footnotemark>(m)</footnotemark> That was trover, ~or selling a chronometer at the price of 300 dollars, whereas the defendant was expressly instructed net to sell for less than 500 dollars. In that case, the defendant had an authority to dispose of the article in question, Not so here : The express contract of the defendants was, <em>to deliver the goods to the plaintiff, </em>or one of his deputies. It is evident, from the reasoning of the Chief Justice, in <em>Sarjeantr. Blunt, </em>that, had the defendant sold without any authority to sell, trover would have been the proper action. He virtually admits, that if the-selling had been tortious, trover would have lain against the purchaser ; but the selling was not tortious: And why was if not ? Because the defendant had authority to sell. How was it in this case ? The defendants had no authority- to de-liver the goods to any one but the plaintiff. There can be. no doubt that the act was tprtious ; and that an action might, have been sustained against <em>James.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>1 am accordingly of opinion, that the form of action is right; and that a conversion is proved as to <em>Eager. </em>But I concur in the opinion, that a conversion is not proved against <em>Bull; </em>and a new trial must, for that reason, be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">New trial granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(i)\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\"><em>LPlace v.
