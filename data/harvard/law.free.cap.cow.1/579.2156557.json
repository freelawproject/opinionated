No information was given to the Coroners of <em>Seneca, </em>to whom the attachment was directed, of the amount of the <em>fi. fa. </em>either by endorsemcet on the attachment, or otherwise. One of the Coroners arrested the defendant, who entered into a recognizance before a Judge of the Common Pleas, with .sureties, to appear, in the penal sum of 50 dollars only. The defendant, on being called, did not appear upon the 'recognizance.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-8\">J. <em>C.

I know of no course for securing competent bail, unless the Court require notice, as in <em>England, </em>that bail will be put in, which then gives the chance to <em>except </em>for insufficiency, or object to the smallness of the penalty. We certainly cannot prosecute with safety upon this recognizance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>without being also allowed to proceed by an <em>alias. </em>This, ^le Court have an undoubted right to grant. The ancient course was to bring in the defendant\u2019s body on the attach.\u2122ent&gt; uP\u00b0n which he was recognized in open Court to appear <em>de du: in diem ; </em>afterwards a single Judge of the Court was allowed to take the recognizance, and now, by statute, (1 R. <em>L. </em>321,) a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. This being a criminal proceeding, the defendant not only forfeits his recognizance, but the Court may, as in other cases of that sort, compel a personal appearance, with a view to inflict an adequate punishment for the offence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b592-6\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Asd\">Direction should have been given to the Coroner in what amount to take bail. We deny the motion to es-treat the recognizance, which would be to accumulate costs unnecessarily. But we grant a rule for an <em>alias </em>attachment, which will answer every requisitp purpose, without a suit upon the recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Rule accordingly.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">\" Accordingly, an <em>alias </em>issued thus : \u00ab To the Coroners of the county of <em>Seneca, </em>Greeting ; We command you, as we have before commanded you, that you attach <em>Josiah B. Chapman, </em>Sheriff of our said county, so that you may have him before our Justices, &amp;e. at the <em>Capitol, </em>in the city of <em>Albany, </em>on the third <em>Monday </em>of <em>February </em>next, to answer to us for certain trespasses and contempts, done and committed in our said Court, before Us, and have you then there this writ.

Rhoad, Cornr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">On the service of an attachment, for whatever cause, the <em>English </em>hooks direct (as to the manner in which the defendant is to be disposed of) thus : \u201c He is brought into Court, or before a Judge at chambers, and sworn to answer interrogatories; he is then committed, unless, with leave of the Court or Judge, he enter into a recognizance, with sureties, for his appearance in Court from day to day, to answer interrogatories concerning such matters as may be objected against him, Or the defendant may appear voluntarily, and be sworn and enter into the recognizance as above mentioned\u2014serve a notice on the opposite party, that the defendant will appear in Court, or before a Judge at chambers, on a certain day, in order to enter into recognizance, and be sworn to answer all such interrogatories as shall be exhibited againt him, stating the names and addition of the bail. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>,as in ordinary cases. This notice should be given 24 hours, at least, previous to the defendant\u2019s being brought up, if the bail reside in town ; or 2 days, or more, if they reside elsewhere, according to the distance. Then get a rule from the Clerk of the rules on the Crown side, to bring up the defendant, if he be in custody of the Marshal; hut if in custody of the Sheriff, it seems, a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>will be necessary. <em>(Imp. C.B. </em>570.) When brought up, the bail justify, and the recognizance is taken as in ordinary cases. It is entirely discretionary with the Court or Judge whether they will allow the defendant tobe bailed or not; and in very gross cases, or where the defendant appears evidently guilty, they usually refuse it (2 <em>Hawk. c. </em>22, <em>s. </em>1.\u201d 2 <em>Archbold's Pr. of the King\u2019s </em>Bench, 299,300.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">By the act concerning the Supreme Court, (1 <em>R. L. </em>321, <em>s. </em>13,) it is provided, \u201cthat if any person shall hereafter be arrested upon any process issuing out of the said Court, whereon a recognizance may now be taken, before one of the J udges of the said Court, it shall and may he lawful for an y Judge of any Court of Common Pleas in this state, to take any such recognizance, and thereupon deliver the same to the officer who shall make the arrest, whose duty it shall be, to transmit the same, with the process, to the Clerk of the Supreme Court, residing at the place where the Court shall be to be holden, and the return of such process and recognizance so taken, shall be deemed as valid as if taken before a Judge of the Supreme bourl.\u201d ,</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Accordingly, on arrest upon the above recited <em>alias </em>attachment, a recognizance was taken thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">\n<em>Stale ofMw-York\u2014Seneca County, ss.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\u201c Be it remembered, that on the 14f/t day of <em>February, </em>A.
