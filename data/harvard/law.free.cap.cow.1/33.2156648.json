B. DavIs, for the defendant, moved to set aside the execution, which was <em>tested </em>the <em>11 th of August last. </em>The plaintiff <em>died </em>the <em>14th </em>of the same month, of which the defendant was Informed, for the first time, on the 1 <em>st </em>day of <em>Feh- </em>, , , <em>ruary </em>last.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ACn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The judgment was recovered upon a bond, for the cousideration money of land, purchased of the plaintiff by the defendant, the title to which had failed, as he had lately hear&lt;l. and believed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b46-5\">Davis, insisted that where the plaintiff dies before execution, it cannot issue until <em>scire facias, </em>and judgment in favour of his representative. Here, the execution not only <em>issues, </em>hut is <em>tested </em>after the plaintiff\u2019s death. And, to shew that this was irregular, he referred to <em>Tidd, </em>915, 916, and cases there cited, and 6 <em>T. R. </em>368. And though this <em>test </em>is in term, it shall not relate to the first day thereof, so as to <em>overreach </em>the plaintiff\u2019s death. The term shall not be esteemed one day for the purposes <em>of </em>a test. (1 <em>JVils. Rep. </em>42.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-6\"><em>E. </em>Williams, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abn\">moved to amend, by altering the <em>lest </em>to some day in term, previous to the <em>Mth of August.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-7\"><em>Davis, </em>said this could not be done. That this case differed materially from the one mentioned in the books, of an execution tested before, though issued after the death of a <em>defendant. </em>For here, the authority of the attorney, who issues the execution, is revoked by the <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>death.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b46-8\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"At1\">As <em>between the parties, </em>the execution has relation to its <em>test. (Tidd, </em>915.) The statute <em>(Sess. </em>36, <em>ch. </em>50, <em>s. </em>6, 1 <em>R. L. </em>501,) was intended for the benefit of <em>purchasers, </em>and does not alter the common law, as to the <em>party, </em>or his <em>personal representatives. (Horton </em>v. <em>Ruesby, Comb. </em>33.) <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Accordingly, an execution, tested <em>before </em>the party\u2019s death, is regular, though it issue afterwards; and this rule extends to both parties. <em>(Cleve </em>v. <em>Veer, Cro. Car. </em>459. <em>Croke arguendo.) </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This execution is irregular, as being tested <em>after </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s death. <em>(Heapy </em>v. Parris, 6 <em>T. R. </em>368.) But we think it maybe amended. Here are no equitable circumstances, precluding an amendment. The failure of ti-tie would have been no defence to the action on the bond ;<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> and if otherwise, it is too loosely made out to be noticed here. And the rule to amend is granted, on payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\"><em> </em>In this case, \u201c Sir <em>G.
