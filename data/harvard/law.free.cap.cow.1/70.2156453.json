As to the objection that the <em>heir </em>was not summoned, he read an affidavit, shewing that <em>Eden\u2019s </em>whole estate had been <em>devised. </em>He insisted, in answer <em>to </em>the 3d objection, that <em>tertenants </em>and <em>devisees </em>are not an exception to the general rule, which prevails in the proceeding by <em>sci. fa. </em>that two <em>nihil s </em>are equivalent to a <em>scire feci.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-8\"><em>Burr, </em>said there was always an <em>heir </em>at law, for the purposes of a <em>sci. fa. </em>The will may be void ; and the heir should always be brought in.

But such an objection cannot b\u00e9' . \u2022 <em>J </em>urged in this form. It should have been pleaded in <em>abate-</em>merit. The case of <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Camp et al. </em>(3 <em>John. Rep, </em>88,) *s a decisive answer to this ground. It is equally well settled that two <em>nihils </em>are equal to a return of <em>scire feci </em>; and the rule applies to a proceeding against heirs, devisees and tertenants, provided they are <em>named </em>in the writ. But where it is against the heirs, devisees and tertenants, generally, <em>without naming </em>them, it is not sufficient to return <em>nihil, </em>but the Sheriff must return, whether there are any such persons in his bailiwick. He must say either that there arc, none, or that he has warned thejln to appear, naming and describing them, as tenants of all the lands in his bailiwick, &amp;c. or certain lands in his bailiwick, &amp;c. and that there are no others. <em>(Tidd's Prac. </em>1038. 2 <em>Wins. Saund. </em>72, <em>r. Panton </em>v. <em>Hall, Carth. </em>105. <em>S. C. </em>2 <em>Salk. </em>598.)<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The writ, in this case, being general against the <em>tertenants, </em>the return of <em>nihil </em>simply, was, therefore, not sufficient to warrant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>|&gt;iamtiff\u2019s second writ, and subsequent proceedings. But, if tlie return were good, the 2d writ did n\u00f3t lie a sufficeint time in the Sheriff\u2019s office. The rules and practice of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, are ours, in those cases not provided for by the rules of this Court. The length of time during which a <em>sci. fa. </em>shall be left in the office of the Sheriff, depends upon the general rule in that Court. (5 <em>Geo. </em>2.) That rule declares, that every writ of <em>scire facias, </em>of which notice shall\" be given to the defendant, shall be left in the office four days before the return, <em>exclusive </em>of the day of the return; and that every writ of <em>alias scire facias </em>shall be left in the office four days, <em>exclusive, before the return. </em>In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Farr, </em>(4 <em>Barnw. &amp; Alders. </em>357,) that Court decided, that, under this rule, the <em>latter four days </em>must be exclusive of the day on which the writ is lodged with the Sheriff, and of the return day also. Testing this case by that decision, to which we assent, the plaintiff has, clearly, been irregular. Here were but four days, <em>including </em>the return day of the <em>alias scire facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-22\">Motion granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b84-6\"> The exception made in <em>Tidd's Pract. </em>and <em>Saund. Rep. </em>cited in this case, that where the writ is general, <em>nihil </em>will not do, is grounded on books of entries there referred to, which contain, simply, the form of the return in such case, viz. <em>Co. Ent. </em>622, <em>a. Herne, </em>327; <em>Dalt. Sher. </em>559; <em>Thes. Brev. </em>269,96, 279,288; <em>Lill. Ent. </em>385, 386; with <em>Carth. </em>105, and 2 <em>Salk. </em>598 ; sanctioning these forms. They also refer to the form of <em>nihil </em>against an heir and <em>terretenants, </em>or against them severally, in <em>Thes. Brev. </em>253, 271, 283. <em>Lill. Ent. </em>385; <em>Tidd\u2019s Pract. Forms, </em>457; <em>Off. Brev. </em>278,282, 286 ; and of <em>nihil </em>as to the heir, and <em>scire feci </em>to the <em>terre-ienants </em>of one defendant, and <em>nihil </em>as to the heir and <em>terre-ienants </em>of another, <em>Tidd's Pract. Forms, </em>457. There seems to be no adjudged case, until the present, which, in terms, either sanctions or denies two <em>nihils, </em>in a proceeding against <em>terre-ienants, </em>&amp;c. This question was discussed by Mr. <em>Campbell </em>and Mr. <em>Henry, </em>in <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Croghan, </em>20 <em>John. </em>111, 117, and the absurdity of allowing two <em>nihils, </em>in such a case, much insisted upon; and Mr. <em>Butler </em>and Mr. <em>Talcott, </em>(A. G.)p. 114, on the other side, admit, that in such a ease, the <em>terre-ienants </em>may be let in to defend, on disclosing a good defence. But the cause turning on another point, this question was not decided. The form of the <em>nihil, </em>on the general writ, is thus : \u201c There are not any heirs, or tenants of the lands or tenements, whereof the within named C. <em>D. </em>was seized, at the time of the rendition of the judgment within mentioned, or ever after, in my bailiwick, whereby 1 can give notice to them, or either of them, as within I am commanded.\u2019? <em>Imp. Sh. </em>486, and vid. <em>Tidd's Pract. Forms, </em>287, <em>Alb. ed. </em>Now it is clear, that the sheriff could make no other return than this, except <em>scire feci; </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u2022if there be heirs, or <em>lertenanls, </em>in his county, or, if they reside elsewhere, and have lands in his county, it would be false, on its face, to make the common return of <em>nihil, </em>viz. \u201c They have nothing in my bailiwick, where, or by which, I can give them notice, as within I am commanded, nor are they found within the same.\u201d <em>(Imp. Sh. </em>485, and vid. <em>Tidd\u2019s Pract. Forms, Alb. </em>ed.286.) Whereas, if the heirs and tertenants be named in the writ, the proceedings seem to stand on the same footing, in this particular, as those on any other sci\". <em>fa. </em>where the defendants are designated. <em>They </em>may well be heirs, or <em>ierre-tenants, </em>as to lands in other counties, and reside there; and the-Sheriff may say, that they are not Sound, and have nothing in his bailiwick, &amp;c. This distinction, therefore, mentioned by the Court, seems to arise from the nature of doing business. Two <em>nihih </em>may, in the latter case,\" amount to a <em>scirefeci, </em>with the same propriety as in other cases, where, if the party have a good defence, relief, by <em>audita querela, </em>is matter of right, against the judgment and proceedings consequent upon not appearing. <em>(Barcock </em>v. <em>Thompson, Styles, </em>281,288, 323.) Or, where the fact is clear and the application recent, the defendants may be relieved on motion; though otherwise, where the fact is disputed, or there has been along acquiescence, or the ground of relief be proper for trial.
