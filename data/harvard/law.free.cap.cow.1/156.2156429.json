This lot was patented to <em>Callaghan, </em>a soldier, who died previous to <em>March 27th, </em>1783. The cause had been once noticed for trial. The lessors claim title under the soldier\u2019s sister and heir at law. In their chain of title, there is a deed from the Sheriff of <em>Cayuga, </em>to S. <em>Dill, </em>who purchased the lot at Sheriff\u2019s sale, as the agent of <em>Harris, </em>one of the lessors, and a deed from <em>Dill to Harris. </em>When this latter deed was executed, some, or one of the defendants, were in possession, claiming title to the lot; though such title has never been placed on record. The defendants were <em>bona fide </em>possessors, at the time of suit brought, claiming under purchases, or contracts for purchase. <em>DilPs </em>name was not. inserted as one of the lessors. And</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-8\"><em>J.

Platt, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AN5\">said it was too late to move for the addition of a new demise, after the cause had been noticed for trial. Another objection <em>is, </em>that <em>Dill </em>has not \"a subsisting title; which is certainly necessary in one applying to be runde a lessor. In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>(4 <em>John. Rep. </em>483,) the Court say: \u201c No person is to be made a lessor, who has no claim or pretence to a <em>subsisting title </em>or <em>interest </em>in the premises. If any person, who has once had the title, is to be made lessor, the burthen of deducing a title from him is taken from the plaintiff and thrown on the tenant, which would be unreasonable.\u201d <em>Dill </em>has parted with all his interest to <em>Harris </em>; and he is estopped from saying otherwise, though third persons may object, that nothing passed by his conveyance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-10\">But the great and decisive objection to a new demise, is this: the defendants were <em>bona fide </em>purchasers., As such, they come within the statute, <em>(sess. </em>36, <em>ch. </em>80, <em>s. </em>2,4, 1 <em>R. L. </em>304-5,) intended to protect them against these lessors. It was universally supposed, for several years after' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>xhe revolution, that when the soldier died previous to the date of the patent, it would enure to the benefit of his heirs. The statute of <em>April 5th, </em>1803,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> was passed in confirmation of this idea. Here the soldier died previous to the time mentioned in the act, viz. <em>March 91th, </em>1783, and the title vests by the patent. In the intermediate time, our statute of descents was passed. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> By this act, the descent of the lot is regulated.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> Thus, the unsettled state of the titles to these military lots, induced the statute of 1813, (1 <em>R. L. 305, s. </em>4) requiring all actions therefor to be brought before the <em>1st </em>day of January, 1823. The Court should give to this statute its full and complete effect. The plaintiff claims under the dead soldier. This is the very case contemplated by the act. The effect of the amendment sought, is to institute a new suit. It goes to a new source of title, in new parties, and a change of rights. We have vested absolute rights under the statute, as fully and entirely so, as if <em>Dill </em>and all these lessors had conveyed <em>to </em>us. These rights cannot be divested by an original action ; nor should they be indirectly, by adding a new demise, and giving it a relation which overreaches our rights, by incorporating it into an old action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-9\"><em>Porter, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqG\">True, the defendants are <em>lona jide </em>.claimants; but, for aught that appears, the persons under whom they claim, came into possession without colour of title, and are therefore to be regarded as mere <em>squatters. </em>It is the uniform practice, in the action of ejectment, to amend by inserting a new demise, notwithstanding the lapse of years, and at almost any distance of time after the action is commenced. <em>(Doe </em>v. <em>Pilkington &amp; Russell, Burr. </em>2447. <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Burtis et al. </em>18 <em>John. 510.) </em>If, as admitted, the deed from <em>Dill </em>is inoperative, then the title is in him : and so arc the cases. If a person out of possession, conveys land held adversely, such conveyance is void ; but the title remains in the grantor, so as to enable him to bring ejectment. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Jackson, ex dem. Tibbets et al. 5 John. Rep. </em>489.) And if h\u00e9 has a mere equitable title, will not the Court allow him to be introduced as a lessor, in furtherance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>of justice ? It is said that this is equivalent to the commencement of a new suit. Far from it. We commenced our suit in good faith, and within the proper time ; and we claim the use of <em>DilPs </em>name, merely to sustain our real interests. This is promoting the justice of the case, not a lawless interference with vested rights.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b169-6\"><em> Sess. 26, ch. </em>88, <em>s. </em>1, 3 <em>Webster, </em>399.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\"> <em>Sess. 9, ch. </em>12, s. 3, 1 <em>Greenleaf, </em>206, <em>Feb </em>23, 1786.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\"> <em>Sess. </em>26, <em>eh. </em>88, <em>s. </em>8, 3 <em>Webster, </em>401.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b170-4\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aai\">The addition of a new demise is, generally, a matter of course, where the proposed lessor has a subsisting title. <em>(Jackson, ex dem. Finch et al. </em>v. Kough, 1 <em>Caines, </em>251.), But the defendants are <em>bona fide </em>possessors of a military lot. For the recovery of such a lot the statute declares that the action must have been brought before the 1st day of <em>January, </em>1823, and be prosecuted to eifect without wilful delay, or the person claiming title shall be forever thereafter barred from recovering. The defendants are actual settlers upon the land under colour of <em>bona fide </em>purchases ; and there is no dispute that they are within the purview of this act of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">It seems to us, that by allowing this amendment, we are indirectly depriving these defendants of all benefit under the act. The title passes to <em>Dill: </em>he releases to Harris, while the lot was possessed adversely by another. No title passed by this release, and <em>Dill </em>might have had ejectment. To allow this amendment, would be to introduce a new cause of action. It is like allowing a declaration to be served <em>de novo, </em>and ordering it to stand <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>The rule is well established, and has often been acted upon in the English Courts, that where the statute of limitations has attached, such an amendment will not be allowed. In the case of <em>Goff, q. t. </em>v. <em>Popplewell et al. </em>(2 <em>T. R. </em>707-8,) the Court say, that \u201c they would not in their discretion permit the proposed amendments to be made, which would, in effect, arnount to a permission to bring another action, to which otherwise the defendants might plead the statute of limitations.,\u20191</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">That was a <em>qui tam </em>action upon the statute of usury ; but the Court said, \u201c there was no difference between civil and penal actions, as to amendments at common law, while all was in paper.\u201d In <em>Steel, q. t. </em>v. <em>Sowerby, </em>(6 <em>T. R, </em>171) Ihe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>same point was decided; and though it was ruled otherwise in <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Kay, </em>(6 <em>T. R. </em>543) and the former decisions are placed on the ground of great delay in the plaintiff to prosecute his suit; yet <em>Lawrence, J. </em>says, \u201c if the amendment prayed for had gone the length of introducing a new charge against the defendant, I should have thought it came too late, on account of the statute of limitations.\u201d In the case of <em>Maddock, q. t. </em>v. <em>Hammet et al. </em>(7 <em>T. R. </em>51) this question again came up, and the Court granted the amendment, saying they did this, \u201c though the time limited for bringing a new action had expired; in as much as the amendment prayed for was not to introduce a new substantive cause of action.\u201d And in the case of <em>Low, q. t. </em>v. <em>Little, </em>(17 John. 346) a majority of the Court, in a similar case, inclined against an amendment, though there had been no delay in prosecuting the suit; and they were unanimous in thinking that there could not be an amendment by introducing any new substantive cause of action. In <em>Lyon, ex dem. Eden </em>&amp; <em>Wood, </em>v. <em>Burtis et al. </em>(18 <em>John. </em>510) which was a strong case of amendment, this Court say, <em>(p. </em>512) \u201c it is not pretended by the defendants that any injury will be done them by the amendment, farther than to remove a mere technical objection.\u201d But, in this case, we are asked to vary the whole ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Here is no subsisting title in <em>Dill, </em>for the purposes of a new action. He is barred, unless we allow him to come in upon this motion to amend. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>4 John. <em>Rep. </em>483.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Motion denied.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\"><em> </em>F or the great liberality of the Courts in allowing amendments, before, at and after trial, in these actions of ejectment, vid. <em>Rnnn. </em>226 to 234, and the cases there cited; <em>Adams on Eject. </em>200 to 208, and the cases there cited, and at <em>id. </em>p. 202, vid. n.

P. refused, in a penal-action, to alter the term of which the declaration was entitled, in order to bring it within the time limited, by'the statute for the commencement of the action; and where an ejectment had been brought, and judgment recovered in 1798, and the term of \u00bfemjse sjnce expired, the Court (1819, Trinity Term) refused to ' grant a rule for enlarging the term and issuing a <em>sci. fa. </em>the possession having changed, and the person who was the owner having since died. <em>(Doe </em>v. <em>Rendell </em>et al. <em>Chit.
