The only difference was in the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>pleadings. The declaration was in <em>assumpsit, </em>including the usual money counts.

The object and office of pleading is to inform the opposite party upon what the party pleading relies ; and this the replication has done. It is the only replication which can be made to such pleas as the 2d and 3d ; and a special pleader must see that they are as fully intended, as if they had been pointed out in their numerical order.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b167-7\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ADty\">The replication is somewhat informal, but there, is not the least difficulty in seeing which of the pleas it intends to answer.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The special demurrer is, therefore, frivolous, and must.be disregarded, as in fraud of the 9th rule of <em>April term, </em>1798.
