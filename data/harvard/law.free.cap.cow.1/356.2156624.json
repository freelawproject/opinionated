The counsel tor the defendant objected to its admission, but ^le Court overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence ; and the discharge was proved, dated <em>February 3d, </em>1812.

This statute proceeds upon the presumption of laches.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Here has been none. The discharge was obtained before the note fell due, and consequently before the statute began to run. The act of 1811, passed with all the requsite formality, and the Courts of the state gave full effect to it; indeed, they considered themselves bound to do so, till declared void by a paramount authority. \u25a0 Until the late decisions in the (7. <em>S. </em>Courts, a prosecution upon this note would have been idle. The statute of limitations only affects the remedy ; the debt still remains <em>due,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the act has always been expounded most favourably for the creditor. By the words of the act.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> the six years must elapse <em>after the cause of action has accrued. </em>The power of the plaintiff to prosecute, was, in fact, suspended : for all. the Courts of justice were shut against him, till within a short time before this suit was brought. His cause of action did not arise within the meaning and spirit of this provision, till the insolvent act of 1811 was declared a nullity.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b368-31\"> <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Sabin, </em>19 John. 154</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AqAL\">\n<em> 1 Bl.

Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AEf\">The only question which can arise in this case is, whether the defendant\u2019s having obtained a discharge, under the insolvent act of 1811, protects the plaintiff from the consequences of not prosecuting within six years. By the 2d proviso to the 5th section of the act of limitations, <footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> excuses for disability in the plaintiff, are confined to infancy, coverture, insanity, orimprisonment. The only excuse allowed by the statute, arising from the act of the defendant, is his being out of the state when the cause of action accrued. Though the defendant\u2019s virtual protection from prosecution by his discharge, produces the same result as his abscence from the state, yet we are not warranted by any rule of construction, in deciding, that every cause which produces the same effect as the one mentioned in the act, comes within it. It is true, that the reason why the absence of the defendant from the state, excuses the plaintiff fro\u00a1yt prosecuting, is, that the defendant is beyond the reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>of the process of the Courts : and the defendant\u2019s discharge p]aceci jj\u00a1m eqUapy out 0f the reach of any recovery against him, till the decision by the Supreme Court of the <em>United States, </em>in <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Crowninshield. </em>But it is not for the Court to extend the law to all cases coming within the <em>reason </em>of it, so long as they are not within the <em>letter. </em>Several cases of equal difficulty may be supposed, and have doubtless often occurred, which have never been holden within the exceptions of the statute. Ignorance of the requisite evidence to prove the plaintiff\u2019s debt, or a residence of the defendant in some obscure or remote part of the state, unknown to the plaintiff, would suspend his recovery, and sometimes more effectually too, than his residence in a neighbouring state : and yet I believe the statute has never been thought to except these, and the like cases, from its operation. The Court below ought to have nonsuited the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax3\">Judgment reversed.<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(e)\">\n<p id=\"A6p\"> 1 <em>R.
