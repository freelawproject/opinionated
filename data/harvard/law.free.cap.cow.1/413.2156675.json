Spencer, </em>moved to amend.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ast\">They remarked, that thi\u00e11 was a matter resting in the discretion of the Court, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Kip,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court held an execution amendable, where too large a sum had been inserted. In <em>Cramer </em>v. Van Alstine,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> they amended by insert-Eng a correct return day. In <em>Phelps </em>v. Ball,<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> a <em>fi.fa. </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>amended, by correcting two mistakes, after it was returned <em>satisfied: </em>and in <em>McIntyre </em>v. Rowan,<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> a ca. sa. was amen-: ded, by adding the <em>testatum </em>clause, after the defendant had been arrested. In 2 <em>Archb. </em>246, it is said that executions may be amended in names and sums, even after they are executed ; and he gives the authorities. And in <em>Holmes </em>v. Williams,<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> an amendment of a <em>ca. sa. </em>was allowed, even after an action of false imprisonment had been brought. Amendments are much a matter of course; though, in form, we are obliged to move the Court. They will always amend where there is any thing to amend. by, and here we have the judgment record.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-8\">S'. <em>J. Sherwood </em>&lt;$-\u2022 <em>Sudam,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqXn\">contra, produced affidavits, from which, as they insisted, it appeared the bond and warrant of attorney had been fraudulently obtained, and ought to be set aside. They accordingly moved to set aside the <em>judgment, </em>for that reason, and the execution for the <em>irregularity </em>pn the face of it. They remarked that, at any rate, they should rely upon the want of good faith disclosed by the affidavits, as a sufficient ground of opposition to the amendment : that, in the case cited from 3 <em>Caines, </em>there was no pretence of hardship. The Court will never exercise their discretionary power of amending, unless in furtherance of justice, and not to oppress the party. The cases cited were free from all <em>iniquity </em>in the party applying to amend.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-9\">\n<em>Powers,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEM\">said the Court would never allow considerations of this kind to operate against an amendment. The attorney, or officer, who makes out the process, is liable t\u00f3 an action for the mistake. Knowing nothing of the <em>equitable </em>circumstances which exist between the parties, he ought, notwithstanding, to be protected. _</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"pA-C\"> <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Mayor of Grampond, </em>7 <em>T.

But we all think there is no foundation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the objection, in point of fact.
