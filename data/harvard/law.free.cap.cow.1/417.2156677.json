He said our statute (1 <em>R. L. </em>343, s. 2,) was a transcript from the <em>8th Eliz. </em>giving costs upon a <em>discontinnance, </em>&amp;c. In <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Tiffin, </em>(3 <em>T. R. </em>511,) a question arose Under that act, whether the defendant should have judgment for costs upon <em>a nolle prosequi. </em>The Court said this could not be distinguished in reason, from a <em>discontinuance, </em>and they granted costs. He referred also to 2 <em>Tidd, </em>399, \u2018</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pAB-\"><em>Noxon, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcT\"><em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Tiffin, </em>was the case of a <em>sole </em>defendant. A <em>nolle prosequi </em>was, therefore, equivalent to a <em>discontinuance. </em>The <em>11th sec. of the stat. </em>(1 <em>R. L. </em>345,) gives costs on <em>non pros discontinuance, or nonsuit, </em>in the <em>discretion </em>of the Court. In this case the action continues, though one defendant is discharged. In <em>Hartness et al. </em>v <em>Thompson et ux. </em>(5 <em>John. Rep. </em>160,) it was decided, contrary to <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Parks Banks, </em>(3 <em>Esp. Rep. </em>76,) and <em>Jaffray </em>v. <em>Frebain et al. </em>(5 <em>id. </em>47,) that where one of several joint defendants pleaded infancy, the plaintiff might .77 . .. -rv 1 \u00b0 enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to him. But there is nothing said in that case about awarding costs. Upon a <em>nolle prosequi, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>plaintiff is not amerced <em>pro falso clamorc. </em>(1 <em>Tidd, </em>632) <em>mentioned with approbation by Spencer J. </em>20 <em>John. Rep. </em>122-3.) The entry, in this case, does not dispose of the tvhole cause of action. It is a discharge of but one defendant, and is like entering a <em>nolle prosequi </em>upon one of the <em>counts </em>in a declaration, where costs are not allowed* <em>(Hubbard </em>v. <em>Biggs, </em>16 <em>East, </em>129.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-6\"><em>Lawrence, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5qz\">Costs was not the question in <em>Hartness </em>v. <em>Thompson. </em>And when <em>Tidd </em>says that the plaintiff is not to be amerced <em>pro falso demore, </em>he is merely giving directions as to the form of the record. Besides, it will be seen by <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Hoyle, </em>(1 <em>Str. </em>574,) which was a <em>nolle prosequi </em>upon a part of the counts, after judgment upon demurrer upon <em>one </em>of them, that judgment <em>pro falso damore </em>need not be entered.

If <em>E. Nelson </em>is entitled to costs, it must be in virtue of the 11 <em>th section, </em>already adverted to, and the construction put upon that section in <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Tiffin, </em>cited upon the former argument. This decision was followed up by that in <em>Morton\u2019s Executors </em>v. <em>Croghan.</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The law of these eases is not questioned, but they do not apply. The plain distinction is, that in those cases, the <em>nolle prosequi </em>operated against all the defendants, and was a <em>total </em>discontinuance of the action. In this case, it is a <em>partial </em>discontinuance\u2014as to one defendant only. It is a familiar principle, that statutes concerning costs, are to be construed <em>strictly.</em><footnotemark><em>(f</em>)</footnotemark> In <em>Hullock\u2019s Law of Costs, </em>144, the cases will be found in which this rule has been applied. The one which is most strikingly analagous, arose under the general provision in the English statute corresponding to the <em>2d section, </em>of ours,<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> that where judgment is given for the defendant, or the plaintiff be nonsuited, the (ormer shall have costs. Now, before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the 8 &amp; 9 W. 3, ch. 11, s. 1, <footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark> which provided that where :0~ of several defendants succeeds, he shall recover costs, the uniform course was to refuse costs to the defendant in such a case. To avoid this evil, legislative provision was made. <footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark> The 11th section is general in its provisions, like the second. And within the reason of the practice under that section, an a~t of the legislature is equally necessary to give a defendant costs in cases of <em>discontinuance </em>and <em>nolle prosequi. </em>The 10th section~<footnotemark>(j)</footnotemark> applies only to trespass, assault, false imj~risonm~nt, or ejeciment. These are the only actions in which one defendant, among several, by our statute, can recover Costs, even on a <em>verdict of acquittal. </em>It does not extend to this action, which seems to be a <em>casus omissus </em>; and the present case remains yet unprovided for, in this particular. The reason, probably, is, that it so rarely happens in actions arising <em>esc contractu, </em>that a verdict can be different as to different defendants. The close of the <em>11 th section </em>speaks of a judgment record and execution in favour of the defendant. This evidently means in favour of all the defendants ; otherwise there can be no record of the defendant. Only one record can be filed. r .zen how is a defendant to collect his costs ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-12\">[Woodworth, J. Might not the whole matter be contained in a single record ?]</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-13\"><em>Butler. </em>There can be but one taxation and one record even, where the defendants <em>sever </em>and all succeed. No case can be found in the books like the present. Where a <em>nolle prosequi, </em>as to one, works a discharge of all, as in <em>Morton's Executors </em>v. Croghan, the whole suit is discontinued, and costs are therefore given. The phraseology of the <em>lltk section </em>is the same as the <em>2d, </em>so far as the number of defendants' is concerned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-14\">But these two sections differ materially as to the obligation to allow costs. The <em>2d is </em>imperative\u2014the 11 <em>th </em>is not so ; but, on a discontinuance, &amp;c. refers it to the <em>discretion </em>of the Court. The 10th <em>section </em>provides, that in certain actions for <em>tort </em>and verdict for one defendant, the plaintiff shall not, even in those cases, be subjected to costs, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Judge certifies that there is reasonable cause for making him a defendant. In both cases, then, there is a discretion to exercise. Has there been, in this case, a sound exercise of that discretion ? A single defendant, pleading an insolvent discharge, is one case in which this Court do exercise a discretion in allowing the plaintiff to discontinue without costs.<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark> It is an instance wherein this provision of the statute has been often acted upon. Is the case, in the Court below, a stronger one for the defendant ? The plaintiff cannot, perhaps, know of the infancy until the moment of trial. In <em>Hartness </em>v, <em>Thompson, </em>cited on the former argument, no costs appear to have been given; and in <em>Pell </em>v. <em>Pell,</em><footnotemark><em>(l)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>there was a <em>nolle </em>prosequi, and the Court, on motion, allowed a discontinuance, on simply paying the costs of the motion. This is like entering a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to one com\u00ed alone, and proceeding upon the others, in which case costs do not follow.<footnotemark>(m)</footnotemark> Where is the difference ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-4\">J. <em>A. Spencer, </em>in support of the rule.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYjE\">I shall say nothing as to the point first made on the other side, because I do not consider the question, in the Court below, as resting in their discretion. Where they refuse to give a proper judgment, this Court will rectify it by writ of <em>mandamus.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-5\">The 10/A <em>section </em>is confined to certain actions for <em>tort </em>only, and embraces those cases, alone, where the defendants <em>sever </em>in their defences. In such a case, separate fees for <em>retainer </em>are not allowed, but after <em>retainer, </em>separate costs are allowed to each. There are but few actions arising, <em>ex contractu, </em>in which defendants have a right to <em>sever, </em>which, probably, accounts for the absence of any similar provision on this head. Infancy and insolvency are two of the cases in which <em>severance </em>is authorized. It is said that here is but a partial discontinuance, like entering a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to one count of a declaration. But the distinction is between the <em>cause of action </em>and the <em>person: </em>where a part of the former is discontinued, costs may not be allowed\u2014otherwise, where the whole is discontinued, and the person totally discharged, This, then, is a complete discontinuance, like that in <em>Cooper r. Tiffin. </em>In both cases, the <em>person </em>is wholly discharged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlEO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The plaintiff cannot complain of this. He sustains no <em>in~ </em>convenience, for he might have sued the adult separately, and averred the infancy of the other defendant. In cases of insolvency and a discharge, after suit brought, the plaintiff may discontinue, it is true, but not if the discharge existed before the suit, nor indeed if obtained after, provided the' . ; . ' * plaintiff take issue and go to trial, <footnotemark>(n)</footnotemark> The defence here -g persona]; an&lt;i confined to the infant alone, as exclusively as the insolvent\u2019s discharge applies to him. Both stand on the same footing, then, as to costs upon a discontinuance. And this case is a very strong, one, for the plaintiff not only <em>takes issue </em>upon the infancy, but <em>goes to trial.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-10\">It is true, that the 1 <em>Ith section </em>does not speak of <em>co-defendants, </em>but it takes the singular number, which applies to any one of the defendants, and thus operates in favour of, each-</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-11\">I have not the gentleman\u2019s difficulty in getting costs. The defendant <em>severs, </em>goes to trial, and is acquitted. Why not make his own record ? This may be done as well as in trespass ; or the Court may direct the whole matter to be included in one record, making this a part of the rule for the <em>nolle prosequi. </em>The case of <em>Hartness et al. </em>v. <em>Thompson et al. </em>cited from <em>5 th </em>Johnson, does not raise the question as to costs i</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b431-11\"> <em>Hull </em>v. <em>The Supervisors of Oneida, </em>19 <em>John. </em>259, 262.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b431-12\"> 1 <em>R.L. </em>345, <em>s. </em>11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b431-13\"> 2 <em>John.

The 11 <em>th section, </em>upon which the defendant claims to be allowed his costs, provides, that if the plaintiff shall, after declaration, suffer the <em>suit </em>to be discontinued, the Court may adjudge costs to the defendant. It makes no provision for a discontinuance as to one of the defendants, and, I think, it applies only to a discontinuance, as to <em>all the' counts, </em>and <em>all the defendants. </em>The <em>2d section </em>provides, that in every case, where a plaintiff would recover costs upon a verdict for him, the defendant shall have costs upon a verdict against the plaintiff. Now, the English statute, from which this is copied, was- not construed to give one defendant hi&amp; tiosts, where he alone, among several defendants, was ac*&gt;</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Quitted. And this defect gave rise to our <em>10th </em>section, which is, however, confined in its language, to the acquittal of one defendant by verdict, in certain actions arising <em>ex delicto. </em>The same rule of construction applies to the <em>11th section. </em>This not being an abandonment of the whole action, I am of opinion that the plaintiff had a right to enter a <em>nolle prosequi, </em>and the Common Pleas a right to permit this to be done without costs. Indeed, I think the statute never intended to give costs to a single defendant, in an action like this, arising <em>ex contractu. Cooper </em>v. <em>Tiffin, </em>was an abandonment of the entire action, and the case from <em>Otsego, </em>of <em>Morton\u2019s Executors </em>v. <em>Croghan\u2019s terre-tenants, </em>in the <em>20th Johnson, </em>is a similar instance.</p>\n<author id=\"b435-4\">Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak71\">It was taken for granted on the former argument, and we certainly took it for granted, when we directed the rule to shew cause, that the statute extended to \u00a1a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to one of several defendants ; and the main question then made was, whether a <em>nolle prosequi </em>was to be deemed within the statute, according to the case of <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Tiffin. </em>This being the case, and the Court of Common Pleas having refused to give a judgment for costs, we granted the rule, upon the principle, that the Court below having refused to act, we would put them in motion. 1 concur, however, that there is nothing to take this case out of the rule of construction which governed upon the acquittal of one defendant among several, under the <em>2d section </em>of the statute of costsj before the adoption of the provisions of the <em>10th section.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b435-6\">SavAge, Ch.

In <em>Jansen and others </em>v. <em>Davison,</em><footnotemark><em>(q)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court below, on a recovery for less than $25, refused to give judgment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>costs, and this Court denied the writ, saying, \u201c the Court below have exercised their judgment on the question of costs ; if they were- wrong, it was an error of judgment merely, and the proper remedy is by writ of error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">There is no question about the authority of the Court, to permit a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to be entered in this case ;<footnotemark>(r)</footnotemark> and the only subject of complaint is, that the defendant Was not allowed the costs of his plea of infancy, and of his witnesses to prove <em>it. </em>By the <em>11th section </em>of the <em>act concerning costs, </em>passed <em>April 12th, </em>1813, <footnotemark><em>(s)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is enacted, that \u201c if, after declaration put in, he (the plaintiff) shall suffer the suit to be discontinued, or otherwise shall be non-suited in the same, then, and in every such case, the Court may, at <em>its discretion, </em>adjudge costs to the defendant.\u201d This discretion, it is said, is not arbitrary, but a sound legal discretion. It is, however, the same discretion, in the exercise of which, this Court has allowed the plaintiff to discontinue, <em>mthout costs, </em>where the defendant is discharged under the insolvent act.<footnotemark>(t)</footnotemark> Had the plaintiff asked leave to enter his <em>nolle pros* equi, </em>on receiving the defendants\u2019 plea of infancy, and the motion had been granted without costs, I vqry much doubt whether the <em>discreetness </em>of such a decision would have been . questioned. If so, then the Court may still be correct, for it might be, that the plea could not have been supported. In my judgment, the defendant asks for costs with a very ill grace, when he has first palmed.himself upon the plaintiff as an <em>adult, </em>and thus obtained his property, and then pleads <em>infancy </em>in his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">But if this ground be not sufficient to resist this motion, there is another, which is, that the proper remedy is by writ of error. The Court of Common Pleas,did not refuse to give judgment at all. 'They have rendered a <em>judgment. </em>If they have erred, it is an error of <em>judgment; </em>and a <em>manda* mus </em>is not the appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">Besides; the language of the act is, \u201c if he shall suffer <em>the </em>. <em>suit </em>to be discontinued, or otherwise shall he non-suited in the same.\u201d Now, the entering of a <em>nolle prosequi, </em>as to <em>one defendant,- </em>is neither a discontinuance of the <em>suit; </em>nor a non-suit. The defendant, therefore, is not within the letter sf the act, and I am not aware of any decision which brings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>him within its provisions. In <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Tiffin,</em><footnotemark><em>(u)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the <em>suit </em>was discontinued, and the defendant had costs; but in <em>Hubbard </em>v. Biggs<footnotemark>(v)</footnotemark> the plaintiff entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to some of the counts, without costs either way.
