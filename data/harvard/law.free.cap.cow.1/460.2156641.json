Ross, </em>the latter of whom acted as connsel for <em>Cheever </em>before the Surrogate and admeasurers. , \u00b0 <em>Cheever </em>himself resided in <em>Boston, </em>and had a tenant, <em>Walton, </em>(named in the order and served with the original papers) resident upon the premises. It was testified by Mr. <em>Ross, </em>that <em>Cheever </em>never gave him any special power of agency or as attorney to act in this matter, other than a general request to keep a look out; nor had <em>Cheever, </em>according to his knowledge or belief, ever given any authority beyond this to his late partner, <em>Hascall. </em>It also appeared that <em>Cheever </em>had been apprized at a very early stage of this proceeding, that an appeal had been brought in this matter, and that he had retained counsel to defend the same. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-7\">It further appeared by Mr. Ross\u2019 affidavit, that one <em>sixth </em>only of the premises was claimed, on his suggesting to the admeasurers and the opposite counsel, that the husband of <em>Maria Coates </em>was the legal owner of only <em>one undivided half </em>of the premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-8\">It appeared further, by the affidavit of Mr. <em>Ross </em>and others, that a part of the vein of ore then open and worked^ was not so opened and worked in the life time of the husband, but that the same was opened by <em>Walton, </em>the tenant of <em>Cheever, </em>and at C\u2019s expense and cost; that the opening, securing and draining it, since the husband\u2019s death, had cost above $2000, including other improvements for the convenience of digging and vending ore ; that those parts opened by <em>Coates </em>were abandoned and had not been used or worked for about six years, and were filled with earth, water and \u2022 stones. Witnesses were examined before the admeasurers, after several adjournments, by whose testimony, and a view of the premises, it appeared, that the premises consisted of a cultivated farm, a house, a barn and other out-houses, a wharf and a vein of iron-ore, extending in length about 60 rods; that the vein of ore had been opened and worked in several places ; that it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>worked down, in some places, as low as it could be work'-1 ed without draining, and that some other places were obstructed by earth and some by rocks ; and that since the\" Premises had been conveyed by <em>Coates </em>to the present pro- \" prietors, they had laid out a considerable sum in repairing the'east end of the house; that they had built a new wharf, and opened the ore bed in a new place, which they had uncapped and sided with timber, and had made a drain for the same, the expense of all which was estimated\" at upwards of $2000 ; that the expenses of opening, draining and timbering the ore bed and making a road, and building a wharf for the convenience thereof, was about three fourths of the whole expense ; that after about 6 years use of the ore bed, it would be necessary to sink a new drain, which a witness was of opinion would cost about $2000, if made as it ought to be, for permanent use ; that the difficulty and expense of digging the ore increased with the quantity taken out, both by reason of the height to which the ore must be raised, and also .of the great difficulty and expense incurred in keeping the works free from water, in as much as the length of the drain was greatly increased with its depth, and the bottom is a rock; that permitting Mrs. <em>Coates </em>to raise ore from the newly opened vein, would greatly interrupt and discommode the present occupant,</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-6\"><em>Coates </em>had purchased <em>one half </em>of these premises' of one <em>Harmon, </em>to whom he had, at the time of the purchase, executed a mortgage for the consideration money ; which mortgage had been assigned to the respondent, who purchased the premises of <em>Coates, </em>during his life time, and took a conveyance thereof in fee. The circumstances attending the conveyances and mortgage, are particularly detailed in the opinion of the <em>Chief Justice*</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-7\"><em>Z. R. Shipherd, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtV\">moved that the report of the admeasurers be set aside, on the grounds specified in the appeal, viz. the omission to assign the appellant her\u2019dower according\" to her legal rights, and particular<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ly, not allowing her a participation in the ore bed and the profits thereof. He said this mine was opened during the husband's life time; and whatever doubts may formerly ~iave been entertained on this subject, they are put at 'rest by the case of <em>Stoughton </em>v. Leigh.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> This case decides that the widow is dowable of aU those mines of lead and coal which have, in fact, been opened during the husband\u2019s life time and in which he had an estate of inheritance. This bed of ore, is a part of the lands whereof the husband was seised, within the meaning of the act concerning dower. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> It is so at the common law. Blackstone says, that \"whatever is in a direct line between the surface of any land and the centre of the earth belongs to the owner of the surface, as is every day\u2019s experience in the mining countries.\u201d<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> The wife is entitled to dower of all profits of land in which the husband was seised of an estate of in-1~eritance.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> Many things of a less permanent and substantial nature than mines are subject tp dower. Springs of water, in Rex v. Miller,<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> were held to be profits of land. So dower is due of tolls arising from a publick navigable river.<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> If a man let lands with liberty of digging, his wife shall not, therefore, be the less endowed of them. Many of the cases put by Ld. <em>Coke,</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>are of things not partaking so much of real property as mines. One instance there given is of a mill, whereof a woman shall not be endowed by metes and bounds nor in common with the heir, but either she may be endowed of the <em>third </em>toll dish, or <em>de integro molendino per quemlibet tertium </em>mensem. The remainderman for life, in an estate tail, may continue to work all coal mines which were lawfully opened by the tenant in tail.<footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark> In Hoby v. Hoby,<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark> it was not disputed that the demandant was entitled to dower in a coal mine. He also referred to Rol. Ab. 675, Dower (D), Bac. Ab. Dower (B), Co. Lit. 55 6. 4 Woodf. L. &amp; T, 55.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-19\">The circumstance, of improvements having been made since the death of the husband, cannot effect the claim. Such a rule would place the widow completely in the power of the tenant, who might bar her dower by improving to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the full alue of the land. The law will not subject her to more disadvantageous terms than a tenant in common, who is liable to pay his share for improvements, but his title caanoi thereby be taken away or aifected in the least.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AHb\">. S. <em>A. Foot, </em>for the respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atb\">objected, 1. That the service of the papers was not sufficient; He said the 10th seci\u2019on the <em>act,</em><footnotemark><em>(j</em>)</footnotemark> under which this proceeding before the Surrogate was instituted, requires the appellant to give notice in writing of the causes of complaint, within 30 days after filing the report. But the act is silent, as to the persons to whom this notice shall be given and the manner of service. Here has been a tenant of the freehold for several years before the application and a tenant under him, neither of whom were served. <em>Hascall </em>&amp; <em>Ross </em>cannot be considered, for the purpose of this service, either as attornies, solicitors or proctors ; for no such officers are legally recognized as existing in the Surrogate\u2019s Court. They are mere private counsel or advisers. It does not appear by the recital in the order, that they were acknowledged as such before the Surrogate in this cause. The tenants are mentioned as appearing in person. The proceedings in dower are usually conducted against the tenant in possession. The notice of this application is in the nature of process. It is a cal 1 to come into this Court, not only to hear a simple reversal or affirmance of the proceedings in the Court below, but for a general revisal of those proceedings. There cannot be service, to call a partv into Court, upon his Attorney in <em>fact. </em>The fact that Mr. <em>Ross </em>was an Attorney of this Court, makes no difference. The 2d section makes service of notice that the application will be made to the Surrogate, good, when made either upon the widow or her <em>Attorney </em>; but the act is silent as to the manner in which service shall be made when the application is on the part of the widow. This difference shews that the legislature intended to leave the service as at common law. The ap-\u201c plication againt the widow is merely a call upon her to institute legal proceedings for the recov\u00e9ry of her dower. She may reside out of the state ; and her dower not being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>assigned, she has no tenant upon <em>the </em>land; and the 'notice to her, for which the statute provides, is for the original application. It .is a matter <em>in pais ; </em>whereas the present is to bring a party into Court upon a proceeding already instituted. In the case of <em>Cooper, widow, &amp;c.</em><footnotemark><em>(k)</em></footnotemark><em> the </em>reasoning of the Court exhibits the light in which notices of this kind are to be viewed.

He thought, however, that none of the cases went beyond <em>collieries. </em>He said, there are special reasons for this exception, as may be seen by the case of <em>Clavering </em>v. <em>Clavering. </em><footnotemark><em>(m)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Coal mines will spoil from <em>the not: </em>working them, It is true, that <em>Coates </em>opened and partially worked the vein during his life time, but abandoned it, and was not engaged in working it at his death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-17\">But if the appellant has a right of dower in this mine, the Surrogate has no jurisdiction of the case. The common law proceedings for the recovery of dower being expensive, the legislature have thought it their duty to give summary powers to the Surrogate. But it is evident, on examining the statute, that they mean to confine this remedy to the ordinary plain case of <em>lands, </em>where the dower may be set off by metes and bounds. The language of the Statute does not extend beyond that case, It mentions lands only, as the subject of. division ; and by- the 3d section, the admeasurers \u00e1re required to <em>admeasure and lay off, </em>as speedily as may be, <em>one third part of the lands thus petitioned for admeasurement. </em>They have no power by the statute beyond marking off the <em>lands </em>by <em>metes </em>and <em>bounds. </em>After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>this is done, the widow may have ejectment. }I~re is the extent of her remedy; she must be content to take what the Surrogate has power to give her. This is the settled rule where the party elects his tribunal. The Surrogate has no power to assign her dower of this mine. Suppose it had been a mill, could the admeasurers assign her every third toll dish? They must adhere strictly to the powers confided to them, which are merely to admeasure by metes and bounds. Yet t~e case of Stoughton~ V. Leigh, relied upon by the other side, places the profits of a mine and a mill upon the same footing as to the mode of assignment. The remedy of the appellant, then, lies in a real action, or in Chancery. Can the admeasurers mark' off one third of the mine? This is impossible. It depends on the co~rse of the view, which, as the Court know, from the history of minerals, the admeasurers could not ascertain. It isessential that they should have power distinctly to designate the right~</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-3\">.Agam; we Claim as alienee, and as such by the statute, ~re to be allowed our improvements, or in other words, the appellant can claim her dower, only according to the value of the lands exclusive of the improvements made since the sale.<footnotemark>(n)</footnotemark> How are the admeasurers to arrive at this allowance? Is it by authorising us first to pay ourselves out of the profits, and afterwards giving the appellant the enjoyment of her dower? In. Hitchcock v. liarrington,<footnotemark>(o)</footnotemark> it was held that the wife is entitled to dower in an equity of redemption; but as between the widow and mortgagee, the mortgage must be considered an alienation. To entitle her to dower, the mine must have been opened while the husband was s\u00ebised. Unless opened during his life time, and while seised, it is not looked to by the widow for her support. Now, who is to try these various questions? The facts in relation to them rest in pa\u00fc'. They do not apply to the right, but to the extent, of the dower. Can we, in this way, be deprived of our right to a trial by jury, or of a hearing in the Court of Chancery? The admeasure\u00e7s have no means of trying these matters. They cannot com~. pel the attendance of a single witness, or~ the production of as~ngle paper. ~ut it maybe said, that the st~tut~ r~quir~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>this Court, on appeal, \u201c to review the proceedings, and do therein what is just.\u201d This does not imply the power of issuing a <em>venire, </em>and trying these rights by jury. It relates to the subject matter, and means the exercise of a jurisdiction strictly appellate. It imports no more than a similar provision in the 25 dollar act, \u201c that this Court shall proceed and give judgment, according as the very right of the case shall appear.\u201d<footnotemark>(p)</footnotemark> The alienation, the opening in the husband\u2019s life time and during his seisin, and the extent and value of the improvements, are all to be tried. The widow must pay or allow one third of the repairs. In the case put, of dower in a mill, the widow who receives every third toll dish, must defray one third of the expense in repairing the mill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-4\">The, Court will not reverse the decision of the adriieasurers, except for error. Here is no error ; for the appellant\u2019s own tribunal have given her all that, by law, they had power to give. That she is unable to obtain more, arises from her own act and cannot be alleged for error.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b483-5\"><em>Shipherd, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aat\">If the notice of this application is defective, the Court will doubtless order a new one to be given, so as not to suffer a sacrifice of the appellant\u2019s right by the omission of her attorney. Without this course, the 30 days allowed for the appeal having elapsed, she would be remediless.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-7\">This service, had it been for the original proceeding before the Surrogate, would have been sufficient. The 2d section of the statute contemplates a service upon the attorney of the party in that case. To whom, then, ought notice of the appeal to be given ? Why not, as here, to the counsel of the party who appeared before the Surrogate ? On whom is a notice of appeal in Chancery to be served ? On the solicitor\" who conducted the cause in the Court below. Notice of filing a writ of error is served on the attorney in the Court below. In this case, notice to the Surrogate is enough ; which he receives by the exceptions being filed in his office, with a declaration of appeal. The statute requires the exceptions and notice to be served, without di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>reeling the manner id which this is to be done, or designa!-' jr)g j.}ie person <em>fo </em>whom it is to be directed. The ex ceptions and notice of appeal are, ordinarily, served on the ^u&lt;%e or magistrate who makes the decision. When a party has no attorney, many kinds of notices, by a rule of this Court, may be served by being affixed in the Clerk\u2019s office.A written power to <em>Ross Haseall </em>was not necessary.They admit that they were employed by <em>Che ever to watch and look </em>out. This makes them agents for the purpose of this whole matter, in all its stages. The respondent, the owner of these lands, resides in <em>Boston, </em>Will the Court send us there to serve the notice ?. In similar cases, the most important rights are frequently compromitted by a mere advertisement in the newspaper. This is a continuation of the proceedings before the Surrogate. There is no writ or process to be served. It is a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>that merely requires reasonable notice to the parties interested, which they have received by a service of these papers upon their agent in the concern.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-4\">Our right to dower in this mine seems not to be opposed With any great degree of confidence', but many obstacles are raised to our obtaining it in this form. The Court have the same' power on the subject, as a Court of Equity. The admeasurerS' may have no powers of trial, or to determine questions of law ; but this Court have a general power of review and correction over them and will guide their proceedings as to the law. The intervention of a jury is unnecessary. The facts, going to constitute' our right, wer\u00e9 all confessed before the Surrogate. The mortgage does not bar the right of dower. A mortgagee has nothing to do with .the premises. A mortgaged works no disseisin of the mortgagor, as has been supposed. The latter remains seis ed precisely in the same manner, apd to every intent, as if no mortgage had been given. But if the tribunal below had defective powers, this, of itself, is a reason why the Court should tell us so by setting aside the report, and turning us over to the legal remedy. It is said the admeasurers could not set off our rights by metes and bounds ; but they might, at least, have reported to the Surrogate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>we were entitled to one third of the ore upon these premises, and set off the residue by metes and bounds. The statute gives to the admeasurers all the powers of a Sheriff upon a \u25a0writ of <em>habere, facias seisinam. </em>The same difficulties intervene in that case, and yet it is held that he may assign every third toll dish of a mill. The remedy granted by the statute should be favoured, as one granted to speed and facilitate the remedy of the widow in the recovery of rights upon which her subsistence often depends. The only question here, is in relation to the quantity or extent of the dower, as to which the admeasurers may be fully directed by a special order. There is no difference in principle between a claim of dower in a <em>coal </em>and an <em>iron </em>mine. Both are appurtenant to\u2014-nay, form a part of the lands j thus coming within the terms of the act. The improvements for which a compensation is claimed were made since the husband\u2019s death. The statute allowing improvements to the <em>alienee </em>ought to he confined, in construction, to those made by him before the death of the husband, upon which event he ought immediately to surrender the widow\u2019s dower.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b479-20\"> 1 Taunt. 402.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b479-21\"> Sess. 10, ch. 4, s. 1, 1 R.

Cheever, the respondent and owner of the lands, resided in <em>Massachusetts, </em>but he personally appeared to answer the proceedings which were' instituted before the Surrogate ; and while the subject was before the admeasurers, <em>Hascall fy Ross </em>were treated as his attorneys, in all the different stages of the investigation. After the decision, they were instructed by him, to keep a good look out. The statute does not designate the person on whom, nor the manner in which, notice of the appeal is to be served. Here they were Served upon <em>HascJll, </em>the partner of <em>Ross, </em>This fact comes to the knowledge of the respondent, so that he has a fair opportunity of contesting the matter. He retains counsel, who watches the proceedings down to the time of the motion, when be <em>is </em>heard <em>by </em>his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>counsel against the appeal.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, f think the clause of the statute requiring notice is reasonably satisfied. The party is.fully apprized, and cannot suffer from the omission to serve the papers upon him personally.</p>\n<p id=\"AE9\">The premises in question contain a valuable <em>ore </em>bed, which was partially opened by the husband of the appellant, during his life time. Since his death, the owner has extended this opening at great expense, and with very great success. In setting off dower, the admeasurers disregarded the increased value of the land arising from the circumstance of its containing this <em>ore bed. </em>They estimated the value, considered merely with a view to its agricultural improvement, and assigned by metes and bounds sufficient to cover one sixth of that estimate, carefully avoiding any interference with the ore. There is no doubt that as to mines in general, including beds of iron ore, if they are unopened at the time of the owner\u2019s death, his widow must take her dower in other land merely. The newly opening a mine is waste, and the wddow, having only an estate for life, can legally do no act which injures the inheritance. All the cases agree in this. But it is equally clear, that if, during the husband\u2019s life time, mines are opened, dower in them is properly assignable. In this case, the admeasurement must accordingly be set aside. The admeasurers must assign to the. appellant her dower, in all mines which were opened during her husband\u2019s life ; but she cannot profit by any extension of that opening. The admeasurers should take into consideration the value of the mine as far as it was opened during the husband\u2019s life, and then assign the dower, either by measuring off one third in value, or specifically assigning a reasonable share of the profits at short periods. The case of <em>Stoughton </em>v. <em>Leigh, </em>(1 <em>Taunt. </em>402,) contains the rules by which, I think, the admeasurers ought to be guided.</p>\n<author id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Savage, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aasu\">By the 10th section of the act, (1 R. <em>L. </em>61,) any party conceiving himself aggrieved, by the proceedings before the Surrogate, may appeal to this Court, giving notice in writing, within 30 days after filing the report of the admeasurers, of the causes of complaint and of his intention to apply to the next Supreme Court. The notice, in this case, was served on Hascall, the partner of <em>Ross, </em>within the time; but no notice was served on the respondent, or his tenant in possession of the premises. <em>Ross </em>swears, that neither himself nor <em>Hascall </em>were the attorneys' of the respondent, except as being occasionally employed by him and requested to keep a look out for him ; but they had no authority either to let or dispose, in any way, of the property in question, or any other property of the defendant. Service of notice on an attorney upon record, in the progress of a cause prosecuted or defended by an attorney, is good ; but <em>Ross </em>was merely counsel before the Surrogate, where attorneys are not known as officers of the Court. The case is somewhat similar to proceedings before Justices. Suppose, upon <em>certiorari </em>brought, the plaintiff should serve his assignment of errors upon the person who had acted as counsel for the opposite party before the Justice, would this be a good service ? The notice, in my opinion, should have been sent to the respondent by mail, or served upon his tenant, or upon his attorney in fact, if he had one. Either mode of service would probably be sufficient, where the respondent, as here, resides out of the state. If nothing farther appeared, therefore, I should be against the application upon the question of notice. But it seems, from the papers, that the respondent had actual notice of the bringing this appeal, and this in season to enable him to retain counsel and prepare for his defence. The whole case is fully before us, and I think we are justified, under such circumstances, in entertaining jurisdiction and deciding the case upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Admeasurers of dower were regularly appointed on application of the appellant. They assigned her dower of \u2022 lands in <em>Essex </em>county, being the third of one half of a certain lot, which is valuable chiefly on account of an <em>iron ore </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>bed </em>which it contains. The admeasurers assigned the dower under an impression, that she was not entitled to any share in the <em>ore </em>bed.' They, of course, gave her no part of this bed ; nor did they estimate it, in the value of the lot, in setting off the sixth part.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">The widow appeals to this Court, and we are now moved to set aside the assignment as inequitable. The respondent. resists the application, on the ground that the appellant is not entitled to dower of the mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">By the affidavits on the part of the respondent, it appears that <em>John Coates, </em>the husband of the demandant, in his life time, (1809) borrowed of the respondent $32,000&gt; conveyed the premises in question to him for <em>$ </em>15,000, and died insolvent ; so that this property is all that the respondent has, or will ever be able to obtain for his debt. <em>Coates </em>had purchased one half of the premises of one <em>Harman, </em>at the same time giving him a mortgage thereon ffir the consideration money. This mortgage has since been regularly assigned to the respondent. It farther appears, that the pits from which ore was taken by <em>Coates, </em>have filled up, by the falling in of earth and stone ; that the respondent has sunk' a new pit, and built a whari on the shore of Lake <em>Champlain, </em>at an expense of from two to three thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">In <em>England, </em>the law seems to be settled, that the widow is entitled to be endowed of mines opened and worked in the life time of her husband, but not of such as were unopened'. <em>Littleton </em>says,<footnotemark>(q)</footnotemark> \u201c the wife, after the decease of her husband, shall be endowed of the third part of such, lands and tenements as were her husband\u2019s at any time during the coverture, to have and to hold to the same wife, in severalty, by metes and bounds for the term of her life.\u201d Ld. <em>Coke,</em><footnotemark><em>(r)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in his Commentary upon this text, enumerates several cases where the widow shall be endowed, though she cannot, from the nature of the property, hold by metes and bounds. One is the case of a mill, in which she may be endowed of the third toll dish. He enumerates a variety of other cases, but is silent as to- <em>mines. </em>In <em>Hoby </em>v. <em>Hoby,</em><footnotemark><em>(s)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court of Chancery recognized the widow\u2019s right to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u00e1ower in &amp; coal mine. In <em>Saunders\u2019 </em>case,<footnotemark>(t)</footnotemark> it was decided, in the Common Pleas, that a lessee for years, or for life, may dig mines which are open, but shall not open new ones, unless he has a lease of them specifically ; and then he may dig for them. In <em>Clavering </em>v. Clavering,<footnotemark>(u)</footnotemark> it was decided by Lord Chancellor <em>King, </em>that a tenant for life may open the earth, in new places, in pursuit of an old vein of coals, when the coal mines had been opened before he came to the estate. In <em>Whitfield </em>v. Bewit,<footnotemark>(v)</footnotemark> it was decided that A, having an estate for life, subject to waste, shall no more open a mine, than he shall cut down timber trees; but in this case, the mines spoken of were thosewhich had never been opened. In the late case of <em>Stoughton </em>v. <em>Leigh,</em><footnotemark><em>(w)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court of Chancery put several questions to the Common Pleas, for their opinion. It is stated that the husband was seised of several lead and coal mines, some in his own land, and some under the lands of others. Some had been opened and worked, in his life time, and some had not. And it is asked, Whether the widow is entitled to dower of all, or any, and which of the mines ? The Common Pleas answered, that the widow was dowable of all the husband\u2019s mines of lead and coal, which had, in fact, been opened and wrought before his death, in which he had an estate of inheritance ; and that her right to be endowed did not depend on the subsequent discontinuance of working them, either by the husband ; or those claiming under him since his death ; but that she was not dowable of mines which had not been opened at all; that in assigning dower, the Sheriff should estimate the annual value of the open mines, and might assign them to her or not; and when assigned to her, she may work them for her own exclusive benefit. If the property could be divided by metes and bounds, that was the most proper manner, but if it was not susceptible of such a division, he might proportion the enjoyment and perception of the profits, and direct a separate alternate enjoyment of the whole for short periods, proportioned to the share each had in the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">I cannot- find, from what research I have been able to make, that this question has ever been adjudicated, either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>in this state or in any of our sister states; but all the authorities in the English books, both ancient and modern, establish the right of the widow, to be endowed of such mines as have been opened and worked during the life of the husband, <footnotemark>(x)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Mrs. <em>Coates, </em>then, is entitled to be endowed of the ore bed in question. The admeasurers were irregular in undertaking to decide upon her right in the land. It belonged to the Surrogate to determine What proportion of the premises should be set off, and it was the duty of the admeasurers to \u2022obey his order. What facts appeared before the Surrogate the Court cannot know ; but it is to be presumed that he decided correctly, and according to the facts presented to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">Another question for o\u00far consideration is, whether the appellant was entitled to <em>one third </em>or only <em>one sixth </em>of the property. In <em>Hitchcock </em>v. <em>Harrington,</em><footnotemark><em>(y)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was decided that the widow of the mortgagor was entitled to dower, the mortgage being paid up, and the tenant deriving title through the mortgagor, the mortgagee having never entered or foreclosed his mortgage.\" In <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Torry,</em><footnotemark><em>(z)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the demandant shewed title from one <em>Merrick, </em>in 1775, to her husband. From him it passed, through <em>Parsons </em>and <em>Winston, </em>to the tenant. The tenant produced a mortgage from <em>Merrick, </em>in 1772,' which was duly assigned to the administrator of <em>Winston, </em>and upon which, as appeared by an endorsement, interest was paid, in \u00cd784: The Court decided in favour of the demandant ; and among other things, say\u2014\u201c A mortgage, before foreclosure or entry, is not now regarded as a legal title,\u2019 which a stranger can setup. It can only be used by the mortgagee and his representatives.\u201d It is added\u2014\u201c The' purchase of the mortgage was, in effect, a discharge of the mortgage, in favour of the title under the mortgagor: It is therefore extinguished, and .the' title of the tenant relates back to, and is founded on the seisin of -the husband.\u201d In <em>Stow </em>v. Tifft,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the Court decided that the widow of a mortgagor for the purchase money, the deed and mortgage being cotemporancous, is barred of her dower, by foreclosure of the mortgage. A question, thqn, presents itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>whether the purchase, by the respondent, of <em>Harmon'1 s </em>mortgage, is to be considered an extinguishment of it, or whether his possession is to be considered an entry, under the mortgage, in the nature of a foreclosure. The spirit of the cases cited seems to be this; that where the tenant in possession enters by virtue of a purchase from the mortgagor, then, .the subsequent purchase of the mortgage, by him, is an ex-tinguishment, and the widow\u2019s right relates back to the pur* .chase b.y her husband, and she shall recover. But where .the tenant enters by virtue of a foreclosure, or after a forfeiture for non-payment of the money, then the estate is deemed never to have vested in the husband, and the widow is not entitled to dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">In this view of the case, Mrs. <em>Coates </em>is entitled to dower in the whole of the premises, according to the value at the time of alienation by her husband. The Surrogate, therefore, was right in directing the admeasurers to lay off <em>one third, </em>by metes and bounds, and the admeasurers erred in adopting a different rule. They ought to have assigned to the widow one third of th.e whole estimated value of the property, deducting the value of the improvements made since the sale by her husband.
