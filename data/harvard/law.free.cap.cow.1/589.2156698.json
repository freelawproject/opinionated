L. </em>275,) hut had omitted to record it in the town clerk\u2019s office, as required by the 1st section of the act, <em>(id. </em>270) nor had the road been opened. An <em>alt ternahve mandamus, </em>returnable at the last <em>May </em>term, having issued, directed to the defendants, commanding them to proceed and open a road (describing it) they returned, that no such road, as the one described in the writ, had been laid out. The original application to lay out the road having been lost, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the affidavits for the <em>mandamus </em>had been drawn up from recollection; and affidavits were now produced, (copies whereof had been served on the defendants, with notice of Present motion) of information and belief, that the defendants, or one of them, had the application in their possession, or under their control; and that <em>Vail, </em>one of the defendants, had admitted this. The affidavits farther went to shew that, probably, the <em>mandamus </em>had misdescribed the road, in consequence of the relator\u2019s not having had theusp of the proper papers when he commenced his proceedings. The defendants made oath, that the application of the twelve freeholders was in the hands of <em>Nathaniel </em>Hyatt, Esquire, of <em>Newcastle, </em>and beyond their control; that <em>Hyatt </em>had been a commissioner in 1817. They admitted that a road had been laid out in pursuance of it, and that it was probably the same to which the <em>mandamus </em>had intended to refer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-5\"><em>S.
