Here was a delay of thirty days after the service upon the agent; the inquest was taken and the verdict recorded before the demurrer was received. Both pleas are answered by a single replication, according to 1 <em>Ch. Pl. 574. </em>8 <em>Wentw. 5. English </em>v. <em>Petitary et al. </em>1 <em>Leon. </em>124. <em>Curtis </em>v, <em>Bateman, </em>1 S<em>id. </em>39. <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>Cheeseman, Yelv. 65. </em>Com. <em>Dig. Pleader, (F </em>4.) Matters of fact and matter of record are both put in issue by the same replication, in which case a conclusion to the country is proper. (1 <em>Ch. Pl. </em>572. <em>Esplin </em>v. <em>Smollet, Say. </em>208, <em>and Whitmore </em>v. <em>Roolce, id. </em>299.) It states no new matter. <em>(Bindon </em>v. Robinson, 1 <em>John. Rep. </em>516.) When matters of fact and law are mixed, both shall be tried by the country. <em>(Peter </em>v. <em>Stafford, Hob. </em>244. <em>Jac. L. Dic. title Record, vol. 5,p. </em>397.) And when the replication denies the substance of the plea, it may conclude to the country. <em>(Hedges </em>v. <em>Sandon, </em>2 <em>T. R. </em>439. <em>Doug. </em>95, <em>in note </em>10.) And it ought so to conclude. <em>(Haywood </em>v. <em>Davis et al. Salk. 4, pl, </em>10. 1 <em>Dunlap\u2019s Pr. </em>510.) The replication not setting up any new matter, should not conclude with a verification. (1 <em>Ch. Pl. </em>572-3.) The proper way of replying to a plea of <em>nul tiel record, </em>is to re-assert the record declared upon. <em>(id. </em>572.) The replication being entire, the conclusion, \u201c all of which, &amp;c. may be inquired of,\u201d <em>&amp;c. </em>applies to the whole replication, and every material fact set forth in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>A <em>similiter </em>was unnecessary. It was implied in the con-ending \u201c <em>et </em>ceferm.\u201d (1 <em>Ch. Pl. </em>571.) At any rate, the omission was cured by the verdict. (1 <em>Dunlap\u2019s Pr. </em>531. <em>Com. Dig. Amendment, M &amp; </em>O.)</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b165-19\"> By a mistake in punctuation, on the preceding page, it appears that <em>the notice of inquest, </em>instead of the <em>special demurrer, </em>was served after the verdict was recorded ; whereas it should have been <em>the latter. </em>The <em>tire of inquest </em>was in season, being served with the replications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AMUr\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AjT\">The demurrer in this case was not served, and it is a little doubtful whether it was sent for the purpose of being served, until after the verdict was recorded. Yet the' party had a right to demur at any time within the 20 days limited by the rule,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> (in this case 40 days, because service of the plea was upon the agent.)<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The only question is, whether the demurrer is frivolous, and in fraud of the rule which gives the time. If so, we will disregard it. Here is a plea of <em>nul tiel record, </em>in the usual form. To this the plaintiff has replied, simply, that \u201c <em>there is such a </em>record,\u201d omitting the conclusion which uniformly follows such a replication in the precedents, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> And the demurrer is special, assigning this omission for cause. We think there is ground for the demurrer, and we cannot preclude the party from bringing up the question in this shape. Here is a formal defect, and the issue is not well joined, as to the plea of <em>nul tiel record.</em></p>\n<disposition id=\"b166-6\">Motion granted.</disposition>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"><em> </em>9 <em>Reg.
