(Cable </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>15 <em>John. R. </em>152. <em>Merchant's Bank </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>2 <em>John. Rep. </em>294. <em>Post </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>18 <em>John. </em>54.) By sustainjng this application, the Court give the defendant the full benefit of his discharge, without,the possibility of the plaintiff\u2019s contesting it; for it cannot be questioned oh affidavit. <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Stafford, </em>1 <em>Caines, </em>249, <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>9 <em>John. Rep. </em>259.) Suppose an action upon this judgment; could the defendant <em>plead </em>his discharge ? He does not ask for this ; and it is now too late to do it <em>of course. (Jackson </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>7 <em>John. </em>Rep. 194. <em>Desobry </em>v. <em>Morange, </em>18 <em>John.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>336.) No excuse is shown for not pleading it earlier, as was done in <em>the Mechanick's Bank </em>v. <em>Hazard, </em>(9 <em>John. Rep. </em>392.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-4\"><em>Silliman, </em>admitted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJt\">that where the defendant has the <em>opportunity </em>of pleading his discharge, but omits to do it <em>in season, </em>he is precluded the benefit of it, unless he is afterwards <em>let in, </em>on terms, upon excusing the delay. This is the principle of the cases cited against the application, from the <em>15th, 2d, and </em>18i/i <em>of Johnson\u2019s Reports ; </em>and so in the cases of <em>Van Valkenburgh </em>v. <em>Dederick, </em>(1 <em>John. Cas. </em>133,) <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>(2 <em>Caines, </em>102,) and <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Wilmerden, (id. </em>380.) But this is clearly otherwise where the defendant has not had the chance of <em>pleading </em>his discharge. In <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Skutt, </em>(1 <em>John. Cas. </em>105,) a judgment on bond and warrant of attorney was set aside, because the defendant had obtained his discharge <em>intermediate </em>the execution of the bond and warrant, and the entry of the judgment. And in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>The Judges of Ulster County, </em>(4 <em>John. Rep. </em>191,) the defendant had been discharged the <em>same day </em>that judgment was entered, and the Court relieved him from the <em>ca. sa. </em>on motion, upon the ground which we take-in this cause. It was too late to plead <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>after the <em>relicta </em>and <em>.cognovit </em>given.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b55-9\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AXx\">-The rule is, that where the defendant has an opportunity of <em>pleading </em>his discharge, he cannot be relieved <em>on motion. </em>The last continuance is the last day of the return of the <em>venire facias, </em>which, in this case, was the <em>1st </em>day of <em>August </em>term, 1821. <em>(Br. Continuance, </em>57. <em>Bull. </em>N. <em>P. </em>310.)<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The discharge being obtained after that day, and' before the next continuance, the defendant might have pleaded it, unless prevented by the <em>relicta </em>and <em>cognovit.. </em>A plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>puis darrein-continuance </em>cannot'be pleaded after the jury have given their <em>verdict. (Pearson </em>v. Parkins, <em>Hill. 3 Geo. </em>1. <em>Bull. N. P. </em>310.) We consider the <em>relicta </em>and <em>cognovit </em>\u00a7*ven hy the defendant, equivalent to a verdict, for the purposes of the present question. The defendant, therefore, had no opportunity of <em>pleading </em>his discharge. It is not pretended butthat the discharge is regular, .</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">And the motion must-be granted.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b55-11\"><em> </em>Continuance, in the common law, <em>is of </em>the same signification, with <em>prorogatio </em>in the civil; as continuance till the next assize. <em>(Terms de la Ley, Am. ed. p. </em>114.) The continuance day is the <em>esspiri </em>day; <em>(Dyer, </em>361, . <em>pi. </em>10,) that is, the first day of term ; (1 <em>Sell. Pr.4. Walter v. Bould, Bulstr. </em>35, <em>per Hemming, C.J.) </em>and this is the proper return day of the writ; <em>(Per. Williams, J, in Walter v. Bould, </em>1 <em>Bulstr. </em>35 ;) and the appearance of the jury, and the taking of the inquest shall relate to this day. <em>(Dyer, </em>361. <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Broome, Bl. Rep. </em>497, <em>Walker, </em>arguendo.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b56-5\"> In this - case the-regularity of the discharge not being <em>questioned, </em>it \"was unnecessaryfor the Court to say what should\" be done, where the plaintiff asks the opportunity of trying its validity on the record. It appears from a case lately reported by <em>Mr. Wheeler, </em>in the JY. <em>Y. Criminal Recorder, </em>that a similar question .arose in the <em>Mayor's Court </em>of the City of <em>New-Yorle, </em>in March, 1816 ; the present able and learned Recorder being then on the Bench, and taking a principal part in the decision. The ftillowing is the report of that case :\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u201c Samuel Mabbott <em>against </em>Nicholas Van Beuren.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In this case an important question arose, upon a discharge under the insolvent act. The defendant\u2019s default was entered for not-pleading on the 10ft of <em>October </em>last. On the 21 <em>st </em>of <em>October </em>the defendant was discharged tinder the act. On the 24ft of <em>October </em>execution was issued against him. The defendant being taken on-the execution, the question was, Has he any relief ?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Riker, Recorder.\u2014The general vale is this : If the discharge he on the same day, or subsequent to tlie judgment, the Court will relieve on motion, because the defendant had no opportunity to plead his discharge <em>puis darrein continuance. </em>The Court will not drive the insolvent to his <em>audita querela. (Baker v. Judges of Ulster, John. Rep </em>191.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">If the insolvent omit to plead his discharge, the Court will not relieve him, after he is taken in execution. <em>(Cross </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>2 Caines, 102.) It is true, an insolvent, after a continuance has passed, has, on payment of costs, been allowed to plead his discharge <em>nunc pro tunc. (Morgan &amp; Smithv. Dyer, </em>9 <em>John. Rep. </em>255, 256. 1 <em>Chitty,63.) </em>This was before execution. But what is the law where the insolvent obtains his discharge a few days before the judgment, and too short a time to give him an opportunity to plead it\", and is taken in execution ? Reason and equity unite in this, that there should\" be relief afforded some way or other. Hbw shall it be done ? My opinion has beeq that\" the defendant'ought to be relieved from the execution: tjiatthe judgmentshbuldh\u2019e set asid'e upon payment of costs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>and that the defendant might be let in to plead his discharge. To this- plea the plaintiff might reply <em>fraud, </em>and thus put in issue the legality of the discharge. This will be doing justice to both the plaintiff and defendant. The judgment might perhaps be allowed to stand as a security for the final result.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">In this case the following order is made : let the defendant be discharged from imprisonment under the <em>ca. sa. </em>upon filing good special bail. Let the j udgment and default be set aside, and the defendantplead his discharge as of the term next after such discharge. The plaintiff to have leave to traverse or plead to the said discharge, and the defendant to pay all the costs which have accrued from the time he so obtained the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\"><em>Phanix, </em>for Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-14\">Woodsworth, for Plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
