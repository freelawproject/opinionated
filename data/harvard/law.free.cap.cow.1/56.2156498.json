It is no satisfaction so as to bar the plaintiff from taking out execution against other persons liable to the same debt or damages. <em>(Tidd, </em>958.) So if the defendant die in prison, (1 <em>R. L. </em>504, <em>Sess. </em>36, <em>ch. </em>50, s. 12,) or his body be discharged by the insolvent act. In these cases, new executions may issue.

(Bu<em>rnaby's case, Str. </em>653.) It is no answer to say that the plaintiff may hereafter be entitled to a new execution, by the death of the defendants. At common law, this could not be done. <em>(Foster </em>v. <em>Jackson, Hob. </em>52.)<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> But the <em>statute </em>makes it an exception. And the case mentioned of a discharge under the insolvent act, is also by statute. We, therefore, deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">Motion denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b69-12\"><em> </em>In this case, (p. 59,) the Court hold \u201c that a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum, </em>as against the party, is not only an execution, but a full satisfaction, by force and act, and j udgment of law.\u201d In <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>(Ambl. 79,) <em>Ld. Hardwicke </em>says, \u201c Where there is an equitable demand, and the party is taken in execution on a decree, this Court (Chancery) will issue all its process against his lands and effects; and the body being detained is not, in this Court, a satisfaction ; the reason is, because he is detained for the contempt. <em>Hut at laui, the detaining the body is a satisfaction, and you cannot afterwards take the goods. </em>And so <em>note </em>the difference between <em>common law, </em>and <em>equity</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
