The proper course is to object this by plea of <em>non-summons, </em>and support it by wager of law. But here the defendant claims a right to qualify his appearance, and comes to shew that he is under no obligation to appear. His appearance is a waiver of all defects in the return ; authorizes us to treat him as in Court, and to count against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-3\"><em>Emmet, </em>remarked that where the very question is, whether process shall issue for non-appearance, the only mode of objecting is by way of pointing out the defect which renders his appearance unnecessary. This we have a right to do, at least, as <em>amici curia ;</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to which the Court agreed; and the counsel for the tenant then objected, that the return did not state <em>the church, </em>at which proclamation was made, to he the one <em>nearest the land, </em>which they insisted was necessary, unless it appeared upon the face of the return that there was but <em>one church </em>in the <em>ward </em>where the land lies. In <em>Searle </em>v. <em>Long, </em>wdiich was a <em>quare impedit, </em>and a proceeding upon the statute of <em>Marlebridge, </em>the Court held that actual notice to the tenant was not enough ; and because it wras not in the form allowed by law, the Court set aside the subsequent proceedings ; and in <em>Furnis </em>v. <em>Waterhouse, </em>the <em>grand cape </em>was superseded, because the return of the summons was not according to the 31 <em>Eliz. (cap. </em>3.) They agreed that this return was according to the English form ; but our statute <em>(Sess. </em>10, <em>c. 50. s. </em>21, 1 <em>R. L. </em>88.) differs from the English, and with reason; for in England there is but one <em>church </em>or <em>chapel </em>in <em>&amp; parish </em>or <em>town. Parish </em>implies the precinct attached to a church, <em>(Com. Dig. Parish B. </em>2. 1 <em>Bl. Com. </em>112.) and the forms of English returns given in the books, relate to lands which lie in a <em>parish. </em>The national religion is there a part of the law of the land, and being a national establishment, the ecclesiastical division of the country, with the church attached to it, are as certain and as well defined by law as its civil divisions.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> There, when</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>the statute speaks of <em>churches, </em>it means those of the estab* lished religion, and can have no reference to the <em>meeting houses </em>of the dissenters. Hence, it is sufficient to return, in language of their statute, that the proclamation was made <em>at or near the most usual door of the church or chapel of that town or parish where the land doth lie. </em>This must, of necessity, relate to the nearest church within the precinct contemplated by the statute. But the same certainty could not be attained here, where all churches are on the same footing ; accordingly, the phraseology of our statute is different. It provides, that where there is more than one church, proclamation <em>shall be </em>made at the one <em>nearest </em>the' lands ; and if none in the town, then at the nearest church in the county; and as there might have been, and were, for aught that appears, several churches within the 2d ward, where these lands lie, the return should have stated it to be the nearest church in the ward to the lands, or have shewn but one church in the ward. Suppose the proclamation had been made at a church out of the ward ; ought not this also to have been excused by a return that there was no church in the ward <em>? </em>Nor can the defect here be supplied by intendment or construction in favour of the act of the <em>Sheriff. </em>There was as much room for favourable presumptions in the case of <em>Furnia </em>v. <em>Waterhouse, </em>as here, and yet none were allowed. Nor will the Court intend, from this return, that the service was <em>personal, </em>so as to supersede the necessity of proclamation. Indeed, the summons cannot be a personal one. It must be upon the land, and this appears from <em>Allen v. Walter, (Hob. </em>133. 2 <em>Saund. </em>43, <em>n. </em>1, and <em>vid. </em>also, <em>W. Jones 7, pl. </em>6.) True, the case in <em>Hobart, </em>was in dower. But this being a proceeding in nature of a writ of right, shews the mode of service applicable to both ; and further, as to the manner of service, they referred to <em>Com. Dig. Process, D. </em>3. <em>Archbold </em>421. <em>title, Writs in nature of a writ of right. </em>2 <em>Saund. </em>44, <em>n. 4. </em>But if a personal summons be sufficient, this return rather authorises a presumption against, than for one. It is, that; proclamation was made <em>secundum formarn statuti, </em>and it is only in cases of summons upon the land, that the statute rep quires proclamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>Radcliff. </em>It is agreed that this return accords with the English precedents, ancient and modern. A form of the English return may be found in <em>Imp. Shff. </em>402. <em>3 Wils. </em>553. 2 <em>Saund. </em>per <em>Serj. Wms. </em>43, <em>n. </em>1, in connexion with <em>id. p. </em>44, <em>n. 4. ch. </em>3 <em>pi. </em>596, The statute does not require a summons upon the land. It is true, this was the ancient practice, and was allowable where every possession was open and notorious, and every man was presumed to occupy his own land. But a personal summons was always sufficient. <em>{Booth on R. A. </em>4, 5.) In the state of modern possessions it is many times essential, to avoid imposition A summons on the land would be very imperfect in this country, for the purposes of notice ; and where the summons is personal, proclamation is unnecesary. This is required only where the summons is upon the land. As the statute was avowedly for avoiding secret summonses, there can he no motive for proclamation where the summons is personal. As to the church, the statute is merely directory. The same certainty is not required in a return as in pleading, <em>(Imp. Shff. </em>378,)<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> and every fair intendment is to be made in support of the acts of a ministerial officer. He is presumed to comply with his duty until the contrary expressly appeared,<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> and when he returns, the Court will not presume him guilty of an <em>equivoque. </em>The English statute is not confined either to <em>churches </em>or <em>parishes. </em>The proclamation is to be made at the door of the <em>church </em>or <em>chapel </em>of that <em>town </em>or <em>parish, </em>where the land lies, yet a return in the general form given by the precedents has always been holden good. And according to 2 <em>Saund. </em>43, <em>n. </em>1, it is enough, according to the modern practice, to return, that the <em>Sheriff h&amp;d </em>made proclamation <em>of the $aid summons according to the form of the statute, \u00a7rc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b17-8\">But should the Court be against the return, we then ask leave to amend, according to the fact, the summons being, in truth, regular.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-9\">Another answer to these objections is, that the defendant has a right to avail himself of them, if they are valid, by plea of <em>non-summons, </em>and where a party may plead a matter, he cannot take advantage of it by motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>The Court </em>took time for advisement, which they declared should not prejudice the demandant; hut that he might take the rule they should finally make, as of the <em>quarto die post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b18-4\">And now,</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\"><em>May </em>12th\u2014The opinion of the Court was delivered by Woodworth, J. He remarked that there was nothing in the return, or in the nature of the case, from which to infer a <em>personal </em>service on the tenant. Had such service in fact taken place and been returned, we think the proclamation would have been unnecessary ;<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> but here is evidently the common proceeding by summons on the land, and proclamation. It does not appear that such proclamation was at the church <em>nearest </em>the lands, though at one in the <em>Second ward, </em>where they lie. The return of the <em>Sheriff </em>is, that he caused proclamation to be made <em>at the most usual door of the Episcopal Church, in Beekman-Street, called St. George\u2019s Chapel, in the Second ward, fyc. </em>We think, that to make the return conform to the statute of this state, he should have gone further, and shewn by the return, either, that <em>St. George\u2019s Chapel </em>was the church within the ward <em>nearest </em>the land, or that it was the <em>only </em>church within the ward. No doubt, that where an omission of duty would be culpable, the officer will, in general, be presumed to have done his duty. But we think the rule does not extend to this case. The statute requires great strictness in this proceeding of the officer ; and his compliance with it ought not to be left to inference, but should plainly appear upon his return. The rule for a <em>grand cape </em>is, therefore, refused, and the demandant must proceed by an <em>alias summons,</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>unless <em>St. George\u2019s Chapel </em>was, in fact, the nearest church in the ward. If so, the <em>Sheriff </em>may amend according to the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">At the opening of the Court on the 13th, <em>Radcliff </em>men-, tioned that, at his request, the <em>Deputy Sheriff, </em>who had served the writ, was in attendance to amend his return. This was, perhaps, a matter of course under the rule which had been made; but, as it was convenient, he requested, for grea-</p>\n<p id=\"b19-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tei\u2019 caution, permission to amend it in open the immediate direction of the <em>Justices. </em>Court, under</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\"><em>Ulshoeffer </em>and <em>T. A. Emmet, </em>for the tenant, asked to be heard against the principle of the amendment. As it could not be known what disposition the Court would make of the other objections, the attention of the counsel had not been directed to this branch of the discussion. Leave being granted, they contended that no amendment could be allowed in this case. The statute is, that <em>if the summons shall not be proclaimed and returned, then no grand cape to be awarded, but an alias or pluries summons, as the case shall require. </em>The process is not vitiated ; the effect is merely a change of process, and the action proceeds. Now, in circumstances much more unfavourable to the demandant; indeed, where the omission is fatal to his <em>remedy, </em>and even Ms <em>right, </em>the Courts have refused amendments. In <em>Charlwood </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>(4 <em>Bos. &amp;. Pull. </em>64,) a motion was made to amend the <em>count </em>in a writ of right, so as to correct the pedigree. This the Court refused, though <em>Mansfield, C. J. </em>said they would have been willing to amend, had not this been a proceeding by <em>writ of right, </em>which he said had always been discouraged, and tenants had been allowed to avail themselves of every advantage to defeat the claims of demandants. And in this all the Justices agreed. And upon the same principle they refused the demandant leave to discontinue. In <em>Maidment </em>v. <em>Jukes, </em>(5 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>429,) the Court, on the authority of <em>Charlwood </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>ordered a side bar rule to discontinue, to be set aside with costs. In <em>Dumsday </em>v. <em>Hughes &amp; Bedford, </em>(3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>453,) the Court refused an amendment of the <em>count, </em>in a writ of right, after demurrer argued, although cases of amendment were cited in <em>formedon </em>and <em>dower, </em>and in <em>common recoveries. </em>This case, refers the strictness or liberality of the Court, in allowing amendments, to the nature of the action. <em>Dower, </em>say the Court, is favoured in the law. But the cases cited shew that the remedy by writ of right has always been holden to be <em>stricti </em>juris. And the Courts have refused amendments, even where the demandant will, in consequence,,be <em>barred </em>by the <em>statute of limitations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AP5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Again, this return being defective, the tenant was not bound t\u00b0 appear. There is no means of compelling his appearanee except by an <em>alias. ' </em>The Court have not now the power\u2019 ^ an amendment, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>to make the defendant a defaulter by relation, on the <em>quarto die post, </em>and subject him to a <em>gfand cape.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\"><em>Radcliff, </em>said that the cases in which Courts would discourage remedies were those where the party had a choice between different modes of redress. It is, really, very singular that the legislature should give a remedy, and yet that it should be the duty of the Court to set about defeating it by requiring an almost impracticable strictness, not applicable to any other case. The authorities cited relate to the a- \u2022 mendment of the <em>count, </em>or relief by discontinuance, against the omission of <em>&amp; party ; </em>but the application here, is to amend the return of the officer*?/ho served the process. Nor is it competent to object that we are not now on the <em>quarto die post. </em>The delay for advisement was declared by the Court to be without prejudice, and our proceedings are tobe entered <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\"><em>Slosson, </em>observed that the demandant must offer himself the first day, or a <em>ne recipiatur </em>may be entered. He must then appear with a <em>regular </em>return. If the Court had powei to amend on <em>the first </em>day, they cannot do it on the <em>quarto die post. </em>On that day, the return being insufficient, the tenant may depart without being guilty of a contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\"><em>Radcliff, </em>denied that the omission of the demandant id offer himself, would prevent his being afterwards received to prosecute. It is true, we are demandable on the first day, and if we do not appear, may be shut out by a <em>ne recipiatur. </em><footnotemark>(g.)</footnotemark> But it does not follow that we must come with a suffi-</p>\n<p id=\"b21-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>clent return, officer.

This was opposed on the ground of the great strictness which prevails in real actions. But the default was set aside. I should say, then, <em>a fortiori, </em>that relief ought to be granted here, in a cas\u00e9 which is a iher\u00e9 mistake of the officer. There is no difficulty here from the <em>quarto die post </em>having elapsed. The demand of the tenant was made on that day, but opposed for a defect in the return; and the motion has been adjourned from day to day.</p>\n<author id=\"b21-8\">Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axs\">It would, indeed, be a disgraceful rale in our jurisprudence, which would forbid an amendment in this mere mistake in form, by the officer, whether the effect be to delay the d\u00e9mandant \u00f3r turn him out of Court.
