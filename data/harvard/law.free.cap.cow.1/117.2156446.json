This being void, no action lies for the costs. The \u00b0 . same reasoning applies to that part of the award, which directs a surrender of the land. The submission was, to determine whether the defendant had land of the plaintiffs in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>possession.

To ascertain it, the patent must be run out by surveyors.

Palmer, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abf\">The plaintiffs seek, by an action on the bond, to recover the costs of the ejectment, which they aver to be \u00a742,20. And the only question is, whether these can be recovered, either as <em>costs awarded, or due </em>by the <em>terms </em>of the submission. The awarding of costs was inch denial to the power of the arbitrators; or, if not so, yet the <em>express </em>agreement set forth in the bond, relative to these costs, conferred that power. The award was to be <em>\u201cof and upon the premises.\u20191'1 </em>But, admitting they had no such power, it is a part of the <em>condition, </em>that the costs should be paid, if the award is against the defendant; and so much as relates to the costs maybe rejected as surplusage. The declaration states all the circumstances of the case, but is, in substance and effect, a declaration in debt, upon the penalty of the bond. It will be intended, that the \u00e1rbitrators acted within the powers delegated to them, till the contrary appear; and it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>enough, for the purposes of this action, that the award is certain in pointing out the land of the plaintiffs, which was in possession of the defendant. That it is so, is plain, f''om th\u00ae award, when taken in connexion with the subject submitted, as it is described by the bonds.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\"> <em>Pratt </em>v.

The contingency was, \u201c <em>if the award should he that the defendant had any land of the said Henry, Rice and Sally, in his </em>possession.\u201d The defendant is not liable, unless a valid award has been made. It is contended, on behalf of the defendant, that the arbitrators exceeded their powers, in several particulars ; and that, therefore, the award is void. The first objection is, that the arbitrators established a <em>stake, </em>in the margin of the river, instead of the <em>cedar post, </em>as the commencement of the dividing line, and were not governed by the proper evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">It does not appear that the <em>cedar post </em>was disregarded. There is no averment that the <em>stake </em>is not at the identical1 <em>place </em>where the <em>cedar post </em>stood when the bond was executed. We cannot intend that the arbitrators commenced running the line at a different place from the one designated. If they did, it was matter of defence, and must be shewn by the defendant. The same reasoning applies to the objection, that the courses and distances, in the original leases, were not followed. The award says, <em>the line rims westerly, along stakes recently set up. </em>We have no evidence that the <em>stakes </em>were not set on the line designated by the courses and distances. The award, to be valid, must be certain, and settle and determine the subjects in controversy. It is evident, in this case, that when once the dividing line is ascertained, the controversy must be at an end. The plaintiffs claimed title in one lot, the defendant in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>If the defendant possessed land included in the plaintiffs\u2019 lot, the \u25a0 line being run, ascertained the extent of that possession ; and, according to tlie terms of the submission, the defendant was bound to surrender it. <em>Payment </em>of the costs, . * o and <em>surrender </em>of the land, were made to depend on the <em>\u25a0award. </em>If, on establishing the line, the defendant had possession of the plaintiffs\u2019 land, he bound himself to surrender and pay the costs. I understand, by the submission, that the arbitrators wrere to <em>settle the line </em>only. The parties required nothing beyond this. They stipulated, in their bonds, for the <em>payment </em>of costs, and <em>surrender </em>of possession, to the party in whose favour the award might be. If the award is good, as to the <em>line, </em>the defendant is bound, by his own stipulation, as to the <em>costs. </em>On this the plaintiffs must rest their right to recover. It is true the arbitrators had no authority to award the costs,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> or that the land be surrendered. That was not submitted to them. The award, in this respect, is merely void. This being conceded, does not affect the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover, provided they have shewn a good award as to the line between lots No. 16 and 17, which is the point submitted, I think there is sufficient <em>certainty. </em>The <em>place of beginning </em>is pointed out. <em>Slakes </em>were placed the whole extent of the line. A survey of the patent, to ascertain the division line, would be useless. Enough is shewn to enable either party to decide*</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Whether his possession corresponded with it. If it did, there was no room for further litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Although the award is bad in part, it does not affect the residue, on which the plaintiffs rely. There is no connex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>ion between the two subjects, nor- do they depend on each other. The rule is well settled, that if the submission be of a particular thing, and the award is of that which is sub- and also of something else, though with respect to the latter it be void, the party is bound to perform the rest. <em>(Kyd on </em>Awards, 244. 2 <em>Roll. </em>46.) It is void only <em>pro tq,nto, </em>because not connected with the residue, so as to affect the justice of the case. (13 <em>John. </em>264, <em>Martin et al. </em>v. <em>Williams.</em>)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">I am of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Judgment for the plaintiffs,</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\"> And an attachment for not paying them, had the award been made a rule of court, it seems, would not lie; because, although due. upon the bond, <em>its a sum stipulated to be paid, </em>and depending upon the award, yet they are not due <em>as a sum of money awarded ; </em>and, therefore, would not come within the rule : and so it was held in <em>Strutt </em>v. Rogers, (7 Taunt. <em>Rep. </em>213,) in relation to costs which the bonds of submission declared, \u00abhould abide the event of the award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
