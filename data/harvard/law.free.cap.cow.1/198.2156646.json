He likened this proceeding to a subpoena in chancery, which might be served on the wife, or some'one of the defendant\u2019s family, between whom and himself the relation of master and servant exists. Both are process; and the reason seems to be much stronger in favour of this service upon the defendant\u2019s clerk, who understands the subject. The Court will regard this as equivalent to a personal service within the rule in <em>Backus </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>(8 <em>John. </em>346.)</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b210-13\"><em> Backus </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>8 <em>John.
