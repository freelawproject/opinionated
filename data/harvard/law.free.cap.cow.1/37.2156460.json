Willard </em>against <em>John Theodore De Missani, </em>who put in special bail the 23d <em>January </em>last, at the suit of <em>George B. Willard, </em>The declaration commenced thus : \u201c <em>Charles Willard, </em>at whose suit, by the name of <em>George B. Willard, John Theodore De Missani </em>was arrested in this suit,7 &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-18\"><em>Russell, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ7\">referred to <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Hulbart, </em>(1 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>645,) <em>Symmers </em>v. <em>Wason, (id. </em>105,) and to 1 <em>Chitty's Pl. </em>251-2, which, <em>in terms, </em>sanctions this mode of declaring. He said, the defendant is not entitled to <em>oyer, </em>in order to plead this matter <em>in abatement ; </em>and ought not to be permitted to take advantage of the variance in this summary way. <em>(Tidd, </em>404. <em>Spalding </em>v. <em>Mure, </em>6 <em>T. R. </em>363.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-19\"><em>Davis, </em>said that for this very reason the objection should be allowed. Here was an attempt to charge a man, by declaring in a cause wherein no writ ever issued, and in which neither party are in Court. No <em>case </em>can be found to sanction such a proceeding. The authorities referred to, in <em>Bosanquet fy Puller, </em>are where the <em>defendant </em>is misnamed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b49-22\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AClx\">The 1 <em>Chitty on Pl. </em>251-2, is an authority for this mode of declaring ; but the case to which he refers is <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Hubbart, </em>(1 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>645.) This case does not bear him out. It is where a defendant, sued by a <em>wrong </em>name, <em>appeared, </em>and was <em>declared against </em>by his <em>right </em>one. The case here is directly the reverse. The <em>capias </em>is at the suit of <em>George B. Willard, </em>according to which the defendant appears. <em>Charles Willard </em>then comes in and declares in his own name. The <em>declaration </em>must correspond with the <em>process </em>in the names of the parties. <em>(Tidd, </em>402.) The case of a <em>defendant, </em>sued by a <em>wrong </em>name and appearing in his <em>right </em>onp, is an <em>exception </em>to this rule. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>tiff may, in such case, declare against him, by the name in which he <em>appears, </em>stating that he was arrested or served with process by the other: for, by <em>appearing, </em>the defendant admits himelf to be the person sued, and so the variance is immaterial. <em>(Tidd, </em>402. <em>Hole </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>2 <em>Wils. </em>393.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\">And the motion was granted,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
