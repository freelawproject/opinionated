L. </em>344,) \u201c that if in any <em>personal </em>action in this Court, the plaintiff shall not recover more than 50 dollars, he shall pay costs to the defendant,\u201d applied to this case. He said, though an action for a <em>libel </em>is a <em>personal </em>action, yet it is not an action of <em>slander, </em>within the meaning of the <em>2d proviso </em>in that section. In <em>2 Dunlap\u2019s Pract. 712, </em>it is said, that a recovery in a <em>libel suit, </em>unless it exceed 50 dollars, will not carry costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-19\"><em>Foote, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARsF\">said, that the <em>2d proviso </em>in the <em>4th section, </em>51 that nothing therein contained should extend to an action of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>slander,\u201d was intended to embrace the recovery in a libel sti it <em>Slander </em>is a <em>generic </em>term, and clearly includes <em>libel, </em>which is <em>written slander. </em>The provision in the <em>6th section, </em>that.in aG^ons for <em>slanderous </em>words, if the damages are assessed under 50 dollars, the plaintiff shall recover no more costs than damages, was not intended of <em>slanderous writing, </em>or libel. In the <em>4th section, </em>the <em>generic </em>term is used; in the <em>6th, </em>the <em>specific </em>term. The first includes libel-^-the last excludes it, and this leaves the first section of the act, which carries costs in all cases where any thing is recovered, to its effect upon this action, and the plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to full costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-4\"><em>Swetland, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aofd\">said the definition of a libel given oi$ the other side was too limited. It embraces not only written and printed scandal, but pictures, intended to ridicule another. The action for a libel is a personal action of trespass on the case, and as such, is within the jurisdiction of a justice. The 25 and 50 dollar acts contain an exception of <em>slander </em>merely, which, as I have already shewn, does not extend to a <em>libel. </em>A justice has cognizance of several actions, as difficult in their nature as an action for a libel.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b428-5\">Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4t\">I think the word <em>slander, </em>as used iti the <em>2d proviso </em>of the <em>4th section </em>of the statute of costs, was intended to include <em>libel.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b428-6\">Savage, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtaI\"><em>Slanderous words </em>are spoken of in the <em>6th section </em>of this statute, as distinct from <em>slander, </em>which is excepted from the operation of the <em>4th section.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b428-7\">Woodworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A588\">I have known several instances of actions for <em>libels, </em>with very trifling verdicts, in which the right to full costs was not drawn in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
