On judgments in the Court of Common Pleas in <em>Crawford </em>county, <em>Pennsylvania ; </em>2. The money counts. A demurrer to the counts upon the judgments had been determined in favour of the defendants, in- <em>January </em>. . _ - . mi _ . __ 7. \u00ab term, 1831. 1 he venue was laid in <em>Marnson, </em>and issue o\u00ed <em>non assumJs^rim^ </em>joined on the money counts, in <em>October </em>term, 1820. These were shown to he mere form, however, and whole cause of action had been disposed of by the demurrer. The <em>Madison </em>Circuit, for 1821, passing, without the cause being noticed for trial, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney slipulated to try at the next Circuit, which having passed with- . <em>\u00b0 i </em>out the cause being noticed,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A75I\"><em>Woods, </em>now moved for judgment, as in case of- non-suits</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AFl\"><em>Stower, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A74P\">read an affidavit shewing, that on the <em>25lk june </em>1823, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and the defendants had ... agreed, m writing, that the cause should not be tried at the ^len next Circuit.

The attorney\u2019s lien, if it exists, in such a case as this, cannot interfere with the equitable arrangements of the parties, and their right to a mutual set off. <em>(Porter v. </em>Lane, 8 <em>John. Rep. </em>357. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hawks, </em>15 <em>id. </em>407. <em>Spence </em>v. <em>White, </em>1 <em>John. Cas. </em>102. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Ody, </em>2 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>28, <em>the opini\u00f3n of Ld. Ch. J. Eldon. Emden </em>v. <em>Darby, </em>4 <em>id. </em>22.) This Court proceeds upon the rule of the English Common Pleas, as settled by the cases last cited. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Lane </em>adopts the cases cited from <em>Bos. dr Pull. </em>The cases in the <em>K. B. </em>of <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>(6 <em>T. R. 456,)filowell et al. </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>(8 <em>East, </em>362,) and the cases in this Court of <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>(2 <em>Caines, </em>105) and <em>Desoy </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>(3 <em>John. </em>247,) are overruled by <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Lane.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-4\">Again : the cases in which the attorney has a <em>lien </em>for costs, are those only where they are liquidated by a recovery. \u00a1No case can be found going farther than this. Where the costs are thus liquidated, if they are paid to the party, in violation of a notice not to pay, the attorney may enforce his lien notwithstanding. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Oldfield, </em>4 <em>T. R. </em>123. <em>Pindar </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>3 <em>Caines, </em>166. 1 <em>Tidd. </em>287-8. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Eyles, H. Bl. </em>122. <em>Turwin </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>3 <em>Aik. </em>719.) The attorney has no lien, except on the final balance. <em>(Howell et al. </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>8 <em>East, </em>362.) But this cause is not finally determined. The defendants admit the claim of the plaintiff, and propose a settlement. Shall the attorney be allowed to interpose his claim of costs, to prevent a settlement, or any steps leading to it ? He undertakes upon the credit of his client. He must look to him, and may decline proceeding, if he is not paid his costs, at any stage of the proceeding'. (1 <em>Dunlap, </em>79, <em>and note. </em>8 <em>John. </em>357. <em>Castro &amp; Wife </em>v. <em>Bennet, </em>2 <em>John. </em>296.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-5\">In <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hawks, </em>(15 <em>John. Rep. </em>406-7) the claim of the attorney was allowed, but <em>Spencer, </em>Ch. J. says, \u201c The question now before the Court is not whether the lien of the attorney, for bis costs, is superiour to the equity of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>defendant, who has a matter of set off existing against the plaintiff. <em>'A different rule has been adopted, by this Court, in suck a case,</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-3\"><em>J. C. Spencer, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARr\">The lien of the attorney takes preference to the equitable arrangements of the parties, where <em>actual notice </em>is given, as in this case. It is only in the absence of such notice, that they have been allowed to prevail. This distinction is fully established by the case of <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hawks, </em>(15 John. <em>Rep. </em>405,) None of the cases make a distinction between a judgment perfected, or one which a party has a right to perfect. The claim is as certain, to every legal intent, in the latter case as in the former; and it is the same in good sense. Here is a judg\u00e1knt upon demurrer, the costs of which have been earned by the attorney. The proceeding to move for judgment, as in- case of non-suit, is the only mode of enforcing the lien. The right of the attorney arose upon the default to notice the cause for trial. He then acquired a right to perfect his judgment upon the demurrer, and to move for and obtain a judgment as in case of non-suit. He gives notice, in violation of which the attorney for the plaintiff tampers with the defendants, and claims thereby to defeat the opposite attorney\u2019s lien.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b186-4\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A8o\">The whole cause of action is disposed of by the demurrer ; and the question is reduced to one of <em>costs alone. </em>The attorney for the' defendants has a right to be protected against any settlement of those costs between his clients and the plaintiff This is always the case when he is entitled .to cost's against the opposite party, and gives, as in this instance, actual notice of his claim, at the same time forbidding an interference.with it by the parties. He has a lien on the \u2019costs, and stands in the light of an assignee. <em>(Martin </em>v. Hawks, 15 <em>John. </em>405.) As no settlement can be made, or release given, after notice ; so no act to delay or obstruct the attorney in his remedy for those costs will be holden valid. This is not inconsistent with the case of <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>relied upon in the argument. Here is not a question as to set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ting off these costs against other costs or damages, which have arisen in the cause, or in other causes between these parties. A different rule prevails in such a case. (15 <em>John. </em>407.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
