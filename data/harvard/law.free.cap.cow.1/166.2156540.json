The Court of C. <em>B. </em>said, \u201c the plaintiff could not be forced to proceed against a person whom he never had accepted as defendant; that the rule was regular, and the nominal plaintiff ought to be non prossed ; but, <em>being nominal, </em>the defendant could have no costs; and the motion was denied. He also cited <em>Runn. on Eject. </em>187, 202-3. 2 <em>Sellon, </em>110. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> <em>Adams on Ej. </em>244-5.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b178-16\"><em> </em>Tn the old editions this is <em>p. </em>111.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b179-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AVE5\">By the English practice, the tenant may rule the nominal plaintiff to reply to his plea, where the lessor has refused to join in the consent rule; and so non pros him. But the tenant there gets no costs.
