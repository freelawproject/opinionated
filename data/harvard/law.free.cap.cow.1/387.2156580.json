His honour the Judge, however, ruled that, although <em>Jenkins </em>&amp; <em>Havens, </em>the endorsers, by paying and taking up the notes, might have brought an action in their joint names, yet that they could not, by a subsequent transfer or delivery of the notes to the plaintiff, enable him to bring an action in his individual name : that the action could only be brought in the joint names of <em>Jenkins </em>&amp; <em>Havens ; </em>and that the evidence was not competent to sustain this action : that he would direct the plaintiff to be nonsuited, with leave to move the Court to set the nonsuit aside. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then offered to prove further, that the partnership of <em>Jenkins Sz Havens </em>had been since dissolved, and that this firm was indebted to the plaintiff, as one of the partners, to an amount equal to the amount of the notes, so that he was entitled to the whole benefit thereof; but his honour thought the testimony immaterial, and therefore rejected it, and the plaintiff was, thereupon, by his honour\u2019s direction, nonsuited, with leave to move the Court to set aside the nonsuit. A motion to set aside the nonsuit, and for a new trial, was now made accordingly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-5\"><em>W.

That <em>Jenkins &amp; Havens, </em>the indorsers, by taking up the notes, which they were legally liable to do, acquired a clear right of action, <em>upon the notes, </em>as payees ; the payment of a note, by an indorser, being a legal purchase of the security, and not an extinguishment of the note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-7\">2. That the notes, being available in their hands, and being indorsed by them in blank, they could, by transfer or delivery, enable the plaintiff to maintain an action, subject to the equities existing at the time of the transfer. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>3.

That the evidence was also competent, under the money counts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-5\">5. That his honour, the Judge, was mistaken in the law, as ruled by him; and that the nonsuit ought to he set aside~ and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-7\">The objection, at the trial was, that, as <em>Jenkins </em>&amp; <em>IJavcnshad </em>paid and taken up the notes, their negotiability had ceased; and the two cases of Blake v. Sewall,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> and Boylston v. Greene,<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> were produced at the Circuit, upon the author~ ity of which the Judge allowed the objection, and. ordered the nonsuit. The error of those cases consists in laying down the rule too broadly, and supposing that the negotiability of a note <em>absolutely </em>ceases, on its being paid. The rule is a qualified one, like that which relates- to.paper which is dishonoured, or over-due. In the latter case, it still continues negotiable, but all equities, between the. original parties, remain.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> After paying and taking up the note, the payees were fully remitted to their original rights, and held, in their first capacity as payces; and whether the maker pay it to them or to their assignee, must be immaterial to him. An indorsement in blank, authorises the holder to fill it up to himself. The cases to this point are cited by Kent, J. in Conroy v. Warren ;<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> and that authority decides, that where there are no suspicious circumstances, the Court will never, in such a case, inquire into the right of the plaintiff to sue. It is enough that he holds the note. Beck v. Robley,<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> up-~. on the authority of which the cases of Blake v. Sewall, and Boylston v. Greene, in JI'Iassaehuselts, were decided, stands upon the principle that some previous party might have been injured by the transfe'r. But Huntington is the maker of these notes, and ought to pay them; and could not Jenkins &amp; Havens, holding them in their original capacity, transfer them to the plaintiff? The case of Callow v. Lawrence, decides.this very point, and gives to <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Robly </em>its proper qualification ; and it is remarkable, that the two cases from <em>Mass. Rep. </em>have, upon a more enlightened view of the subject, in that very state, been overruled, or restricted to th;e 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>-principle, as it is to be found in <em>Callow </em>v. <em>Lawrence. </em>This was done in <em>Guild </em>v. <em>Eager &amp; another, </em><footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant has a full right, in this case, to all the defence which can exist, or could ever have existed. He is, consequently, not injured by the form of the action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-4\"><em>G. Griffin, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aej\">1. The notes on which the action is founded, having been once paid, ceased to be negotiable, and could not, therefore, be transferred to the plaintiff, so as to enable him to sustain an action in his own name.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-5\">2. <em>Jenkins </em>&amp; <em>Havens </em>could not have maintained any action on the notes themselves, as they were accommodation notes, though they might for the <em>money paid ; </em>but the right of action for money paid is not negotiable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-6\">There are, in reality, substantial reasons why this action should have been brought in the name of <em>Jenkins </em>&amp; <em>Havens, </em>instead of <em>Havens </em>individually. It is conceded, that if the defendant may, by possibility, be injured by this form of proceeding, the action cannot be sustained. Here is a notice of set off. Now suppose our right of set off to be against <em>Jenkins \u00a7\u25a0 Havens jointly; do they not </em>defeat it <em>by </em>thus, of their own heads, declining to be plaintiffs, and throwing <em>Havens </em>forward as the sole party ? All the cases cited by the gentleman, steer clear of the real point in controversy. These are accommodation notes, endorsed and discounted for the benefit of <em>Huntington ; </em>so that, in truth, the endorsers Were mere sureties for the defendant. <em>Jenkins </em>&amp; <em>Havens </em>paid the money and took back the notes as endorsers. The cause of action was then properly money paid, laid out and expended\u2014a mere chose in action, not assignable. Admit them restored to their original capacity ; what was this \u2022? Not that of payees. They never could have counted upon these notes <em>as such. </em>They never were made and delivered <em>as promissory notes </em>to <em>Jenkins fy Havens. </em>They differ, therefore, altogether from the case of notes given for a debt due to <em>Jenkins &amp; Havens. </em>A payment would there remit them to their original situation as <em>endorsers. </em>Here it merely gives them a <em>new </em>right of action as sureties, which was created by the payment. They have stood all along in the relation of <em>mere sureties.-.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>But these notes are <em>functus officio, </em>without reference to ^le effect which may be produced upon any of the parties to them. They ate so within the case of <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Robley. </em>That case was decided in the 14 <em>Geo. </em>3 ; and being beforfe, the revolution, is binding upon this Court, notwithstanding the cases decided there since.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-5\"><em>Slosson, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Addn\"><em>Jenkins </em>&amp; <em>Havens were </em>hot <em>mere sureties'. </em>They became <em>sureties upon negotiable paper ; </em>and are entitled to all the benefit arising from the form in which the bu siness was done. No authorities have been or can be cited against this doctrine. Being the beneficial owners, they are entitled to treat this p\u00e1per <em>as-promissory notes, </em>and transfer it accordingly. They became the substituted holders of the notes. Had a third person paid the note, and taken it from the bank, could not an action have been maintained \"upon it ? In <em>Callow </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>it was holden that one who takes up a note, becomes the purchaser, and may sue upon it as such. In <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Robley, </em>the right of action is denied upon the single ground of injury to <em>Hodgson. Huntington, </em>I repeat, cannot complain. He has every equitable defence by way of set off or otherwise ; and he may avail himself of it equally as if the suit were in the name of the payees.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Al_\"> <em>Callow </em>v. <em>Lawrence, 3 M &amp; S. 95 Ch.on Bills, Phil. ed. </em>440.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b402-16\"> Cooper v.

The objection to the right of recovery is merely to the form of action. It is urged on this principle, that by payment of a bill or note, the contract of the parties to it ceases. It is not necessary to controvert this proposition, in order to decide the present cause. A remedy in this form, on the note itself, is certainly convenient; and if it can be shown that no injury can arise by sustaining it, I should be inclined to uphold it, unless restrained by a uniform current of authority. The case of <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Robley, </em>(1 <em>H. Bl. </em>89,) is relied on by the defendant\u2019s counsel as in point; but it will be found, on ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>animation, to be clearly distinguishable. The facts were these : <em>Brown </em>drew a bill of exchange upon Robley, payable to Hodgson, or order, which was accepted by <em>Robley, </em>and indorsed by <em>Hodgson. </em>Not being paid when due, <em>Hodgson </em>returned the bill, and <em>Brown </em>took it up, <em>Hodgson\u2019s </em>indorsement still remaining. <em>Brozan </em>afterwards gave the bill to <em>Beclc, </em>as a security for money. The jury found a verdict for the defendant, on the ground that th\u00e9 acceptor was discharged by <em>Brown\u2019s </em>taking up the bill, and that there Was an end to its negotiability. The Court held the action not maintainable ; not on the ground, that where a bill Comes back unpaid, and is taken up by the drawer, it ceases, in every case, t\u00f3 be a bill, but that the facts in that case required it so to be considered. This is evident from the expressions of Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>Who observes, \u201c if it were negotiable, <em>Hodgson </em>would be liable, for which there is no colour.\u201d The consequences that would follow from a different decision, could not be sanctioned. The payment by <em>Brown </em>to <em>Hodgson, </em>wholly exonerated the latter. It was the same thing as striking out his indorsement; and if so, <em>Beck </em>could have no title to the bilk If, notwithstanding the payment to <em>Hodgson, </em>his indorsement passed the interest in the bill to <em>Beck, </em>it follows that he Would be liable as an indorser\u2014a proposition too absurd and unjust to be tolerated. The distinction, in the present case, is manifest. It is true, the indorsers here have taken up the note, as the drawer did in <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Robley : </em>they afterwards passed it, but on their own indorsement solely. -\u2018The plaintiff derives his right from <em>Jenkins </em>&amp; <em>Havens, </em>Who ought to be liable as indorsers ; for it must be presumed they have received value for the transfer. Supposing <em>Havens </em>had indorsed this note, and Jet\u00f3<em>kins </em>&amp; <em>Havens </em>had paid hiin and taken it up, but omitted to strike out his name ; the holder could not recover on a Count, stating the indorsement to him to have been made by Havens; because then the principle in <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Robley </em>would apply. The two cases would be alike. Here there are no interests of third persons to be affected, but in the manner prescribed by law. The note continued negotiable in the hands of <em>Jenkins </em>Havens, by their own indorsement. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>they passed it, there is no reason why they should not he liable. In <em>Callow </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>(3 <em>M. </em>&amp; S. 95,) the case was this : The drawer of a bill, payable to his own order, indorse(l \u00fc to <em>Taylor, </em>who discounted it for him. <em>Taylor </em>indorsed it to <em>Bassett. </em>Upon the bill being dishonoured, the drawer paid the amount to <em>Bassett, </em>who struck out his own and <em>Taylor's </em>indorsement, and returned it to the drawer, who afterwards passed it to the plaintiff. It was held that he might recover against the acceptor. Lord <em>Ellenhorough, </em>in that case, says, \u201c If the drawer has paid the bill, he may sue the acceptor on that bill, and if, instead of suing the acceptor, he put it into circulation on his own indorsement only, it does not prejudice any of the other parties.\u201d He considered that <em>Bywell, </em>the drawer, became the purchaser of the bill when he passed it and took it up ; that it was not paid <em>animo solvendi, </em>in order to extinguish it, but only to relieve himself from the situation in which he stood upon the bill. All the Judges concurred in the opinion, that the case of <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Rohley </em>was decided on the distinction I have laid down. In <em>Gomez Serra </em>v. <em>Berkley, </em>(1 <em>Wils. </em>46,) the point in question seems to have been settled. There the payees of a promissory note, payable to them or order, indorsed it to the plaintiff, and afterwards paid the note and took it back, and then passed it a second time to the plaintiff. It was held that the plaintiff might recover against the maker ; for he was still liable to the payees, when they passed the note a second time ,to the plaintiff; and that the plaintiff ought to stand in their place. The next objection is,, that <em>Jenkins </em>&lt;5- <em>Havens </em>could not have maintained an action on the notes themselves, as they were accommodation notes, though they may for the money paid. It will be conceded that <em>Jenkins </em>&amp; <em>Havens </em>could not sustain an action on the notes, before payment at the bank. Previous to that there was no consideration, but becoming liable on the notes as indorsers, and it being their duty to take them up, the money paid operated as a purchase of the security; and from that moment it ceased to be an accommodation note, indorsed by them for the defendant, but a valid note to <em>Jenkins </em>&amp; <em>Havens, </em>founded on good consideration. I am of opinion, that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akcl\">The only question is, whether the notes oeased to be negotiable in consequence of having been dishonoured by the maker, and paid by the indorsers.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">All the doubt that exists upon this point, has grown out of the case of <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Robley, </em>(1 <em>H. Bl. Rep. </em>89, <em>note.) </em>And all the cases, in which the negotiability of a note, or bill of exchange, circumstanced like these, has been called in question, put themselves upon the authority of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">That was the case of a bill of exchange, drawn by one <em>Brown </em>upon <em>Robley, </em>in favour of one <em>Hodgson, </em>accepted by <em>Robley, </em>and endorsed by <em>Hodgson. </em>Not being paid by the acceptor, when due, <em>Brown, </em>the drawer, took it up, <em>Hodgson\u2019s </em>endorsement being still upon it. <em>Brown </em>subsequently passed it to <em>Beck, </em>the plaintiff. It was held, by Lord <em>MansJield, </em>that the drawer, after having paid the bill, could not again put it in circulation ; because, by so doing, <em>Hodgson, </em>the payee and endorser, would be subjected to a suit upon it, which clearly ought not to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">This case has always been Considered, in <em>England, </em>as standing upon its own particular grounds; and has never been held to decide, that a bill or note is not negotiable after it becomes due, and has been taken up, unless by putting it in circulation again : some party to it might be subjected to a suit, who ought not to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The case of <em>Callow </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>(3 <em>M. &amp; S. </em>94) is decisive upon this point. There a bill of exchange was drawn by one <em>Pywell, </em>payable to his own order, upon, and accepted by <em>Lawrence, </em>the defendant. <em>Pywell </em>endorsed it to one <em>Taylor, </em>and <em>Taylor </em>to one <em>Bennett, </em>who held it when it became due. Not having been taken up by <em>Lawrence, </em>the acceptor, <em>Pywell, </em>the drawer and first endorser, paid it; and, striking out the subsequent endorsements of \u2019 <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Bennett, </em>passed it to <em>Callow, </em>the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">It was held, by all the Judges, that the fact of the bill having been taken up by the drawer, did not destroy its negotiability : that the test was, <em>whether it could be put in circulation again, without prejudice to any party who ought not to pay it: </em>and that, as the drawer was also the first endorser of the bill, its negotiability could be preserved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>without prejudice to the subsequent endorsers, by striking ou\u00a3 j-jjgjj. ilameSj and leaving his own upon it. The case of <em>Gomez Serra </em>v. <em>Berkley, </em>(1 <em>Wils. </em>46) is to the same P\u00b0*nk</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\">This question was. very fully discussed in the Superior Court of <em>Massachusetts, </em>in <em>Guild v. Eager et al. </em>(17 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>615,) and the principle of <em>Callow </em>v. <em>Lawrence </em>was sanctioned and adopted, although two decisions of a contrary character had been made, in that Court, under a misapprehension of the case of <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Robley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">It is clear, then, upon the authority of these cases, that the negotiability of the notes upon which this suit was brought, was not impaired by the fact of their having been paid and taken up by <em>Jenkins </em>&lt;\u00a3\u2022 <em>Havens. </em>They were the payees and sole endorsers of the notes ; and no party, who was not at all events bound to pay them, could be sued or molested, in consequence of their being again put in circulation.</p>\n<p id=\"AgA\">If, as between <em>Jenkins &amp; Havens </em>and the defendant, there was any fraud in the transfer of these notes, or if he has any ground of defence against them, he can avail himself of it against the plaintiff; for, having taken the notes after they became due, he took them subject to every defence which existed between the original parties at the time of their transfer to him. <em>(Brown </em>V. <em>Davies, 3 T. R. </em>80. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Mather, id. </em>83, <em>note. Johnson </em>v. <em>Bloodgood, </em>1 <em>John. Cas. 51. 2 Caines\u2019 Cas. in Err. </em>303. <em>Sebring </em>v. <em>Rathbun, </em>1 <em>John. Cas. </em>331. <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Gaine &amp; Ten Eyck, 2 John.
