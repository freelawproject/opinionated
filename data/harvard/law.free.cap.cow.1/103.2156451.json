This is the precise doctrine of the case of <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>McNeil. </em>There the parties to the contract were inhabitants of <em>South-Carolina, </em>and the contract was made there. <em>McMillan, </em>the debtor, subsequently removed to the state of <em>Louisiana, </em>where he. was duly discharged from all his debts, under an insolvent law of that state. To a suit, brought by <em>McNeil, </em>against him, upon the contract made in <em>South-Carolina, </em>he pleaded his discharge. Upon demurrer to the plea, the discharge was held invalid, on the grounds which have been stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The case of <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Crowninshield, </em>of <em>Rosevelt </em>v. <em>Ce-bra,</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>In the matter of Wendell,</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>determine, that a contract, between citizens of the <em>same state, </em>is not affected by a discharge of the debtor, under an insolvent law of that state, <em>passed subsequent to l?te making of the contract. </em>And, in <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Bush,</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court decided, that a discharge, under the insolvent act, of <em>April 3d, </em>1811, was valid, in relation to all contracts made between citizens of this state, subsequent to the passage of that act. But what the effect of such a discharge would be, upon a contract made in this state, (after the passing of the act) <em>between citizens of another </em>state, has not been expressly decided: though, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>think, the reasoning and analogies to be drawn from the cases adverted to, go very far towards settling it.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">This Court, in <em>Mather </em>v. Bush, held, that the insolvent act did not impair the obligation of the contract; and that the discharge was, therefore, valid : because, the contract having been made between citizens of this state, after the passing of the law, \u201c was made under the law, and is presumed to have been made with reference to it ;\u25a0 and the parties are legally conusant of it at the time. The contract, in such case, is not impaired by the law, for the law is part of the -contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The same doctrine is held in <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Russell,</em><footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the same reason assigned ; though, in that case, only the <em>debtor party to the contract, </em>was an inhabitant of the state where the contract was made. In <em>Smith </em>v. Buchanan,<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark> a discharge, under the insolvent law of <em>Maryland, </em>was held to be no bar to an action brought in <em>England, </em>by an <em>English subject, upon a contract made in England, </em>the other party to the contract being, <em>at </em>the time of making it, a citizen of the <em>United States.-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In <em>Van Raugh </em>v. <em>Van Rrsdaln,</em><footnotemark><em>(j)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a discharge, under the insolvent laws of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>was held to be no bar to a suit brought by the endorsee, against the endorser, of a promissory note, <em>the endorsement having been made in this state, and the endorsee being, at the time of the endorsement, an inhabitant of this stale, and the endorser and defendant an inhabitant of Pennsylvania.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In all these cases; considerable importance seems to be attached to the circumstance, that one, or both of the parties, were inhabitants of the state or country where the contract was made. But, with great deference, it does appear to me, that all these cases stand upon a principle entirely independent of that circumstance. It is that of the <em>lex loci contractus : </em>that the law of the place where the contract is made, must govern the construction of the contract; and that, whether the parties to the contract are inhabitants of that place or not. The rule, I apprehend, is not founded upon the allegiance due from citizens or subjects to their respective governments, but upon the presumption of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>that the parties to a contract are conusant of the laws of the country where the contract is made; that it is made with reference to those laws, and that they, therefore, form a part ^ie contract. That this is the principle of the rule, is evident, from the exceptions to it. For where it appears that the place of performance is different from the place of making the contract, then it is to be construed according to the law of the place where it is to be performed, though neither of the parties reside or owe any allegiance there.<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark>, In <em>Robinson </em>v. Bland,<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark> a bill of exchange, drawn in France, but <em>payable </em>in <em>England, </em>for money won at gaming, in <em>France, </em>was held to be governed by the law of <em>England, </em>and, therefore, void ; and, upon the first argument of the case. <em>Lord Mansfield </em>intimated, that it made no difference whether the parties .to the contract were subjects of France, or <em>Englishmen, </em>resident there, <footnotemark>(m)</footnotemark> The same general principle is acknowledged in all the following cases : <em>Melan </em>v. <em>Luke of Fitz James, </em>1 <em>Bos. Pull. </em>138. <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>, 2 <em>John. Rep. </em>235. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Ketcham, </em>8 <em>id. </em>189. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Sterry, 5 Cranch, </em>289. <em>Slocum </em>v. <em>Pomeroy, </em>6 <em>Cranch, </em>221. <em>Lanusse </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>3 <em>Wheat. </em>101, 146. In <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Ketcham, </em>it was held that parol proof was not admissible to shew that a note, made in <em>Jamaica, </em>was to be paid in <em>Nem-York.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The rule, therefore, upon this subject, is, that the law of' the place where the contract is made, is to control it, unless it appear, upon the face of the contract, that it was to be performed at some other place, or was made with reference to the laws of some other place: and the reason of the rule is, not-the allegiance due from the contracting parties to the government, where the contract is made, or is to be executed, but the supposed reference which every contract has to the laws of the state or country where it is made, or is to be executed, whether the parties are citizens <em>o\u00ed </em>that state or country, oy not.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">The bond, in this case, therefore, having been made in this state, and it not appearing, upon the face of it, that it was to be -paid elsewhere, is to be construed according to the law of this. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>state. And having been made subsequent to the passing of the law, under which the defendant was discharged, by the established law of this state, as pronounced in <em>Mather </em>v. Bush, the discharge was no violation of the obligation of the contract, and is, therefore, valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The plaintiff having failed to aver or shew what the law of <em>Massachusetts </em>is, we are to presume it to be the same with our own. The case of <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Ketcham, </em>is precisely analagous, upon this point, to the case under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The defendant, therefore, upon every ground, is entitled to judgment upon the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Judgment for the defendant.<footnotemark>(n)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"AyC\"> 4 <em>wheat'. 122&gt;299 \u2022</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"AM2\"> 9 <em>Joh)U </em>Re2\u2018325-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(e)\">\n<p id=\"b118-5\"> 17 <em>John.
