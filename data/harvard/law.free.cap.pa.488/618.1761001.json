Shortly thereafter, Greenwood confronted the intruders armed with a loaded, .22 caliber rifle. As the intruders fled from the premises, Greenwood followed and pursued them for a distance of over 200 feet firing several shots. As one of the young men ran through a field located more than 400 feet from the Greenwood house, he was hit and fatally injured by a shot fired by Greenwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Greenwood testified on his own behalf at the trial, saying he fired the rifle to frighten the intruders only and not with any intent of hitting either of them. During cross-examination, the District Attorney was permitted to make the following inquiries over objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">\u201cQ. Is it correct that you are listed as Reverend James Greenwood in the telephone directory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">Mr. Stegenga: If the Court please, I am going to impose an objection to this type of testimony as being prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9q\">The Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">Q. The University of Pittsburgh has no theological school, does it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-9\">A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-10\">Q. California State College has no theological school, does it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-11\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-12\">Q. You have no theological degrees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-13\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-14\">Q. Why do you list yourself as a Reverend in the directory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-15\">A. Because I am a Reverend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-16\">Q. Where did you get your ministry degree?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-17\">A. Universal Life Church.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-18\">Q. Why wasn\u2019t that mentioned among your other credits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">Q. Where is the Universal Life Church?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">A. The office is in Modesto, California. But there are many branches in the country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">Q. Did you acquire that degree when you were in San Francisco?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">Q. Does that Church believe in the Ten Commandments, Mr. Greenwood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">A. The only doctrine the Universal Life Church is, you believe in what\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">Q. Does it believe that thou shalt not kill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-12\">A. The only doctrine of the Universal Life Church is believing what\u2019s right. I believe it\u2019s right not to kill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">Cross-examination of the same nature ensued of witnesses who testified to Greenwood\u2019s reputation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The cross-examination was irrelevant to the issue on trial<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and tended to divert the minds of the jury and prevent an objective resolution of the question for decision. In plain language, it created an aroma not conducive to a fair trial. Moreover, it was blatantly violative of the Act of April 23, 1909, P.L. 140, 28 P.S. \u00a7 313 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">\u201cNo witness shall be questioned, in any judicial proceeding, concerning his religious belief; nor shall any evidence be heard upon the subject, for the purpose of affecting either his competency or credibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><em>See Commonwealth v. Mimms, </em>477 Pa. 553, 385 A.2d 334 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-15\">. The judgment of sentence was affirmed by the Superior Court. Judge Spaeth filed a dissenting opinion. We granted Greenwood\u2019s petition for special allowance to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">We note that, following argument of post-verdict motions in the trial court, the President Judge of that court filed a minority opinion urging a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-14\">. For example, Greenwood\u2019s father-in-law was questioned in part as follows over objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-15\">\u201cQ. Do you know that your son-in-law is listed in the telephone directory as Reverend James Greenwood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-16\">A. Yes, sir, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-17\">Q. Have you gone to any of his church meetings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-18\">A. No, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-19\">Another witness was subject to the following cross-examination over objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-20\">\u201cQ. Where does your wife live?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-21\">A. She lives in Carnegie, Pa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-22\">Q. Are you separated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-23\">A. I\u2019ve been separated for four years, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-24\">Q. Do you go to church with Reverend Greenwood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-25\">A. No. I don\u2019t go to church with anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-26\">Q. Do you go to church?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-27\">A. No, I don\u2019t believe in church.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-28\">Another witness was cross-examined in part as follows over objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-29\">\u201cQ. Do you go to the same church as Reverend Greenwood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOih\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-30\">Q. What church do you go to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-31\">A. None.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-32\">Q. <em>Do you and your husband share Mr. Greenwood\u2019s disbelief in the Ten Commandments?\u201d </em>(emphasis added) (This question also assumed a fact not in evidence.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b692-14\">. Pointing out that during Greenwood\u2019s direct examination he detailed many alleged academic achievements, the district attorney urges this opened the door to the type of cross-examination he pursued. We are not so persuaded. For example, whether Greenwood or his witnesses believed in the Ten Commandments was totally irrelevant and served no useful purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
