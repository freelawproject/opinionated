Because the state court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law, the district court properly denied relief and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">In 2000, the state of Florida filed a petition in state court to classify Walker a sexually violent predator under state law and have him committed to state custody. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 394.910. Over Walker\u2019s objections, the trial court admitted witness testimony that constituted hearsay evidence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which Walker argued violated his right to cross-examine and confront his accusers under the Fourteenth Amendment and <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury found Walker to be a sexually violent predator, and the court committed Walker to the custody of the Department of Children and Family Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">The state court of appeals affirmed the state court\u2019s civil commitment order. Walker\u2019s subsequent petition for <em>cert, </em>was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court. Walker then filed the instant \u00a7 2254 petition, arguing that he was denied his Fourteenth Amendment right to cross-examine and confront the witnesses against him at his civil commitment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">The district court denied the petition, finding that <em>Crawford </em>did not apply to civil proceedings, and no other clearly established federal law required cross-examination at civil proceedings. The district court, therefore, deferred to the state court decision. At Walker\u2019s request, the district court granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue: \u2018Whether this Court erred in deferring to the state court\u2019s adjudication of Petitioner\u2019s claim concerning whether the admission of hearsay evidence at his civil commitment proceedings violated his right to confrontation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision about whether the state court\u2019s decision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law. <em>Williams v. Allen, </em>598 F.3d 778, 788 (11th Cir.2010). Section 2254(d), as amended by the Antiterrorism <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The phrase \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d refers to \u201cthe governing legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its decision.\u201d <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 71-72, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">\u201cThe \u2018contrary to\u2019 and \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 clauses of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) are separate bases for reviewing a state court\u2019s decisions.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1241 (11th Cir.2001). A state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law if (1) the court applied a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by U.S. Supreme Court ease law, or (2) the court confronts facts that are \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d from relevant U.S. Supreme Court precedent, but arrives at an opposite result. <em>Id. </em>An \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law occurs when the state court correctly identifies a legal rule from U.S. Supreme Court precedent but unreasonably applies that rule to the facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>State courts are not obligated to widen or enlarge legal rules set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court to contexts in which it has never decided. <em>Hawkins v. Alabama, </em>318 F.3d 1302, 1307 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also Carey v. Musladin, </em>549 U.S. 70, 77, 127 S.Ct. 649, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (holding that, when the U.S. Supreme Court has not decided an issue, \u201cit cannot be said that the state court \u2018unreasonably] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">On appeal, Walker argues that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s right to confrontation in civil commitment proceedings is \u201cclearly established.\u201d He also contends that this right \u201cshould\u201d match that guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause and the principles set forth in <em>Crawford. </em>After review, we conclude that, even though Walker\u2019s right to confrontation may be clearly established, his right against the admission of testimonial hearsay in the civil commitment context is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">Florida law establishes a civil commitment procedure for the long-term care and treatment of sexually violent predators. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 394.910; <em>State v. Harris, </em>881 So.2d 1079, 1083 (Fla.2004). Individuals in civil commitment proceedings are entitled to certain due process protections guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, including the rights to confront and cross-examination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Specht v. Patterson, </em>386 U.S. 605, 610, 87 S.Ct. 1209, 18 L.Ed.2d 326 (1967). In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court held that a testimonial statement will only be admissible if the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine. 541 U.S. at 59, 124 S.Ct. 1354. But <em>Crawford </em>only applies in the context of Sixth Amendment criminal trial rights and has not been extended to other contexts. <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1146 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>In the context of a habeas case, it is not our role to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause should match that guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and <em>Crawford; </em>we are limited to determining whether the U.S. Supreme Court has \u201cclearly established\u201d that such a right exists. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Walker has not cited a single U.S. Supreme Court case requiring the Florida court to exclude testimonial hearsay evidence in a civil commitment hearing. <em>Carey, </em>549 U.S. at 77, 127 S.Ct. 649. Moreover, the state court was under no obligation to widen the scope of <em>Crawford </em>to a context not yet decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. <em>Hawkins, </em>318 F.3d at 1307 n. 3. Accordingly, the state court\u2019s decision, to the extent that it admitted testimonial hearsay at Walker\u2019s civil commitment proceeding, was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The district court correctly denied Walker\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-11\">. The evidence Walker sought to exclude included the testimony of mental health professions and police officers who based their testimony on various written reports and allegations of criminal conduct for which Walker had not been convicted. Although Walker was permitted to cross-examine these mental health professionals and police officers, he was not able to cross-examine the people who created the reports that formed the basis of the witnesses' testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-18\">. Walker acknowledges that <em>Crawford </em>applies only to criminal proceedings but urges that the rationale should apply to civil commitment cases as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\">. We note that Walker was able to cross-examine witnesses at his commitment hearing, but he was not able to cross-examine those people who created the reports about which the witnesses testified.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
