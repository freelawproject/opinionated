Pressley, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 141, 40 O.O. 2d 141, 228 N.E. 2d 631. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>A clear legal right exists where the commission abuses its discretion by entering an order which is not supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936. We must presently determine whether the commission abused its discretion in denying temporary total disability compensation from September 7, 1984 through May 24, 1985. Upon review, we find its order conforms with the some evidence rule, and thus deny the requested writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Eligibility for temporary total disability compensation is satisfied where an industrial injury results in a temporary condition that prevents a claimant from returning to his or her former position of employment. <em>State, ex rel. Ramirez, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 630, 23 O.O. 3d 518, 433 N.E. 2d 586. \u201cFormer position of employment\u201d has been defined as the position held at the time of injury. <em>State, ex rel. Horne, </em>v. <em>Great Lakes Constr. Co. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 79, 80, 18 OBR 117, 118, 480 N.E. 2d 753, 754. In the case at bar, the commission determined that the totality of the evidence before it did not establish a causal relationship between appellant\u2019s industrial injury and his alleged inability to return to his former position of employment at Kaiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">However, the commission ultimately denied appellant\u2019s compensation request for \u201clack of credible medical evidence.\u201d In the medical evidence initially before the hearing officer, which evidence was part of appellant\u2019s application to re-activate his claim, Dr. Levitas certified appellant to be temporarily totally disabled beginning September 7, 1984. On this very same form, in response to an inquiry as to whether he had drawn unemployment benefits since his injury, appellant replied in the affirmative and indicated that he had received unemployment benefits during the period from September 7,1984 through October 23, 1984. Under R.C. 4141.29(A) (4)(a), eligibility for unemployment benefits is premised, in part, on an applicant being \u201cable to work and available for suitable work and * * * actively seeking suitable work * * *.\u201d Moreover, an employee is not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits unless he is capable of being employed in his usual trade or occupation or any other employment for which he is reasonably fitted. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Bur. of Unemp. Comp. </em>(1948), 83 Ohio App. 247, 51 Ohio Law Abs. 449, 38 O.O. 356, 83 N.E. 2d 628, paragraph two of the syllabus. This unresolved contradiction concerning appellant\u2019s ability to work undermines the persuasiveness of Dr. Levitas\u2019s certification. Further, in light of this conflict, the commission was not obligated to accord full evidentiary weight to subsequent certifications submitted by appellant. Finally, although the record also contains Dr. Brito\u2019s January 1986 report, we question the extent to which Dr. Brito\u2019s ultimate disability conclusion may have been influenced by the erroneous presumption that appellant had not worked since the date of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Evaluation of the weight and credibility of the evidence before it rests exclusively with the commission. <em>Burley, supra. </em>In the present case, deficiencies in appellant\u2019s application to re-activate his claim and Dr. Brito\u2019s report constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s application for temporary total disability compensation was unsupported by credible medical evidence. Moreover, because we find the commission\u2019s decision to be supported by some evidence, we find it unnecessary to address the denial of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>pensation within the context of an \u201cabandonment\u201d theory as relied on by the appellate court. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b72-6\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
