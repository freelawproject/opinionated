Sigall, was suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year by this court\u2019s order dated November 7,1984. On October 2, 1985, this court issued an order granting relator\u2019s motion for finding of contempt and order continuing suspension for respondent\u2019s failure to return legal fees to clients, totalling in excess of $50,000, as required by this court\u2019s November 7, 1984 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">From February 1986 to October 1988, the Clients\u2019 Security Fund granted twenty-seven Clients\u2019 Security Fund claim awards, totalling $44,571, to former clients of respondent. On October 27,1988, in exchange for payment of $27,000 by respondent to the Clients\u2019 Security Fund, the Clients\u2019 Security Fund released respondent from the remaining $17,571 in claims. In accordance with the terms of the judgment entry filed pursuant to the mutual release entered into between respondent and the Clients\u2019 Security Fund, respondent made the initial payment of $10,000 and the first monthly payment of $250. On January 26, 1989, respondent filed the instant application for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">Notwithstanding respondent\u2019s agreement with the Clients\u2019 Security Fund, in accordance with the prior orders of this court, respondent shall not be considered for reinstatement to the practice of law in Ohio until such time as respondent has reimbursed the Clients\u2019 Security Fund for the total amount of awards paid by the Clients\u2019 Security Fund to former clients of respondent, and respondent has reapplied for reinstatement. Therefore, respondent\u2019s application for reinstatement is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b222-14\">Moyer, C.J., Holmes, Wright, H.
