Yates, </em>v. <em>Court of Appeals for Montgomery Cty. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 30, 33, 512 N.E. 2d 343, 346; <em>Bobb </em>v. <em>Marchant </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St. 3d 1, 3, 14 OBR 1, 2, 469 N.E. 2d 847, 849; <em>State, ex rel. Flower, </em>v. <em>Rocker </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St. 2d 160, 162, 6 O.O. 3d 375, 376, 370 N.E. 2d 479, 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Here, the county alleged that the SPBR was about to exercise unlawful quasi-judicial authority and that this would cause the county irreparable harm. However, because the SPBR may ultimately find that it has no jurisdiction, the county cannot show that it <em>will </em>be injured if a writ of prohibition is denied. Indeed, if the SPBR finds jurisdiction to be absent and dismisses the pertinent cases, the county would not want even to consider an appeal. In this sense, the county\u2019s complaint was \u201cpremature,\u201d and we find that the court of appeals properly dismissed it on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">Our conclusion makes it unnecessary to decide whether the county will have no adequate remedy at law if the SPBR decides the question of jurisdiction adversely to it. The county asks us to assume how the SPBR will resolve the issue. However, in <em>State, ex rel. B.F. Goodrich, </em>v. <em>Griffin </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St. 2d 59, 13 O.O. 3d 55, 391 N.E. 2d 1018, we refused to make a similar assumption prior to a common pleas court\u2019s ruling on facts relating to its jurisdiction. We find <em>Griffin </em>sufficient authority for us to refuse to make the assumption needed to reach the county\u2019s claim here.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">For these reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-13\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
