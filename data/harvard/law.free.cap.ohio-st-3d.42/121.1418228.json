During the audit year, R.C. 5733.051(A)(5) and (6) (now R.C. 5733.051[E] and [F]) provided that capital gains realized from the sale of shares of stock were to be allocated in the same manner as dividends. These code provisions stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">\"Net income of a corporation subject to the tax imposed by this chapter shall be allocated and apportioned to this state as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">\u2018 \u2018(5) Capital gains and losses from the sale or other disposition <em>of </em>intangible personal property which may produce income enumerated in subdivision (6) of this division shall be allocated on the same basis as set forth in such subdivision. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-13\">\u201c(6) Dividends, which are not otherwise deducted or excluded from net income, shall be apportioned to the state in accordance with the ratio which the book value of the physical assets of the payor thereof located in this state bear to the book value of the total physical assets of the payor thereof located everywhere. Dividends received from payors, the location of whose physical assets is not available to the taxpayer, shall be apportioned as provided in subdivision (8) of this division.\u201d (134 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1485, 1564-1565.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">Alcan apportioned the gain under then subdivision (8) (now R.C. 5733. 051[H]), which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-15\">\u201cAny other net income, from sources other than those enumerated in subdivisions (1) to (7), inclusive, of this division, shall be allocated to this state on the basis of the apportionment mechanism provided in division (B) of section 5733.05 of the Revised Code [the three-factor formula].\u201d (134 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1565.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">The commissioner argues that the BTA misstated the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>term \u201cavailable\u201d and that it also imposed on her the burden of establishing that the assessment was correct. She asserts that \u201cavailable\u201d means \u201cobtainable\u201d and that Alcan has the burden to prove that her assessment is incorrect. Alcan responds that it did not have actual knowledge of the location of the physical assets of Kohler and that the evidence discloses that Alcan could not have obtained the information. Thus, according to Alcan, the commissioner should have used her subpoena powers to learn the location of Kohler\u2019s physical assets. Since we agree with the commissioner, we reverse the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">As the BTA recognized, R.C. 5733.051 is not ambiguous. Capital gains are to be apportioned to the state according to the ratio of the book value of the physical assets of the payor located within Ohio and located everywhere. If the location of the physical assets of the payor is not available to the taxpayer, the gains must be allocated under the three-factor apportionment formula. The meaning of the word \u201cavailable\u201d is, therefore, pivotal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Under R.C. 1.42, \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d In <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp. </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 137, 12 O.O. 3d 158, 389 N.E. 2d 473, the taxpayer received dividends from a domestic international sales corporation (\u201cDISC\u201d) that had no physical assets. The taxpayer in that case would have received favorable tax treatment if the dividend income were apportioned under R.C. 5733.051(A)(6) and not allocated under the three-factor formula. It claimed that the DISC had physical assets outside Ohio because it had \u201cconstructive ownership\u201d of the property. This court disagreed. We held that the DISC lacked physical assets and, because it \u201chad no capitalized assets with an ascertainable book value,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 145, 12 O.O. 3d at 162, 389 N.E. 2d at 477, it was required to allocate income under the three-factor formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Thus, we have interpreted \u201cavailable\u201d to mean \u201cascertainable.\u201d Dictionary definitions lend support to this interpretation. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed. 1979) 123; Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 150. Therefore, the contextual meaning of \u201cavailable\u201d is that the shareholder must be able to ascertain or learn of the location of the physical assets of the payor. The BTA erred when it found that Alcan had to have actual knowledge of the location.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Furthermore, a fifty-percent shareholder such as Alcan would be expected to be able to learn of the location of the physical assets at least until the date of sale. Under R.C. 1701.37 (C), any shareholder has the right to examine the corporation\u2019s books and records of account. Alcan, therefore, could have learned of the location of Kohler\u2019s physical assets had it asserted its right to do so. The commissioner validly argues that Kohler\u2019s physical assets should have been \u201cavailable\u201d to Alcan.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">The commissioner is also correct that the BTA erred when it reversed the assessment because there was no acceptable evidence supporting the conclusion that the location of Kohler\u2019s physical assets was available to Alcan. Absent a demonstration that the commissioner\u2019s findings are clearly unreasonable or unlawful, they are presumptively valid. Furthermore, it is error for the BTA to reverse the commissioner\u2019s determination when no competent and probative evidence is presented to show that the commissioner\u2019s determination is factually incorrect. <em>Hatchadorian </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St. 3d 66, 21 OBR 365, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>488 N.E. 2d 145, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Information regarding the location of Kohler\u2019s physical assets would normally be available to Alcan, and the commissioner had information that all the property was located in Ohio approximately two months prior to the sale date. Her finding is presumptively valid, and the BTA may not reverse it if there was no evidence presented to show that the commissioner\u2019s order was factually incorrect. Moreover, there is no evidence that Alcan even sought this information. Alcan had the burden to demonstrate that the commissioner\u2019s findings were incorrect. It did not sustain this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Accordingly, the decision of the BTA is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\n<em>Decision reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b162-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
