Kilbane from ruling upon affiant\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief arising from his 1976 conviction. The affidavit in essence alleges that certain actions by Judge Kilbane deprived affiant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">A judge is presumed to follow applicable law in all respects. <em>In re Disqualification of Grigsby </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St. 3d 607, 522 N.E. 2d 461. Alleged errors of law or procedure are legal issues subject to appeal and are not grounds for the disqualification of a judge. <em>In re Disqualification of Light </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St. 3d 604, 522 N.E. 2d 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">In the absence of evidence of bias, prejudice, or other factors, a judge who presided at trial is not automatically disqualified from hearing a petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate or set aside his sentence. <em>Walters </em>v. <em>United States </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1975), 404 F. Supp. 996, affirmed (C.A. 2, 1976), 542 F. 2d 1166; <em>Schoonover </em>v. <em>State </em>(1978), 2 Kan. App. 2d 481, 483, 582 P. 2d 292, 295. I find no evidence of such bias, prejudice, or other disqualifying factors in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well-taken and is hereby dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
