John L. Creveling\u2019s application was filed November 22, 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">John W. Jepson\u2019s application of January 9, 1911, is a division of an application filed October 14, 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">Jepson\u2019s preliminary statement alleged conception in April, 1908, and a disclosure to others at the same time; that he con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>structed a full-sized apparatus in October, 1909, and reduced it to practice in November, 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Creveling alleged conception and disclosure to others in the year 1900; the making of sketches in the same year; that he never made a model of the invention, and that it was first embodied in a full-sized working machine which was completed during the year 1901, and was successfully operated during the year 1901.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The tribunals of the Patent Office all agreed in awarding priority to Jepson, and Creveling has appealed from the final decree of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The Examiner of Interferences found that Jepson\u2019s evidence tended to show conception as early as May 2, 1908, and that Creveling was confined to his date of filing application for both conception and constructive reduction to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">He denied Jepson\u2019s reduction to practice as claimed, but held that he had shown sufficient diligence since before Creveling\u2019s entry in the field to entitled him to the award of priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">The Examiners in Chief found that Jepson first conceived the invention in 1908. They agreed with the Examiner of Interferences that Jepson\u2019s proof of reduction to practice was not sufficient, but agreed with the latter that he was using due diligence when Creveling entered the field, and thereafter affirmed the award of priority to Jepson.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">The Commissioner on appeal agreed with the Examiners in Chief, awarding priority to Jepson. He held that Jepson\u2019s trial of his apparatus about November 1, 1909, was a reduction to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">In the view that we take of the case it is immaterial to examine the evidence of Creveling\u2019s conception as alleged by him, and its disclosure to Hallock, and we shall confine ourselves to Jepson\u2019s evidence of reduction to practice, for this, preceding Creveling\u2019s filing date, and would relieve him from the burden of proving diligence and entitle him to the award of priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">The evidence of competent witnesses shows that the apparatus of Jepson constructed by him in working form was tried in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>test room of the Gould Coupler Company on or before the 1st of November, 1909, which was prior to Creveling\u2019s filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The evidence referred to above shows that the whole apparatus constituting the system consisted of a generator, lamp circuit, battery circuit, and generator regulator, connected up in their respective relations. The apparatus was given complete test by varying the speed of the generator, varying the lamp loads, with and without battery, and was also given a long run to charge the battery up to its full state so that the apparatus would function by the potential coil usurping the control and causing the series coil to release its plunger and become inactive. In fact it was given every test that could be given a piece of car-lighting apparatus. There had been controversies at times with respect to vibrations, but this was proved to have no effect as apparatus for building them with dash pots that took care of all these conditions, and these principles are substituted in this apparatus for securing the same results with regard to vibration. The test was satisfactory in every respect, the apparatus performing every function for which it was designed. There was some question made as to the sufficiency of this test respecting a car-lighting apparatus on the account of the lack of an automatic pole changer, which became necessary only in case the generator should be reversed when needed by a revei\u2019se operation of the car. The Commissioner, taking the view that this test was sufficient, stated: \u201cAs to the lack of an automatic pole changer, it is not necessary, in order to test a current and voltage regulator, that the generator be reversed, although conditions in practice may arise where a reversal will occur often enough to make this important.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u201cIf the issue' was limited to a car-lighting system, the situation might be different, but the issues are not so limited, and the mere fact that Jepson designed his device for use in the severe service of car lighting does not seem to me to warrant raising the standard of the test required beyond what the issues would indicate.\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Wo agree with the conclusion of the Commissioner. The thing reduced to practice was the invention of the issue; none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>of the counts referred to a car-lighting system. It is true that the invention may be chiefly useful in an axle-driven system, but the invention is designed for other systems as well. The, generator may be driven from any suitable source of power, and is useful in any system where a storage battery is charged from a generator, the speed of which is not constant.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">As before intimated, this conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider the evidence relating to Creveling\u2019s conception and to the want of diligence in Jepson.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed, and the clerk will report this decision to the Commissioner of Patents as required by law. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
