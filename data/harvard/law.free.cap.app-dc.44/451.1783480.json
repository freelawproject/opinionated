Each tribunal held the claims unpatentable over certain references. The appealed claim was submitted to the Commissioner and rejected upon the same references.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">We have examined the references in the light of the present substituted claim, and fully concur in the conclusion reached by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed, and the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by law required. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
