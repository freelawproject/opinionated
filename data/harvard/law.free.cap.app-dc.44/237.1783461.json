Morgan, appellee here, in the Supreme Court of the District for $1,000 damages in an action for an assault of the plaintiff by a motorman of the defendant, Capital Traction Company, while plaintiff was a passenger on one of defendant\u2019s cars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-11\">The first count of the declaration is in trespass on the case. In it plaintiff alleges that he boarded one of defendant\u2019s cars at the Aqueduct Bridge for the purpose of riding to the corner of Seventeenth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N. W., obtained a seat, and paid his fare; that it was \u201cthe duty of the defendant to use due and proper care to protect the plaintiff whilst he was a passenger on its said car against all injury, violence, insult, and ill treatment at the hands of its servants, agents, or employees;\u201d that, in disregard of this duty, \u201cthe motorman operating the said car of the said defendant violently, wantonly, and maliciously, and with force and arms, and in the presence of a large number of passengers, assaulted the plaintiff, the plaintiff being then, as aforesaid, a passenger on said car, and the said motorman being an agent, servant, or employee of the said defendant, and said motorman did then and there seize the plaintiff by the neck and arm, and drag the plaintiff violently to the front platform of the car, whereby, and by reason of which, the plaintiff\u2019s clothing was soiled, torn, and damaged, his body bruised and injured, and he was publicly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>exposed to humiliation, mortification, indignity, and disgrace in the eyes of the passengers with which said ear was crowded, and did then and there suffer, and since has suffered, great mental anguish by reason of the injury to his feelings caused thereby.\u201d In the second count the same facts are set forth, but the plaintiff there relies upon an implied promise of the defendant to carry him to his destination, and asks damages for the breach of that promise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\">To this declaration the defendant filed a plea of the general issue, and a special plea in confession and avoidance. In the latter plea the defendant admitted that plaintiff had become a passenger, as alleged in the declaration, and that the motor.man had laid hands upon him and removed him from a position in the narrow part of the aisle of the car which he had assumed, and where he \u201cwas blockading the passage of other passengers forward,\u201d the motorman using no more force than was necessary. Issue was joined upon this plea, and a trial followed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence was in substance as follows: After surrendering his seat to a lady he moved forward and grasped the brass handle on the first cross seat near the front, on the left-hand side of the car. In this type of car there is an open space in the front and rear, and a series of cross seats on either side of the middle portion of the car. The car kept filling up, .and people were in front of him (in the open space), hanging on the straps, and behind him, hanging on the brass handles on the ends of the seats. There was plently of room for people to pass him, as he was very close to the seat. The motorman called \u201cUp front\u201d several times, but plaintiff paid no attention to the call. Finally, the motorman \u201cjumped back and grabbed plaintiff around the neck with his left hand; plaintiff had a collar on, which the motorman greased up with his gloves; the motorman grabbed plaintiff with his right hand around both of plaintiff\u2019s hands, and put his left hand around plaintiff\u2019s neck, and dragged him to the front, and said \u2018You will stand there, won\u2019t you.\u2019 \u201d Nine witnesses, all of whom were passengers on the car at the time in question, gave evidence fending to prove that plaintiff was not blocking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>aisle. The evidence of these witnesses as to the assault was in substantial accord with that of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">The conductor and motorman of the car, testifying for the defendant, stated that the back part of the car was very crowded, but \u201cthere were not very many people up front;\u201d that the plaintiff was asked to move out of the aisle to let people pass through; that upon his refusal to move, the motorman forcibly broke his hold of the car seat, \u201cand pushed him up to the front of the car, and left him standing there in the front of the car. * * * That thereupon plaintiff immediately wont back and took the same position he had formerly occupied in the aisle;\u201d that while plaintiff was standing in this position in the center of the aisle, \u201cno one could pass him unless they pushed past him;\u201d that conductors and motormen \u201chad verbal instructions from the company to keep the aisles clear as far as possible, so passengers could pass through the car.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-7\">At the request of the plaintiff the court instructed the jury that if they believed from the evidence that the position the plaintiff occupied in the car \u201cdid not block the aisle of the same, or obstruct other passengers from freely passing the plaintiff, that then the defendant company had no right to direct or require the plaintiff to move from the place he occupied to another place in said car.\u201d To this the defendant objected upon the ground, among others, that the defendant, \u25a0whenever it might be necessary to relieve or mitigate the crowded condition of a car, could require a passenger to move forward, \u201cso as to distribute the crowd in the car.\u201d The court further instructed the jury, over the objection and exception of the defendant, that if they found that the plaintiff was not committing a breach of the peace or obstructing the aisle of the car, and the motorman took hold of him and pulled or dragged him through a portion of the car, they should find for the plaintiff. Further objection was made to an instruction which authorized the jury, in fixing the amount of the damages in case they found for the plaintiff, \u201cto consider the injured feelings of the plaintiff, the indignity endured, the humiliation, wounded pride, mental suffering, and the like, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>allow suoli sum as the jury may think proper,\u201d not exceeding the amount named in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-4\">The court further instructed the jury that the employees of the defendant had a right to require plaintiff to move forward in the ear in order to make room for other passengers, and to relieve the crowded condition of the aisles, provided the jury should find that it was necessary to do this to accomplish the result sought, and that if they should find that the plaintiff declined and refused to obey the request or demand that he move forward, if necessary as above stated, the motorman was justified in using such force as was necessary, and the verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-5\"><em>Mr. G.

It is the contention of the defendant that the special plea and the joinder of issue thereon raised the single question of justification. The plea alleged that when the motorman laid hands upon and removed the plaintiff, plaintiff was \u201cblockading the passage of other passengers forward,\u201d and such must have been the finding of the jury to sustain the plea. The evidence of the plaintiff tended to show not only that he was not \u201cblockading the passage of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>passengers forward,\u201d but that there was plenty of room for them to pass him. Under his contention and evidence the plea of justification was ill founded. If the jury should accept his view, as they subsequently did, it of course would be necessary that the facts surrounding the assault should be known, that the damages might be measured. The plaintiff, by joining issue on this special plea, merely conceded that if the jury should find the facts as therein alleged, that is, if the jury should find that the plaintiff was blocking the aisle, the motonnan was justified in removing him, and that the motonnan used no more than the necessary amount of force. But if the special plea was ill founded, the motorman\u2019s act constituted an assault, as plaintiff contended, and under the pleadings the court clearly was right in permitting the plaintiff to prove the facts surrounding the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">During plaintiff\u2019s testimony he stated that immediately after his release by the motorman he assumed the position from which he had been removed. Ilis counsel thereupon moved the court to strike out this statement, which motion was granted, over the objection and exception of the defendant. We quite agree with the learned trial justice that \u201cif he (plaintiff) had a right there originally, it would not malee any difference whether he went back or not.\u201d Moreover, defendant\u2019s witnesses, without objection, testified to the same fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We come now to the main question in the case, that is, whether the court\u2019s charge, to which reference has been made, correctly stated the law. While the duty of common carriers of passengers may not be abridged by rules and regulations, there is no doubt as to the power of such a carrier to make and enforce reasonable rules and regulations having for their object the safety and comfort of the traveling public. The rights of a single passenger are not greater nor less than those of every other passenger. Thus the carrier has a right to make and enforce a rule confining a passenger to one seat. <em>Chesapeake &amp; O. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Spiller, </em>151 Ky. 222, 50 L.R.A.(N.S.) 394, 162 S. W. 815, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 186. The passenger contracts for one seat, and has no right to more. So, too, must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>he conform to reasonable regulations as to his conduct in the waiting room of the carrier. <em>Central of Georgia R. Co. </em>v. <em>Motes, </em>117 Ga. 923, 62 L.R.A. 507, 97 Am. St. Rep. 223, 43 S. E. 990, 14 Am. Neg. Rep. 13. But in the present case no regulation of the carrier is involved, for the only evidence upon this point is evidence tending to show that \u201cconductors and motormen had verbal instructions from the company to keep the aisles clear as far as possible, so passengers could pass through the car.\u201d It therefore was contemplated that if more passengers were taken on than could find- seats, they would be permitted to occupy the aisle of the car, unless in so doing they prevented passerigers from passing through it. The charge of the court upon this point was in harmony with the instructions of the defendant to its employees. The defendant, having taken on more passengers than it could seat, a by no means uncommon occurrence, had no right to move those passengers about as pawns upon a chess board. In other words, the plaintiff had a right to assume a position in the aisle, and remain there, unless by so doing he prevented other passengers from passing there-through. The interior of the car was common to all passengers, and so long as plaintiff demeaned himself properly and respected the rights of the other passengers, he was not subject to the whims or arbitrary notions of defendant\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The next and last assignment of error relates to the question of damages. It first is insisted that there was no proof of damage, and hence that nominal damages only should have been allowed. It is seriously contended by appellant that it does not appear that the plaintiff suffered any injured feelings, nor that he endured any indignity, humiliation, or wounded pride. One person may be more sensitive than another, or, stated otherwise, one person may be more callous than another to public gaze under embarrassing conditions, but we think the rule of law is that where the circumstances-of such an assault as is here shown to have taken place are before the jury, the jury may infer that the average person would suffer from the indignity and humiliation. Indeed, to the average person those elements of hurt would be more distressing and lasting than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>comparatively insignificant physical hurt. <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Heywood, </em>7 Allen, 118; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hannibal &amp; St. J. R. Co. </em>99 Mo. 319, 12 S. W. 655; <em>Western U. Teleg. Co. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>75 Tex. 531, 6 L.R.A. 844, 16 Am. St. Rep. 920, 12 S. W. 857; <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>Milwaukee Street R. Co. </em>88 Wis. 56, 59 N. W. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">But, it is insisted, mental suffering unaccompanied by physical injury may not form the basis of damages. The overwhelming weight of authority is to the contrary. <em>Lake Shore &amp; M. S. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Prentice, </em>147 U. S. 101 37 L. ed. 97, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Blodgett, </em>44 Vt. 476; <em>Head </em>v. <em>Georgia P. R. Co. </em>79 Ga. 358, 11 Am. St. Rep. 434, 7 S. E. 217, 8 Am. Neg. Cas. 135; <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co. </em>77 Iowa, 54, 41 N. W. 564; <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Brooklyn Heights R. Co. </em>178 N. Y. 347, 66 L.R.A. 618, 102 Am. St. Rep. 503, 70 N. E. 857, 16 Am. Neg. Rep. 181; <em>Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Hine, </em>121 Ala. 234, 25 So. 857; <em>Pennsylvania R. Co. </em>v. <em>Connell, </em>127 Ill. 419, 20 N. E. 89; <em>Pennsylvania Co. </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>125 Ind. 229, 25 N. E. 439. Here, however, there was an actual physical assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The further contention is made, under this assignment of error, that the charge of the court upon the question of damages was so vague as to permit the jury to find punitive damages. There is no justification for this contention in the record. Punitive damages were neither claimed by the plaintiff nor permitted to be found by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
