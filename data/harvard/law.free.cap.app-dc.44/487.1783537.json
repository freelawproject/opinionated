Defendant furnished the apartments, and sublet them. Instalments of rent being in arrears, plaintiff sued defendant in the municipal court of the District, and recovered a judgment. Execution issued, a levy was made upon the furniture in the apartments, which was appraised at $255.25. Defendant claimed exemption under section 1105 of the D. C. Code, which provides, among other things, as follows: \u201cThe following property, being the property of the head of a family or householder residing in the District of Columbia, shall be exempt from distraint, attachment, levy, and sale on execution or decree of any court in the District: * * * All beds, bedding, household furniture, stoves, cooking utensils, and so forth, not exceeding three hundred dollars in value.\u201d [31 Stat. at L. 1362, chap. 854.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-9\">On trial, the municipal court found defendant not entitled to the exemptions.

It is clearly established that defendant rented the apartments unfurnished at the rate of $45 per month each, furnished them, and sublet them at the rate of $65 per month each, and that he, with his family, resided at 1431 Rhode Island avenue, northwest, this city. The question is, therefore, squarely piresented, whether furniture not used by a debtor or his family for their own household purposes, but for commercial purposes, is exempt from execution, to the amount of $300, under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Exemption statutes of this sort have for their object the protection of the family of the householder. The term \u201chousehold furniture\u201d has been generally held to refer to furniture in use in the household or place of residence of the debtor, and not furniture used for commercial purposes or as a source of profit. We think the statute clearly implies such interpretation. For example,, it would hardly be contended that a furniture dealer, -entitled to an exemption as a merchant of stock in trade to the value of $200 under 'the statute, would also be entitled to an additional exemptio'n from the same stock of $300. Nor that coal kept for sale by a coal dealer would be exempt as \u201cfuel for three months,\u201d or that groceries on sale in a store are exempt as \u201cprovisions for three months\u2019 support.\u201d In New Hampshire it was held that meat kept by a debtor for sale, and not to be consumed as provision for the support of his family, was not exempt from attachment as \u201cprovisions.\u201d <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>65 N. H. 165, 18 Atl. 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In <em>Weed </em>v. Dayton, 40 Conn. 293, under a statute substantially the same as ours, the court, considering its application to furniture belonging to a boarding-house keeper, said: \u201cThe statute secures to the debtor and his dependent family the personal use by him and them of such household furniture as is essential to their personal comfort. * * <em>* </em>Mere boarders are not such within the meaning of the statute. Furniture used by them for' a compensation, and useful to the debtor himself only as a means of profit, is not protected from attachment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">In <em>Heidenheimer Bros. v. Blumenkron, </em>56 Tex. 308, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>court, defining the term \u201call household and kitchen furniture\u201d as used in the Texas statute, said: \u201cThe exemption of \u2018all household and kitchen furniture\u2019 would not include any other than furniture for the family, such as might be on hand and used by it. Household and kitchen furniture used in hotels and restaurants, beyond that which is used by the family, is not included in the exemption.\u201d This holding was approved in <em>Mueller </em>v. Richardson, 82 Tex. 361, 18 S. W. 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Not only was this furniture not exempt under the statute, but it appears that defendant at this time was living with his family in a furnished house. The \u201chousehold furniture\u201d to which the statute refers was contained in the house occupied by the debtor and his family as a residence. The furniture in question was not kept for the use of the family, but to enable defendant to sublet the apartments at a profit. Such a use does not come within the limitations of the statute. \u201cIt nowhere appears that the property in question was \u2018kept and used by the debtor and his family\u2019 or \u2018kept for\u2019 their use. For aught that appears, the property in question may be a part of the stock of a furniture store, or of a second-hand store, or of a hotel or furnished flats in which his family do not reside.\u201d <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>62 Minn. 471, 64 N. W. 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The judgment is reversed, with costs, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
