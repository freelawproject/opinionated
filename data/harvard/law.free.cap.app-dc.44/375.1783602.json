Oliver Probey whereby it agreed to sell f. o. b. at Kalamazoo, Michigan, a number of automobiles for distribution in the District of Columbia and other adjacent territory. The contract provided, among other things, that each automobile shall be sold to the dealer at a discount of 20 per cent from the list price of the manufacturer, and the dealer agrees to pay the manufacturer list price as published in the current year for all parts purchased less a discount of 20 per cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-9\">The dealer .shall report at the end.of each week all names and addresses of parties purchasing cars from the dealer during that week, etc.; agrees to furnish the manufacturer with a copy of any and all contracts made with a dealer or any stipulations; all parts and accessories ordered by the dealer are delivered f. o. b. at their net price; shipments to be made with bill of lading attached to sight draft, or cash on delivery; a number of other provisions are made among which the only important ones are the following: .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-10\">It is stipulated and agreed between the dealer and the manufacturer that the title to any property mentioned herein, or in any subsequent order, shall not pass to the dealer, but shall remain in the Michigan Motor Company until the purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>price of the same and all notes and acceptances given for the same shall be paid in cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\">It is further stipulated that if the manufacturer shall, at the request of the dealer, ship or deliver any of the property purchased as above to any firm, company, or person, the title thereto shall remain in the Michigan Buggy Company until the same is fully paid for in cash, and such delivery shall not be deemed as a waiver of that right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">On the same day a supplemental contract was entered into explanatory of the foregoing. It is provided in this that this is a sales contract, not a purchase contract; and that T. O. Probey is not agreeing to purchase any goods to be shipped under this contract, but is to distribute them and sell them at wholesale and retail within the territory within the time herein allotted; that he has this day delivered to the Michigan Buggy Company, pursuant to this allotment, orders and approximate monthly shipping instructions for different models herein allotted, said shipments to be made in the months specified, the party of the second part agreeing to receive or sell direct to others, display, demonstrate, store in first-class order and maintain as new, automobiles such as are shipped to him, \u2014 pay freights and insure in full in the name of the Michigan Motor Car Company for its use and benefit \u2014 to pay the expenses of his sales, salary, and expenses of salesmen and demonstrators,\u2014 a reasonable stock of automobiles to be carried by T.

O. Probey, at Washington and other places within the territory covered by said contract, a large number of automobiles, accessories, parts, and equipments to be by said Probey handled, sold, and accounted for, in accordance with the terms and conditions of said contracts; and said shipments took place and continued at various times from the execution of said contracts up to, to wit, June 21, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-7\">That for a period of a year or more after the date of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>execution of said contracts, the provisions thereof relating to the giving of notes for the purchase price of automobiles had been entirely disregarded by said Probey and said Michigan Buggy Company, and said Probey had frequently, and from time to time, given his promissory notes to said Michigan Buggy Company, in such numbers and in such amounts as were requested by said Michigan Buggy Company, without any reference to or connection with the delivery of automobiles to said Probey by said Michigan Buggy Company; the total of said notes so issued by said Probey and delivered to said Michigan Buggy Company up to the date of the execution and delivery of said contracts, as hereinbefore set forth, aggregated a total amount of not less than $46,740.34, and it had long been the practice between said Probey and said company for said Probey to execute and deliver his promissory notes to said company whenever requested by it so to do, which said notes were used by said company in its business, and which said custom and practice continued between the parties both before and after the execution of said contracts hereinbefore referred to, and said notes were so given without any reference to any particular automobile or to any particular use to which the same were to be applied, and none of said notes were returned to said Probey when and after the same were paid. That at the time of making the said contracts there had been issued and were then outstanding in the possession of said Michigan Buggy Company and the various banks with whom the same had been discounted by it, notes so given to said company to the amount of $40,-114.54. That from and after about January, 1913, said Probey executed and delivered to said company his non-negotiable notes drawn upon a form, all of which said notes so given were to the said company without reference to any particular automobiles, or the purchase price thereof, and were not intended to be, and were not, in any way connected with any automobiles, accessories, parts, or equipment delivered to said Probey by the said company, but were given at the request of said company for its accommodation, whenever and in such amounts as it might request from time to time, some of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>said notes so given were subsequently and at various times discounted by said company with various banks and trust companies (all of which are made defendants to the bill) ; and in carrying out said custom and practice, so followed by said Probey and said company, it was the intention between said parties that no one of the notes so given by said Probey to said Michigan Buggy Company should represent any particular automobile, etc., and the said notes were given without any intention of connecting the same up in anyway with any automobiles; and the owners and holders of said notes have no right or interest in the twenty-six automobiles hereinafter mentioned and described, or any thereof, or the proceeds thereof. All of said notes so executed and delivered by said Probey to the company were to be held as deposits on automobiles, carriages, etc., contracted for by said defendant Probey; it being the understanding and so provided that upon full payment of the purchase price of said automobiles, carriages, etc., said notes would be returned to said defendant Probey; it being understood and agreed, however, that at all times the title to all automobiles, etc., which should be shipped' or consigned to said defendant should remain in said company until said automobiles or the proceeds thereof should be fully accounted for to said company; and the said notes given in the amount herein set forth were rhade payable to the said company, and were not payable to its order, and were not negotiable instruments or intended so to be. Thereafter, the said company discounted a large number of said notes with various banks, and said notes are now held and owned by the various banks, made defendants to this proceeding. The amount of said notes being so sold is correctly set forth in the exhibit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-5\">That under said contract the said Michigan Buggy &amp; Motor Car Company shipped and delivered to said defendant Probey, from time to time, to wit, June 27, 1913, a large number of automobiles, accessories, parts, etc., for which payment had not been made on or before said June 27, 1913, and on, to wit, the said June 27, 1913, said Probey had in his possession \u2022 and under his control twenty-six of said automobiles manufactured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>by said company, and consigned and delivered to him under tho terms, provisions, and conditions of his contract aforesaid, whereby it is agreed that the title to said automobiles should not pass to and vest in the said Probey, or any other person, until he had fully accounted for said automobiles or the proceeds thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\">On or about the 27th day of June, 1913, the said Michigan Buggy Company, for value received, sold, assigned, and transferred to the Pennsylvania Sales Corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, all the right, title, and interest of the said Michigan Buggy Company in and to all the automobiles and automobile parts made by said Michigan Buggy Company, which had been shipped and consigned by said company to the said T. Oliver Probey under the terms and provisions of the contracts hereinbefore mentioned, and not paid for by him, including the twenty-six automobiles herein more specifically mentioned and described, which said automobiles and automobile parts were thereupon invoiced and charged to said Pennsylvania Sales Corporation by said Michigan Buggy Company, and were thereafter paid for to said Michigan Buggy Company by said Pennsylvania Sales Corporation, of which said sale, assignment, transfer, etc., defendant Probey, who was then in possession and control of said automobiles under the contracts as aforesaid, had due and proper notice, and duly consented and agreed thereto; and the said Probey then and there further agreed with the said Pennsylvania Sales Corporation that, if he should be allowed said automobiles for sale under consignment from said Pennsylvania Sales Corporation, he would make prompt and accurate return and an accounting to said Pennsylvania Sales Corporation for said automobiles, or the proceeds thereof, and would hold the automobiles, and the proceeds realized from the sale or sales thereof, in trust for, and remit and pay the same promptly to, the said Pennsylvania Sales Corporation, its successors, and assigns, which said agreement was intended to and did include the proceeds from those sales which had already been made by said Probey, as well as those sales which might <em>thereafter .he </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>effected. Relying upon said promise, understanding, and agreement, the said Pennsylvania Sales Corporation subsequently re-invoiced the said automobiles and parts, so purchased by it from said Michigan Buggy Company, to the said Probey, to be sold by him for and on account of said Pennsylvania Sales Corporation, its successors, and assigns, and the said Probey accepted and received the same under said promise and agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">That by reason of the said sale, assignment, transfer, etc., the said Michigan Buggy Company relinquished all its rights and claims in and to said twenty-six automobiles, or the proceeds thereof, and against the said Probey by virtue of any liability on his part arising out of said contracts, notes, and all other obligations of every character of said Probey to said Michigan Buggy Company existing at that date, and at the same time both said Michigan Buggy Company and said Probey relinquished, each to the other respectively, all claims, rights, and liabilities of each to the other respectively, arising under said contracts, notes, and automobiles or of any other kind or character whatsoever; and thereupon said Pennsylvania Sales Corporation was substituted as the owner of all the rights, title, interest, claim, and demand 'of every kind and character whatsoever of said Michigan Buggy Company in said automobiles, and the proceeds thereof, and said Probey thereupon relinquished to the said Buggy Company all the claims of every kind or character which he had against said buggy company, and said buggy company likewise relinquished all its claims against said Probey, and transferred the same to said Pennsylvania Sales Corporation, which was substituted for said Michigan Buggy Company as the owner of all rights thereof; which said transaction constituted an adjustment, compromise, and settlement in full of all rights and liabilities of every kind and character then existing between said Michigan Buggy Company and said Probey; and that the new contracts or agreements betwen said buggy company and said sales corporation, and between the sales corporation and the said Probey, as hereinbefore set forth, were both subsequently acknowledged, acquiesced in, adopted, and the same operated under by all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>parties thereto. And the said T.

Oliver Probey, what automobiles have been sold by the said Probey, what cash he has in his possession or control belonging to the complainant, what automobiles and parts still remain in the possession, custody, or control of the said Probey; that all of the facts and information concerning these several matters are in the exclusive custody, possession, knowledge, and control of the defendant Probey, and that without a discovery and disclosure of these matters the complainant is wdthout any means of proving its case or establishing the facts upon which it relies for proving its rights against the said defendant; that complainant, without such discovery, has no other source of information available, and is advised, and therefore avers, that by reason of the confidential and fiduciary relations existing between complainant and the said Probey, as well as by reason of the duty and obligation of the said Probey to fully account to complainant, said Probey is obligated and should be required to make a full and complete disclosure and discovery to complainant of all facts and matters within his knowledge arising out of, or connected with, the matters and transactions hereinabove set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-5\">That he has neglected and still fails and refuses, although frequent demand has been made, to make disclosure and discovery of the facts so within his exclusive knowledge and control as aforesaid, and complainant is without means of enforcing discovery except in this court; and the said Probey has refused and still does refuse to make an accounting or settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>for said automobiles, or any parts thereof, or the proceeds for the same, and no accounting has been made, or payment of any of proceeds of any sale of said automobiles or any parts thereof has ever been made by defendant Probey, to your complainant or to any other person for said automobiles, although he has often been requested so to do, and complainant has been unable to ascertain or discover what disposition has been made by said Probey of said automobiles, or the said proceeds thereof; that a large part of the facts and evidence relating to the matters aforesaid are in the exclusive custody, possession, and control of said Probey, and that complainant has no other source of information available for establishing same, except upon disclosure and discovery by the said Probey of the facts and evidence so held by the said Probey and in his exclusive knowledge and control; and complainant has, therefore, need of discovery of these facts, and is without adequate remedy unless such discovery and disclosure be made by defendant. And it .is further specifically averred that defendant has used funds and moneys coming into his hands belonging to complainant for his own uses and purposes, and for and in the purchase of other property, stocks, bonds, and other securities, some of which were taken and held by the said Probey in the names of other persons, the exact nature, kind, and amount of said property, stocks, bonds, and securities, and the names in which the same have been taken are now being held, being unknown <em>to </em>your complainant; that the said Probey has concealed said property, and complainant has been unable to find or obtain possession of the same; that these things have been done for the purpose of cheating and defrauding your complainant out of its rights in the premises and out of the proceeds of said automobiles. The said defendant is entirely insolvent and financially irresponsible; and unless your complainant is granted the relief herein prayed for, said Probey will convert the said automobiles and proceeds thereof to his own use with the intent to cheat and defraud said complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\">The motion to dismiss on the ground that the amended bill shows no. equity in .favor of the plaintiff, and second that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>.plaintiff has plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law, was sustained and the bill finally dismissed with costs, and therefrom the Edward F.

The title to the automobiles remained in the Michigan Buggy Company, and passed into the possession of Probey as its agent. By subsequent assignments the property passed into the hands of succeeding assignees with each of whom, including the plaintiff, Probey agreed to hold the said automobiles as the property of the assignees, and to account therefor under the terms of his agency. He made himself the agent of each assignee in succession, including the plaintiff. When the automobiles were demanded he refused to deliver and also to make any account of his agency. His relation was fiduciary. He was intrusted with the automobiles for sale, and it was his duty to account for the net proceeds thereof immediately upon the sales. Instead of doing this, as alleged, he secreted or disposed of the automobiles, and the place of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>deposit or keep is unknown to complainant and only within the knowledge of the defendant, who is now insolvent. It was his duty to turn over the automobiles on demand, or such of them as were left, to the complainant, and to pay over the net proceeds of such as may have been sold under his agency. Under the allegations of the bill it is impossible for the complainant to ascertain where the said automobiles are, or what has become of them, or how many of them have been sold, and what amount of proceeds said Probey has in his hands received from his \u2022agency sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">It seems to us that without discovery complainant will be practically remediless. He has a right not only to know where his property is situated, so that he may take possession of it, but also to know what amount of money has been realized by his agent from the sale of any automobile, and to have him account for and pay over the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The question of equity jurisdiction for discovery and relief is quite fully discussed in <em>George </em>v. Ford, 36 App. D. C. 315\u2014329, which need not here, be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">We are of opinion that the motion to dismiss should have been overruled, and that complainant is entitled to a complete discovery under oath by defendant Probey, and to such further and incidental relief as the court having jurisdiction of the general suhject-matter may find it equitable to award.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The decree is reversed, with costs, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
