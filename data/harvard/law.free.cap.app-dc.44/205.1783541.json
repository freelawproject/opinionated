Co. </em>41 App. D. C. 507. The decision clearly was right. In that case the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Van Orsdel, said: \u201cThe statute takes from the realm of possible registration the name of an individual, firm, corporation, or association, except under conditions not existing in this case. This limitation is founded upon sound principles of public policy. <em>\u2018A </em>man\u2019s name is his own property, and he has the same right to its use and enjoyment as he has to that of any other species of property.\u2019 <em>Brown Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>139 U. S. 540, 35 L. ed. 247, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625. The same rule applies to a- corporation. * * * It is not the business which the statute in this particular aims to protect. It is the corporate name, and it is sufficient that possible damage may be inferred from invading the corporate right which the corporation possesses in its name.\u201d Here, as there, it is sought to register as a trademark the principal and distinguishing word of the corporate name of the appellee. Whether that word is to be written or printed in a peculiar manner is of no consequence, for, however it is written, the letters still will spell \u201cFord\u201d-and the domain of the appellee will be encroached upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The decision must be affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
