Hopkins, Otherwise known as Julia B. Fletcher, plaintiff below, against defendants Patrick F. Hannan, appellant, and one James J. Fletcher, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>a supersedeas bond given by defendant Fletcher as principal, and defendant Hannan as surety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-5\">It appears that plaintiff procured a divorce from defendant Fletcher, in which she was decreed alimony. Subsequently, in the same action, defendant Fletcher was cited into court to show cause why he should not be committed for contempt for failure to comply with the,Jorder of the court for the payment of alimony. On hearing, a decree was entered finding that Fletcher was in default in the payment of alimony in the sum of $621.-50; that he had wilfully and contumaciously disobeyed the order of the court by his failure to pay the alimony as ordered; and that, in continuing his failure and refusal to pay, he was in contempt of court and of its decree. Fletcher was therefore adjudged in contempt of court, and it was ordered \u201cthat he be committed to the Washington asylum and jail for the term of sixty days, or until such earlier time as he shall purge himself of his said contempt by paying the arrears of alimony aforesaid amounting to the sum aforesaid, or be otherwise discharged by order of court, or released according to law, and that he be taken into custody immediately by the marshal of the United States for the District of Columbia for the execution of this order.\u201d Appeal from this order was noted, and\" the penalty of the bond was \u201cfixed at the sum of $100, if for costs, and at $800, if to act as a supersedeas.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-6\">Appeal was perfected and a supersedeas bond in the sum of $800 was given, with Hannan as surety. The bond was conditioned \u201cthat if the above-named James J. Fletcher shall prosecute his said appeal to effect, and answer all damages and costs if he shall fail to make good his plea, then this obligation shall be void: otherwise, the same shall be and remain in full force and virtue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-7\">On appeal to this court, the decree was affirmed. <em>Flelcher </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>43 App. D. C. 180. On return of the mandate to the court below, this action was brought on the bond to recover the alimony, with interest. On trial, the court entered judgment for the balance of alimony found to be due, with interest and costs, from which judgment this appeal was prosecuted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Mr. Henry E.

With this contention we agree. Tbe finding tbat be was in default did not amount to a judgment for accrued alimony, but merely a recital of bis failure to comply with tbe former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>decree, which furnished the basis for the order of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">It will be observed that this is not a judgment for accrued alimony, but a decree finding appellant guilty of contempt of court in failing to comply with a former decree awarding alimony. The order is for a cost bond of $100, staying execution for costs of that proceeding pending appeal, or for a supersedeas bond for $800, staying execution of the sentence of imprisonment pending appeal. We think it too clear for argument that the bond in no way superseded or stayed execution on the judgment in the former decree for the payment of alimony. The bond stayed only the order of commitment, and in no way affected the enforcement of the judgment for alimony which was embraced in the divorce decree. Execution could have been issued on that decree at any time, regardless of the bond staying appeal upon the commitment order to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The judgment is reversed, with costs, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
