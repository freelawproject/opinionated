A British patent is a bar to the granting of a patent here to the same applicant for the same invention, where the application for the British patent was a provisional one, and was filed more than one year prior to the date of the filing of the application here, although the subject-matter of the invention for which a patent is claimed here was not disclosed by such provisional application, but was only disclosed by the completed specification of the British patent, filed less than one year before the filing of the application in this country. (Following <em>Re Bwinbwme, </em>19 App. D. C. 565.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b453-9\">2. Where, after an application for a patent has been denied on a reference to a foreign patent, the Commissioner denies a motion by the applicant for a reference to the examiner, with directions to declare an interference with a patentee whose application was junior to that of the applicant, and whose invention, it is claimed, was the same as that of the applicant, an appeal will not lie from the order of the Commissioner denying such motion, as to permit such an appeal would be equivalent to this court compelling the declaration of an interference in the Patent Office, which this court has no power to do.

This court has no power to entertain appeals from interlocutory orders and rulings of the Commissioner of Patents on mere matters of procedure.

A provisional application for tbe British patent was filed more than one year prior to tbe date of filing tbe present application, which, it was held, renders tbe British patent a bar to tbe granting of a patent on tbe appealed claims. U. S. Rev. Stat. sec. 4887, Comp. Stat. 1913, sec. 9431.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">But it is argued that tbe completed specification of tbe British patent was filed less than a year before the present application, and that tbe provisional application did not disclose tbe subject-matter of tbe appealed claims. We have held, however, that tbe bar of tbe statute begins to run from tbe date of tbe filing of a foreign provisional specification which ripens into a patent disclosing tbe subject-matter of tbe claim upon which a domestic patent is sought. <em>Re Swinburne, </em>19 App. D. C. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">It is also insisted that tbe appealed claims are closely related to claims which have been allowed in a patent to one Euch, whose application was junior to that of appellants. When tbe Commissioner rejected appellants\u2019 claims as unpatentable, appellants requested a reference of tbe case back to tbe Examiner, \u2022with instructions to declare an interference with Buck. Erom tbe refusal of tbe Commissioner to grant tbis request, error is here assigned. To recognize tbis as a proper ground of appeal, and sustain tbe contention of appellants, would be equivalent to compelling tbe declaration of an interference in tbe Patent Office. Tbis we have held not to be within our appellate jurisdiction. In tbe very early case of <em>Westinghouse </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>App. D. C. 131, this court, through Chief Justice Alvey, held that from \u201cthe mere refusal of the Commissioner to direct an investigation and determination of the Examiners as to an alleged interference of an application for a patent with any pending application, or with any unexpired patent, is but a preliminary <em>opinion, </em>as to the propriety of such examination, formed in the exercise of a sound discretion; and as the foundation for the exercise of such discretion, the Commissioner is at liberty to obtain extrinsic information as to the interfering claims. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>5 Blatchf. 160, Fed. Cas. No. 11,325. From this preliminary opinion of the Commissioner, no appeal lies to this court.\u201d This rule as to interlocutory orders and rulings on mere matters of procedure has been consistently adhered to. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>26 App. D. C. 8; <em>Union Distilling Co. </em>v. <em>Schneider, </em>29 App. D. C. 1; <em>Re Fullagar, </em>32 App. D. C. 222; <em>Cosper </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>34 App. D. C. 194; <em>Universal Motor Truck Co. </em>v. <em>Universal Motor Co. </em>41 App. D. C. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed, and the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by law required. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
