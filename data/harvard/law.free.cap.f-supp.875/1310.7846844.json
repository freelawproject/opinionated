Through the court\u2019s authority under FRCP 12(f), this order strikes the redundant and immaterial from these recitals to focus on any claims the facts at bar may present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-22\">Plaintiffs claim that between August 3, 1992, and July 17, 1993, defendants artificially inflated the price of Clearly Canadian stock through a series of materially misleading statements, violating \u00a7 10(b) and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5 and \u00a7 20(a) of the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act. Defendants move to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on the.grounds that it fails to allege sufficient facts to support plaintiffs\u2019 claim of scienter. Defendants also claim their statements were not materially misleading and that plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled loss causation. In addition, defendants oppose plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-24\">Starting in 1988, Clearly Canadian pioneered the \u201cNew Age\u201d segment of the soft-drink market, selling uncolored carbonated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>fruit-flavored beverages. Until 1992, the company had near exponential growth in its sales, with revenues jumping from approximately $33 million in 1990 to $127.4 million in 1991. Throughout this period of rapid growth and into the purported class period, Clearly Canadian and its officers and directors forecasted continued growth and high profitability. The company based its forecasts on past performance and publicly announced plans to expand its distribution network into Mexico, Europe and the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-4\">Not all of the company\u2019s plans came to fruition. Indeed, the 1992 summer was cooler than expected, decreasing consumers\u2019 demand for all types of softdrinks. In addition, Clearly Canadian began to face competition from industry heavyweights like Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo., which each introduced competitive \u201cNew Age\u201d products. On top of that, flavored ice tea drinks gained newfound popularity and an increased market presence, giving consumers additional choices for softdrinks. As a result, Clearly Canadian in the fourth quarter of 1992 and in early 1993 failed to meet earnings expectations, and its stock began a downward drift from around $17 per share at the beginning of the purported class period to approximately $6 per share at the period\u2019s end.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-5\">Plaintiffs allege that defendants made a number of materially misleading statements about Clearly Canadian during the purported class period that violated \u00a7 10(b) and SEC Rule 10b-5 and \u00a7 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. At the beginning of the period, for example, Clearly Canadian announced a planned European stock offering expected to generate $35 million to $45 million, a fact that the markets apparently viewed favorably, as demonstrated by a 9.6 percent increase in the price of the company\u2019s shares. Plaintiffs contend this statement was misleading in that Clearly Canadian had not secured interest or backing for its proposed offering, which never occurred. Plaintiffs also complain about other optimistic statements. On September 1, 1992, Clearly Canadian\u2019s CEO, defendant Mason, stated that he expected sales, which analysts had predicted were dipping in the third quarter of 1992, to rebound in the fourth quarter. In the same statement, Mason also said he expected sales to increase 30 to 35 percent in 1993. As it turned out, sales and net income for the first half of 1993 were one half that of the first half of 1992. Nevertheless, in mid-October 1992, Mason announced plans to expand Clearly Canadian\u2019s distribution systems and roll out new flavored beverages, and he expressed confidence the new flavor would be \u201cthe most popular of the Company\u2019s current product line.\u201d SAC \u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-7\">In conjunction with Clearly Canadian\u2019s November 4 announcement of its earnings for the third quarter of 1992, defendant Mason indicated that a portion of the company\u2019s sales increase for that quarter was attributable to an inventory build-up, which he believed would be depleted in the fourth quarter. Plaintiffs contend this statement was misleading in that Mason was aware that distributors were holding excess inventory and that Clearly Canadian\u2019s board had directed the company to reduce production through March 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-8\">In a <em>Barrons </em>article published a month later, Clearly Canadian\u2019s COO, defendant Foreman, predicted fourth quarter revenues would be lower than expected because of an \u201cinventory correction,\u201d but still in the $30-35 million range. Plaintiffs contend that internal sales reports available to Foreman indicated that sales through the end of November were less than $10 million and that his prediction of sales over $30 million lacked a reasonable basis based on past year\u2019s experience. When Clearly Canadian finally announced its sales for the full year 1992, fourth quarter sales turned out to be only around $15 million, and net income from operations dropped to $.07 per share, compared to $.19 per share for the same period in 1991. When adjusted for one-time charges related to the buyout of a distributorship agreement, Clearly Canadian actually posted a $9.9 million quarterly net loss of the last quarter of 1992. By the date of this announcement, in late February 1993, the price of Clearly Canadian stock had dropped to approximately $9 per share. Following the announcement of year end results for 1992, several analysts publicly commented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>they felt misled by Clearly Canadian\u2019s prior statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-4\">Finally, in late June 1993, Clearly Canadian\u2019s CFO, defendant Horton, allegedly assured analysts that sales for the quarter ending in June would be in line with expectations of five-and-a-half to six million cases, when in fact, as of the end of May, Horton allegedly knew quarterly sales had been just over 3 million cases. Plaintiffs argue Horton had no reasonable basis for assuming the company would meet his prediction. SAC \u00b6 96. When Clearly Canadian finally announced its earnings for the quarter ending in June, they turned out to be lower than some analysts had predicted. Following this announcement on July 19, the last day of the purported class period, Clearly Canadian\u2019s stock dropped to $6 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-5\">Plaintiffs allege that in addition to making these misstatements, individual defendants engaged in illegal insider trading of the company\u2019s shares by trading while in possession of material nonpublie information. Plaintiffs also point out that the company repurchased its own shares during the purported class period, allegedly to boost the firm\u2019s stock price and allow individual defendants to sell their own shares at a profit. In addition, plaintiffs note that three times during the purported class period Clearly Canadian reduced the exercise price of options held by corporate insiders, allegedly to enable individual defendants to profit from their misstatements notwithstanding the overall erosion of the value of the company\u2019s shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-7\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that a complaint contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d FRCP 8(a)(2). In addition, allegations of fraud must be pled with particularity. Id. Rule 9(b). Courts are generally familiar with what to expect in fraud complaints involving direct or face-to-face transactions. Courts find less guidance about what to look for in a complaint such as the one at bar which claims a fraud on a securities market; this cause of action originated only recently and the opportunity for courts to develop pleading standards has been limited.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1500-10\">In assessing the adequacy of a complaint for securities market fraud under the Federal Rules, it is helpful to consider the information available to, and practical difficulties facing, a lawyer seeking to plead a claim of that type. As Professors Wright and Miller explain, \u201c[w]hat constitutes a short and plain statement must be determined in each case on the basis of the nature of the action, the relief sought, and the respective positions of the parties in terms of the availability of information.\u201d 5 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1217 (2d Ed. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-11\">Drafting a complaint for securities market fraud is at once both easier and more difficult than drafting a complaint for direct fraud. Securities market fraud is simpler to plead than direct fraud in that the former requires fewer elements than the latter. To state a claim for direct securities fraud under Rule 10b-5, a pleader must allege: (A) a misstatement or an omission which renders misleading a statement actually made, (B) materiality of the misstatement or omission, (C) scienter on the part of those making the statement or omitting the information, (D) reliance by the plaintiff if a misstatement is alleged, (E) damages suffered by the plaintiff and (F) a causal link between the damages suffered and the misstatement or omission. See Thomas Lee Hazen, <em>The Law Securities Regulation </em>\u00a7 13.2 (2d ed. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-12\">If the plaintiff sues under the fraud-on-the-market theory, however, reliance (element D) need no longer be pled. A securities market fraud case proceeds on the assumption that investors rely on the integrity of the market to establish a fair and correct price for openly traded securities. Hence, there is no need to prove that individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1415\">*1415</page-number>investors relied on any particular information about the prospects of the security\u2019s issuer. <em>Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 244-47, 108 S.Ct. 978, 990-91, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988); <em>In re Seagate Technology II Sec. Litig., </em>843 F.Supp. 1341, 1355 (N.D.Cal.1994). Moreover, an allegation that the defendants\u2019 misstatement distorted the market price of the security itself satisfies three of the elements required to state a claim of direct fraud (i.e., elements B, E and F). See Jonathan R. Macey, Geoffrey P. Miller, Mark L. Mitchell &amp; Jeffry M. Netter, <em>Lessons from Financial Economics: Materiality, Reliance, and Extending the Reach of Basic v. Levinson, </em>77 Va.L.Rev. 1017 (1991). Given the presumption of reliance, when an alleged misstatement or omission occurs (element A) and affects the trading price of the security on the open market, this price effect denotes the materiality of the misinformation put into the market, satisfying element (B). The price effect, it is theorized, also furnishes elements (E) and (F). Because defendants misled the market, the market, according to the theory, was unable correctly to value the security, whose price diverged from its true value, leading plaintiffs to overpay for (or in the rare case undersell<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) the security, causing plaintiffs\u2019 damages. The amount of those damages is simply the amount of the divergence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Green v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., </em>541 F.2d 1335, 1341-42 (9th Cir.1976) (Sneed, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-5\">A complaint for market fraud therefore requires only two distinct elements, (A) and (C) above, along with an allegation that the price of the security responded significantly to defendants\u2019 alleged misstatements. This simplification greatly reduces the burden on the pleader drafting his complaint, especially since the price effect on the security of the alleged misrepresentation is usually known at the time the complaint is drafted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The basic facts pertaining to elements (A) and (C) may also be known when the complaint is drafted. Indeed, these facts are frequently disseminated by the numerous media which cover and compile business and economic news and information and thus can be alleged with the particularity required by FRCP 9(b) without much difficulty. Damages, which need not be pled with specificity, can nevertheless also be precisely calculated because the effect of the allegedly misstated or omitted information can be observed in the price reaction of the security when the true facts about the issuer become known to the market. Although the price distortion will not necessarily equate with the price shock which triggered the lawsuit, see Baruch Lev &amp; Meiring de Villiers, <em>Stock Price Crashes and 10b-5 Damages: A Legal, Economic, and Policy Analysis, </em>47 Stan.L.Rev. 7 (1994), econometric analysis of publicly available price and volume data will enable the price distortion to be calculated early in the litigation, perhaps even before the complaint is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-10\">While the availability of much of the information needed to plead a market fraud claim eases the pleader\u2019s task, it also constrains what he can responsibly assert in the complaint. In an omissions case, for example, the information that moved the price of the security is that which defendants should allegedly have earlier disclosed, but did not. The pleader when drafting the complaint will generally not know with precision what information defendants knew and when they knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>it. This contrasts with a misstatement case, in which the timing and falsity of the misinformation put into the market is evident. Hence, although a pleader will know in both a misstatement case and an omissions case when the market fraud ended, in an omissions case it may not be readily apparent when the fraud being alleged began. Similarly, the identity of those responsible for the false statement or misleading omission may not be fully known when drafting the pleading. Again, this is especially likely in an omissions case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-4\">Another constraint is that the alleged misstatements or omissions must match temporally with the pattern of the security\u2019s price behavior. For a misstatement to be actionable, it must have an effect on the price of the security in the market. Similarly, an omission is actionable only if it causes the value line of the security to diverge from the price line. See <em>Green, </em>541 F.2d at 1341; <em>Seagate II, </em>843 F.Supp. 1341, 1347 (N.D.Cal. 1994). No matter how untrue a statement and no matter the malignancy with which it is uttered or with which information is concealed, no market fraud is committed unless the statement or omission moves the price of the security to depart from its true value. Often a pleader will be unable to match the misstatements or omissions that he suspects with price behavior that suggests that the market was fooled or that the information distorted was material to investors\u2019 evaluation of the company\u2019s prospects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-5\">Finally, the misstatement or omission whose correction caused the precipitous price movement that triggered the litigation must be the subject of defendants\u2019 alleged fraud. If, for example, the news that rocked the security price was of disappointing earnings, then the pleader must find a misstatement about earnings put into the market by defendants or identify material information about earnings that defendants were aware of and concealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-6\">From this discussion, it should be clear that pleading market fraud under FRCP 8(a)(2) does not require elaborate or lengthy recitals. The core of a market fraud case is the price effect of the alleged misrepresentation or omission, measured when the \u201ctruth\u201d entered the market. In addition, in a misstatement case, one would expect a pleader to include specific information about the alleged misstatement, such as who made it, when it was made and why it was misleading. In an omissions ease, however, the specifics of exactly who said (or did not say) what, and what they knew when, can be alleged more generally, to be illuminated through discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-9\">When confronted with a complaint that runs afoul of Rule 8(a)(2), the court has two options. First, the court may dismiss the complaint. <em>Kuehl v. FDIC, </em>8 F.3d 905 (1st Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 114 S.Ct. 1545, 128 L.Ed.2d 196 (1994); <em>Salahuddin v. Cuomo, </em>861 F.2d 40 (2d Cir.1988); <em>Lasky v. Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., </em>139 F.R.D. 597 (S.D.N.Y.1991). Dismissal under these circumstances is usually without prejudice, although the more draconian step of dismissal with prejudice may be appropriate in particular eases. <em>Kuehl, </em>8 F.3d at 908-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-12\">A second option is for the court to use its power under FRCP 12(f) to order stricken from the complaint redundant or immaterial matter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This option is particularly appropriate where, as here, the complaint describes a fraud on the market, and plaintiff lawyers, able and experienced securities litigators, have had years to develop facts into a coherent theory of fraud and have already amended their complaint twice. Furthermore, defendants have moved the court to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint under FRCP 12(b)(6). Under these circumstances, dismissal for failure to comply with Rule 8(a)(2) will only invite a pared down amended complaint and a new round of motions to dismiss. In the interests of efficiency, then, the court, if it denies defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, should nevertheless strike the surplusage of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to bring it in compliance with Rule 8(a)(2). Because plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not comply with Rule 8(a)(2), and for the reasons developed in connection with the court\u2019s discussion of the merits of defendants\u2019 motion, the court believes such action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>is necessary in the case at bar and undertakes to do so in Part IV of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-5\">Defendants seek dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint under FRCP 12(b)(6). The court may grant defendants\u2019 motion if plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges no set of facts showing plaintiff is entitled to relief. <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). \u201cConclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\u201d <em>In re VeriFone Sec. Litig., </em>11 F.3d 865, 868 (9th Cir.1993). In addition, allegations of securities fraud must meet the particularity requirements of FRCP 9(b). <em>Wool v. Tandem Computers, Inc., </em>818 F.2d 1433, 1439 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-7\">Defendants\u2019 first argument for dismissal is that plaintiffs have failed to allege facts that demonstrate defendants\u2019 scienter. Scienter is a state of mind evidencing an intent to defraud. Under Ninth Circuit case law, reckless conduct by defendants satisfies the scienter requirement. <em>Hollinger v. Titan Capital Corp., </em>914 F.2d 1564, 1568-69 (9th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>499 U.S. 976, 111 S.Ct. 1621, 113 L.Ed.2d 719 (1991). A company\u2019s failure to meet its forecasts is not enough to support an inference of scienter. <em>Marx v. Computer Sciences Corp., </em>507 F.2d 485, 490 (9th Cir.1974). Rather, plaintiffs must demonstrate that, at the time the forecasts were made, defendants knowingly or recklessly failed to reveal material information in their possession, rendering the forecasts misleading. Scienter may be pled generally, FRCP 9(b); <em>In re GlenFed, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>42 F.3d 1541 (9th Cir.1994), and plaintiffs can infer scienter at the pleading stage by claiming defendants had a motive and opportunity to profit from the alleged fraud. <em>In re Wells Fargo Sec. Litig., </em>12 F.3d 922, 931 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-8\">The thrust of defendants\u2019 scienter argument is directed towards plaintiffs\u2019 apparent inability to describe a motive for defendants to have engaged in the fraud of which they are accused. Defendants point out that individual corporate insiders engaged in only small amounts of trading during the purported class period and that none of this trading coincided with alleged fraudulent misstatements. Also, defendants argue that reducing the exercise price of options held by insiders is simply an appropriate reaction to a decline in the value of the company\u2019s shares and does not support an inference of scienter. Finally, defendants note that a company\u2019s decision to invest in itself by repurchasing its shares is inconsistent with an intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-10\">These arguments are not sufficient to demonstrate that plaintiffs have failed to allege facts from which the court can infer defendants acted with scienter. Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint contains specific allegations that defendants made public statements about Clearly Canadian either knowing those statements to be false or with reckless disregard for their falsity. For example, plaintiffs contend that defendants Foreman and Horton made two predictions about Clearly Canadian\u2019s short term performance while in possession of internal reports that showed their predictions lacked a reasonable basis. See SAC \u00b6\u00b6 75-76, 96. Other examples of allegations that plead facts supporting scienter are discussed below. While it is unclear to the court what motive defendants may have had for making such allegedly misleading statements, under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the securities laws, these allegations are sufficient to support plaintiffs\u2019 claim of scienter at the pleading stage. See <em>GlenFed, </em>42 F.3d at 1547 (\u201cRule 9(b) requires particularized allegations of the circumstances <em>constituting </em>fraud.\u201d); <em>Hollinger, </em>914 F.2d at 1569-70; see also <em>In re Time Warner Sec. Litig., </em>9 F.3d 259, 268 (2d Cir. 1993) (noting scienter can be supported by claims of conscious disregard for the truth). Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to allege facts supporting scienter must therefore be DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-12\">Defendants also contend Clearly Canadian\u2019s statements were not materially misleading as a matter of law. Defendants offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>three versions of this argument. First, Clearly Canadian adequately disclosed the information plaintiffs claim was concealed. Second, the company\u2019s descriptions of its business strategy did not create an impression of future growth and therefore did not mislead the market. Last, the statements plaintiffs complain were misleading were simply vague expressions of optimism that are not actionable as a matter of law. While correct as far as they go, these arguments do not go so far as to justify granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-4\">When a corporation chooses to disclose information, it must reveal any information in its possession necessary to render the disclosure not misleading. This rule applies to statements of future projections as well as statements of past performance. <em>In re Apple Computer Sec. Litig., </em>886 F.2d 1109, 1113 (9th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>496 U.S. 943, 110 S.Ct. 3229, 110 L.Ed.2d 676 (1990). Thus, even if the investment community knew that demand for softdrinks had decreased during the 1992 summer because of bad weather and that the entry of competitors like Coke and the proliferation in the market of flavored iced tea drinks would decrease demand for Clearly Canadian\u2019s product, defendants\u2019 forecasts could still have been materially misleading if one of three implicit factual assertions contained in the forecasts were false: (1) that the statement was genuinely believed; (2) that there was a reasonable basis for the belief; and (3) that the speaker was not aware of any undisclosed facts that undermined the accuracy of the statements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1504-5\">Plaintiffs make five allegations that meet this test. First is the company\u2019s announcement of its later-aborted European stock offering, which plaintiffs allege was made when defendants knew they lacked sufficient backing. SAC \u00b6 65. Second, on November 4, 1992, defendant Mason commented that he expected sales to rebound. According to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, when Mason made this statement he already knew that the Clearly Canadian\u2019s board had directed the company to reduce production due to the amount of inventory held by distributors. Id. \u00b672. Third, defendant Foreman\u2019s statement in a December 7,1992, article in <em>Barrons </em>predicted sales for the quarter ending in December 1992 would be upwards of $30 million. Plaintiffs allege that when Foreman made this statement, he was aware of internal reports that showed the company could not reach this level of sales. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 75-76. Fourth, on February 8, 1993, defendant Foreman was quoted as predicting that Clearly Canadian would \u201cgrow double the market in 1993\u201d; again, plaintiffs contend Foreman was aware of information that will prove that prediction lacked a reasonable basis. Id. \u00b6 78. Finally, plaintiffs claim defendant Horton, in June 1993, misled the market by predicting sales over 5.5 million cases for the quarter when he allegedly knew the figures would turn out much lower. Id. \u00b6 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-7\">From plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, one can infer that, if these statements were false, they caused the price of Clearly Canadian\u2019s stock to diverge from its true value. Following disclosure of Clearly Canadian\u2019s plans for a European stock offering, the price of its NASDAQ-traded stock increased 9.6 percent. Id \u00b6 65. And while Clearly Canadian\u2019s stock price declined from over $17 per share in October 1992 to $9 per share in February 1993, it is not unreasonable to assume (and, indeed, on defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the court must assume) that, had defendants not made their alleged misstatements, Clearly Canadian\u2019s stock would have dropped in price even more rapidly. By the end of the purported class period, when, according to plaintiffs, the \u201ctruth\u201d about Clearly Canadian\u2019s prospects were finally known to the market, its stock was trading at approximately $6 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-8\">Not all of defendants\u2019 statements during the purported class period are actionable, however. Defendants properly point out that, in a fraud-on-the-market case, they cannot be liable as a matter of law for failing to include in their disclosures information already widely known to the market. <em>Apple Computer, </em>886 F.2d at 1115. Under the fraud-on-the-market theory, plaintiffs rely on the integrity of the market, which is by assumption efficient, meaning that the market rapidly incorporates into the price of a security all available material information. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>If information about entry of competitors into the New Age softdrink market was available to the market and materially relevant to the price of Clearly Canadian stock, defendants\u2019 failure to disclose that information cannot have affected the price of Clearly Canadian stock. Additional disclosure by defendants would not have added material information to the market. Put differently, the materiality requirement of Rule 10b-5 judges a statement in light of the total mix of information available to the market. <em>TSC Indus. v. Northway, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 438, 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 2132, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976). If a disclosure by the defendants would not have altered this total mix of information, it cannot be material and is therefore not actionable. <em>In re Convergent Technologies Sec. Litig., </em>948 F.2d 507, 513 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-4\">From plaintiffs\u2019 own assertions, it is clear that the financial markets were well aware of many of the troubles Clearly Canadian faced, notwithstanding defendants\u2019 alleged efforts to hide their problems. For example, on August 3, 1992, a Dow Jones Newswire discussion of Clearly Canadian\u2019s stock performance noted that the company\u2019s strong second quarter 1992 results \u201ceased the fears of some who thought that increasing competition in the so-called \u2018new age\u2019 beverage category would cut into the company\u2019s results.\u201d SAC \u00b6 65. Thus, even at the beginning of the purported class period, the markets were aware of the threat increased competition posed to Clearly Canadian\u2019s performance. Analysts began lowering their estimates of Clearly Canadian\u2019s earnings almost immediately thereafter, just one month into the purported class period, id. \u00b6 66, and defendant Mason acknowledged that reduced expectations were appropriate, given the cool summer weather. Id. \u00b6 67. Three months later, in November 1992, securities analysts probed defendant Foreman with inquiries about the effect increased competition would have on Clearly Canadian\u2019s sales, indicating competition continued to be a topic of concern in the financial markets. As a result of the market\u2019s unease about Clearly Canadian\u2019s prospects, its stock price declined from almost $17 in August 1992 to around $10 in November.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-5\">Plaintiffs also contend that defendants\u2019 vague statements of general optimism are actionable under the securities laws. The investment community understands that long range plans may not come to fruition and that corporate insiders\u2019 naturally optimistic hopes are often inflated, however. <em>Wielgos v. Commonwealth Edison Co., </em>892 F.2d 509, 515 (7th Cir.1989); <em>In re VeriFone Sec. Litig., </em>784 F.Supp. 1471, 1481 (N.D.Cal. 1992), <em>aff'd, </em>11 F.3d 865 (9th Cir.1993). Thus, statements such as defendant Foreman\u2019s that the company is well-positioned for the future or that it will be a $1 billion dollar company soon after the turn of the century, or defendant Mason\u2019s claim that the company\u2019s distribution agreements are steps towards becoming a global leader are not actionable as a matter of law. Indeed, some of these long-term predictions may eventually come true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-6\">Nevertheless, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint contains sufficient allegations of material misstatements to support 10b-5 liability. Accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claims for failing to allege material misrepresentations is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-8\">Defendants\u2019 final argument for dismissal is that plaintiffs have failed to allege facts that indicate plaintiffs will be able to prove the causation element of 10b-5 liability. The court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-9\">In a fraud-on-the-market case, causation becomes closely intertwined with plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the integrity of the market. See Part II, supra; see also <em>Sea-gate II, </em>843 F.Supp. at 1347 n. 5; <em>VeriFone, </em>784 F.Supp. at 1479. This is especially so in a case such as this, where defendants are accused of misleading the market with fraudulently optimistic forecasts. Plaintiffs can prove loss causation by demonstrating that the price of Clearly Canadian stock was artificially inflated by defendants\u2019 misstatements when plaintiffs purchased their shares. The loss suffered by plaintiffs is the difference between the \u201ctrue\u201d value of the stock and its artificially inflated price at the time of purchase. <em>Wool, </em>818 F.2d at 1437.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>Defendants argue that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails to plead facts demonstrating causation because plaintiffs have not specifically linked any decline in the price of Clearly Canadian shares with a particular misstatement. In an omissions case, however, this is hardly surprising. As discussed in Part IIIB, supra, it is not unreasonable to assume at this stage in the litigation that plaintiffs may be able to demonstrate that but for defendants\u2019 alleged material omissions, the price of Clearly Canadian shares would have decreased faster than it did. Of course, plaintiffs will have to come forward with evidence on this point, but that is an issue more properly addressed in a motion for summary judgment. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claim for failure adequately to plead loss causation is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-5\">To make out a claim of controlling person liability under \u00a7 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, plaintiffs must allege that (1) individual defendants had the power to control or influence Clearly Canadian and (2) individual defendants were culpable participants in the company\u2019s alleged fraudulent acts. <em>Wool, </em>818 F.2d at 1441-42. \u201c[W]here, as here, the corporate officers are a narrowly defined group charged with day-to-day operations of a public corporation, it is reasonable to presume that these officers had the power to control or influence the particular transactions giving rise to the securities violation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1506-6\">Review of plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint reveals adequate allegations to support the first element of plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 20(a) claim. As discussed above, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint also sufficiently alleges that defendants Mason, Foreman and Horton all made culpable misstatements to support the second element of \u00a7 20(a) liability. Furthermore, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint contains sufficient allegations of a conspiracy and acts in furtherance to support claims against the remaining individual defendants. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 20(a) claim is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-8\">Denial of defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss does not mean this litigation must proceed with plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as it stands. FRCP 8(a)(2) requires a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 seventy-four page complaint is neither short nor plain. Rather, it is replete with irrelevant and immaterial recitals that have no part in this litigation. Inclusion of such material places an unnecessary burden on defendants and the court to sift through the irrelevant matter to identify the basis of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Ultimately, such pleading is self-defeating for plaintiffs, as it merely slows down the litigation from reaching the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-9\">Included in plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint, for example, are \u00b6\u00b6 41-64 and 98-107, which, respectively, describe in fifteen pages statements allegedly made by defendants <em>before </em>and <em>after </em>the purported class period. Similarly, \u00b6 108, which describes alleged insider trading by individual defendants, lists on five pages trading activity that occurred overwhelmingly <em>outside </em>the purported class period. As the class period defines the time during which defendants\u2019 fraud was allegedly alive in the market, statements made or insider trading allegedly occurring before or after the purported class period are irrelevant to plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claims. Pursuant to Rule 12(f), the court therefore ORDERS STRICKEN from plaintiffs\u2019 complaint \u00b6\u00b6 41-64 and 98-107 and any transactions listed in \u00b6 108 that occurred before August 3, 1992, or after July 19, 1993, plaintiffs\u2019 purported class period. The court also ORDERS STRICKEN \u00b6\u00b63, 4, 5 and 6, which discuss only statements allegedly made before the purported class period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-10\">In addition, the court ORDERS STRICKEN \u00b6 109, which purports to list in thirty-nine subparagraphs information known to or recklessly disregarded by defendants when making their allegedly misleading statements. For the reasons discussed in Part III, supra, certain of \u00b6\u00b6 65-97 describe plaintiffs\u2019 claims with adequate specificity and detail to satisfy plaintiffs\u2019 pleading requirements under Rules 8 and 9(b), rendering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>additional piling on of vague so-called \u201cfacts\u201d in \u00b6 109 unnecessary. Moreover, \u00b6 109 fails to show how any of the allegedly adverse facts it recites rendered false or materially misleading any statements made by defendants. Nor does \u00b6 109 identify facts which imposed on defendants a duty to disclose the information it contains.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-4\">Finally, the court ORDERS STRICKEN as redundant and immaterial \u00b6\u00b6 66-71, 73, 77, 80-88 and 90-95. Paragraph 66 states only that an analyst lowered his forecast for Clearly Canadian\u2019s earnings. There is no allegation, however, that the analyst\u2019s statement was false or misleading, or that defendants \u201csufficiently entangled [themselves] with the analysts\u2019 forecasts to render those projections attributable to [them].\u201d <em>Elkind v. Liggett &amp; Myers, Inc., </em>635 F.2d 156, 163 (2d Cir.1980). Accordingly, \u00b6 66, even if trae, is not actionable. The same can be said for \u00b6\u00b6 83-85 (describing analysts\u2019 comments about Clearly Canadian). Paragraph 77, which contains no factual allegations, is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-6\">Paragraphs 67-71, 73, 80-82, 86-88 and 90-95 all fail to comply with FRCP 9(b). To satisfy Rule 9(b)\u2019s requirements for pleading securities fraud, \u201cplaintiffs] must set forth <em>what </em>is false or misleading about a statement, <em>and, why </em>it is false.\u201d <em>GlenFed, </em>42 F.3d at 1548 (emphases added). While all of these paragraphs from plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint discuss statements by defendants, none says anything about why those statements were false when made. For example, \u00b671 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1507-7\">On October 29, 1992, Clearly Canadian announced that it had entered into agreements to distribute Clearly Canadian products in Mexico and the Caribbean. In the announcement, defendant Foreman, Chief Operating Officer stated: \u201cThese agreements are part of Clearly Canadian\u2019s goal of quality on its worldwide leadership position within the rapidly growing New Age beverage industry. Under the terms of the agreement, the distributors have committed to 1,000,000 cases and 600,000 cases in the first year of the agreements.\u201d In fact, distributors appear to have taken significantly less product during the first year period identified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1507-10\">SAC \u00b6 71. This paragraph alleges that defendant Foreman made a statement that <em>later </em>turned out not to be true. There is no indication, however, about what was false or misleading about the statement when made. <em>GlenFed, </em>42 F.3d at 1549 (\u201c[A] plaintiff must set forth, as part of the circumstances constituting fraud, an explanation as to why the disputed statement was untrue or misleading <em>when made.\u201d). </em>The statement describes an agreement; to satisfy Rule 9(b), plaintiffs must allege that the description of the agreement was itself false or misleading, not simply that facts did not unfold as hoped. Paragraph 86 provides a similar example. The paragraph merely states that defendants \u201casserted that Clearly Canadian was about to be delisted from the Vancouver Stock Exchange and listed on the New York Stock Exchange * * *. Clearly Canadian was never listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\u201d Again, there is no indication that defendants\u2019 assertion was false when made. Moreover, \u00b6 86 fails to identify the time and place of this alleged statement, failing the other requirements of Rule 9(b). <em>GlenFed, </em>42 F.3d at 1547-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-11\">Plaintiffs cannot, as they have attempted to do, simply list a number of defendants\u2019 statements and then elsewhere (in this case \u00b6 109) describe in vague terms why these statements were false. Allegations must be focused on specific falsehoods. Otherwise, by filing an easily drafted complaint, plaintiffs could impose significant discovery costs on defendants and burden the courts with needless litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-12\">The court recognizes, as discussed in Part II, supra, that often information related to the falsity of a defendant\u2019s statements will not be known at the time of pleading. In this situation, however, the proper pleading practice is exemplified by \u00b6\u00b6 75-76 of plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint, which allege that defendant Foreman made a particular prediction (fourth quarter revenues would be $30-$35 million), but that when he made that prediction he possessed internal sales reports showing his prediction was unreasonable. Such specificity lays the foundation for <em>fo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number><em>cused </em>discovery about what defendant For-man knew when he made his prediction and allows the parties to determine efficiently whether the prediction had a reasonable basis and, therefore, whether defendants can be hable for securities fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-5\">Plaintiffs seek certification that this fraud-on-the-market securities litigation may be maintained as a class action under FRCP 23. In <em>In re Seagate Technology II Securities Litigation, </em>843 F.Supp. 1341, 1366 (N.D.Cal.1994), the court required plaintiffs seeking class certification in a fraud-on-the-market securities action to provide evidence on the extent of seller-purchaser and equity conflicts. The court believes that such information is necessary to determine the adequacy of representation in fraud-on-the-market cases, as the court must do under Rule 23. <em>Id. </em>at 1359-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-6\">Plaintiff lawyers in the case at bar, instead of presenting evidence to address the court\u2019s concerns, take issue with the court\u2019s <em>Seagate II </em>order. For the reason\u2019s detailed in <em>Sea-gate II, </em>the court believes seller-purchaser conflicts and conflicts between equity-holding and non-equity-holding class members raise serious questions about the adequacy of representation of all would-be class members. As plaintiffs have submitted no evidence to the court on these issues, the court is not in a position to determine whether class certification is proper. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-7\">Counsel shall appear for a status and scheduling conference on March 17, 1995, at 2:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1500-8\">.

One of the anomalous features of a claim for market fraud is that, because necessarily each purchase in the market corresponds to a sale, as many participants benefit from the fraud as are damaged.
