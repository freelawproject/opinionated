W. Pelger, who is the holder of a chattel mortgage upon the same property subsequently executed by the same grantor. A trial in the superior court resulted in a decree denying a f oreclosure as against the defendant Felger, upon the ground that no affidavit setting forth the amount due upon the Merryman mortgage was filed in the office of the county auditor within two years after the maturity of the debt secured thereby, nor at any time, as required by Rem. &amp; Bal. Code, \u00a7 3662 (P. C. 349 \u00a7 43). From this disposition of the cause touching the rights of the defendant Felger, the plaintiff has appealed to this court. In so far as the decree and judgment deals with rights of the plaintiff as against other defendants, it is not drawn in question upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The controlling facts are not in dispute. On July 1, 1909, Andrew J. Reed, the owner of the property here involved, executed and delivered to Caroline Merryman a chattel mortgage, to secure an indebtedness evidenced by three promissory notes maturing on and prior to May 1, 1910; the indebtedness and the dates of its maturity being plainly so shown upon the face of the mortgage. On August 15, 1910, after the maturity of the whole of the indebtedness secured by the Merryman mortgage, Andrew J. Reed executed and delivered to respondent Felger another mortgage upon the same property, to secure an indebtedness evidenced by a promissory note for the sum of $1,100, then loaned by respondent Felger to Reed. Both of these mortgages were duly and timely filed for record in the office of the county auditor. On May 27, more than two years after the maturity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>of all of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage given to Caroline Merryman, she having died in the meantime, appellant, as her executor, commenced this action to foreclose the same as against respondent Felger as well as others claiming interest in the property. There has never been filed in the office of the county auditor any affidavit setting forth the amount due upon that mortgage, as provided in \u00a7 3662, Rem. &amp; Bal. Code (P. C. 349 \u00a7 43), which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201cEvery mortgage filed and indexed in pursuance of this act shall be held and considered to be full and sufficient notice to all the world, of the existence and conditions thereof, but shall cease to be notice, as against creditors of the mortgagors and subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith, after the expiration of the time such mortgage becomes due, unless before the expiration of two years after the time such mortgage becomes due, the mortgagee, his agent or attorney, shall make and file as aforesaid an affidavit setting forth the amount due upon the mortgage, which affidavit shall be annexed to the instrument to which it relates and the auditor shall indorse on said affidavit the time it was filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Counsel for appellant contend, in substance, that since Reed\u2019s indebtedness to respondent was incurred, and the mortgage securing the same given, before the expiration of two years following the maturity of the Merryman mortgage, respondent does not belong to the class of persons specified in \u00a7 3662 above quoted, who may claim rights superior to the Merryman mortgage, notwithstanding the Merryman mortgage has not been renewed by affidavit as required by that section. Counsel invoke the general rule as stated in the text of 6 Cyc. 1095 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\u201cIt is usually held that a person who purchases mortgaged property within the period when the mortgage is valid without refiling cannot later object that the instrument was not properly filed at the time when renewal should have been made, for the term \u2018subsequent purchaser\u2019 in a renewal statute means purchasers subsequent to the time of the refiling of the mortgage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>A number of decisions of the courts are cited and relied upon by counsel from which this general rule is deduced. They all, however, deal with the rights of parties under statutes in words, or in substance, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201cEvery mortgage so filed shall be void as against the creditors of the person making the same, or against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith, after the expiration of one year after the filing thereof, unless, within thirty days next preceding the expiration of the term of one year from such filing, and each year thereafter, the mortgagee, his agent or attorney, shall make an affidavit etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">This language is quoted from the opinion in <em>Howard v. First Nat. Bank of Hutchinson, </em>44 Kan. 549, 24 Pac. 983, 10 L. R. A. 537. The substance of the holding in that decision is stated in the syllabus as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">\u201cThe words \u2018subsequent purchasers\u2019 and \u2018subsequent mortgagees in good faith\u2019 in \u00a7 3905, mean only purchasers and mortgagees who purchased or took their mortgages after the expiration of the year from the filing of the mortgage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The holding of all the other decisions to which our attention has been called are in harmony with this view, but all of them deal with statutes either identical or in substance the same as the Kansas statute. No decision has come to our notice dealing with the rights of parties arising subsequent to a first mortgage under a statute like ours. Under the Kansas statute, the mortgage expires as to those subsequently acquiring rights, upon the <em>\u201cexpiration of one year after the filing thereof\u201d </em>in the absence of the filing of. the renewal affidavit thirty days <em>preceding </em>such expiration; while under our statute, the mortgage expires as to those subsequently acquiring rights upon the <em>\u201cexpiration of the time such mortgage becomes due\u201d </em>in the absence of the filing of the renewal affidavit within two years <em>thereafter. </em>In the case before us, respondent Felger acquired his rights under the second mortgage, when he made the loan to Reed, sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>eral months after the expiration of the time the first mortgage became due, which mortgage, we have noticed, has never been renewed by affidavit as required by statute, though over two years elapsed after its maturity before it was sought to be foreclosed by this action. This situation, it seems to us, answers the question of the superiority of the rights of the respective mortgagees in favor of respondent; unless the fact that the Mterryman mortgage was of record, and subject to renewal at the time the second one was given to respondent, continued the Mterryman mortgage in force as against him. But here we are met with this distinction between the Kansas statute and our own. By the provisions of the Kansas statute, under no circumstances can a subsequent mortgagee\u2019s rights intervene or supersede the rights of the first mortgagee before the time specified as the limit of the first mortgagee\u2019s rights, because the renewal affidavit, under that statute, must be filed thirty days <em>before </em>the expiration of the mortgage, which, as we have noticed, is one year after its filing; while under our statute, the mortgagee has two years <em>after </em>its maturity during which period his mortgage will remain in force if renewed by filing the affidavit within that period. Our statute recognizes the possible good faith of those acquiring rights after maturity of the prior mortgage, and before the expiration of two years thereafter. It seems to us that, in view of these provisions, a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for value \u2014 and that, we think, is as far as his good faith need extend \u2014 may acquire rights subsequent to the <em>maturity </em>of a prior mortgage, subject only to the possibility of such prior mortgage being thereafter renewed by affidavit within two years after its maturity. We are of the opinion that our statute is, in substance, a statute of limitation, in so far as the rights of purchasers and mortgagees who acquire rights in the property after the maturity of the first mortgage are concerned, and that as to such there can be no renewal of the prior mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>gage after the expiration of two years following its maturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Crow, C.
