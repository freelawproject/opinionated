J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGy\">Petitioner asks this court to review the proceedings in the superior court of San Joaquin County in a cause wherein P. D. Hart was plaintiff and petitioner was defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">It is alleged that Hart brought an action against petitioner in Stockton township and in the complaint therein averred \u201cthat within two years last past said plaintiff rendered labor to said defendant, at the latter\u2019s special instance and request, in the agreed value of $325; that upon said amount the sum of $100 has been paid, leaving due the sum of $225, no part of which has been paid\u201d; that summons was duly issued and served upon petitioner; \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>thereafter, in obedience to said summons and not voluntarily\u201d the petitioner demurred to the complaint on the grounds \u201cthat the court has no jurisdiction either of the person of the defendant or the subject matter of the action,\u201d and that the \u201ccomplaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action\u201d; that the court overruled the demurrer and the defendant answered, alleging \u201cthat the court has no jurisdiction of the person of the defendant or of the subject matter of the action for the reason that the defendant is not, and never was, a resident of the said Stockton township, and the alleged contract to pay for the said pretended work and labor specified in said complaint, was not made in said Stockton township nor to be performed therein,\u201d denying the allegations of the complaint, and pleading a settlement and payment of the alleged indebtedness; that \u201cat the trial of said cause in the justice\u2019s court the defendant called the attention of the justice to the fact that it had no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action or of the person of the defendant, and objected to the justice\u2019s court determining any question but that of jurisdiction. The justice\u2019s court then and there overruled the defendant\u2019s objection . . . and rendered judgment against the defendant\u201d; that the defendant appealed from such judgment \u201cupon questions of both law and fact\u201d; that in the superior court \u201cthe defendant . . . called the attention of said court to the fact that neither the justice\u2019s court nor the said superior court had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action or of the person of the defendant, and then and there objected to the court determining any question but that of jurisdiction, but the defendant, as the judge of the said superior court, overruled the defendant\u2019s said objection and rendered judgment against said defendant\u201d; that \u201cneither the said justice\u2019s court nor the said superior court had jurisdiction in said case of the subject matter of the action or of the person of the defendant, for the reason that it does not appear on the face of the complaint, or in the judgments entered therein, or in any of the records of said ease, that either the said justice\u2019s court ... or the said superior court . . . had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action ... or jurisdiction of the person of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Proof that a defendant resides in a judicial township in which he is sued is jurisdictional hut it is not required that the fact of such residence shall \u201cappear on the face of the complaint, or in the judgment entered therein, or in any of the records\u201d in the case. <em>(Jolley </em>v. <em>Foltz, </em>34 Cal. 321. See, also, <em>In re Williams, </em>102 Cal. 70 [41 Am. St. Rep. 163, 36 Pac. 407].) By his answer the defendant tendered the issue that his residence was not in Stockton township. By his appeal he asked the superior court to decide that issue. The court certainly had jurisdiction to determine the question thus raised. It does not appear from the petition that the court decided the question against petitioner\u2019s contention on insufficient evidence or without an opportunity to prove his place of residence. It must be presumed that there was evidence to support the judgment, even if the sufficiency of the evidence could be inquired into in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Petitioner relies on the case of <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>106 Cal. 589 [39 Pac. 936], in support of his contention that the defense of want of jurisdiction can be raised by answer. At the time that case was decided section 890, subdivision 4, of the Code of Civil Procedure provided for the dismissal of an action \u201cwhen it is objected at the trial, and appears by the evidence, that the action is brought in the wrong county, or township, or city.\u201d In 1905, subdivision 4 was amended to provide for a dismissal \u201cwhen the action is brought in the wrong county, or township, or city\u201d and it is silent as to the manner in which the question may be raised. In <em>Vance </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>48 Cal. App. 327 [191 Pac. 945], where the facts were similar to those here, the court said: \u201cBy his general appearance in the justice\u2019s and superior court petitioner waived his right to raise the question of jurisdiction,\u201d citing <em>Olcese </em>v. <em>Justice\u2019s Court, </em>156 Cal. 82 [103 Pac. 317], and <em>American Law Book Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>164 Cal. 327 [128 Pac. 921]. (See, also, <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Police Court, </em>185 Cal. 65 [195 Pac. 1053].) The provision of section 832 of the Code of Civil Procedure to the effect that actions such as that here involved must be commenced and tried \u201cin the township or city in which the defendant resides\u201d relates to the jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. <em>(Ohio Southern R. Co. </em>v. <em>Morey, </em>47 Ohio St. 207 [7 L. R. A. 701, 24 N. E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>269].) This proceeding is sought to review the action of the superior court, not that of the justice\u2019s court. \u201cThis court has never recognized the right of a petitioner to writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review the judgment of a justice\u2019s court after appeal taken and determined in the superior court.\u201d <em>(Olcese </em>v. <em>Justice\u2019s Court, su-pra.) </em>\u201cBy its appeal to the superior court the petitioner submitted the question of want of jurisdiction of its person to the superior court and . . . the tribunal to which the appeal was thus prosecuted had the right to decide that question incorrectly as well as correctly.\u201d <em>(American Law Book Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra.) </em>\u201cIf such tribunal has regularly pursued its authority, our inquiry stops.\u201d <em>(Matter of Hughes, </em>159 Cal. 360, 363 [113 Pac. 684, 686].) It does not appear from the petition herein that the superior court did not regularly pursue its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Hart, J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on July 24, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">All the Justices concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Richards, J., <em>pro tem., </em>and Myers, J., <em>pro tem., </em>were acting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
