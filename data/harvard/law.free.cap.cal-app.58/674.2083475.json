Respondents insist that the proceedings which appellant sought to prohibit were not judicial. The proceedings are the same as those considered in <em>Garin </em>v. <em>Pelton, ante, </em>p. 672 [209 Pac. 377]. It was there held that <em>certiorari </em>would not lie to review the proceedings because they were not judicial, and for the same reason prohibition cannot lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-23\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-24\">Sturtevant, J., and Langdon, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-25\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on October 2, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-26\">All the Justices present concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-27\">Richards, J., <em>pro tern., </em>was acting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
