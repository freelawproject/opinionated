The respondents have appeared by general demurrer.  The petition contains all the necessary averments relating to the judgment which the petitioner holds against the city and county and so far as that judgment is concerned the writ of <em>mandamius </em>should issue. But in so far as the petitioner seeks to obtain relief for others who hold judgments against the city and county, it fails to allege any facts bringing it within the terms of section 1086 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that the writ of mandate \u201cmust be issued upon the verified petition of the party beneficially interested. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Let the writ issue commanding the respondents to include in the tax levy for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1923, a sum sufficient to pay the judgment held by petitioner or an aliquot part thereof as provided by the act of March 23, 1901. (Stats. 1901, p. 794.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Langdon, P. J., and Sturtevant, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
