Hall filed his affidavit in the municipal court of Augusta to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien on a described automobile trailer which he had repaired for Fred L. Bogers, the affidavit alleging that the contract price for the repairs was $400, that Bogers had paid $150 on said contract price, and that the balance due affiant was $250. In his counter-affidavit Bogers deposed that \u201cit was understood and agreed that said repairs . . would cost between $275 and $300, but in no event would it exceed $300;\u201d that deponent had paid Hall $150 in advance on said contract and the work done on the trailer did not exceed that sum; that \u201cit was understood it would not take more than six or seven days to do the work . . and should not have taken longer than a week or ten days for such work;\u201d that Hall\u2019s unreasonable delay in completing the work on the trailer caused deponent to lose forty-three days; that deponent\u2019s time was reasonably worth $5 a day, or a total of $215; and that Hall was indebted to him in the sum of $215. Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>litigants introduced evidence and the jury returned a verdict fo.r the plaintiff in the sum of $250. Rogers filed a motion for new trial based solely upon the usual general grounds; the court overruled that motion and Rogers excepted to that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In their brief counsel for plaintiff in error admit that Hall made out a prima facie case for the recovery of $250 but insist that the evidence demanded a finding that \u201cthere was such an unreasonable delay in the completion of the work that defendant lost fifty-five days, which he testified was worth $5 a day, making a total of . . $275, and, therefore, this amount should have been set off . . against the . . $250 claimed by the plaintiff, which demanded a verdict for the defendant . . of $25.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Hall testified in substance that when Rogers brought the trailer to him it was a complete wreck; that the agreed contract price for repairing the trailer was $400; that Rogers \u201cinterfered with the men who were working with me on the trailer so until they quit work three different times;\u201d that \u201cit took four weeks working continuously to repair that trailer;\u201d that \u201cI worked at least eight hours every day . . started to work every morning around seven and would work to six or seven at night . . was working all the time on this trailer;\u201d that Rogers was present while the trailer was being repaired and \u201csupervised the work\u201d and \u201cran my men off of the job worrying them while they were working;\u201d that after the work was completed Rogers was \u201centirely pleased with the finished job\u201d and offered Hall his (Rogers\u2019) personal check for $250 on a trust company in New York; that he refused the check because Rogers would be gone before he could find out if the check was good; that Rogers then \u201cgot mad\u201d and Hall took a lien on the trailer to protect himself; that Rogers \u201cwas on vacation and did not lose any wages or salary . . that I know of;\u201d and that \u201cI completed this job just as soon as I could, even worked on Sunday.\u201d Mr. Holloway, a witness for the plaintiff, testified in part: \u201cI got three days work on this trailer; I was disturbed and bothered so much by Rogers I could not work. I was there when the job was finished. Rogers didn\u2019t find any fault with the work that had been done; he seemed perfectly satisfied and presented his check for $250.\u201d The defendant Rogers testified in part: \u201cI was delayed in Augusta fifty-five days. There was no excuse for him taking that long to do the work; I believe that it could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>done in a week. . . I value my time at at least $5 a day. . . I am retired. I formerly worked for Cable Company; New York. I offered him the check for $250 and told him this was an ex-horbitant price, but that I wanted to settle the matter and get away from here. . . I would consider that $200 would have been a . . fair price for repairs and materials on the trailer; I would have done the work and painted it fox that amount. . . It would have taken the factoxy about ten days to do the woxk Hall did on my trailer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">While the foregoing is by no means a full statement of the testimony in the case, we think it suffices to indicate the correctness of our conclusion that the jury\u2019s verdict was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"Anf\">\n<em>McIntyre and Gardner, JJ., concur.</em>\n</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
