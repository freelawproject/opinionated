EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Jerry A. Helms, appellant, appeals from an order entered by the Circuit Court for Garrett County, denying his \u201cMotion for Reduction of Sentence by 1/4\u201d under Maryland Code (2008 RepLVol.), \u00a7 11-605 of the Correctional Services Article (\u201cCS\u201d). In his brief, appellant, who is self-represented, contends the circuit court erred by (1) denying the motion under \u00a7 11-605 without \u201cthe benefit of an essential hearing,\u201d and (2) not providing an explanation for the denial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In the exercise of our discretion, we shall address the applicability of \u00a7 11-605, an issue not raised by appellant and not raised in circuit court. We conclude that the statute is applicable only to inmates housed in local correctional facilities, and thus, not to appellant, who is incarcerated in a State correctional facility. We shall also address appellant\u2019s contentions, which lack merit. The plain language of \u00a7 11-605 grants the circuit court discretion in determining whether to allow a diminution of an inmate\u2019s sentence and does not require it to hold a hearing or provide an explanation for its ruling. For these reasons, explained below, we shall affirm the ruling of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">On December 11, 1997, appellant appeared before the Circuit Court for Garrett County, entering guilty and Alford pleas to charges in six different cases. He was convicted and, according to appellant, sentenced to eighty-five years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">More than eleven years after his sentencing, on January 5, 2009, appellant filed a \u201cMotion for Reduction of Sentence by 1/4,\u201d citing Maryland Code (1957), Article 27, \u00a7 645N. That section was repealed and recodified, without substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>change, in Maryland Code (2008 Repl.Vol), \u00a7 11-605 of the Correctional Services Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 11-605 is titled \u201cDiminution credits\u201d and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">If the committing court determines that an inmate\u2019s conduct, diligence, and general attitude merit a diminution of sentence, the court may allow diminution of one-fourth of the inmate\u2019s term of confinement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">To demonstrate that he qualified for the diminution credits under the language of \u00a7 11-605, appellant also appended various definitions to his motion, including \u201cInmate,\u201d \u201cState Correctional Facility,\u201d \u201cCommitting Court,\u201d and \u201cTerm of Confinement.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">In his motion, appellant argued that he \u201csatisfied the requirements of \u00a7 11-605\u201d because he had (1) \u201can [sic] good conduct history while being confined in the State Facilities,\u201d (2) \u201cmaintained a job while in prison and most of the jobs have been preferred jobs, which are for the best inmates with the best skills,\u201d and (3) \u201cbeen able to stay away from gangs and drugs while in prison.\u201d Appellant requested a hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">On January 8, 2009, the State filed its \u201cAnswer to Motion for Reduction of Sentence by 1/4.\u201d The State did not address appellant\u2019s conduct as an inmate, noting that it did not have the opportunity to review appellant\u2019s file in the Division of Correction. Instead, it argued that the language of \u00a7 11-605, particularly the word \u201cmay,\u201d grants a circuit court discretionary authority when considering an inmate\u2019s request for a diminution of his term of confinement. The State then described the nature of the six cases underpinning appellant\u2019s sentence, focusing on \u201ctwo cases involving physical violence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>and sexual abuse of a one-year old child\u201d that now lives with \u201cpermanent injuries and disabilities \u2014 seizures, a deformed arm and vision impairment.\u201d The State concluded that \u201c[wjhether [appellant] has conformed his conduct while incarcerated and held jobs within the prison system does not in the State\u2019s view balance the risk that [appellant] would pose to the most vulnerable individuals\u201d if his term of confinement were reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">By order entered January 12, 2009, the circuit court, noting that it had \u201cread and considered\u201d the motion and the State\u2019s answer, denied the motion without a hearing or elaboration of reasons. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">As noted earlier, appellant contends the circuit court erred by (1) denying the motion under \u00a7 11-605 without \u201cthe benefit of an essential hearing,\u201d and (2) not providing an explanation for the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The State counters, as it did in its answer in circuit court, that the plain language of \u00a7 11-605 grants the circuit court discretion in determining whether to allow a diminution of an inmate\u2019s sentence. The State also argues, for the first time, that appellant had no right to relief under \u00a7 11-605 because the statute applies to inmates incarcerated in local, and not State, correctional facilities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The resolution of appellant\u2019s claims involves statutory interpretation. In <em>WCI v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 807 A.2d 32 (2002), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">Repeatedly, we have emphasized that \u201cthe paramount object of statutory construction is the ascertainment and effectuation of the real intention of the Legislature.\u201d In seeking to ascertain legislative intent, we first look to the words of the statute, viewing them \u201cin ordinary terms, in their natural meaning, in the manner in which they are most commonly understood.\u201d \u201cWhere the statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and simple meaning, courts do not normally look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent.\u201d Nor may a court under those circumstances add or delete language so as to \u201creflect an intent not evidenced in that language,\u201d or construe the statute with \u201c \u2018forced or subtle interpretations\u2019 that limit or extend its application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">We have acknowledged that in determining a statute\u2019s meaning, courts may consider the context in which a statute appears, including related statutes and, even when a statute is clear, its legislative history. We have cautioned, however, that this inquiry is \u201cin the interest of completeness, to look at the purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That inquiry, in other words, ... \u201cis a confirmatory process; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>it is not undertaken to contradict the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 140-43, 807 A.2d 32 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">1. \u00a7 <em>11-605 Does Not Apply to Inmates in State Correctional Facilities</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">We conclude that \u00a7 11-605 applies to inmates incarcerated in local, and not State, correctional facilities. The General Assembly expressly distinguishes between \u201cLocal Correctional Facilities\u201d and \u201cState Correctional Facilities\u201d throughout the Correctional Services Article. A \u201cLocal correctional facility\u201d is operated by \u201cone or more counties\u201d or \u201cby a municipal corporation,\u201d CS \u00a7 l-101(j), whereas a \u201cState Correctional Facility\u201d is operated by the State or, more specifically, the Division of Correction. CS \u00a7 1 \u2014 101(o)(l); CS \u00a7 9-103 (providing that a judge \u201cshall sentence\u201d an individual to the Division of Correction for an offense \u201cfor which a law requires the imprisonment be served at a specific State correctional facility.\u201d) The length of an inmate\u2019s sentence determines where the inmate is incarcerated. <em>See </em>CS \u00a7\u00a7 9-104 and 9-105 (providing sentencing ranges for local and State correctional facilities, respectively). Although the language of \u00a7 11-605, considered alone, does not refer to either local or State correctional facilities, its restrictive applicability is clear by virtue of its location within the Code, corroborated by its legislative history. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471 (1988) (\u201cWhen construing a provision that is part of a single statutory scheme, the legislative intent must be gathered from the entire statute, rather than from only one part.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Section 11-605 appears as part of Subtitle 6 within Title 11. Title 11 is captioned, \u201cLocal Correctional Facilities.\u201d <em>See Tidewater/Havre de Grace v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Havre de Grace, </em>337 Md. 338, 347, 653 A.2d 468 (1995) (stating \u201cthat the title of an act is relevant in ascertaining the legislative intent and purpose\u201d) (citations omitted). In addition, subtitle 6, the scope of which is expressly outlined in CS \u00a7 11-601, is applicable only to local correctional facilities. CS \u00a7 11-601 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section and Subtitle 7 of this title, this subtitle applies in all counties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">(b) <em>Montgomery County. </em>\u2014 This subtitle does not apply in Montgomery County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The language of \u00a7 11-605\u2019s sister statutes in Subtitle 6 reinforces this reading, as their provisions are directed at local correctional facilities. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 11-602 (titled \u201cEmployment\u201d and providing, in part, that \u201c[w]hen an individual is convicted of a crime and sentenced to a <em>local correctional facility, </em>the sentencing judge may allow the individual, to the extent possible, to continue the individual\u2019s regular employment ----\u201d) (emphasis added); \u00a7 11-603 (titled \u201cConfinement' when not working\u201d and providing that, \u201c[ujnless the court directs otherwise, an inmate shall be confined in the <em>local correctional facility </em>when: (1) not employed; and (2) between periods of employment.\u201d) (emphasis added); \u00a7 11-607 (titled \u201cExpenses of Managing Official,\u201d and providing that \u201c[t]he managing official of a <em>local correctional facility </em>shall receive an extra expense of mileage allowance as the local governing body determines for additional services provided under this subtitle.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Reviewing, in the \u201cinterest of completeness,\u201d the legislative history of 11-605 and its surrounding provisions, we arrive at the same conclusion. <em>See Chesapeake Amusements, Inc. v. Riddle, </em>363 Md. 16, 29, 766 A.2d 1036 (2001). The language of section \u00a7 11-605 is derived \u201cwithout substantive change\u201d from former Article 27, \u00a7 645N, which was originally enacted in 1959, along with \u00a7\u00a7 645K to 645S, under the subtitle \u201cEmployment of Prisoners.\u201d <em>See </em>Ch. 601 of the Acts of 1959. At that time, the provisions applied \u201conly in Harford and Anne Arundel County.\u201d Former Article 27, \u00a7 645S (predecessor to CS \u00a7 11-601). The stated purpose of the bill was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4E\">providing for the employment of prisoners held by Harford and Anne Arundel County during their detention, providing for their confinement when not employed, providing further for a diminution of their sentences, and relating generally to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the custody of prisoners in Harford and Anne Arundel County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">In 1998, the provisions were made applicable to almost all counties. See Ch. 508 of the Acts of 1998. In 1999, when the subtitle, along with other portions of Article 27, was recodified in the Correctional Services Article, its provisions applied to all counties, except Montgomery County. Ch. 54 of the Acts of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We presume \u201c[recodification] of statutes is ... for the purpose of clarity rather than change of meaning,\u201d <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Blanton, </em>390 Md. 528, 539, 890 A.2d 279 (2006) (citations omitted), and the Revisor\u2019s note to \u00a7 11-601 indicates as much:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">The provisions of former Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 645K through 645S, which are revised in this subtitle, set forth general rules governing work release for local correctional facilities. The provisions of former Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 546T through 645 MM, which are revised in Subtitle 7 of this title, set forth rules governing work release and other alternatives to incarceration in particular counties. All of these provisions were in the same subtitle in former Art. 27, which was entitled \u201cEmployment of Prisoners\u201d. Subsection (a) of this section clarifies that the general provisions of this subtitle do not apply when there are conflicting provisions in Subtitle 7 of this title relating to work release and other alternatives to incarceration in particular counties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Thus, the location of \u00a7 11-605 within the Code, corroborated by its legislative history, clearly indicates that the General Assembly intended for it to apply solely to local correctional facilities. Therefore, appellant, not being an inmate in a local correctional facility, had no statutory basis to petition the circuit court for diminution of his sentence under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">2. <em>Failure to Properly Present Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Even if the statute were applicable, appellant\u2019s contentions would fail. Maryland Rule 8-504(a)(7) requires that a brief contain, among other things, \u201c[t]he citation and verbatim text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>of all pertinent constitutional provisions, statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations.\u201d Appellant contends that he was entitled to a hearing and an elaboration of reasons for denial, but fails to cite any authority supporting these contentions in his brief. It is not this Court\u2019s responsibility to do so in his stead. <em>See Mathis v. Hargrove, </em>166 Md.App. 286, 318, 888 A.2d 377 (2005) (real estate broker did not cite authority for its argument that the contracting broker was an independent contractor, and thus, the argument would not be reviewed on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">3. <em>\u00a7 11-605 Does Not Require A Hearing or Explanation of Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Even if properly before us, and assuming \u00a7 11-605 were applicable, the plain language grants the circuit court discretion in determining whether to allow a diminution of an inmate\u2019s sentence and does not require the circuit court to hold a hearing or give a detailed explanation for its ruling. Section 11-605 provides that \u201cthe court <em>may </em>allow diminution\u201d (emphasis added). \u201c \u2018May' is generally interpreted as permissive, in contrast with \u2018shall,\u2019 which is interpreted as mandatory.\u201d <em>Livesay v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 1, 17, 862 A.2d 33 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Moreover, attempting to read into the statute conditions precedent, like a required hearing, is contrary to the canon of statutory construction <em>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius. See WFS Fin., Inc. v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>402 Md. 1, 14, 935 A.2d 385 (2007) (\u201c... Maryland has long accepted the doctrine of expressio (or inclusio) unius est exclusio alterius, or the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.\u201d) <em>{quoting Chow v. State, </em>393 Md. 431, 458, 903 A.2d 388 (2006) (citations omitted)). We note that the General Assembly requires an on-the-record hearing and decision under CS \u00a7 7-401 for parolees facing revocation of parole. <em>See also </em>CS \u00a7 7-502(b)(1) (affording inmates facing revocation of mandatory supervision the same due process rights that parolees have, including rights under \u00a7 7-401 to an on-the-record hearing and decision). If the General Assembly intended to impose similar conditions under \u00a7 11-605, the General Assembly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>could have inserted such requirements. It chose not to do so. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in exercising its discretion and declining to do either.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The Court is in receipt of a letter from appellant, dated January 13, 2010, in which he asks this Court to extend the time for filing a reply brief or, in the alternative, consider the contents of the letter. We have considered the contents of the letter, but it simply repeats appellant\u2019s contention that he was entitled to a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR REDUCTION OF SENTENCE AFFIRMED. APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-9\">. We distilled these questions from appellant\u2019s brief. Appellant\u2019s \"Question Presented\" only asks whether the circuit court erred by denying him \"an essential hearing\u201d prior to denying his motion. Nevertheless, appellant states, throughout his brief, that the circuit court also erred by failing to provide an explanation for the denial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\">. In its answer to appellant's motion, the State noted that Art. 27, \u00a7 645N had been repealed and reenacted as \u00a7 11-605 without substantive change. Appellant cited to \u00a7 11-605 in his brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-10\">. While he supplied a citation for the last term only, Art. 27, \u00a7 700A, it is apparent they were taken from former Article 27 of the Maryland Code. The State, in its answer to appellant's motion, noted the section \"was substantially reenacted\u201d in CS \u00a7 3-701.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\">. Notwithstanding the State\u2019s failure to challenge the applicability of \u00a7 11-605 before the circuit court, we shall address the issue pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131. The rule provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">(a) Generally. The issues of jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter and, unless waived under Rule 2-322, over a person may be raised in and decided by the appellate court whether or not raised in and decided by the trial court. Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQd\">Because the Rule employs the term \"ordinarily,\u201d it \"permits exceptions[,] and [appellate courts] have occasionally decided cases on issues not previously raised.\u201d <em>Taub v. State, </em>296 Md. 439, 463 A.2d 819 (1983); <em>See also Canaj, Inc. v. Baker &amp; Div. Phase III, </em>391 Md. 374, 383, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>893 A.2d 1067 (2006); <em>Jones v. State, </em>379 Md. 704, 713-714, 843 A.2d 778 (2004); <em>Crown Oil &amp; Wax Co. of Del., Inc. v. Glen Constr. Co. of Va., Inc., </em>320 Md. 546, 561, 578 A.2d 1184 (1990). Therefore, we shall consider whether \u00a7 11-605 is a potential source of relief to inmates incarcerated in State correctional facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\">. Appellant\u2019s characterization of the hearing denied to him as \"essential\u201d invites due process considerations; we need not opine on that issue, however, because we resolve the present case on non-constitutional grounds by holding that appellant has no right to relief under \u00a7 11-605. <em>See, e.g., Robinson v. State, </em>404 Md. 208, 217, 946 A.2d 456 (2008) (noting, \"it is this Court\u2019s established policy to decide a constitutional issue only when necessary\u201d). (Footnote continued ...) In any event, the discretionary language in 11-605 does not trigger due process protections. <em>See, e.g., Reese v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>177 Md.App. 102, 157, 934 A.2d 1009 (2007) (stating that \"discretionary statutory 'rights,' as compared to mandatory rights, do not create protected liberty or property interests under the Due Process clause.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
