Subsequently, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Appellant appeals both his convictions and the denial of his motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Appellant presents ten issues to this Court, which we have consolidated, reworded and re-ordered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">I. Did the trial court err in prohibiting appellant from introducing evidence of the State\u2019s only eyewitness\u2019s prior convictions for crimes of violence to demonstrate his allegedly violent propensities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">II. Did the trial court err in preventing appellant from cross-examining the State\u2019s only eyewitness about his failure to register as a sex offender in Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">III. Did the trial court err in permitting the State to elicit a hearsay statement that appellant was \u201clooking for a fight,\u201d as a present sense impression?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">IV. Did the trial court err in failing to declare a mistrial when a State\u2019s witness testified that appellant was \u201chostile\u201d on the telephone after the witness had been specifically instructed not to make such a statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">V. Did the trial court err in failing to sustain appellant\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s allegedly improper remark made in its opening statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">VI. Did the trial court err in failing to declare a mistrial based upon the State\u2019s allegedly improper remarks made in its closing argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">VII. Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">The first issue is not preserved for appellate review. We answer the remaining questions in the negative and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Appellant, who was, at that time, a Prince George\u2019s County-police officer, and his wife, Stacey Washington (\u201cMrs. Washington\u201d), purchased a bed from Mario Furniture which was delivered to their Accokeek, Maryland residence in December, 2006. The bed rails, however, were defective and either appellant or Mrs. Washington requested replacements. Mario agreed to do so and arrangements were made to deliver the new bed rails on January 24, 2007, between 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Appellant took off from work to be at home when the delivery arrived. When the bed rails were not delivered during the specified time frame, appellant called Mario to inquire about the delivery. After several phone calls, appellant was notified that the rails would be arriving around 7:30 p.m. At about that time, Brandon Clark (\u201cClark\u201d) and Robert White (\u201cWhite\u201d), two furniture deliverymen, arrived at the Washington residence with the bed rails. Appellant met Clark at the door. Unbeknownst to Clark or White, appellant had a handgun tucked into his waistband. White and Clark, accompanied by appellant, carried the bed rails to the master bedroom on the second floor. They were alone; Mrs. Washington and the Washington\u2019s six year old daughter were having dinner in the first floor kitchen. A few minutes later, appellant shot both Clark and White. White was severely injured and Clark died nine days later from complications related to his wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">After an investigation by the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, a grand jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County indicted appellant on twelve counts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">Count I second degree felony murder (Brandon Clark);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">Count II second degree specific intent to kill murder (Brandon Clark);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">Count III second degree specific intent to do serious bodily harm murder (Brandon Clark);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">Count IV second degree depraved heart murder (Brandon Clark)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">Count V voluntary manslaughter (Brandon Clark);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Count VI involuntary manslaughter \u2014 grossly negligent act (Brandon Clark);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">Count VII involuntary manslaughter \u2014 unlawful act (Brandon Clark);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">Count VIII first degree assault (Brandon Clark);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">Count IX use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence (Brandon Clark);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">Count X attempted second degree murder (Robert White);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">Count XI first degree assault (Robert White);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">Count XII use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence (Robert White).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Prior to appellant\u2019s trial, White filed a civil action against appellant and Prince George\u2019s County seeking $400,000,000 in damages arising out of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">Appellant\u2019s trial was preceded by <em>in limine </em>motions filed by both the State and appellant pertaining to evidentiary matters. Several of the trial court\u2019s rulings on these motions are pertinent to the issues raised on appeal and we will discuss them below.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">While a detailed description of the evidence presented at trial is not necessary for this opinion, we will summarize the testimony of White, on the one hand, and appellant and Mrs. Washington, on the other, to illustrate the contrast in their versions of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">According to the State, the shootings were unprovoked and unjustified. The State introduced evidence from an employee of Mario who had spoken to appellant earlier in the day to the effect that appellant was angry and hostile over the telephone. White testified that, upon arriving at appellant\u2019s resident, Clark went up to the front door and talked to appellant, while White stayed in the delivery truck. White recounted that, when Clark came back to the truck to get the bed rails, he told White that appellant was \u201clooking for a fight.\u201d White then testified as to his version of what then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-15\">[THE WITNESS]: When we went inside, he direct [sic] us to a bedroom upstairs. I was walking first, in front of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Brandon. Brandon was walking behind me. He was behind Brandon, and he directed us to a bedroom upstairs. We went in, we set the rails down, and then Mr. Washington started arguing with Brandon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">[THE STATE]: And what was Mr. Washington arguing with Brandon about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">[THE WITNESS]: Because, I guess, we got to his house late, and he was upset because he was waiting to his house all day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">[THE STATE]: Go ahead and tell us what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">[THE WITNESS]: So Brandon kneeled down \u2014 I\u2019m standing on the other side, close to the railing, Brandon at the bed, and he ask Mr. Washington why you disassemble your bed, and he said \u2014 this was his words \u2014 \u201cMotherfucker, are you telling me what to do in my house?\u201d I said, \u201cBrandon, do you know Mr. Washington?\u201d Brandon said no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">So it was a few seconds later he pushed Brandon and told Brandon to get the fuck out of his house. I said, \u201cBrandon, I think we should go.\u201d Brandon said, \u201cNo, just let me do my job. It\u2019s only going to take ten minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">Brandon kneeling again \u2014 he\u2019s still kneeling. Mr. Washington pushed him again, \u201cGet the fuck out of my house,\u201d and the third time he pushed him, he pushed him until he was actually laying on his side. Brandon jump up. I told Brandon, \u201cThat\u2019s it; we out of here.\u201d I stepped between both of them, Mr. Washington and Brandon, Brandon going back out the door with his hands up. I got my back to Mr. Washington, and all I heard was shots after we got out of the room. He said, \u201cI know how to get you the fuck out my house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-11\">[THE STATE]: After you heard the shots, what did you do; what did you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-12\">[THE WITNESS]: Brandon was going back towards the stairs, and I grabbed Brandon to keep him from falling down the stairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>I had to lay him down, and as I ask him where the cell phone at, when I turn around, I hear more shots. Then I realized I was hit .... [i]n the chest and in the stomach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-4\">I didn\u2019t want to go down the stairs because he already shot me. So I moved up, to move away from Brandon, ... and I laid down here [pointing to a diagram], down on this side. Mr. Washington went back in his room. I got back up because I knew I needed help. When I got back up, he comes out of his room and he said, \u201cMotherfucker, didn\u2019t I told you to stay down,\u201d and he starts shooting again. That\u2019s when I realized I was hit in the knee. I went down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">[THE STATE]: You went down. Then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">[THE WITNESS]: We laid there screaming, asking him to help us, to call somebody, and he said he wasn\u2019t calling nobody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In contrast, appellant and Mrs. Washington testified that appellant had acted in self-defense. Appellant testified that when Clark and White arrived at appellant\u2019s home he instructed them to put the bed rails in the foyer, but they carried them to the master bedroom instead. Appellant led Clark and White to the master bedroom, but when he got there, he noticed that White was no longer following. When appellant asked Clark about White\u2019s whereabouts, Clark \u201cbackslapped\u201d appellant twice in the chest and told him \u201cI got him, Shorty.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant then saw White coming out of appellant\u2019s daughter\u2019s bedroom. When appellant told White to get out of his daughter\u2019s bedroom, Clark again responded with \u201cI told you, Shorty, I got him.\u201d Appellant told Clark and White to leave his house. After appellant told Clark and White for the third time to leave his house, Clark responded that appellant need<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ed to watch how he talked to people. Appellant again demanded that Clark and White leave. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0a\">[APPELLANT]: Mr. White punched me on the side of the face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What did Mr. Clark do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3\">[APPELLANT]: When he punched me, Mr. Clark punched me in the back of the head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What did you do after Mr. White punched you and Mr. Clark punched you in the back of the head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">[APPELLANT]: When he punched me, I swung around with my hand, and I just covered up because I couldn\u2019t stop them. They were on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What position was your body in when you said you tried to cover up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">[APPELLANT]: I was like this, covering up my head and my face and I was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: At this time, Your Honor, I\u2019d ask Mr. Washington to step down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">[THE COURT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">(Witness steps down from witness stand.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You can stand in front of the jury. Now, Mr. Washington, you said you attempted to cover up, and you described the position of your body. Can you let the ladies and the gentlemen of the jury know, after Mr. Clark and Mr. White hit you, what you did physically?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ2\">[APPELLANT]: Yeah. I swung around, with my hand like that, and they were on me and they was \u2014 I was covering up, like this, trying to protect my head and my face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And at that point, where is Mr. Clark and Mr. White?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-15\">[APPELLANT]: Mr. Clark is right here to my left, and Mr. White is right here to my right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And what are they doing at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>[APPELLANT]: They were hitting me and kicking me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab\">Appellant went on to testify that he shot Clark and White in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Mrs. Washington testified that she heard appellant, White and Clark going upstairs with the bed rails. She continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A20\">I didn\u2019t hear anything for a little while, and then I heard my husband say, \u201cGet out of my house; leave my house; get out now,\u201d and that\u2019s the next thing I heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And once you heard your husband say those words, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">[MRS. WASHINGTON]: I got up. I told [K.] [appellant\u2019s and Mrs. Washington\u2019s six year old daughter] \u2014 I told [K.] to stay put, to don\u2019t move, and that\u2019s when I got up. And I got up to go see what was wrong, because I could tell something was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay Ms. Washington. You stated that you were walking from the kitchen as you were peering up the stairs. What did you see when you looked upstairs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">[MRS. WASHINGTON]: That\u2019s when I saw Keith bent over, and these two men were on either side of him and they were beating him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And when you looked up and saw that, what did you do? And you can take your time, Mrs. Washington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">[MRS. WASHINGTON]: I was walking into the hallway and, as I was coming around through the hallway, I looked up and then I could see them, him in the middle, and he was kind of bent over, and then there was one man on either side of him, and they were beating him. And I thought oh, my god; oh, my god; they\u2019re just going to beat him to death, because he was just kind of bent over and he couldn\u2019t do anything. And I thought, okay, I need to help him; I need to help him. And so I was going to start up the steps. And as I was getting ready to start up the steps, I was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>thinking what if something happens to me, what is [K.] going to do? I didn\u2019t want her to come in here \u2014 (crying).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">^ ij;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Ms. Washington, I think where we were, you were about to describe \u2014 I\u2019ll just ask you the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">As you looked upstairs, as you\u2019re leaving the kitchen, where were the deliverymen positioned with respect to where your husband, Keith Washington, was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">[MRS. WASHINGTON]: He was bent over, and there was one man on either side of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I believe you said that you were at the bottom of the stairs. At that point, when you looked upstairs and you were at the bottom of the stairs, what did you say or do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">[MRS. WASHINGTON]: The first thing I thought was, my god; oh, my god, I need to help him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">s-j \u2756 H\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">[MRS. WASHINGTON]: As I started to go up the steps, that\u2019s when I knew I couldn\u2019t help him. And then I was going to call 911. (Crying.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">After the shootings, Mrs. Washington called 911. Appellant joined in the call. The State played a recording of the call to the jury. The State introduced forensic evidence regarding the gunshots. The evidence could support the conclusion that at least one of the gunshots was fired from a distance of four feet or more, while the other gunshots were at closer range. A DNA analysis of appellant\u2019s handgun indicated that both appellant\u2019s and White\u2019s DNA was present on it. The State also presented the testimony of an emergency room physician who treated appellant on the night of the shooting. She did not observe any trauma to appellant\u2019s neck or face. She also testified that the X-rays taken of appellant were negative, indicating no fractures. The emergency room nurse who examined appellant that night gave similar testimony. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>further corroborate the physician\u2019s testimony, the State also introduced a photograph of appellant taken before he was transported to the hospital, which did not reveal any indication of significant injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Appellant called other witnesses who had been present at the Washington residence after the shootings. They testified that appellant\u2019s face appeared puffy or swollen on the night of the shooting and that appellant was holding an ice pack to his face before being transported to the hospital. The appellant called a forensic pathologist who testified that, in his opinion, White\u2019s testimony was not consistent with evidence regarding his injuries and Clark\u2019s autopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">On February 13, 2008, the jury convicted appellant of involuntary manslaughter-unlawful act (Brandon Clark), two counts of first degree assault (Brandon Clark and Robert White), two counts of use of a handgun in commission of a felony or crime of violence (Brandon Clark and Robert White), and attempted second degree murder (Robert White), and acquitted him of all remaining counts. Appellant was sentenced on May 27, 2008, to a total of 45 years incarceration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from those convictions on May 30, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">On August 25, 2008, appellant filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied on November 21, 2008. Appellant filed a timely notice appealing that judgment on December 2, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Additional facts will be discussed as necessary in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Did the Trial Court Err in Prohibiting Appellant from Introducing Evidence of White\u2019s Prior Convictions to Demonstrate His Allegedly Violent Propensities?</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Before this Court, appellant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">Prior to trial, counsel for [appellant] discovered that White, the State\u2019s only eyewitness, had 11 prior convictions and received at least one significant period of incarceration (a fact that helped explain why the witness had no convictions between 1995 and 2005). In support of his self-defense theory at trial, Mr. Washington sought to introduce White\u2019s prior convictions to attack White\u2019s credibility and to show bias, and because the probative value of his convictions far outweighed any prejudicial effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">* * * Hi * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">In response, Mr. Washington argued that, given the nature of Mr. White\u2019s prior convictions, the convictions were highly relevant to White\u2019s credibility. The defense asserted multiple theories of admissibility, specifically claiming that the convictions were admissible under (1) the United States Constitution, (2) Md. Decl. of Rights art. 21, and (3) Md. Rule 5-609. Moreover, White\u2019s convictions were evidence of bias____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">The trial court committed reversible error. Because White\u2019s convictions for aiming a firearm, assault and battery, assault with intent to commit a sexual offense, and domestic violence are relevant to the issue of first aggressor status, their exclusion was improper....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Asserting that White\u2019s status as the initial aggressor was an \u201cessential element\u201d to his claim of self-defense, and relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>Hemingway v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 127, 548 A.2d 879 (1988)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, and Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 9-115, appellant contends that he was entitled to introduce White\u2019s prior convictions to prove White\u2019s violent nature. Such evidence, appellant argues, would be relevant to appellant\u2019s assertion that White and Clark were the first aggressors. Appellant\u2019s argument was not presented to the trial court and, as such, is not subject to review by this Court in this proceeding. We will explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\n<em>A.

Competency of Trial Counsel.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">As an alternate ground for appellate relief, appellant argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to preserve the issue for appellate review. Conceding that \u201cclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel are usually limited to post conviction proceedings\u201d as opposed to direct appeals, appellant argues that this Court should consider the ineffective assistance of counsel issue. Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">The record in this case makes clear the following: (1) trial counsel strenuously argued for the admission of White\u2019s criminal convictions; and (2) there is a mountain of case law on admissibility of such convictions in the self-defense context. From that vantage point, it is clear that, if the argument was not preserved for appeal, (1) it was not a strategy of trial counsel to not argue what was perhaps the most likely route to the admissibility of the convictions, and (2) trial counsel committed a serious error in not making the argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate that (1) \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and (2) \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Courts employ two presumptions, first, that trial counsel was compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>tent, and, second, that \u201cthe challenged action might, under the circumstances, be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 283, 681 A.2d 30 (1996). Generally, the appropriate avenue for the resolution of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a post-conviction proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\">By having counsel testify and describe his or her reasons for acting or failing to act in the manner complained of, the post conviction court is better able to determine intelligently whether the attorney\u2019s actions met the applicable standard of competence. Where, as here, the record sheds no light on why counsel acted as he did, direct review by this Court would primarily involve \u201cthe perilous process of second-guessing,\u201d perhaps resulting in an unnecessary reversal in a case where sound but unapparent reasons existed for counsel\u2019s actions. Consequently, we leave consideration of [the defendant\u2019s] ineffective representation claim to the circuit court upon post conviction proceeding where there can be a studied evaluation of a proper record should appellant choose to pursue the matter.

The attorney admitted to the error, <em>id., </em>and there was no question as to his motivation. There was no suggestion that trial tactics, or anything other than a simple mistake, lay behind trial counsel\u2019s action. Since the attorney admitted his mistake to the trial court, there was no need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the Court of Appeals to exercise the deference traditionally given to trial counsel with regard to tactical decisions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In <em>Smith, </em>the trial transcript clearly established that trial counsel disclosed privileged attorney-client communications to the trial court. 394 Md. at 192, 905 A.2d 315. The Court of Appeals stated that since \u201cwe can conceive of no circumstances that would require Smith\u2019s counsel to reveal the substance of his advice to the court.... [W]e conclude that a collateral evidentiary hearing concerning Smith\u2019s counsel\u2019s disclosure would be superfluous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 905 A.2d 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The case before us is different. Unlike <em>Parris W., </em>there was no admission of error by trial counsel; in contrast to <em>Smith, </em>there was no clear and unambiguous breach of a lawyer\u2019s responsibility to a client. In the instant case, appellant\u2019s appellate counsel have identified a trial strategy that they believe should have been pursued at trial. The failure to do so may have been a matter of lawyerly dereliction or may have reflected a tactical consideration by trial counsel. Upon the record presented to us, we can only speculate. Under these circumstances, the appropriate avenue for the resolution of the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a post-conviction proceeding. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. at 435, 439 A.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Did the Trial Court Err in Preventing Appellant from Cross-Examining White about White\u2019s Failure to Register as a Sex Offender in Maryland?</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">In 1995, White was convicted in South Carolina of assault with intent to commit sexual conduct. As such, he was required to register as a sexual offender with the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services within fourteen days of commencing employment in Maryland. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann.Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-705(b)(3)(i) (2008). White had been delivering furniture in Maryland for approximately three weeks prior to the events at appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>residence and had not registered as a sexual offender in Maryland at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Prior to trial, appellant filed a motion <em>in limine </em>requesting permission to cross-examine White as to his failure to register. Appellant advanced four bases for admissibility regarding White\u2019s failure to register: (1) to expose a motive to lie and/or bias in light of circumstantial evidence that White expected a \u201cdeal\u201d from the State regarding his failure to register in exchange for his testimony against appellant; (2) to expose a motive to lie and/or bias in light of his pending civil action against appellant and Prince George\u2019s County because a conviction would virtually guarantee a \u201cwin\u201d for White in his civil action; (3) as a prior act that is probative of untruthfulness, pursuant to Md. Rule 5 \u2014 608(b); and (4) to impeach White\u2019s credibility in light of his sex offender status because the jury may have disbelieved White\u2019s testimony if it was aware that White was a convicted sex offender, and according to appellant, was found in appellant\u2019s daughter\u2019s bedroom. The trial court held a hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">At the hearing, the State represented, without contradiction, that no offer had been made to White regarding his failure to register as a sex offender. The State also called White as a witness. On direct examination, he testified that he was aware that he could be charged for failing to register, that the Prince George\u2019s County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office would determine whether he was to be charged, and that a favorable assessment of his criminal trial testimony by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office might affect its decision whether to charge him. On cross-examination, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Mr. White, it is your expectation that if the State views your testimony, in a trial against Mr. Washington, favorably, that they will consider that in the decisions they make about whether or not to charge you with failing to register in the State of Maryland as a sex offender, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">[THE WITNESS]: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>H&lt; % H&lt; H&lt; # \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It is your expectation, Mr. White, that if the State views your testimony at Mr. Washington\u2019s trial as favorable, that they might consider that when making decisions, if you were prosecuted, about what kind of plea offer you might receive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">[THE WITNESS]: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">Hi H\u00ab H* H? H\u00ab H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What are you saying you expect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">[THE WITNESS]: I don\u2019t know what they going to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Z\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: My question to you is not what you know about what they\u2019re going to do, but what your expectation is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">The question is, is it your expectation that if the State views your testimony in the trial of Mr. Washington favorably, that they would consider that in deciding whether or not you\u2019ll get prosecuted for failing to register as a sex offender?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">[THE WITNESS]: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You don\u2019t know what your expectation is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">[WITNESS]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-14\">[THE COURT]: Okay. The exact nature of your motion in this instance was a motion in limine ... for permission to elicit, on cross-examination, Robert White\u2019s failure to register as a sex offender in Maryland, that it be admissible as a motive to falsify testimony in order to curry favor with the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-15\">I\u2019ve read the <em>Ware [v. State, </em>348 Md. 19, 67, 702 A.2d 699 (1997)] case. I\u2019ve read the <em>Ebb [v. State, </em>341 Md. 578, 587, 671 A.2d 974 (1996)] case. I\u2019ve gone over other cases, as well, on this specific issue, and believe that, in this instance, the <em>Ebb </em>case is dispositive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>My understanding of Mr. White\u2019s testimony and the proffer made by the State at the bench, which was accepted by the defense, was that no offer whatsoever was made by the State to Mr. White in the instance of his failure to register as a sex offender in the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">I heard Mr. White\u2019s testimony, and what he did say was he did not know what the [Sjtate\u2019s [Ajttorney\u2019s office was planning and that he had not thought about it, didn\u2019t know what to expect. To me, that is fairly clear that he was saying that, again, no offer was made to him by the State, and he had no expectation of what to think was going to happen or any expectation of leniency on behalf of anything that he did testify or otherwise in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">Secondarily, if you look in evaluating the probative value versus the prejudicial value of your ability to do that in front of a jury, I believe any probative value of that, in terms of what he said as to expectation, is far outweighed by the prejudicial impact that it would have on a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">I\u2019ve made another ruling about the offense for which he was convicted and for which he did not register in Maryland, and I weighed that similarly; that in the State of Maryland, based on my understanding of the current state of the law, I did not believe that offense was relevant to the issue of credibility, and I cited the cases and my reasons to do so and, in fact, that the probative value of such a conviction, when weighing all of the elements of it versus the prejudicial impact that it would have on the jury, was similarly situated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">And this, my compliments to you on your legal acumen and your four-pronged attack on the purpose of the sexual registration, but I feel that it falls short in this instance and am going to deny your motion and not permit you that cross-examination in this aspect in front of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">On appeal, appellant advances only two of the grounds asserted at the trial court level: first, appellant argues that he should have been permitted to cross-examine White to show bias or a motive to lie in exchange for favorable treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>from the State; and second, evidence of White\u2019s failure to register was admissible under Rule 5-608(b) as a prior act probative of truthfulness. We will discuss each ground separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\n<em>A. Bias or Motive to Testify Falsely.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Maryland Rule 5-616(a)(4) permits witnesses to be impeached by proof that \u201ca witness is biased, prejudiced, interested in the outcome of the proceeding, or has a motive to testify falsely.\u201d The rule is a reflection of one aspect of the guarantee contained in both the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights of a defendant\u2019s right in a criminal case to confront the witnesses against him. <em>Ebb v. State, </em>341 Md. 578, 587, 671 A.2d 974 (1996); <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>320 Md. 300, 306-08, 577 A.2d 356 (1990). <em>See also Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974). However, trial courts retain</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab7\">\u201cwide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\"><em>Ebb, </em>341 Md. at 587, 671 A.2d 974 (quoting <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) and citing <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>320 Md. 300, 307, 577 A.2d 356 (1990)). Decisions of the Court of Appeals have established that, where the charge of bias stems from the pendency of criminal charges against a witness, courts should hold an evidentiary hearing outside the presence of the jury to permit the parties to address factors pertaining to the issue whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>Ebb, </em>341 Md. at 591, 671 A.2d 974; <em>Jackson v. State, </em>340 Md. 705, 717, 668 A.2d 8 (1996); <em>Watkins v. State, </em>328 Md. 95, 99, 613 A.2d 379 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">As we have discussed, the trial court conducted such a hearing and determined that no offer had been made by the State to White, and that White had neither an expectation as to what the State might do regarding charges against him, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>an expectation of leniency in return for his testimony. The trial court determined that danger of prejudice generated by permitting appellant to cross-examine White regarding the failure to register as a sex offender outweighed its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in relying on <em>Ebb. </em>In that case, the Court of Appeals considered whether the trial court abused its discretion in precluding the cross-examination of Timmons and Allen, two prosecution witnesses, with regard to criminal charges pending against them. 341 Md. at 586, 671 A.2d 974. In holding that there was no error, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">As a general rule, pending criminal charges are not admissible to impeach a witness. An exception to that rule, however, is when the pending charges are offered to show bias, prejudice or motive of the witness in testifying. In determining whether to admit the evidence, the judge must engage in a balancing test giving wide latitude to cross-examine for bias or prejudice but not permitting the questioning \u201cto stray into collateral matters which would obscure the trial issues and lead to the factfinder\u2019s confusion.\u201d The trial judge is in the best position to balance the probative value of the unrelated pending charges against the prejudicial effect and to decide when their admission would enmesh the trial in confusing or collateral issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">On voir dire, Timmons and Allen testified that the State had not offered and that they did not expect leniency in exchange for their testimony. They denied any expectation of leniency in return for their testimony and there was no basis for any expectation of leniency....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">s\u00ed? ;|s ^4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">In determining the admissibility of the evidence, the trial judge considered the testimony of the witnesses, i.e., that they were not offered and did not expect leniency. He made a preliminary finding that based on the denial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>witnesses and the uncontroverted representation of the prosecutor that there was no offer of leniency, there was a complete lack of probative value or that the value for impeachment was so slight as to be overcome by the probability that the testimony would be unduly prejudicial or confusing to the jury. This we believe, is a proper matter for the trial court\u2019s discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><em>Id. </em>341 Md. at 588-591, 671 A.2d 974 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Appellant attempts to distinguish <em>Ebb </em>on the basis that the witnesses in that case affirmatively denied expecting anything in return for their testimony, 341 Md. at 583, 671 A.2d 974, whereas White \u201cequivocated multiple times.... Such ... hesitant response[s] could not possibly dismiss any fear of White\u2019s bias and/or motive to lie. In light of White\u2019s dubious response, the trial court erred in preventing [appellant] from cross-examining White on this matter in the presence of the jury.\u201d Appellant\u2019s argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">White\u2019s testimony established, to the satisfaction of the trial court, that the State had made no offer to White and, in the words of the trial court, that White had \u201cno expectation of what to think was going to happen or any expectation of leniency....\u201d Certainly implicit in the trial court\u2019s finding was an assessment of the credibility of White\u2019s testimony on the issue. Where, as in an <em>in limine </em>hearing, no jury is involved, we will not set aside a trial court\u2019s factual finding unless it is clearly erroneous and we give due regard to the trial court\u2019s ability to assess the credibility of witnesses. Maryland Rule 8-131(c). As Judge Moylan explained for this Court in <em>Morris v. State, </em>153 Md.App. 480, 837 A.2d 248 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">The most basic rule of appellate review of fact-finding is that of extending great deference to the fact finder, be it judge or jury. Appellate judges do not see or hear the witnesses or have the benefit of any sort of non-verbal communication. They are relatively far less able to assess credibility than are the fact finders on the scene. Appellate judges, moreover, are not immersed in the local context and do not get the sometimes inexpressible \u201cfeel\u201d of the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>They are relatively far less able to weigh the evidence than are the fact finders on the scene. The basic rule of fact-finding review, therefore, is that the appellate court will defer to the fact-findings of trial judge or jury whenever there is some competent evidence which, if believed and given maximum weight, could support such findings of fact. That is the prime directive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 489, 837 A.2d 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s finding that White had no expectation of leniency arising out of his testimony. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the prejudicial effect of evidence regarding White\u2019s failure to register as a sex offender outweighed any possible probative value. <em>Ebb, </em>341 Md. at 588, 671 A.2d 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\n<em>B. An Act \u201cProbative of Truthfulness.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Appellant also contends that evidence of White\u2019s failure to register was admissible under Rule 5-608(b) as a prior act probative of truthfulness, or, rather, the lack thereof. Rule 5-608(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">(b) Impeachment by examination regarding witness\u2019s own prior conduct not resulting in convictions. The court may permit any witness to be examined regarding the witness\u2019s own prior conduct that did not result in a conviction but that the court finds probative of a character trait of untruthfulness. Upon objection, however, the court may permit the inquiry only if the questioner, outside the hearing of the jury, establishes a reasonable factual basis for asserting that the conduct of the witness occurred. The conduct may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Appellant contends that \u201cWhite\u2019s failure to register as a sex offender was an act of deception and, as such, is an act that is probative of untruthfulness.\u201d He suggests that, since it was uncontroverted that White was required to register as a sex offender and had not done so, a \u201creasonable factual basis\u201d exists for an inquiry. Appellant also asserts that, if White had been convicted of failure to register as a sex offender, the conviction would likely have been admissible, pursuant to Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Rule 5-609, as a crime relevant to witness credibility because a failure to register necessarily involves an act of deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The crux of appellant\u2019s argument is that White\u2019s failure to register was effectively a series of misrepresentations to the State of Maryland and that act (or acts) of deception is probative of untruthfulness. Appellant seeks support in Maryland case law interpreting Rule 5-609, which pertains to the admissibility of evidence of prior crimes for impeachment purposes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant argues that in <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 713, 436 A.2d 906 (1981), the Court of Appeals held that the name of an impeachable offense, in the words of appellant, \u201cmust immediately communicate to the jury the past act the witness committed and must obviously and directly bear on the witness\u2019 credibility.\u201d Appellant continues that, if White had been convicted of failing to register, the conviction would \u201cmost likely have been admissible, pursuant to Md. Rule 5-609\u201d for impeachment purposes. Finally, appellant contends that the trial court erred in determining that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">For its part, the State argues that White\u2019s failure to register as a sex offender is not probative of truthfulness because \u201cthere may be any number of reasons for a person\u2019s failure to register\u201d and White, at the <em>in limine </em>hearing, did not testify as to why he had not registered out of a concern regarding his privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Both sides point to cases from other jurisdictions to support their contentions. The State cites <em>United States v. Montgom</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>ery, </em>390 F.3d 1013, 1016 (7th Cir.2004), <em>State v.

Barner, </em>374 Ill.App.3d 963, 313 Ill.Dec. 122, 871 N.E.2d 849 (2007), for the proposition that failure to register as a sex offender is not a crime reflecting upon a witness\u2019 credibility. We approach these cases with some degree of reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">All three courts were applying Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or substantively similar state rules. Fed.R.Evid. 609, and its state law equivalents, allows all convictions, regardless of their nature, having a maximum penalty of more than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>year\u2019s imprisonment, to be used to impeach a witness. If the witness is not a criminal defendant, the court utilizes a balancing test functionally equivalent to that set out in Maryland Rule 5-609(a)(2). If the witness is a criminal defendant, the balancing test focuses exclusively upon prejudicial effect to the defendant. <em>See </em>6 L. McLain Maryland Law of Evidence \u00a7 609.6 at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In contrast, under Maryland Rule 5-609(a), the \u201cuniverse of convictions,\u201d <em>State v. Giddens, </em>335 Md. 205, 213, 642 A.2d 870 (1994), that can be used to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility, is limited to \u201cinfamous crimes\u201d (common law felonies and the common law <em>crimen </em>falsi) and crimes that are relevant to the witness\u2019 credibility. <em>State v. Westpoint, </em>404 Md. 455, 478, 947 A.2d 519 (2008); <em>Jackson v. State, </em>340 Md. 705, 712-13, 668 A.2d 8 (1995). In order to fall into the second category:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">the crime itself, by its elements, must clearly identify the prior conduct of the witness that tends to show that he is unworthy of belief. Moreover, a crime tends to show that the offender is unworthy of belief, if the perpetrator \u201clives a life of secrecy\u201d and engages in \u201cdissembling in the course of [the crime], being prepared to say whatever is required by the demands of the moment, whether the truth or a lie.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABl\"><em>Westpoint, </em>404 Md. at 484, 947 A.2d 519 (internal citations omitted) (quoting <em>Giddens, </em>335 Md. 205, 642 A.2d 870).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>With this distinction in mind, we turn to the specific cases cited by the State. <em>Young </em>did not address the admissibility of a conviction for failure to register; the court simply noted in passing that the trial court excluded evidence of a conviction for failure to register, \u201cfinding that it was not a crime of dishonesty under [South Carolina Rule of Evidence] 609(a)(2), and that although the crime was punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year, the prejudicial effect of the conviction outweighed its probative value....\u201d <em>Young, </em>661 S.E.2d at 388 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">In <em>Montgomery, </em>the defendant had six prior felony convictions including one for unlawful failure to register as a sex offender. 390 F.3d at 1016. The District Court found that, with the exception of an obstruction of justice conviction, none of the convictions went to the defendant\u2019s truthfulness but admitted all six for impeachment purposes nonetheless. On appeal, the defendant argued that the District Court erred by doing so; in determining that the District Court did not abuse its discretion, the Circuit Court of Appeals did not single out the failure to register conviction for special analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In <em>Barner, </em>the defendant was tried in 2004 on rape charges. 374 Ill.App.3d at 964, 313 Ill.Dec. 122, 871 N.E.2d 849. The trial court permitted him to be impeached with a 1999 conviction for failure to register as a sex offender. <em>Id. </em>at 968, 313 Ill.Dec. 122, 871 N.E.2d 849. On appeal, the issue was not whether the failure to register conviction was probative of the defendant\u2019s credibility but rather whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the conviction because, by so doing, it permitted the prosecution to bring to the jury\u2019s attention that the defendant had a prior sex crime conviction. <em>Id. </em>The appellate court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, <em>id. </em>at 972, but, again, without discussing whether failure to register was relevant to the defendant\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>United States v. Easter, </em>66 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir.1995), is more instructive. In that case, the appellant argued that the District Court erred by not allowing the cross-examination of Oliver, a government witness, on the subject of his failure to register as a sex offender. The defendant argued that \u201cOliver\u2019s desire to avoid potential punishment for this failure could have furnished Oliver with a substantial motivation to testify for the [g]overnment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1022. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, holding that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in not permitting the cross-examination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">First, the Circuit Court of Appeals noted that the District Court permitted cross-examination on other matters that impeached Oliver\u2019s credibility. <em>Id. </em>In addition, the Circuit Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">Trial judges have \u201cwide latitude\u201d in determining the proper scope of cross examination. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986); <em>see also United States v. Lopez, </em>885 F.2d 1428, 1438 (9th Cir.1989) (\u201cbroad discretion\u201d).

In the present case, the potential prejudice of describing a witness as a sex offender, who has not registered as such, is obvious. The countervailing relevance, if any, was minimal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">A common thread through these cases, and the Maryland cases as well, is that, even if impeachment evidence is otherwise admissible, the trial court must also exercise its discretion to determine if the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-609(a); <em>Westpoint, </em>404 Md. at 478, 947 A.2d 519; <em>Giddens, </em>335 Md. at 214, 642 A.2d 870; <em>Fulp v.

White had registered in both South Carolina and the District of Columbia, where he was residing at the time. He had been working in Maryland for only three weeks prior to the incident giving rise to the charges against appellant. The trial court had ruled that the underlying crime (assault with intent to commit sexual conduct) that required White to register was not itself relevant to credibility under Maryland law. Additionally, the trial court permitted appellant to attack White\u2019s credibility through cross examination as to White\u2019s civil claim against appellant and Prince George\u2019s County as well as his prior convictions for grand larceny, receiving stolen goods, and first degree burglary. In light of these factors, the trial court determined that the prejudicial effect of permitting cross examination outweighed its probative value. We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling absent an abuse of discretion, <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 405, 697 A.2d 432 (1997) (citing <em>Hunt v.

The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">[THE STATE]: Robert White, I\u2019m proffering this, is going to testify that, when he was in the Mario truck out in front of [appellant\u2019s] home, Brandon Clark went to the door, met with [appellant], and Clark was able to see \u2014 or White was able to see that. And then he came back, Clark came back to the truck and said something to the effect of [\u201c]man, this guy is looking for a fight.[\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">Our position \u2014 of course, Brandon Clark can\u2019t be here to testify. He\u2019s unavailable. Our position is that it\u2019s a present sense impression. It was Brandon Clark\u2019s impression of [appellant] immediately after having contact with him, immediately after perceiving him and meeting with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3j\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, we object to it. First of all, there won\u2019t be cross-examination of Brandon Clark. So it is a statement that Robert White is allowed to make without any kind of cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">And there is two relevant layers of hearsay. First of all, what the statement actually is it\u2019s an interpretation \u2014 it comes from Robert White. There\u2019s no corroboration of it. But it\u2019s an interpretation \u2014 it\u2019s Brandon Clark\u2019s interpretation, his opinion about [appellant\u2019s] state of mind, and that\u2019s not admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">They argue it\u2019s a present sense impression, but it\u2019s really an opinion about an interaction about which we know nothing, and that\u2019s not admissible. And then relaying that to Mr. White doesn\u2019t make it admissible either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>THE COURT: I believe ... we have in this particular matter provided by the Maryland Rules 5 \u2014 803(b)(1), which gives present senses impression as a statement describing or explaining an event or condition, even while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition. This rule seems to be entirely consistent with the case law, and the declarant, without any motivation to falsify, described an event he is observing at that very moment or shortly thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">That appears to be the setting here. The State is proffering that the statement to be made was prior to any shooting that later occurred in the house. I believe that this falls squarely within the confines of <em>Booth versus </em>State,[306 Md. 313, 331, 508 A.2d 976 (1986),] ... as a present sense impression statement made by an unavailable declarant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">Hi <em>i'.i </em>H\u00ed Hi Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">I have weighed the impact of the statement, in terms of the probative value of it, balancing it against the possible prejudicial impact that it may have on the jury, and I find that the probative value far outweighs the prejudicial impact of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">THE COURT: [Y]ou\u2019re entitled, certainly, to cross-examine [White] about when that statement was made to him and all of the circumstances surrounding it, but I believe this is a classic present sense impression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And would we be also entitled to cross-examine him about the manner in which and the timing about when he brought that statement to light?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\">THE COURT: Well, that\u2019s certainly within your purview.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHI\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The jury returned to the courtroom and White took the stand and testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">[THE STATE]: Robert, on January 24th, do you remember, approximately, the time it was that you arrived to do the last delivery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>[THE WITNESS]: I\u2019m not sure what time it was.

Well, let\u2019s just leave.\u201d He said we couldn\u2019t do that; we have to call our supervisor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">Appellant did not object to White\u2019s response nor did he move to strike it. While appellant cross-examined White extensively, he did not ask him any questions regarding the circumstances surrounding Clark\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">On appeal, appellant contends that the statement was impermissible hearsay. In response, the State argues that the issue was not preserved for appellate review because appellant\u2019s trial counsel failed to object to the substance of White\u2019s response when White testified as to the hearsay statement. Alternatively, the State contends that White\u2019s testimony was admissible as a \u201cpresent sense impression\u201d pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(l). We conclude that, although the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>tion is a close one, appellant preserved the issue for appellate review. However, the trial court did not err in admitting the controverted testimony. We will address each issue separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\n<em>A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The issue here is whether appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s statement \u201cYour Honor, I object to the narrative here,\u201d coupled with his opposition to the State\u2019s <em>in limine </em>motion, was sufficient to preserve the issue of the admissibility of White\u2019s testimony regarding Clark\u2019s statement for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">As a general rule, when a court rules in an <em>in limine </em>proceeding that evidence is admissible, Rule 4-323(a) requires that the party opposed to admission object at the time the evidence is actually offered in order to preserve the issue for appellant review. <em>Reed v. State, </em>353 Md. 628, 639-40, 728 A.2d 195 (1999); <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 356-57, 535 A.2d 445 (1988) (interpreting predecessor rule). The Court of Appeals recognized an exception to the general rule in <em>Watson v. State, </em>311 Md. 370, 535 A.2d 455 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">In <em>Watson, </em>the defendant filed a motion <em>in limine </em>requesting the court to determine whether his prior convictions for attempted rape and theft were admissible to impeach his credibility in the event he testified. The court ruled that both convictions were admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 371-72, 535 A.2d 455. After the defendant completed his testimony on direct examination, the State informed the court that it intended to cross-examine the defendant on both convictions. The court reiterated its ruling that evidence of the attempted rape conviction was admissible and the defendant did not object to the State\u2019s questions on the subject. <em>Id. </em>at 372, 535 A.2d 455. The Court of Appeals held that the issue was preserved for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">In the case <em>sub judiee, </em>the trial judge ruled prior to trial on the motion <em>in limine </em>to admit Watson\u2019s prior convictions. Thus, standing alone, Watson\u2019s objection to the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling would be insufficient to preserve his objection for our review. However, the trial judge reiterated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>ruKng immediately prior to the State\u2019s cross-examination of Watson. It was during this cross-examination that the State elicited Watson\u2019s prior convictions. As we see it, requiring Watson to make yet another objection only a short time after the court\u2019s ruling to admit the evidence would be to exalt form over substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><em>Id. </em>311 Md. at 372, n. 1, 535 A.2d 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The <em>Watson </em>exception is a narrow one. <em>Reed, </em>353 Md. at 636 n. 4, 728 A.2d 195 <em>(\u201cWatson </em>was limited to its specific circumstances____\u201d); <em>see also Clemons v. State, </em>392 Md. 339, 362-63, 896 A.2d 1059 (2006) (issue of admissibility of scientific evidence preserved for appellate review pursuant to <em>Watson </em>when counsel stated grounds prior to voir dire examination of expert witness but did not restate them after examination was concluded).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The facts in the instant appeal are not fully analogous to <em>Watson. </em>In the case at bar, the trial court\u2019s ruling came before, not during, White\u2019s testimony and the trial court did not reiterate its ruling. However, appellant\u2019s counsel did object. Although counsel\u2019s objection did not expressly refer to the grounds asserted in the <em>in limine </em>hearing, that hearing had concluded only minutes before. The phrase \u201cthe narrative here\u201d can be interpreted to refer to the substance, as well as the style, of White\u2019s testimony. In light of the close temporal proximity between the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion <em>in limine </em>and White\u2019s testimony, we will resolve the ambiguity in favor of the appellant and consider the issue preserved for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Appellant presents us with alternative grounds to conclude that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that an unknown amount of time elapsed between Clark\u2019s conversation with appellant and Clark\u2019s statement to White that appellant was \u201clooking for a fight.\u201d In light of this, appellant argues that the trial court erred in determining that Clark\u2019s statement to White reflected a present sense impression:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Based on the record in this case, enough time elapsed for Clark to walk an unknown distance<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark> from the house to the van to speak with White. During that time, any number of things (that we can never know) may have crossed the declarant\u2019s mind, causing him to mislead his companion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_\">Appellant did not present the issue of lapse of time to the trial court. Since appellant raised specific contentions as to why the testimony was inadmissible, which did not include the issue of a possible lapse in time with the trial court, he is foreclosed from raising that issue for the first time on appeal. <em>Lee v. State, </em>186 Md.App. 631, 669, 975 A.2d 240 (2009); <em>State v. Jones, </em>138 Md.App. 178, 218, 771 A.2d 407 (2001) (\u201c[W]hen particular grounds for an objection are volunteered or requested by the court, \u2018that party will be limited on appeal to a review of those grounds and will be deemed to have waived any ground not stated.)\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Leuschner v.

State, </em>84 Md.App. 582, 588, 581 A.2d 439 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Appellant also contends that Clark\u2019s statement reflected not a present sense impression but rather an opinion as to appellant\u2019s state of mind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">Most significant to the analysis of the putative \u201cpresent sense impression\u201d in this case is the nature of Clark\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>statement. His statement was an opinion of [appellant\u2019s] state of mind. Moreover, although the words \u201che is looking for a fight\u201d suggest that Clark personally observed [appellant\u2019s] demeanor, it is impossible to verify on what basis Clark made his speculative opinion of [appellant\u2019s] state of mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The leading case in Maryland on the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule is <em>Booth v. State, </em>306 Md. 313, 508 A.2d 976 (1986). In <em>Booth, </em>the Court of Appeals surveyed previous Maryland cases, scholarly works and authority from other jurisdictions, <em>id. </em>at 317-23, 508 A.2d 976, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">As observed by the Advisory Committee to the Federal Rules, the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d and \u201cpresent sense impression\u201d exceptions \u201coverlap, though based on somewhat different theories.\u201d Advisory Committee Note, Fed.R.Evid. 803(1). The underlying rationale of the two exceptions are similar, <em>ie., </em>both preserve the benefit of spontaneity in the narrow span of time before a declarant has an opportunity to reflect and fabricate. We conclude that the \u201cpresent sense impression\u201d exception to the hearsay rule rests upon a firm foundation of trustworthiness, and we adopt it in the form in which it appears at Fed.R.Evid. 803(1).<footnotemark>[12]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\"><em>Id. </em>306 Md. at 324, 508 A.2d 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The Court proceeded \u201cto a consideration of practical problems that may be encountered in the application of this exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals identified three such problems:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">Initially, we consider the question of requisite spontaneity. Although statements offered under this exception will usually be those made at the time an event is being perceived, we recognize that precise contemporaneity is not always possible, and at times there may be a slight delay in converting observations into speech. However, because the presumed reliability of a statement of present sense impres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>sion flows from the fact of spontaneity, the time interval between observation and utterance must be very short. The appropriate inquiry is whether, considering the surrounding circumstances, sufficient time elapsed to have permitted reflective thought. <em>See </em>McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 298, at 862 (3d ed. E. Cleary 1984). In the words of Professor Jon Waltz, \u201cabsent some special corroborative circumstance, there should be no delay beyond an acceptable hiatus between perception and the cerebellum\u2019s construction of an uncalculated verbal description.\u201d Waltz, The Present Sense Impression Exception to the Rule Against Hearsay: Origins and Attributes, 66 Iowa L.Rev. 869, 880 (1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">306 Md. at 324, 508 A.2d 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">As we previously noted, the appellant failed to raise the issue of \u201crequisite spontaneity\u201d with the trial court. Moreover, as noted in footnote 11 of this opinion, a photograph of the exterior of the Washington residence taken on the night of the shootings shows the delivery van parked a short distance from the front door to the home. White testified that, when they arrived, \u201cBrandon gets out of the truck, goes up to talk to the customer, comes back and said,\u201d \u201cThe guy\u2019s looking for a fight.\u201d The journey back to the truck could not have taken more than a few seconds and there is nothing in White\u2019s testimony to suggest that Clark paused to reflect. While the sequence of events lacked the speed of the neurological process suggested by Professor Waltz, there was a \u201cspecial corroborative circumstance\u201d in this case; namely, White\u2019s own testimony as to appellant\u2019s state of mind, which was received shortly thereafter without objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">[THE WITNESS]: When we went inside, he direct [sic] us to a bedroom upstairs. I was walking first, in front of Brandon. Brandon was walking behind me. He was behind Brandon, and he directed us to a bedroom upstairs. We went in, we set the rails down, and then Mr. Washington started arguing with Brandon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">[THE STATE]: And what was Mr. Washington arguing with Brandon about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>[THE WITNESS]: Because, I guess, we got to his house late, and he was upset because he was waiting to his house all day.<footnotemark>[13]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The second issue identified in <em>Booth </em>was \u201cthe extent to which there must be proof that the declarant is speaking from personal knowledge before the statement may be admitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 508 A.2d 976. White\u2019s testimony established that Clark had direct knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The final problem identified in <em>Booth </em>concerned the manner in which the sense impression is conveyed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">An additional problem often encountered in the consideration of this exception to the hearsay rule is the tendency of a spontaneous declarant to characterize that which is being observed in language that involves, or often appears to involve, the opinion of the speaker. As we noted in <em>Ellsworth v. Sherne Lingerie, Inc., </em>303 Md. 581, 609, 495 A.2d 348 (1985), the line between \u201cfact\u201d and \u201copinion\u201d is often difficult to draw. A statement that at first blush appears to represent the opinion of the speaker may prove upon more careful analysis to be non-judgmental in character, or it may represent a shorthand rendition of facts. Additionally, we recognize that evidence which enjoys a significant presumption of reliability, and which may be of significant assistance to the trier of fact in arriving at the truth of the matter may be lost if it is excluded because perceptions are cast in opinion form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\"><em>Id. </em>306 Md. at 325, 508 A.2d 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">In the instant case, White testified that appellant \u201cwas looking for a fight.\u201d In <em>Booth, </em>the Court quoted with approval Professor Waltz\u2019s comment that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>If the out-of-court declaration is not the sort of conscious deduction which the conditions attaching to the present sense impression exception would themselves prohibit, it should be receivable as a shorthand fact description.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-5\"><em>Id. </em>306 Md. at 327, 508 A.2d 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We view the phrase \u201cthe guy\u2019s looking for a fight,\u201d uttered a few moments after the conclusion of a conversation, as being a \u201cshorthand fact description\u201d of appellant\u2019s demeanor.

During an <em>in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>camera </em>hearing to determine the admissibility of potentially hearsay statements that Robinson was expected to make, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\">[THE STATE]: But you spoke with Mr. Clark when you called him on the phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">ROBINSON: Yes, sir, I spoke with Brandon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">[THE STATE]: Now, with the information you received from Mario Dispatch Service, what did you say to Brandon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">ROBINSON: I told Brandon that you can go ahead and make the delivery now; you know, the liability won\u2019t fall back on us; we go ahead and just make the delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">[THE STATE]: What did Mr. Clark say to you in response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">ROBINSON: He was glad.

The first conversation was initiated by Clark, who called to inform him that \u201cthe paperwork [was] not adding up\u201d because the work order from Mario required him to pick up defective bed rails but there were no rails at appellant\u2019s house. Robinson testified that he told Clark that he would call him back. The following testimony ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\">[THE STATE]: Did you call Mr. Clark back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">[ROBINSON]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">[THE STATE]: What did you inform Mr. Clark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD2\">[ROBINSON]: I informed Mr. Clark that ... we can go ahead and make the delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">[THE STATE]: Did Mr. Clark say anything to you during this conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">[ROBINSON]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">[THE STATE]: What did Mr. Clark say to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">[ROBINSON]: He said that the situation was all messed up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">[THE STATE]: Did Mr. Clark further explain why the situation was all messed up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">[ROBINSON]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-12\">[THE STATE]: What did Mr. Clark say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-13\">[ROBINSON]: Mr. Clark said that it was, you know, that it was taking a long time just for a 15-minute set of bed rails and that, you know, the guy was pretty hostile\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-14\">[THE STATE]: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-15\">[DEFENSE]: Objection, Your Honor.

It was one statement, and I may be able to take care of that problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">[DEFENSE CO-COUNSEL]: We took every precautionary measure we could think of, Your Honor, to keep this from happening.

Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The record does not indicate that any juror approached the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Appellant argues that Robinson\u2019s testimony was so prejudicial that no curative instruction would have been adequate and that the trial court erred in not declaring a mistrial. He points to \u201cthe numerous and deliberate steps [that] were taken to prevent Robinson from testifying in regard to appellant\u2019s demeanor\u201d as proof of the unfairly prejudicial nature of Robinson\u2019s testimony. The State, while conceding that Robinson\u2019s testimony was prejudicial, asserts that the curative instruction was adequate and that the trial court did not err in denying the request for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">In <em>Wilson v. State, </em>148 Md.App. 601, 666, 814 A.2d 1 (2002), <em>cert. denied </em>374 Md. 84, 821 A.2d 371 (2003), we explained that the decision to declare a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">\u201cis committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Ordinarily, the exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed upon appeal absent a showing of prejudice to the accused.

Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>will not interfere with the trial judge\u2019s decision unless appellant can show that there has been real and substantial prejudice to his case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\"><em>Wilson, </em>148 Md.App. at 666, 814 A.2d 1 (citing <em>Carter, </em>366 Md. at 589, 785 A.2d 348 (in turn citing <em>Rainville, </em>328 Md. at 408, 614 A.2d 949)).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Robinson\u2019s testimony was a \u201cblurt\u201d or a \u201cblurt out\u201d\u2014 an abrupt and inadvertent nonresponsive statement made by a witness during his or her testimony. <em>See State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 277, 604 A.2d 489 (1992). There is a well established analytical framework for determining whether the prejudice to a defendant resulting from a \u201cblurt-out\u201d is \u201creal and substantial enough\u201d to warrant a mistrial. In <em>Rainville v. State, </em>328 Md. 398, 408, 614 A.2d 949 (1992), the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">In <em>Guesfeird [v. State, </em>300 Md. 653, 659, 480 A.2d 800 (1984)], the Court set forth the following factors to be considered in determining whether a mistrial is required:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX3\">whether the reference to [the inadmissible evidence] was repeated or whether it was a single, isolated statement; whether the reference was solicited by counsel, or was an inadvertent and unresponsive statement; whether the witness making the reference is the principal witness upon whom the entire prosecution depends; whether credibility is a crucial issue; [and] whether a great deal of other evidence exists....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\"><em>Id. </em>300 Md. at 659, 480 A.2d 800. In <em>Kosmas [v. State, </em>316 Md. 587, 560 A.2d 1137 (1989)], we made it clear that \u201cthese factors are not exclusive and do not themselves comprise the test.\u201d 316 Md. at 594, 560 A.2d 1137.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Every trial is different and the test articulated in <em>Guesfeird </em>is open-ended and fact-specific. We think it useful to consider how the test has been applied in a variety of factual contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\"><em>Guesfeird </em>and <em>Kosmas </em>are, in a sense, mirror images. <em>Guesfeird </em>involved a prosecution for the sexual abuse of a young teenage girl whose uncorroborated testimony was the sole basis for the prosecution. During the course of her direct examination, she testified that she had taken a lie detector <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>test. <em>Guesfeird., </em>300 Md. at 656, 480 A.2d 800. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, which was denied. The court then issued a cautionary instruction to the jury to disregard any reference to a lie detector test. Defense counsel objected to the instruction as well \u201cbecause of the emphasis it had created.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657, 480 A.2d 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><em>Kosmas </em>was another lie detector case. The defendant was accused of murdering his wife. There were no eyewitnesses and no physical evidence tying the defendant directly to the crime. The State\u2019s case consisted largely of the uncorroborated testimony of the victim\u2019s son, who stated that the defendant had repeatedly physically abused his mother, and the uncorroborated testimony of Mattson, a private detective who testified that the defendant had approached him about murdering the victim for money. The defendant denied murdering the victim, abusing her, and attempting to hire Mattson as a murderer. <em>Kosmas, </em>316 Md. at 588-91, 560 A.2d 1137. Mattson also testified that the defendant refused to take a polygraph test. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 560 A.2d 1137. As in <em>Guesfeird, </em>the trial court gave a cautionary instruction but denied a motion for a mistrial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed both convictions. In <em>Guesfeird,, </em>the Court stated that the victim\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">uncorroborated testimony conflicted directly with the testimony of the defendant and all the other witnesses. In this ease, credibility was the crucial issue for the jury. [The victim], who stated that she had taken a lie detector test, was ... the sole prosecution witness whose testimony supported the charges. The unavoidable inference for the jury to make is that if she took the test, she passed and was telling the truth at trial; otherwise, the prosecution would not have gone forward with her as the only witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-s\"><em>Guesfeird, </em>300 Md. at 666-67, 480 A.2d 800. In <em>Kosmas, </em>the Court first noted that, as Mattson was a retired Baltimore City police detective, \u201c[i]t seems highly likely that [Mattson] was aware that evidence concerning lie detectors was inadmissible, and it requires a generous nature to assume that his reference to the defendant\u2019s refusal to take a lie detector test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>was inadvertent.\u201d 316 Md. at 596, 560 A.2d 1137. The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">More important, however, are the questions of whether credibility of the defendant was a crucial issue in the case, and whether the strength of the State\u2019s case was otherwise such that the prejudice resulting from the improper admission of the evidence may be considered insubstantial. On the first issue, it is clear that the defendant\u2019s credibility was critical to the success of his case. Much of the strength of the State\u2019s circumstantial evidence case depended upon the jury believing that the defendant had repeatedly threatened and abused his wife, and had attempted to contract for her murder. The defendant adamantly denied the truth of those allegations. Informing the jury that the defendant had refused to take a he detector test cut to the heart of the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">\u00edJ\u00ed jfc \u2756 \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">We turn to the question of the weight of the other evidence against the defendant----Overall, it is fair to say that if [the victim\u2019s son] and Mattson are believed, the State has a strong circumstantial evidence case, but even then it is not overwhelming. If the defendant is believed in those areas in which his testimony conflicts with that of Michael and Mattson, the State\u2019s case is very weak. Again, then, it is apparent that the issue of the defendant\u2019s credibility is a central and crucial factor in this case, and the State\u2019s evidence that does not hinge at least in part upon the determination of that credibility is hardly of sufficient strength to permit us to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the inadmissible evidence did not in any way influence the verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\"><em>Id. </em>596-98, 560 A.2d 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">In <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 279, 604 A.2d 489 (1992), the Court considered the effect of two police officers\u2019 testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s interrogation. One witness testified that the defendant gave inconsistent versions of who committed a murder and, as a result,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>I went out of my office into Sergeant Bane\u2019s office and told him what had happened. He came back into the polygraph suite \u2014 (witness slapped hand on witness table) \u2014 I\u2019m sorry\u2014 came back into my office and said, told the Defendant that she was under arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 274, 604 A.2d 489. The other officer made a passing reference to the defendant\u2019s being \u201cin the area next to the polygraph room....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 604 A.2d 489. The trial court denied a motion for a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 276, 604 A.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">First noting that, in contrast to <em>Kosrnas, </em>the blurts were uttered \u201cwithout nefarious intent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 277, 604 A.2d 489, the Court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">The fundamental rationale in leaving the matter of prejudice vel non to the sound discretion of the trial judge is that the judge is in the best position to evaluate it. The judge is physically on the scene, able to observe matters not usually reflected in a cold record. The judge is able to ascertain the demeanor of the witnesses and to note the reaction of the jurors and counsel to inadmissible matters. That is to say, the judge has his finger on the pulse of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">Supporting the denial of the motion by the judge here was that the references to \u201cpolygraph\u201d were not solicited or pursued by the prosecutor. All that the officers voiced, without embellishment, was the taboo word \u201cpolygraph\u201d. Neither officer stated that Hawkins had taken a polygraph test or had expressed her willingness or unwillingness to take it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 278, 604 A.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">In <em>Rainville, </em>the defendant was charged with sexually molesting a child. In her testimony, the victim\u2019s mother inadvertently alluded to the fact that the defendant was in jail \u201cfor what he had done\u201d to another child. 828 Md. at 401, 614 A.2d 949. The trial court denied a motion for a new trial and gave a curative instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 402, 614 A.2d 949. The Court viewed the mother\u2019s statement as being particularly prejudicial to the defendant because the jury could have inferred from it that the defendant had molested another child. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>407, 614 A.2d 949. In light of the prejudice and several inconsistencies in the State\u2019s case and a lack of probative medical evidence, it was \u201cnot persuaded that the trial judge\u2019s curative instruction could be effective under the circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>410-11, 614 A.2d 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In applying the <em>Gnesfeird </em>factors to the instant case, Robinson\u2019s statement was isolated and we do not find that there is any indication that the prosecutor was intending to solicit Robinson\u2019s response. Robinson certainly was not the principal witness in the State\u2019s case. The degree of prejudice engendered by Robinson\u2019s testimony does not approach that found in <em>Guesfeird, Kosmas, </em>or <em>Rainville. </em>While credibility was a crucial factor in the case, the conflict was between the testimony of White on the one hand and appellant and Mrs. Washington on the other. Robinson\u2019s testimony neither enhanced nor detracted from the credibility of any of these witnesses. Unlike <em>Rainville, </em>Robinson did not indicate that appellant was guilty of a crime similar to which he was being tried. As to the strength of the State\u2019s case, there was corroborating evidence to support portions of White\u2019s testimony. The testimony of appellant and Mrs. Washington that appellant was attacked by White and Clark is inconsistent with evidence as to appellant\u2019s lack of injuries. Finally, the trial court took prompt corrective action with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">We bear in mind that the trial court is better equipped than we are to \u201cascertain the demeanor of the witnesses and to note the reaction of the jurors and counsel to inadmissible matters.\u201d <em>Hawkins, </em>326 Md. at 278, 604 A.2d 489. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Did the Trial Court Err in Failing to Sustain Appellant\u2019s Objection to the State\u2019s Allegedly Improper Remarks Made In Its Opening Statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">As part of its opening statement, the State addressed the fact that White\u2019s DNA was found on appellant\u2019s handgun. The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>[THE STATE]: We\u2019ll hear DNA testimony....

And, of course, his version is going to be different than what Robert White is going to tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">Before this Court, appellant argues:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">At the time the State remarked on [appellant\u2019s] failure to make a statement to the 911 dispatcher, about whether either victim attempted to grab his gun, the State was unaware of whether [appellant] planned to testify or to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. Without knowing whether [appellant] would testify, the State essentially promised the jury that it could disprove [appellant\u2019s] self-defense claim by proving, through [appellant\u2019s] failure to indicate otherwise on the 911 call, that neither victim attempted to grab [appellant\u2019s] gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-13\">The State is not permitted to comment on what a defendant may or may not testify to in its opening statement ... When the State makes such comments, it alludes to evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>dence that is only admissible as impeachment evidence, <em>if </em>the defendant elects to testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Appellant relies upon <em>Allen v. State, </em>318 Md. 166, 567 A.2d 118 (1989), to support his contention that the prosecutor could not have believed, in good faith, that he would have been able to put on evidence demonstrating that appellant \u201cnever said anything about anybody trying to grab his gun, hold his gun, have his gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In <em>Allen, </em>the Court of Appeals reversed a trial court\u2019s ruling allowing the prosecutor, in his opening statement, to say that the jury would hear from a witness about the witness\u2019 relationship with the defendant when the prosecutor and the trial court both knew that the witness would be invoking his right against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 179, 567 A.2d 118. <em>Allen </em>is inapposite to the facts presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">In the case <em>sub judiee, </em>the prosecutor in good faith expected to, and ultimately did, introduce the 911 recording during which appellant makes no mention of anyone trying to grab the handgun from him. The trial court did not err in overruling appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Did the Trial Court Err in Failing to Declare a Mistrial Based Upon the State\u2019s Allegedly Improper Remarks Made In Its Closing Argument?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Appellant asserts that the State repeatedly made improper and prejudicial statements in its closing argument. Appellant argues the statements either addressed facts not in evidence or generated unfair prejudice against him. In his brief, appellant points to twelve separate portions of the State\u2019s closing that he contends were improper. He contends that the trial court erred in not granting his motion for a mistrial based upon the cumulative effect of these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">In response, the State contends that the statements at issue, even taken cumulatively, were not prejudicial enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>warrant a new trial. In addition, the State argues that appellant failed to raise several of the controverted statements when it presented its motion for a mistrial and has not preserved his right to raise them on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We do not find the State\u2019s argument regarding preservation to be persuasive in this context. While the State is correct that appellant did not specifically mention each allegedly improper statement when he made his motion, appellant made it clear that his motion was based upon the cumulative impact of the statements. Therefore, we consider the appellant\u2019s contentions preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">We begin by noting that \u201c \u2018[t]here is no doubt that, in the heat of argument, counsel do occasionally make remarks that are not justified by the testimony, and which are, or may be, prejudicial to the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 589, 886 A.2d 876 (2005 (quoting <em>Dunlop v. United States, </em>165 U.S. 486, 498, 17 S.Ct. 375, 41 L.Ed. 799 (1897)). Mistrials are required for improper remarks in closing argument only when \u201cthe remarks of the prosecutor actually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u201d <em>Lee v. State, </em>405 Md. 148, 164, 950 A.2d 125 (2008) (quoting <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 592, 886 A.2d 876).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The determination whether a prosecutor\u2019s comments were sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 592, 886 A.2d 876 (citing <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 158-59, 872 A.2d 25 (2005) and <em>Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 231, 596 A.2d 1024 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 972, 112 S.Ct. 1590, 118 L.Ed.2d 307 (1992)). In <em>Lee, </em>Judge Battaglia explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">When assessing whether reversible, or its converse, harmless, error occurs when improper statements are made during closing argument, [appellate courts] review various factors, including \u201cthe severity of the remarks, the measures taken to cure any potential prejudice, and the weight of the evidence against the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>Lee, </em>405 Md. at 165, 950 A.2d 125 (quoting <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 592, 886 A.2d 876, and citing <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 159, 872 A.2d 25 and <em>Hill v. State, </em>355 Md. 206, 223, 734 A.2d 199 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Comments made in closing argument must be weighed in their context. <em>Clermont v. State, </em>348 Md. 419, 455, 704 A.2d 880 (1998); <em>Colvin-el v. State, </em>332 Md. 144, 178-79, 630 A.2d 725 (1993). Therefore, we now turn to the relevant portions of the State\u2019s closing.

But I made it a point that they had to strike it from their mind, totally disregard it and couldn\u2019t consider it. And I said that in a very strong way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">I believe, with respect to that issue, that instruction was appropriate and corrective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, in all fairness as well, I mean, you polled the jury as well and did the note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALV\">[THE COURT]: Correct.

Those were part of the instructions.<footnotemark>[20]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>As to [the prosecutor]\u2019s mentioning or stating, quoting Mr. Washington saying an out-of-mind or out-of-body experience, and I believe that he switched between the two on a couple of different occasions, there was testimony from Mr. Washington that he had an out-of-body experience. I don\u2019t recall him saying \u201cmind,\u201d but I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s of the dimension that you\u2019re making it out to be, and that was part of the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">The pictures you\u2019re making reference to, and I believe that\u2019s the picture of Mr. Washington that you indicated that there was no testimony about the picture being taken before he proceeded to the hospital, in point of fact, I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQO\">[THE STATE]: They were pictures taken of Mr. Washington by the evidence tech Rob Taylor before Mr. Washington went to the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">[THE COURT]: I don\u2019t recall that, and I don\u2019t believe inflame would be improper argument, if that\u2019s part of the record and the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Our contention is that it was not stated that it was before he went to the hospital, so the record will speak to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">Before this Court, appellant argues:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">Under the three-part test enunciated in <em>Lee, </em>each of the aforementioned prosecutorial remarks was severely prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">Many of the State\u2019s remarks improperly probed the passions and sympathies of the jury----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">Several other remarks urged the jury to consider facts not in evidence ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>As to the second factor, the weight of the evidence against Mr. Washington, the evidence was not so great as to outweigh the prejudice created by the State\u2019s numerous remarks----The evidence adduced at trial produced a \u201cclose call\u201d for the jury, as the only eye witness to the incident, aside from [appellant], was White, whose credibility was questionable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">Finally, as to the third factor, although the trial court took steps to cure the prejudice created by the State\u2019s remarks, those steps were insufficient to remedy the harm done to Mr. Washington. During closing argument alone, the trial court sustained <em>nine </em>of [appellant\u2019s objections, and granted [appellant\u2019s various motions to strike the comments from the record. The trial court also instructed the jury to disregard evidence stricken from the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQK\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The State asserts, first, that appellant did not include all of the comments that he now identifies as grounds for a mistrial in his motion for mistrial in front of the trial court. Second, the State contends that, as most of appellant\u2019s objections were sustained and the comments stricken from the record, appellant was not prejudiced. The State states that the only preserved objection that was overruled was the objection to the comment that appellant experienced \u201cwhat he calls an out-of-mind, out-of-body experience.\u201d The State argues that \u201c[t]he trial court properly ruled that there was testimony by Washington of an \u2018out-of-body experience\u2019 and the prosecutor\u2019s reference had been misconstrued and was not \u2018of the dimension\u2019 that defense counsel was making it out to be.\u201d While we do not agree with all aspects of the State\u2019s analysis, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">In <em>Lee, </em>the Court of Appeals articulated three factors for a review court to consider in determining whether a trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion for a mistrial based upon improper closing argument: the severity of the improper remarks, the measures taken to cure any potential prejudice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and the weight of the evidence against the accused. 405 Md. at 165, 950 A.2d 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\n<em>(A) The Seventy of the Improper Remarks.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Turning to the first of the <em>Lee </em>factors, we conclude that the remarks in question did not involve the sort of impropriety that traditionally requires a mistrial. For example, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in the instant case do not involve invocation of the \u201cgolden rule,\u201d <em>e.g. </em>an argument \u201cin which a litigant asks the jury to place themselves in the shoes of the victim,\u201d <em>Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 593 n. 11, 886 A.2d 876 (2005); or a prosecutorial appeal to the jury\u2019s own interests, another rhetorical device that warrants a mistrial. <em>Hill v. State, </em>355 Md. 206, 214-15, 734 A.2d 199 (1999),\u201d <em>Lee, </em>405 Md. at 161 n. 6, 950 A.2d 125. Nor do the statements below have anything near the prejudicial impact of the prosecutor\u2019s call to the jury in <em>Lee </em>to teach the victim not to follow \u201cthe laws of the streets\u201d (which were not specified by the prosecutor), a tactic that the Court of Appeals determined \u201ccould do nothing other than lead to juror speculation and decision, perhaps, on information outside the evidence. <em>Id. </em>405 Md. at 174, 950 A.2d 125. The prosecutor did not inform the jury that they were \u201cchosen to send a message to protect the community,\u201d a message that was \u201cwholly improper and presumptively prejudicial.\u201d <em>Hill </em>355 Md. at 216, 734 A.2d 199. The prosecutor did not improperly vouch for the credibility of a witness. <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 157, 872 A.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\n<em>(B) The Measures Taken to Cure Any Potential Prejudice.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Turning to the second of the <em>Lee </em>factors, we conclude that the trial court took prompt and effective measures to mitigate the prejudicial impact of the improper remarks. The trial court sustained the appellant\u2019s objections and, when asked to, struck the offending statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\n<em>(C) The Strength of the State\u2019s Case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Finally, as to the strength of the State\u2019s case, the State adduced evidence that appellant had been waiting for hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>for the furniture delivery and that he was angry. The parties do not contest that appellant was carrying a semi-automatic pistol at his waist when Clark and White arrived at his home. There is sharply conflicting testimony between White and appellant and Mrs. Washington as to the events immediately preceding the shootings but appellant\u2019s argument that he was the victim of a sudden, unprovoked, and extremely violent attack by Clark and White is inconsistent with the absence of any medical evidence that he had been severely beaten by Wfliite and Clark, and forensic evidence that indicated that at least one of the bullets striking Clark had been fired from more than four feet away. Appellant asserts that White\u2019s \u201ccredibility was questionable,\u201d and, certainly, White\u2019s credibility was crucial to the State\u2019s case. But in the context of a motion for a mistrial, the trial court, not us, had \u201cits finger on the pulse of the trial,\u201d <em>Hawkins, </em>326 Md. at 278, 604 A.2d 489, and was in the better position to evaluate potential prejudice to the appellant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Bearing these factors in mind, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Did the Trial Court Abuse Its Discretion in Denying the Motion for New Trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">On August 25, 2008, appellant filed a post-trial motion for a new trial pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-331(b).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Appellant asserted four grounds in support of his motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>1.

To support his contentions, appellant refers to the arguments discussed in Parts I through VI of this opinion. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">We begin our analysis by noting that trial errors, such as the sort set out in appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, are not generally cognizable under Rule 4-331(b). In <em>Isley v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 611, 629, 743 A.2d 772 (2000), <em>(overruled on other grounds, Merritt v. State, </em>367 Md. 17, 24, 785 A.2d 756 (2001)), Judge Moylan traced the history of Rule 4-331(b) and concluded that its function is limited to the correction of a defect in a verdict. In <em>Ramirez v. State, </em>178 Md.App. 257, 941 A.2d 1141 (2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 Md. 561, 979 A.2d 708 (2009), Judge Hollander explained as to 4-331(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">\u201cThe Motion in Arrest of Judgment has long been recognized in federal criminal practice and is provided for by Criminal Rule of Procedure 34.\u201d In <em>United States v. Sisson, </em>399 U.S. 267, 280-83, 90 S.Ct. 2117, 26 L.Ed.2d 608 (1970), the Supreme Court described how the motion is concerned only with matters \u2018on the face of the record\u2019 (the pleadings, the form of the verdict) and not with the evidence or the trial proceedings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">An arrest of judgment was the technical term describing the fact of a trial judge refusing to enter judgment on the verdict because of an error appearing on the face of the record that rendered the judgment invalid....

Therefore, ... a decision based on evidence adduced at trial cannot be one arresting judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">178 Md.App. at 280, 941 A.2d 1141 (emphasis supplied by Ramirez) (quoting <em>Isley, </em>129 Md.App. at 629, 743 A.2d 772, which in turn quoted C. Torcia IV Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure (12th ed., 1976) 160-61.) However, as Judge Moylan explained in <em>Isley, </em>this Court has sometimes considered appeals of trial courts\u2019 denials of motions for new trials under Rule 4-331(b) based upon assertions of trial error. <em>Isley, </em>129 Md.App. at 629, 743 A.2d 772; <em>see Bates v.

We shall do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">A motion for a new trial based upon trial errors such as those in question here is granted or denied by the trial court in the exercise of its discretion. As we explained in <em>Jackson v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 679, 884 A.2d 694 (2005), <em>cert. denied </em>390 Md. 501, 889 A.2d 418 (2006), a new trial motion, such as the one <em>sub judice, </em>is often:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGK\">based on events that happen in the course of the trial; such as, e.g., rulings on admissibility, potential trial error that may or may not be recognized at the time of occurrence, jury instructions, jury behavior, etc. These events are of a type that will ordinarily happen under the direct eye of the trial judge. For that reason, subsection (a) expressly provides that the trial judge may order a new trial \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d for it is he who has his thumb on the pulse of the trial and is in a unique position to assess the significance of such events. In <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Rugs, </em>328 Md. 51, 57, 612 A.2d 1294 (1992), Judge McAuliffe stressed that the range of the trial judge\u2019s discretion is accordingly at its broadest when it involves \u201cthe judge\u2019s evaluation\u201d of \u201cthe core question of whether justice has been done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\"><em>We are obliged to consider the breadth of discretion that is afforded a trial judge in making this type of decision. </em>As we have seen in tracing the history of our treatment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>this issue, the emphasis has consistently been upon <em>granting the broadest range of discretion to trial judges whenever the decision has necessarily depended upon the judge\u2019s evaluation of the character of the testimony and of the trial when the judge is considering the core question of whether justice has been done.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\"><em>Jackson, </em>164 Md.App. at 699-700, 884 A.2d 694 (emphasis supplied by Jackson).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">While the motion for new trial was not, strictly speaking, brought under Rule 4-331(a), it encompassed the types of issues described in <em>Jackson. </em>A decision to grant or deny the motion for new trial in the instant case necessarily turned upon the \u201cjudge\u2019s evaluation of the character of the testimony and of the trial when the judge is considering the core question of whether justice has been done.\u201d For the reasons set out in Parts I through VI hereof, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-13\">.

This is a proposition fundamentally different from permitting the introduction evidence of prior convictions as the sole proof of character, as appellant now contends the trial court should have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-18\">In any event, <em>Hemingway </em>was decided before the adoption of Maryland\u2019s current Rules of Evidence in 1994. It is at best questionable whether <em>Hemingway </em>is consistent with current Maryland Rule 5-405, pertaining to proof of character. <em>See </em>5 L.

The closest appellant came to arguing that White\u2019s prior convictions were relevant to any defense to be asserted at trial was the following passage from his response to the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">In this case, Mr. White has several powerful motives to have falsified, or at least shaded, his statements to the police and to testify untruthfully at trial. These motivations all involve Mr. White's criminal record. First, Mr. White wants to receive money based on the fact that he was shot. He has already served notice on Prince George's County that he intended to sue based on the shooting incident. Second, since the moment that the police became involved in this case, Mr. White has a powerful motivation to escape criminal prosecution for the crimes he committed against Mr. Washington inside of Mr. Washington\u2019s home....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">In order to avoid prosecution and ultimately obtain money, Mr. White has needed, and continues to need, the police, the State, and ultimately the jury to believe that he was the victim in this incident and not the initial aggressor. Mr. White's criminal record, specifically the number of convictions, the nature of the charges and his sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>offender status, [is] the most significant obstacle] ] that he Mr. White [sic] must overcome to have his story believed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">This statement falls well short of an assertion that appellant sought admission of White's convictions in order to prove that White was the first aggressor.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\">.

The State also contends that the trial court never ruled on appellant\u2019s argument that White\u2019s failure to register was deceptive conduct proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>live of his veracity and that, \"by not pursuing this issue with the trial court, [appellant] failed to preserve it for appellate review.\u201d Our review of the record leads us to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">As we discussed above, appellant's motion <em>in limine </em>advanced four grounds supporting his assertion that he should be permitted to cross-examine White as to his sex offender status. One of those grounds was that White\u2019s failure to register was a prior act that is probative of untruthfulness, pursuant to Md. Rule 5-608(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">On February 8th, the trial court issued a memorandum opinion and order denying the motion in part and reserving a ruling on one ground, namely, appellant\u2019s argument that White\u2019s sex offender status was probative as to a possible bias in light of White's pending civil action, until testimony could be taken at trial. The trial court\u2019s memorandum opinion and order did not explicitly address whether failure to register as a sex offender was a prior act probative of untruthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">On February 12, 2008, the court conducted a hearing on that portion of the appellant's motion which it had reserved. The trial court found that White had no expectation of leniency in return for his testimony and that, accordingly, it would not permit cross-examination regarding his failure to register as a sex offender. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">And this, my compliments to you on your legal acumen and your four pronged attack on the purpose of the sexual registration, but I feel that it falls short in this instance and am going to deny your motion and not permit that cross examination in this aspect in front of a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">We interpret the phrase \"four-pronged attack\u201d to be a reference to all four grounds presented by appellant in his motion.

Prior to the trial court\u2019s ruling, the State had introduced State's Exhibit No. 3, a photograph of the exterior of appellant\u2019s house taken the night of the shootings. The photograph showed a Mario delivery van parked at the curb in front of appellant\u2019s home. In addition, the trial court invited appellant\u2019s counsel to cross-examine White as to \"all of the circumstances surrounding\u201d Clark\u2019s statement; but appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[12]\">\n<p id=\"b114-9\">12.

White testified regarding appellant\u2019s state of mind <em>after </em>he recounted Clark's statement. Thus, the introduction of the hearsay statement and the introduction of the corroborating evidence were out of sequence. However, appellant did not explicitly object to White\u2019s testimony on the basis of a lapse in time between Clark\u2019s conversation with appellant and Clark's statement to White. Had appellant done so, the State presumably would have established the foundation prior to introduction of the hearsay statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b117-10\">. Appellant additionally asserts that the introduction of Clark\u2019s statement \u201cviolated [appellant's] constitutional rights to confront his accusers under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment\u201d and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which is read <em>in pari materia </em>with the Confrontation Clause. <em>Marquardt v. State, </em>164 Md. App. 95, 120, 882 A.2d 900 (2005). Appellant is incorrect. Appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights would be implicated by the introduction of \u201ctestimonial hearsay.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). While there are multiple standards to determine what is \"testimonial hearsay,\u201d \u201cthe uniting theme underlying the <em>Crawford </em>holding is that when a statement is made in the course of a criminal investigation initiated by the government, the Confrontation Clause forbids its introduction unless the defendant has had the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.\u201d <em>State v. Snowden, </em>385 Md. 64, 81, 867 A.2d 314 (2005). Clark\u2019s statement to a fellow employee before either had the slightest intimation that anything was seriously amiss was obviously not testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">Finally, appellant claims that his trial counsel's failure to preserve the issue of the admissibility of Clark\u2019s statement deprived appellant of effective assistance of counsel.
