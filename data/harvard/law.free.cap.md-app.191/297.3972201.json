Law \u00a7 5-602(2) (2002); possession of cocaine, in violation of Grim. Law \u00a7 5-601; possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of Crim. Law \u00a7 5 \u2014 621(b)(1); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>illegal possession of a regulated firearm, <em>in violation of </em>Md. Code Ann. Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133(b) (2003); and possession of marijuana, in violation of Crim. Law \u00a7 5-601(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Appellant presents two issues for our review, which we have reworded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">I. Did the trial court err in failing to enter judgments of acquittal on charges involving possession of a firearm where there was no evidence that the firearm involved in the crime was operable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">II. Was the evidence sufficient to support a conviction for simple possession and possession with the intent to distribute cocaine?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Evidence at trial established the following pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Around midnight on April 6, 2007, Officer Jefferson Tufts of the Baltimore County Police Department stopped a white Cadillac for driving 48 miles per hour in a posted 35 mile per hour zone near the intersection of Pine Avenue and Dundalk Avenue. Officer Thomas Huesman assisted in the stop. Appellant was the driver and sole occupant of the car. Officer Tufts approached the driver\u2019s side of the car and Officer Huesman approached the passenger\u2019s side. Appellant appeared \u201cnervous\u201d but produced his driver\u2019s license and the registration without incident. Officer Huesman alerted Officer Tufts to two marijuana \u201cblunts\u201d he observed on the front passenger seat. At Officer Tufts\u2019 direction, appellant handed the blunts to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Officer Tufts then inquired whether appellant had \u201canything else in the vehicle [he] needed to know about.\u201d Appellant responded in the negative. Next, in the words of Officer Tufts, \u201cI asked [appellant] to exit the vehicle so that we could [conduct a] search.\u201d Appellant did not comply. Instead, he immediately sped away, followed by both officers in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>individual patrol cars. Approximately 50 yards into the pursuit, Officer Tufts saw \u201csomething [thrown] out the window.\u201d The chase lasted no more than a mile before appellant lost control of the car and crashed. Appellant exited the car and continued to flee before being caught by Officer Huesman.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Officer Shawn McElfish arrived shortly after appellant was apprehended. He searched for the discarded item in the roadway area as described by Officer Tufts. He found a handgun. It was loaded with a magazine of six rounds, and one round in the chamber. Two sandwich baggies containing a white substance were found in the interior \u201cconsole\u201d of the car. The contents of the baggies were later identified as being 19.2 grams and .9 grams of cocaine having a street value of approximately $800. No other contraband was recovered from appellant or the car. According to Detective Hinton Sekou, the State\u2019s expert in the sale and use of illegal drugs, the amount of cocaine seized was indicative of possession with an intent to distribute rather than personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">After appellant\u2019s arrest, Detective Sean Moran interviewed him about the gun. Appellant advised that a \u201cfriend\u201d owned the car and provided no identifying information about the \u201cfriend.\u201d Detective Moran recalled asking appellant whether \u201cwe needed to investigate other people if other people were responsible for this firearm.\u201d Appellant responded that he would not discuss the gun. His reason, according to the detective, was that to do so would be self-incriminating.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Appellant testified that the gun and cocaine both belonged to the owner of the car, a friend whom he knew only as \u201cBlack.\u201d According to appellant, he had spent the evening at a party with friends, including Black. The two left the party together with Black driving the car. Appellant stated that when they arrived at Black\u2019s home, Black turned the car over to appellant because Black was not up to taking appellant home.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Appellant claimed that when the traffic stop occurred, he called Black with Officer Tuft\u2019s permission in order to locate the car\u2019s registration. Appellant testified it was during this call to Black that he learned there was a gun under the front driver\u2019s seat. Appellant did not state that Black alerted him to the cocaine in the car. Officer Tufts denied that appellant made a telephone call during the stop. Officer Huesman did not recall that appellant made any calls during the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Appellant admitted to discarding the gun and that Officer Tufts \u201cpointed out I had two blunts.\u201d He did not dispute that Officer Tufts questioned him as to any other contraband in the car, that he denied the presence of any, or that he sped away after being advised that the car would be searched. Appellant explained that he \u201cpanicked\u201d after learning about the gun and fled only because he knew a prior CDS conviction prohibited his ownership or possession of a firearm. Appellant admitted that the gun recovered by Officer McElfish was the same gun that he threw out of the window. Appellant denied any knowledge of the cocaine, and stated that he learned about the cocaine discovered in the console of the car when at the police station. Appellant called no other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">At sentencing, the court merged the simple possession conviction into the possession of cocaine with intent to distribute conviction and imposed a 20-year term of incarceration thereon, suspending all but 10 years, to be served without the possibility of parole; imposed a five-year term of incarceration to be served without the possibility of parole for the possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime conviction, to be served consecutively to the first sentence of incarceration; and suspended any sentence generally as to the other convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">We will provide additional facts as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">I. The Firearm Offenses</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Appellant was charged with the violation of three gun-related offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u2022 Wearing, carrying and transporting a handgun without a permit in violation of Crim. Law \u00a7 4-203;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">\u2022 Possessing a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of Crim. Law \u00a7 5 \u2014 621(b)(1); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u2022 Possessing a regulated firearm by a person previously convicted of a disqualifying crime under Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">At trial, Officer McElfish described the gun that he recovered as being \u201ca .45 caliber Smith Armory handgun.\u201d He testified that he \u201cmade it safe\u201d by \u201cunloading the weapon\u201d before \u201cpackaging] it per County policy.\u201d There was no affirmative evidence in the record as to the gun\u2019s operability. There was no testimony by any witness as to any examination or test firing of the gun. However, appellant did not dispute that the gun was a real gun and loaded when found. Appellant did not question whether the gun was in good condition, and presented no evidence that the gun showed any signs of disrepair or was not otherwise intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">At the close of all of the evidence, appellant moved for a judgment of acquittal of all the charges against him. Regarding the gun-related offenses, appellant did not dispute that he possessed the gun or had prior disqualifying convictions. Rather, his argument for acquittal was based solely on the assertion, without citation to authority, that each gun-related offense required proof of the gun\u2019s operability and that the State had failed to prove operability.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The State responded that appellant was \u201ccorrect, [as to] the simple possession of a handgun\u201d under Crim. Law \u00a7 4-203 requiring operability, but maintained that a conviction under Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133 and Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621(b) did not \u201crequire testimony as to the operability.\u201d On this point, the State failed to argue that a reasonable fact finder could determine operability from the circumstantial evidence presented in lieu of direct evidence, (e.g. that the gun was loaded and there being no evidence of disrepair). The trial court denied the motion for judgment of acquittal and found appellant not guilty of the handgun offense (Crim. Law 4-203) but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>guilty of the firearm drug trafficking and regulated firearm offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Before this Court, appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133(b)(1) and Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621(b)(l) because, in his view, both statutes require proof of operability in order to support a conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">[U]nder [Crim. Law] \u00a7 5-621(b) and [Pub. Safety] \u00a7 5-133(p) ..., the State bears the burden of proving that the weapon was operable If the Legislature had intended that the terms \u201cfirearm\u201d and \u201cregulated firearm\u201d include inoperable firearms, it knew how to make that intention clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHR\">Appellant points us to Crim. Law \u00a7 4-204, which prohibits the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime \u201cwhether ... the handgun is operable or inoperable at the time of the crime\u201d as an example of a statute that does not require proof of operability. Since neither Pub. Safety \u00a7 5 \u2014 133(b)(1) nor Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621(b)(l) contain similar language, he argues that the State is required to prove operability.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The State responds that the governing statutory definitions of a \u201cfirearm\u201d (in Crim. Law \u00a7 5 \u2014 621(b)(1)) and \u201cregulated firearm\u201d (in Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-101) are clear and unambiguous and that the plain meaning of neither statute imposes a requirement that a firearm be operable. The State also relies upon established case law defining a firearm as, among other things, a weapon \u201cdesigned to expel, or may readily be converted to expel\u201d a projectile. The State reasons that \u201c[i]t obviously follows that a weapon that requires conversion to expel\u201d does not suggest a requirement of present operability.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">We review a trial court\u2019s construction and interpretation of a statute <em>de novo. </em>We affirm the denial of a motion for acquittal unless we determine that no rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 374-75, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005); <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 479, 649 A.2d 336 (1994) <em>(quoting Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\n<em>A. Unlawful Possession of a Regulated Firearm (Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133(b)).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Appellant\u2019s first argument is that the State was required to prove operability of the .45 handgun in order to convict him of violating Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133(b)(l). That statute reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">\u00a7 5-133. Restrictions on possession of regulated firearms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">(b) Possession of regulated firearm prohibited. \u2014 A person may not possess a regulated firearm if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">(1) has been convicted of a disqualifying crime----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The term \u201cregulated firearm\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 5-133 but rather in three subsections of Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-101. As in <em>Hicks v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 112, 134-35, 984 A.2d 246 (2009), \u201cwe will set them out in reverse order\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">(p) <em>Regulated firearm,. </em>\u2014 \u201cRegulated firearm\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">(1) a handgun; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">(2) a firearm that is any of the following specific assault weapons or their copies, regardless of which company produced and manufactured that assault weapon: [list of assault weapons omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-13\">(n) Handgun.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-14\">(1) \u201cHandgun\u201d means a firearm with a barrel less than 16 inches in length.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-15\">(2) \u201cHandgun\u201d includes a signal, starter, and blank pistols.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-16\">(h) Firearm.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-17\">(1) \u201cFirearm\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-18\">(i) a weapon that expels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-19\">(ii) the frame or receiver of such a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-20\">(2) \u201cFirearm\u201d includes a starter gun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The resolution of appellant\u2019s contentions as to his Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133 conviction is controlled by two recent companion decisions of this Court: <em>Moore v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 90, 110, 983 A.2d 583 (2009) and <em>Hicks, </em>189 Md.App. at 139, 984 A.2d 246. After reviewing pertinent legislative history and surveying authority from other jurisdictions, we concluded in each case that \u201cin order to obtain a conviction under Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133, the State need not prove that the firearm in question was operable.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>189 Md.App. at 139, 984 A.2d 246; <em>see also Moore, </em>189 Md.App. at 110, 983 A.2d 583.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In effect, we held that the design and construction of a weapon, rather than the state of its operability at the time of the crime, determines whether a weapon is or is not a \u201cfirearm\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 5-101 and \u00a7 5-133 of the Public Safety Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Appellant does not contest that the .45 Smith Armory automatic handgun was a \u201cregulated firearm,\u201d nor does he contest that he had previously been convicted of a \u201cqualifying crime,\u201d the other statutory predicates for a finding of guilt. Therefore, his conviction for violating Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133(b)(1) will stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\n<em>B. Possession of a Firearm in Relation to a Drag Trafficking Crime (Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Appellant challenges his conviction for violating Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621(b)(l). The statute reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">\u00a7 5-621. Use of weapon as separate crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">(b) <em>Prohibited. </em>\u2014 During and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, a person may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-12\">(1) possess a firearm under sufficient circumstances to constitute a nexus to the drug trafficking crime....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">Like Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133, Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621 does not define \u201cfirearm.\u201d However, the succeeding section of the Code does. Crim. Law \u00a7 5-622 makes it unlawful for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>person previously convicted of a CDS felony under Title 5 of the Criminal Law Article to possess, own, carry, or transport a firearm. Specifically, \u00a7 5-622 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">(a) <em>\u201cFirearm\u201d defined. </em>\u2014 In this section, \u201cfirearm\u201d includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">(1) a handgun, antique firearm, rifle, shotgun, short-barreled shotgun, and short-barreled rifle, as those words are defined in \u00a7 4-201 of this article;<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">(2) a machine gun, as defined in \u00a7 4-401 of this article; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">(3) <em>a regulated firearm, as defined in \u00a7 5-101 of the Public Safety Article.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Appellant\u2019s argument is based on the premise that the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d contained in \u00a7 5-622 should be applicable to the term \u201cfirearm\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 5-621. Then, focusing solely upon Crim. Law \u00a7 5-622(a)\u2019s cross-reference to Crim. Law \u00a7 4-201, appellant reasons that: (1) since there \u201cwas no evidence that [the weapon in appellant\u2019s possession] was one of the types of Springfield Armory firearms\u201d listed in Pub. Safety \u00a7 5 \u2014 101(p)(2); then (2) the firearm in this case would have to qualify as a \u201chandgun\u201d under Crim. Law \u00a7 4-201; (3) since operability is required to sustain a conviction under Crim. Law \u00a7 4-203 (which incorporates \u00a7 4-201\u2019s definition of handgun); then (4) the same requirement should be imputed to a prosecution under Crim. Law \u00a7 5 \u2014 621(b)(1). We agree with appellant\u2019s initial premise but not his subsequent logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Although the predecessors to Crim. Law \u00a7\u00a7 5-621 and 5-622 were enacted at a different time than the predecessor to Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133, their respective legislative histories lead us to conclude that they share common purposes and policies and should be read in conjunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\n<em>Crim. Law \u00a7\u00a7 5-621 and 5-622.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621\u2019s predecessor, Art. 27 \u00a7 281 A(b), was enacted as part of the Drug Kingpin Act and codified under the sub-heading \u201cHealth \u2014 Controlled Dangerous Substances.\u201d <em>See </em>1989 Md. Laws 2412-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u201cThe major objective\u201d of the Drug Kingpin Act was \u201cto reduce the supply of drugs in Maryland by establishing harsher penalties for drug dealers and by decreasing the profitability of participation in a drug trafficking crime.\u201d Briefing Document and Synopsis of the Drug Enforcement-Drug Kingpin Act Senate [Bill] 400/ House Bill 502. <em>See also Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 150, 626 A.2d 946 (1993); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>154 Md.App. 286, 305, 839 A.2d 769 (2003). This same briefing document states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">The use of firearms in connection with drug trafficking crimes is an everyday occurrence____ [T]he combination of dealing drugs and possessing a firearm has become too commonplace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">The Use or Possession of a Firearm Component. This component recognizes that firearms readily available and that those involved in drug trafficking crimes are quite willing to use those weapons to resolve disputes with their rivals or their customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">III. Use of a Firearm in a Drug Trafficking Crime</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APA\">1. Why is it necessary to establish that <em>use or possession </em>of a firearm be a separate offense when Article 27, \u00a7 36B, already makes it unlawful to use a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">The current statute is restricted to handguns. The proposed bill would include all firearms. Many drug dealers are using automatic weapons, assault rifles and other firearms that may not fall within the current definition of a handgun---- The language in this bill prohibits anyone to \u201cuse or possess\u201d a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. It would affect an individual who carries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>a handgun while dealing drugs, <em>even though he does not use it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In 1991, the General Assembly amended Article 27\u2019s \u201cHealth \u2014 Controlled Dangerous Substances\u201d subtitle by adding former Art. 27 \u00a7 291A, the statutory predecessor to Crim. Law \u00a7 5-622. 1991 Md. Laws 3385-86. Section 291A reflected the General Assembly\u2019s policy that persons convicted of violating the controlled dangerous substance laws be prohibited from thereafter possessing, owning, carrying, or transporting a firearm. The bill file contains a document titled \u201cExplanation of Floor Amendment to House Bill 978,\u201d which states with regard to \u00a7 291A:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">Th[e] purpose of this amendment is to remedy a conflict between this bill and a provision of current law [under \u00a7 445] that makes it a misdemeanor for a person to possess a pistol or revolver if the person has been convicted of certain controlled dangerous substance offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">This amendment strikes Article 27, 445(c)(l)(iii) [prohibiting, <em>inter alia, </em>a person convicted of manufacturing or distributing controlled dangerous substances from possessing a \u201cpistol or revolver\u201d] because it <em>overlaps </em>with the provisions of this bill and conflicts with the portion of this bill that makes the <em>same offense </em>a felony rather than a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">(Underlined emphasis in original, italicized emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The legislative history indicates that the General Assembly intended the term \u201cfirearm\u201d to have the same meaning in former Art. 27 \u00a7\u00a7 281 A and 291 A. <em>See Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514-15, 525 A.2d 628 (1987) (When interpreting statutory language \u201c[w]e may and often must consider other \u2018external manifestations\u2019 or \u2018persuasive evidence,\u2019 including a bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments that occurred as it passed through the legislature, [and] its relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation.... \u201d). We interpret their statutory successors consistently with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>legislative intent and conclude that the term \u201cfirearm\u201d has the same meaning in Crim.

Laws 3140; Senate Floor Report Bill 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">In enacting \u00a7 445, the General Assembly determined that certain persons were unfit to possess firearms, including, <em>inter alia, </em>anyone previously convicted of a crime of violence, a felony, or certain misdemeanors. The Maryland Gun Violence Act of 1996 was based in large part upon the federal Gun Control Act of 1968 and utilized much of the same terminology. <em>Hicks, </em>189 Md.App. at 137, 984 A.2d 246. As we explained in <em>Moore </em>and <em>Hicks, </em>federal courts interpreting the federal law \u201chave consistently held that [the federal statute corresponding to what is now Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133] does not require proof of operability of the firearm.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>189 Md.App. at 104, 983 A.2d 583; <em>see Hicks, </em>189 Md.App. at 133, 984 A.2d 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The legislative histories of Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-101 and \u00a7 5-133, on the one hand, and Crim. Law \u00a7\u00a7 5-621 and 5-622, on the other, demonstrate that they share common purposes, including proscribing the possession of a firearm by a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>in connection with a drug transaction or who had previously been convicted of various criminal offenses, including drug distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-101 is the only criminal statute in which the General Assembly has provided a descriptive (versus an inclusive) definition of the term \u201cfirearm.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That definition is expressly cross-referenced within the meaning of \u201cfirearm\u201d under Grim. Law \u00a7 5-622(a), and we accordingly read Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-101 in <em>pari materia </em>with Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621(b)(l) and \u00a7 5-622, in order to give the term consistent meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In <em>Hicks </em>and <em>Moore, </em>we concluded that the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d in Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-101 does not include the concept of operability. Logic dictates that we apply the same construction to the term \u201cfirearm\u201d as it is used in Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621 and \u00a7 5-622. Hence, we hold that, in order to obtain a conviction under Crim. Law 5-621(b), the State need not prove that the firearm in question was operable.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">II. The CDS Convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The sole issue presented by appellant\u2019s remaining contention is whether the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant was in possession of, and with the intent to distribute, the 20.1 total grams of cocaine found in the car he was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Appellant asserts that the evidence was legally insufficient for two reasons. First, he submits that there was insufficient evidence \u201cto show, or from which to infer,\u201d that he knowingly possessed the cocaine. Appellant emphasizes that the evidence failed to show \u201cwhere exactly\u201d the cocaine was found in the car or whether they were accessible or in his plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Second, appellant argues that the State did not prove that he \u201cexercised dominion and control over the [cocaine] found in the car.\u201d Appellant stresses that he did not have a possessory or ownership interest in the car and that the evidence failed to show who \u201cactually owned the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The State responds that the evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant knowingly possessed the cocaine and was in actual or constructive possession of it. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The standard for our review of the sufficiency of the evidence is \u201cwhether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>see White v. State, </em>363 Md. 150, 162, 767 A.2d 855 (2001). We defer to the fact finder\u2019s \u201copportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses, weigh the evidence, and resolve conflicts in the evidence....\u201d <em>Sparkman v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 716, 740, 968 A.2d 162, <em>cert. denied, </em>410 Md. 166, 978 A.2d 246 (2009); <em>Pinkney v. State, </em>151 Md.App. 311, 329, 827 A.2d 124, <em>cert. denied, </em>377 Md. 276, 833 A.2d 32 (2003). While we do not re-weigh the evidence, \u201cwe do determine whether the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence, direct or circumstantial, which could convince a rational trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>White, </em>363 Md. at 162, 767 A.2d 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The same review standard applies to all criminal cases, including those resting upon circumstantial evidence, since, generally, proof of guilt based in whole or in part on circumstantial evidence is no different from proof of guilt based on direct eyewitness accounts. <em>See Pinkney, </em>151 Md.App. at 327, 827 A.2d 124; <em>Eiland v. State, </em>92 Md.App. 56, 69, 607 A.2d 42 (1992), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>330 Md. 261, 623 A.2d 648 (1993). \u201cCircumstantial evidence is entirely sufficient to support a conviction, provided the circumstances support rational inferences from which the trier of fact could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Hall v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 377, 393, 705 A.2d 50 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Furthermore, the fact finder, not the appellate court, resolves conflicting evidentiary inferences. \u201cThe primary appellate function in respect to evidentiary inferences is to determine whether the trial court made reasonable, <em>i.e., </em>rational, inferences from extant facts. Generally, if there are evidentiary facts sufficiently supporting the inference made by the trial court, the appellate court defers to the fact-finder....\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 547, 823 A.2d 664 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In support of his argument, appellant refers this Court to four cases: <em>State v. Suddith, </em>379 Md. 425, 428, 842 A.2d 716 (2004) (defendant was one of three passengers in vehicle where CDS was found); <em>White v. State, </em>363 Md. 150, 159, 767 A.2d 855 (2001) (defendant was only passenger and cocaine was found in a sealed box in the trunk of car driven by another); <em>Larocca v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 460, 465-66, 883 A.2d 986 (2005) (defendant was one of two passengers and marijuana was found under the front seat); and, <em>Folk v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 508, 511, 275 A.2d 184 (1971) (defendant was one of six passengers where police witnessed another passenger discard marijuana from vehicle). In all of these cases, the defendant was a passenger with at least one other occupant in a vehicle and the issue as to the possession of contraband seized from the vehicle was in the context of joint or constructive possession. Based upon these \u201cpassenger\u201d cases, appellant concludes: \u201cAt most, the evidence established that [appellant] was a recent occupant of a car involved in suspicious activity which contained [cocaine] in some unspecified place in the vehicle.\u201d These cases are factually inapposite and are of no assistance to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Crim. Law \u00a7 5-601 prohibits the possession of controlled dangerous substances (which, under Crim. Law \u00a7 5-403(b)(3)(iv), includes cocaine). Crim. Law \u00a7 5-602 prohibits the possession of CDS with the intent to distribute. Crim. Law \u00a7 5-101(u) defines \u201cpossess\u201d to mean \u201cto exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>actual or constructive dominion or control over a thing by one or more persons.\u201d A conviction for possession of cocaine may rest upon either actual or constructive possession. <em>Suddith, </em>379 Md. at 431-32, 842 A.2d 716. A person has constructive possession over contraband when he or she has dominion or control over the contraband itself or over the premises or vehicle in which it was concealed. <em>Smith, </em>374 Md. at 553, 557, 823 A.2d 664. Furthermore, although appellant complains that the State did not prove who \u201cactually owned\u201d the car (which, we observe, did not thereby affirmatively exclude him), a legal possessory or ownership interest in the premises or vehicle is not necessary or dispositive as to the issue of dominion and control. <em>Handy v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 538, 571, 930 A.2d 1111 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Because a person \u201cordinarily would not be deemed to exercise \u2018dominion or control\u2019 over an object about which he is unaware,\u201d knowledge of the contraband\u2019s presence is a prerequisite to the exercise of dominion and control. <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 649, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988). <em>See Suddith, </em>379 Md. at 432, 842 A.2d 716 (A person\u2019s \u201cknowledge of the contraband is a key element in finding [a person] guilty of possession].... \u201d). Accordingly, in order to obtain a conviction for possession of illegal drugs, the State must show by direct or circumstantial evidence that the defendant knew of both \u201cthe presence and the general character or illicit nature.\u201d <em>Dawkins, </em>313 Md. at 651, 547 A.2d 1041. Thus, the sufficiency issue here boils down to whether the trier of fact could reasonably infer that appellant knew of the presence of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The Court of Appeals has recognized that \u201c[d]rivers generally have dominion and control over the vehicles they drive.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>374 Md. at 553, 823 A.2d 664 (citation omitted). In that opinion, after reviewing of the evidence<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and emphasizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>a fact finder\u2019s prerogative to choose among differing inferences, along with the deference that must be given in that regard, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">We hold that the status of a person in a vehicle who is the driver, whether that person actually owns, is merely the driver or is the lessee of the vehicle, permits an inference, by a fact-finder, of knowledge, by that person, of contraband found in that vehicle. In other words, the knowledge of the contents of the vehicle can be imputed to the driver of the vehicle. That inference in the case <em>sub judice, </em>based upon the direct and circumstantial evidence presented, would permit a fact-finder to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent had knowledge of the [contraband] in the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">374 Md. at 550, 823 A.2d 664. <em>Accord Sellman v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 1, 31, 828 A.2d 803 (2003) (citing to <em>Smith </em>and stating that \u201creasonable fact-finder ... reasonably could infer that as the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle ... [defendant] not only knew of [the] existence [of the illegal drugs found in the vehicle after the traffic stop] but was exercising dominion and control over it by transporting it.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">While a fact finder could infer that appellant possessed the cocaine simply by virtue of his status as the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle, there was additional evidence, based upon reasonable inferences, of appellant\u2019s knowledge, dominion, and control over the cocaine. \u201cThere are few facts, including even ultimate facts, that cannot be established by inference.\u201d <em>Moore v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 36, 45, 533 A.2d 1 (1987). \u201c[A]n inference is valid if the inferred fact is more likely than not to be true if the basic fact is true, or there is a rational connection between the basic and the inferred facts.11\u201d L. McLain, Maryland Evidence, \u00a7 301.4 at 427 (2d Ed. 2001) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>An inference \u201c \u2018need only be reasonable and possible; it need not be necessary or inescapable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>374 Md. at 539, 823 A.2d 664 (citation omitted). Fact finders \u201croutinely apply their common sense, powers of logic and accumulated experiences in life to arrive at conclusions from demonstrated sets of facts.\u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>315 Md. 309, 318, 554 A.2d 395 (1989). Finally, to the extent that conflicting inferences are possible from the evidence, \u201c \u2018it is for the fact finder to resolve the conflict. The possibility of raising conflicting inferences from the evidence does not preclude allowing the fact finder to determine where the truth lies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>374 Md. at 539-40, 823 A.2d 664 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Russell, </em>46 Mass.App.Ct. 307, 309, 310, 705 N.E.2d 1144 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The evidence in support of an inference that appellant exercised knowledge, dominion and control over the cocaine included: 1) that appellant was the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle when stopped by the police; 2) that appellant was \u201cnervous\u201d when the officers approached the vehicle; 3) that when the officers advised appellant they were going to search the vehicle, he fled; 4) and that a loaded gun and other drugs, suggesting a relationship to the cocaine, were also in the vehicle at the time of the traffic stop. <em>See Henderson v. State, </em>183 Md.App. 86, 102, 960 A.2d 627 (2008) (stating \u201cit is a commonplace observation that firearms are tools of the drug trade.\u201d); <em>Burns v. State, </em>149 Md.App. 526, 542, 817 A.2d 885 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The fact finder could properly infer that appellant was in possession of the cocaine. Appellant\u2019s version does little to dispel the inference of his knowledge and control. According to appellant, someone, known to appellant only as \u201cBlack,\u201d lent him an automobile with a handgun and $800 of cocaine secreted within it. Appellant testified that Black told him of the handgun, but not the cocaine, and he fled to avoid the search and discovery of the gun alone. Witness credibility is not ours to decide, but lies solely within the purview of the fact finder. <em>See State v. Raines, </em>326 Md. 582, 590, 606 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>265 (1992). A fact finder is \u201cfree to accept the evidence that it believes and reject that which it does not believe.\u201d <em>Snyder v. State, </em>104 Md.App. 533, 549-50, 657 A.2d 342, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 Md. 216, 665 A.2d 1058 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">In our view, taken as a whole, the evidence was sufficient to support a conclusion by a reasonable fact finder that appellant knowingly possessed, with an intent to distribute, the cocaine hidden in the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.
