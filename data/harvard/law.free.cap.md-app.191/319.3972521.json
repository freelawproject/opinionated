FREDERICK SHARER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AnM\">Retired, Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">In the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Aubrey David Wilder, appellant, was convicted by a jury of various charges of first-degree assault, reckless endangerment, and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>In this appeal, Wilder raises four issues, which, as recast and reordered, are:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\">I. Whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain the convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">II. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by admitting \u201cother bad acts\u201d evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">III. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by permitting a police officer to provide lay opinion testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">IV. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by not removing a juror who had raised doubts about her ability to be \u201cfair and just.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting testimony about cellular tower site location without qualifying the State\u2019s witness as an expert, and that the error is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we shall vacate Wilder\u2019s convictions and order a new trial on all counts except for the handgun charges. With respect to the handgun count, we are unable to hold that the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Wilder used a \u201chandgun\u201d in the commission of the offenses, and shall reverse. We further conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of a prior threat made by Wilder, and did not abuse its discretion by not granting a mistrial. Finally, we need not consider appellant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s decision not to remove a juror, as that issue is not likely to recur in a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The genesis of the charges against Wilder is a shooting incident that took place in the early morning hours of July 25, 2007, in Windsor Mill, Baltimore County. A gunman fired four shots at the residence of Robert Lee Williams, Jr., at 3314 Lynne Hall Drive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time, the residents of the house included Williams\u2019s father; his son, Robert Lee Williams III (Robert); Robert\u2019s girlfriend; two children; a niece, Lavivian Jones, and her child, Zaire. Williams was acquainted with Wilder through Jones. Wilder is the father of Jones\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Williams testified that on the afternoon of July 24, 2007, he was outside of his house, along with Jones, her child, and Robert. Wilder drove up, stopped across the street from the house, and walked up to Jones at the edge of the property. Williams explained that because Wilder was forbidden to be on his property, he could go no further when visiting Jones and their child. Wilder had not been welcome at the Williams house because he and Jones \u201calways had issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Wilder and Jones at first conversed quietly. They began to argue, however, and Wilder, who was holding the child, walked back towards his car. Jones became concerned that Wilder would drive away without securing Zaire in a car seat, and she prevailed upon her cousin, Robert, to intervene. Robert suggested to Wilder that he place the child in a car seat. Wilder took offense, and an argument arose. Robert explained why he intervened in the dispute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">Well, at some time [Wilder] was tryin\u2019 to take him. And, you know, no car seat. And I was, um, basically cornin\u2019 to stop him from takin\u2019 the baby \u2018cause he was takin\u2019 it with no car seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">And my cousin [Jones] was tellin\u2019 me, you know, come, cause he was tryin\u2019 to take the baby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>When I got down there I told him, you know, you ain\u2019t takin\u2019 the baby. And specially, you know, you ain\u2019t got no car seat. You know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">And then after that I guess he, you know, went on the offensive, sayin\u2019, this is my son, whatever, whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">So he tryin\u2019 to get in the car with the baby with no car seat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Robert alluded to threats Wilder had made during an earlier conversation with Robert\u2019s mother, and further described his confrontation with Wilder on the afternoon before the shooting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">A. And I said, due to the past comments you made, you know, previous to my mother, and threats.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">A. I said, you got nerve to come around here with this, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">That\u2019s when I \u2014 I was kinda upset, you know, \u2018cause what he said to my mother and all that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">So I asked him to step out of the car, you know. He\u2014 like, he ain\u2019t step out of the car. He ain\u2019t do none of that. Still got the baby in his hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-12\">So I\u2019m like, step out the car. He never step out the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-13\">Then after that he pulls off with the baby, goes halfway down the street, gets out the car. Ah, you messed up. You messed up. You messed up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-14\">Then he drove off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">Just after driving off, Wilder stopped for a moment and was heard to remark that \u201che [Robert] just F\u2019ed up.\u201d The elder Williams remarked that Wilder\u2019s demeanor was \u201clike a tough-guy thing.\u201d Jones recounted that after Wilder took Zaire and drove away, she \u201chad to call Baltimore County [police] to get my son back ... because Wilder had Zaire without a car seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Williams returned home from work at about 2 a.m. on the morning of the 25th, and remained awake because he had planned to leave for a trip that morning. He had mentioned to his wife that he was concerned by the hostilities between Wilder and Robert, and that \u201cthings are gettin\u2019 more intense with [Wilder] and Robert, considerin\u2019 what happened earlier that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Just before he was set to leave on his trip, Williams heard four gunshots. He rushed to the top of the stairs and saw Wilder\u2019s Volvo station wagon \u201cpullin\u2019 off.\u201d Williams recounted that the car was \u201cjust pullin\u2019 out my driveway, pullin\u2019 around the circle.\u201d He could not see the driver and could not tell how many people were in the station wagon. Four rounds hit the house and went through the walls. Williams identified four locations where the gunshots hit the house. One round entered a hallway shortly after Williams had passed by that point. Williams described additional damage. Police responded to the scene, and found two shell casings. Williams later discovered two additional bullets as workmen were repairing the house. According to the lead detective, a firearms technician concluded that the bullets recovered were \u201cprobably\u201d fired from a \u201c9 millimeter-type handgun, and a 9 millimeter\u2019s only fired out of a semi-automatic gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The prosecutor asked Williams about an earlier incident that had taken place on July 3, when Wilder threatened to come to the Williams house. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, Williams testified that when his wife told him that Wilder had called her with this threat, he then called Wilder. Wilder \u201csaid that Vivian [Jones] disrespected him for the last time and that he was cornin\u2019 out to our house with a gun.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Williams, who was not at home at the time of the call, instructed his wife, Ursula, to call the police, and an officer responded. When he arrived home, Williams met the officer and discussed the threat. Approximately 20 minutes later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Wilder drove into the cul-de-sac that was adjacent to Williams\u2019s house, made a U-turn, and drove away, apparently seeing the police car that was parked in the circle.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Ursula Williams recalled her telephone conversation with Wilder on July 3. Her niece, Lavivian Jones, had borrowed Wilder\u2019s car, which Mrs. Williams described as \u201ccopperish\u201d in color, and Wilder had called inquiring about the vehicle. Mrs. Williams said that neither Jones nor the car was at the house. Wilder became upset, and threatened to come to the house. According to Mrs. Williams, Wilder said something to the effect that \u201che didn\u2019t care who ... got it.\u201d Mrs. Williams called Jones and told her to return the car, and also called her husband, who in turn instructed her to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">When asked why Wilder was not welcome at their house, Mrs. Williams explained that her husband enforced the ban because there had been \u201cincidents\u201d between Lavivian and Wilder. She elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: And you also said that the defendant was not welcome in your home because of incidents with or between him and Lavivian?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">Q. And what do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">A. Lavivian, she and Aubrey had gone together, but it\u2019s like Vivian always get hurt or somethin\u2019 when she\u2019s with Aubrey, you know. So my husband just \u2014 you know, we don\u2019t believe in that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">Q. What do you mean, hurt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">A. Hit on, beaten.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">THE COURT: All right. The objection\u2019s sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">Defense counsel also requested a mistrial. The trial court denied this motion, noting that, initially, defense counsel failed to object when Mrs. Williams alluded to Lavivian getting \u201churt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">Lavivian Jones testified that on the morning of the shootings, she and Wilder were talking to each other on their cell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>phones. She recalled that they were talking \u201coff and on\u201d at about 2:80 a.m., when Wilder said that he was at a club. Thinking that everyone assumed that Wilder had fired the shots, Jones called him shortly after the shooting \u201cto see what he had to say.\u201d Wilder denied any involvement in the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Troy McLain Wallace lives across from the Williams house. He was awake just before the shooting. He heard four gunshots, and reacted immediately:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">And I was walkin\u2019 down the hallway, and at that time I heard four \u2014 what I would consider four shots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">I then looked out my window. I was already up and walkin\u2019, so I responded to the window probably within a second. And I looked out, and that\u2019s when I viewed the vehicle in the Stowe Court loopin\u2019 and the court and goin\u2019 out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">At that time I dialed 9-1-1. And I could hear my neighbor across the street, and I hollered back to him \u2014 I can\u2019t remember what we said to each other, but it was just to make sure he was all right and just to indicate that I just dialed 9-1-1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">[The car] was a late model Volvo, a bronze, rust, copper-color car. It\u2019s kinda hard to describe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">[PROSECUTOR:] What style of Volvo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">A. It\u2019s a little boxy, station wagon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">Q. And had you seen that car before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am, the day before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">Q. The day before. Okay. Did you know who that car belonged to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">A. The defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-15\">Q. When you saw it the day before, did you see the defendant with that car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-16\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Wallace also recounted the scene that took place the afternoon before the shooting. He could tell that \u201cthere was some problems[,]\u201d and recalled that there was an argument that \u201cwas gettin\u2019 kinda hostile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Detective Hanna<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was the lead investigator, and it was he who arrested Wilder at his cousin\u2019s house on Northwood Drive. Two cell phones were recovered incident to the arrest. Wilder was then taken to the station, where Hanna interviewed him after advising him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Wilder denied shooting at the house, asserting that he would never shoot at a house where his child was living. He did describe how he had been \u201cdisrespected\u201d by Jones, and was also angry with Jones\u2019s cousin Robert. Hanna recalled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">Well, this is what I\u2019m hearing from Aubrey, the defendant. He\u2019s telling me that he\u2019s being disrespected by this individual, by this other male, who has no right to come in, in his opinion \u2014 and, frankly, in mine too. I agreed with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">He has no right to come into this. And he actually would call Aubrey names ... he was very disrespectful to [Wilder].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">And it turned out that [Wilder] ended up leavin\u2019 \u2014 leavin\u2019 the scene kind of in a ... very hastily and in a very angry tone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Wilder told Hanna that he had been at his cousin\u2019s house from 10:00 p.m. on the evening before the shooting until the time he was arrested \u201ca little before lunch.\u201d Over objection by defense counsel, on hearsay grounds, Hanna recounted that he had confronted Wilder with the fact that cell phone records suggested otherwise, and the fact that people observed his Volvo at the time of the shooting. Wilder continued to deny that he was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Hanna persisted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>I just tried to describe to him where the \u2014 why we havin\u2019 these questions, why this becomes an issue, showing that these hits on those towers indicate that that phone was in the area of the shooting, and then actually moved along the map and ended up hitting on the towers right near North-wood Drive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">Hi H'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">Those towers \u2014 the hits we got on those towers also indicated calls in and out from that phone during the time around the shooting and along that so-called path, what I call it, back to the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">And I had questions to him about certain specific calls ... it deserved some sort of explanation on his part as to why certain numbers were called at certain times of the day and just how those calls were made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">Hi H? *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">He \u2014 he offered no explanation. He said ... other than denying during the interview ... he would continue to say, I can\u2019t help you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Hanna testified at length about mapping Wilder\u2019s whereabouts around the time of the shootings by the use of cell phone tracking and GPS technology. He also determined that the Volvo Cross Country was registered to Wilder.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">The defense called two witnesses. Wilder\u2019s mother, Arlene, recounted that on July 3 her son had been extremely upset over the fact that Jones had taken his car and had not returned it. In August, following the shootings, Mrs. Wilder went to the Williams house at about 4:30 a.m. and took photographs of the Volvo to substantiate her position that it would be impossible to discern the color of the vehicle at night. Dwayne McKenzie offered alibi testimony. He testified that Wilder and he went to clubs in Baltimore in the late evening and early morning of July 24th and 25th, and then returned to McKenzie\u2019s home in Woodlawn at about 4:00 a.m. McKenzie borrowed Wilder\u2019s Volvo to take a companion home, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>and returned to Woodlawn at about 4:30 a.m. Wilder was asleep on the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">We will recite additional facts as they relate to the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AkV\">\n<em>Standards of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The number of issues before us requires the application of several standards of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">We review the trial court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Bernadyn v. State, </em>390 Md. 1, 7, 887 A.2d 602 (2005). With respect to the admission of \u201cbad acts\u201d or \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, we have plenary review over the legal determination of whether the challenged evidence meets a \u201cspecial relevance\u201d exception. <em>Streater v. State, </em>352 Md. 800, 809, 724 A.2d 111 (1999). We review the trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. <em>Miles v. State, </em>365 Md. 488, 569, 781 A.2d 787 (2001). We review <em>de novo </em>the issue of whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain Wilder\u2019s convictions. <em>Hudson v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 488, 523, 832 A.2d 834, <em>cert. denied, </em>378 Md. 618, 837 A.2d 928 (2003). In reviewing for sufficiency, we must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)(emphasis in original). <em>Accord State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533, 823 A.2d 664 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\n<em>1. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Citing the lack of an identification of the shooter and physical evidence linking him to the scene, Wilder claims that the circumstantial evidence adduced at trial is insufficient to establish his criminal agency, or that a handgun was used in the commission of these crimes. The State responds that the first argument has not been preserved, because the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>motions for acquittal were argued on different grounds. The State also contends that there is sufficient circumstantial evidence pointing to Wilder as the gunman, and to the nature of the firearm he employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, the defense moved for acquittals, asserting that the evidence, with respect to first-degree assaults and reckless endangerment counts, failed to establish that the victims in the house were located near the entry points of the four projectiles. Therefore, counsel argues, the inhabitants of the home were not endangered. The defense also asserted that the evidence failed to show that Wilder \u201cever possessed a handgun, ever shot a handgun, that would qualify for being in possession of a handgun in the use of the commission of a crime of violence.\u201d Following the close of all the evidence, the defense submitted on its prior arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">We first take up the State\u2019s argument that Wilder\u2019s sufficiency challenge has not been preserved. Citing <em>Anthony v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 119, 699 A.2d 505, <em>cert. denied, </em>348 Md. 205, 703 A.2d 147 (1997), the State maintains that Wilder\u2019s sufficiency contentions have not been preserved because the arguments he raises on appeal differ from those raised before the trial court. A criminal defendant \u201cis not entitled to appellate review of reasons stated for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Starr v. State, </em>405 Md. 293, 302, 951 A.2d 87 (2008). Thus, Wilder\u2019s appellate contention, that the evidence does not establish his participation in the shootings, has not been preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Assuming that the sufficiency issue has been preserved, <em>see generally Bible v. State, </em>411 Md. 138, 982 A.2d 348 (2009), we conclude that the evidence of Wilder\u2019s involvement was sufficient to sustain his convictions for assault and reckless endangerment. Even discounting the erroneously admitted cell site evidence that, as will be discussed below, should have been presented through expert testimony, the circumstantial case against Wilder is compelling. Maryland \u201chas long held that there is no difference between direct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Hebron v. State, </em>331 Md. 219, 226, 627 A.2d 1029 (1993). Most certainly, a jury may not return a guilty verdict \u201con proof amounting only to strong suspicion or mere probability.\u201d <em>White v. State, </em>363 Md. 150, 163, 767 A.2d 855 (2001). Yet in this case, the jury heard testimony from witnesses who saw Wilder\u2019s Volvo drive from the scene immediately after the shooting; that Wilder had a verbal altercation with Jones and a hostile confrontation with Robert Williams III on the afternoon of the day before the shootings; and that Wilder had previously threatened to come to the Williams house with a weapon.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Taken together, this evidence is sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s finding of criminal agency, and the trial court did not err in denying the defense motions for judgments of acquittal on the assault and reckless endangerment counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">As to the handgun conviction, Wilder asserts that the evidence is insufficient to establish that a firearm, meeting the statutory definition of \u201chandgun,\u201d was employed to fire at the Williams residence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is well-established that \u201cevidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>to support a conviction for a handgun crime is insufficient unless a jury can find beyond a reasonable doubt that the weapon used met the statutory definition of \u2018handgun.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 138, 166, 957 A.2d 654 (2008) (citations omitted). Noting that a handgun was not recovered in this case, we emphasize that \u201ctangible evidence in the form of the weapon is not necessary to sustain a conviction; the weapon\u2019s identity as a handgun can be established by testimony or by inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the case before us, however, we must determine whether ballistics evidence, absent more, is sufficient to permit a reasonable juror to infer that a statutory \u201chandgun\u201d was used by the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">On this record, we conclude that the evidence does not carry the State\u2019s burden of proof on the issue of whether the firearm used in the shootings qualifies as a statutory \u201chandgun.\u201d The State also points out that witnesses heard gunshots, and claims that \u201cthe evidence supported the inference that the firearm used was such that it could be readily concealed, [because] Wilder was able to depart the scene immediately after the shooting occurred without disclosing the firearm\u2019s presence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s arguments. The fact that witnesses heard gunshots does not tend to identify that the firearm was a handgun, but only that an \u201coperable\u201d firearm was employed. As to evidence of concealment, we note that the assailant drove away in darkness. This fact, for example, does not rule out the use of a rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The State is left with the ballistics evidence. We have recognized that, \u201c[u]nder appropriate circumstances ... ballistics evidence may give rise to ... an inference\u201d that the weapon was a handgun. <em>Brown, </em>182 Md.App. at 169, 957 A.2d 654. But the ballistics evidence in the case before us leads only to speculation about whether the firearm used met the statutory definition of \u201chandgun.\u201d Hanna\u2019s testimony on this point is revealing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Were you actually ever able to determine if this was a semi-automatic weapon or a revolver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">A. The only indication I got back from our \u2014 I guess you\u2019d call them, like, a firearms technician, the indication he gave me was, it was more than likely \u2014 and he wasn\u2019t \u2014 he cannot give a certainty \u2014 that it was probably a 9 millimeter-type handgun, and a 9 millimeter\u2019s only fired out of a semiautomatic gun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Again, the trier-of-fact cannot return a guilty verdict \u201con proof amounting only to strong suspicion or mere probability.\u201d <em>White v. State, </em>363 Md. at 163, 767 A.2d 855 (2001). In <em>Brown, </em>we iterated that the calibers of bullets found at the scene of a shooting \u201calone cannot support the inference that a handgun was used.\u201d 182 Md.App. at 172, 957 A.2d 654. The technician\u2019s statement to Hanna, that the provenance of the rounds that were recovered at the Williams house was \u201cprobably\u201d a handgun, does not exclude the fact that the bullets may have been fired by a rifle. The \u201cprosecution\u2019s burden of proof is more than possibly, probably, or likely \u2014 it is beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Kellam, </em>568 F.3d 125, 145 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Michel v. United States, </em>558 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 657,-L.Ed.2d-(2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">We therefore reverse Wilder\u2019s conviction for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\n<em>2. Evidence of Prior Bad Acts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Wilder asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the State to present testimony that Wilder had threatened to come to the Williams house with a weapon. He argues that this evidence of \u201cbad\u201d conduct was \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d and that it would serve \u201csolely to convince the jury that [Wilder] had a criminal propensity.\u201d In a related argument, Wilder contends that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to declare a mistrial after Ursula Williams referred to an instance in which Lavivian Jones had been \u201cbeaten\u201d by Wilder. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The State moved, pre-trial, <em>in limine </em>for the admission of evidence that \u201con July 3rd of 2007 [Wilder] made statements to the homeowner that he planned to bring a gun to the location and start shooting.\u201d The trial court ruled that the State could present this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">During his testimony, Williams recalled that Wilder threatened to come to the house with a weapon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... Describe the circumstances under which you had a phone conversation with the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar2\">[WILLIAMS]: My wife called me ... and told me that he had called her and told her he was cornin\u2019 to our house with a gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">I called him and asked what was goiri on. He said that Vivian disrespected him for the last time and that he was comin out to our house with a gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">And I told him, no, you don\u2019t want to bring that to my house. He says, yeah, he\u2019s cornin\u2019. He said, Mr. Rob, I\u2019m cornin\u2019 up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">And I said, no, you don\u2019t want to come out. Little Rob [Williams III] don\u2019t own that house. Lavivian don\u2019t own that house. This is my and Miss Ursula\u2019s house, so you have no right to bring anything to my house like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACN\">He said, no, I\u2019m comin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">He said, whoever come out, Little Rob, whoever, they goin\u2019 down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">He said, only way that won\u2019t happen, if you put your niece [Jones] out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">And I told him, you don\u2019t tell me who to put in my house and who to let out of my house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-12\">So I told him, if you comin,\u2019 I\u2019ll meet him. And I was there waitin\u2019 on him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">A bench conference ensued, and defense counsel voiced his objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, same objection I put on before during the pretrial motions. This testimony is beyond highly inflammatory. It\u2019s so prejudicial. It has no probative value whatsoever. It\u2019s not going to an ID. It\u2019s going just to inflame the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">He\u2019s talking about a conversation ... three weeks earlier. Nothing was acted upon at that point. The State\u2019s using this solely to show the jury \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s clearly gonna prejudice them against my client. I don\u2019t think I can say anything more clearly than that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The prosecutor responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: It is permitted for the State to use under the <em>Faulkner </em>case, as I argued in my motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">I haven\u2019t gotten to it yet, but there will be testimony that the police were called and did make a report in connection with the incident, which means that there is clear and convincing evidence that the conversation actually took place ... and it goes to an essential element of the State\u2019s case establishing the identity of the person who shot the home. And then we have the defendant making a statement of intent to shoot the home and bring a gun there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">It is extremely probative, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">The trial court overruled the defense objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">After hearing Wilder\u2019s threat, Williams instructed his wife to contact the police, and a cruiser responded. Shortly after Williams returned home, Wilder drove by Williams\u2019s house in the brown Volvo station wagon. Wilder made a U-turn before arriving at the house \u201cbecause [according to Williams] I guess he saw the police sittin\u2019 there in the circle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">The second ruling of which Wilder complains involves the trial court\u2019s refusal to declare a mistrial after Mrs. Williams, in describing the stormy relationship between Jones and Wilder, referred to instances when Jones was \u201cbeaten.\u201d The court sustained counsel\u2019s objection to this testimony, but de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>nied counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial after offering to strike the offending testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">This issue arose during the direct examination of Ursula Williams:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: And you stated that the defendant was not welcome in your home because of incidents with or between him and Lavivian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">A.

The witness testified to prior beatings. We\u2019ve never heard any of this before. She put that before the jury, that he beat her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APy\">THE COURT: Well, the first question, she said that Lavivian got hurt when she was with the defendant. There had been no objection, no motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I didn\u2019t think we were getting into physical beatings. And then that\u2019s where the witness goes, into physical beatings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-16\">Now they\u2019re painting him as a person who beats a woman. I mean, how much more could be put before the jury, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-17\">THE COURT: Well, I can ask that \u2014 I can advise the jury that that answer is stricken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-18\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But it\u2019s still out there, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Wilder\u2019s argument implicates the application of the \u201cpropensity rule\u201d set forth in Md. Rule 5-404(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\">(b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Md. Rule 5 \u2014 404(b). This Rule and \u201cthe common law preclude the admission of other crimes [or other acts] evidence, unless the evidence fits within a narrowly circumscribed exception.\u201d <em>Carter v. State, </em>366 Md. 574, 583, 785 A.2d 348 (2001). In addition, Md. Rule 5-403 requires the exclusion of relevant evidence if its admission proves to be unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The propensity rule is a rule of exclusion. <em>See Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 312, 718 A.2d 588 (1998); <em>Harris v. State, </em>324 Md. 490, 500, 597 A.2d 956 (1991). \u201cEvidence of prior criminal acts is not admissible to prove the guilt of the defendant.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>366 Md. at 583, 785 A.2d 348. The ordinary prohibition against the admission of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence \u201censure[s] that a defendant is tried for the crime for which he or she is on trial and to prevent a conviction based on reputation or propensity to commit crimes, rather than on the facts of the present case.\u201d <em>Sessoms v.

Second, there must be \u201cclear and convincing evidence that the defendant participated in the alleged acts.\u201d ...

Testimony that Wilder had earlier threatened to come to the house with a weapon has special relevance to establishing the identity of the shooter in this case, and it is also relevant to Wilder\u2019s motive for revenge against Jones and Robert. Moreover, the State established the existence of the threats by clear and convincing evidence, based on testimony from both Mr. and Mrs. Williams. Finally, we see no abuse of discretion in the determination that the probative value of this evidence outweighed potential prejudice. Although the trial court did not articulate the basis for its ruling, it overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection only after an extensive argument by the State in favor of admissibility. We presume that the trial judge knew the law and properly applied it in overruling the defense objection to Robert\u2019s testimony. <em>See State v. Chaney, </em>375 Md. 168, 179-80, 825 A.2d 452 (2003) (judges presumed to know the law and apply it properly).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We turn, then, to Mrs. Williams\u2019s reference to the beating of Jones, and Wilder\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial. The court offered to strike the testimony, but counsel declined, stating that \u201cit\u2019s still out there, Your Honor.\u201d In <em>Hubbard v. State, </em>395 Md. 73, 909 A.2d 270 (2006), the issue was whether the trial court erred by declaring a mistrial after the prosecution called a witness, whose testimony against one co-defendant had been suppressed, to identify the other defendant. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>explained that its action was justified by manifest necessity. <em>Hubbard, </em>395 Md. at 87, 909 A.2d 270. The Court of Appeals disagreed that the trial court was required by manifest necessity to grant a mistrial, because there were reasonable alternatives to that action. Relevant to the case before us, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">Other jurisdictions have considered the exclusion of testimony as a reasonable alternative to declaring a mistrial. In <em>State v. Dodge, </em>564 P.2d 312 (Utah 1977), the Supreme Court of Utah considered whether the trial judge\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was proper. The court held that the trial judge correctly declined to grant a mistrial, stating: \u201cThe trial court had other alternatives to the mistrial the appellant requested. A motion to strike or exclude the violating witnesses testimony could have been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313 (also noting that defendants should avail themselves of \u201cless drastic means\u201d to limit possible prejudice before moving for a mistrial).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\"><em>Hubbard, </em>395 Md. at 94, 909 A.2d 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Certainly, \u201c \u2018it is unrealistic to expect jurors to ignore seemingly relevant evidence which they have already heard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McKnight v. State, </em>280 Md. 604, 615, 375 A.2d 551 (1977)). But, we are unable to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to declare a mistrial when counsel declined the court\u2019s offer to strike the testimony. <em>See also Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 603, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984) (\u201c[IJf a question is answered and subsequently an objection is made and erroneously sustained, the erroneous ruling is nonprejudicial in the absence of a motion to strike\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds, Price v. State, </em>405 Md. 10, 949 A.2d 619 (2008). We note that the \u201c \u2018declaration of a mistrial is an extraordinary act which should only be granted if necessary to serve the ends of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooley v. State, </em>385 Md. 165, 173, 867 A.2d 1065 (2005)(citation omitted). On these facts, we find no abuse of discretion in denial of the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Notwithstanding our conclusion, Wilder has waived any challenge to this testimony, because there was no objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>tion when Robert testified that he had seen \u201caltercations\u201d between Wilder and Jones. Further, when Robert was asked on cross-examination whether he was angry with Wilder, he responded, without objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">A. No. Actually, I won\u2019t even say angry.

Yeah. Of course.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">In <em>Williams v.

We also conclude that the State proved Wilder\u2019s earlier acts by clear and convincing evidence, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by implicitly finding that the probative value of this testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>nally, we see no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying the defense motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\n<em>3.

He did surveillance on that location and, sure enough, the defendant came out, and he was placed under arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">In the second part, the part that pertains to this exhibit that [defense counsel] referred to, all Detective Hanna did was obtain certified cellular phone records from Sprint Nextel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">Those certified records show inbound calls, outbound calls, the duration of the call. They show the date that the call was made, they show the originating number, they show the number the call was placed to or came from, and they also show a code that corresponds to longitude and latitude, coordinates that can be plotted on a map to show cell tower locations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">And Detective Hanna took the information from the certified cell phone records and he plotted the towers on a map of the relevant area of Baltimore County, and the certified records show that the calls in question utilized those particular towers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">THE COURT: All right. So these are records that are certified in what way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Certified from Sprint Nextel as business records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">THE COURT: Okay. So he\u2019s taken certified business records. So if they have the proper certification, \u2014 which [defense counsel] may look at \u2014 those records would come into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And I\u2019m not contesting that the records are not certified, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: I will let the Court know that Detective Hanna is, in fact, not an expert. And I am not attempting to qualify him as such, but he was able to do this just using the certified records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">All he did was look at the records and plot out the towers and the calls that correspond to the towers using just the information from the records, and that\u2019s all he\u2019s going to testify about with regard to this particular issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">THE COURT: No, I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">We\u2019ve had that type of testimony before. We have not had that testimony presented in this way before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">[Defense counsel], is there anything else you wish to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHRy\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If you don\u2019t mind, Your Honor. I understand the State \u2014 I didn\u2019t know they weren\u2019t going to try to get in how they followed him. So I guess if they\u2019re not gonna put in testimony how they got to him then that becomes moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">But my worry, as I said, Your Honor, is that a detective\u2019s gonna testify. He\u2019s not gonna be able to answer any of my questions that I would normally put to an expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">And I know the logical conclusion of that is that I should call an expert in rebuttal, but that puts me in a position where they\u2019re gonna proffer testimony that this detective can\u2019t \u2014 he can\u2019t explain anything about this, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">This is a highly technical situation where they are claiming that my client is in the general location. I need to know how big of a tower area this is. I don\u2019t know if he knows the answer to that. I don\u2019t know if he knows what the next closest tower is, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-12\">I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s an expert, but I\u2019m saying it should come in through an expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-13\">I mean, this is highly \u2014 I mean, the evidence that they\u2019re gonna put in is that he is \u2014 his cell phone is in the area at the time of the shooting. I mean, that\u2019s an extremely large part of the State\u2019s case in this case, because there\u2019s no eyewitness to him actually doing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>They\u2019re gonna say, cell phone. And if I don\u2019t have the ability to do any cross examination on that because their detective\u2019s gonna say, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, then I\u2019m left with nothing, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m not left with much on this record to rule at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">Your argument is too sketchy for me at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">He\u2019s taking some records that are certified and he is plotting some points on them. He\u2019s not going to express any opinions after he\u2019s plotted those points.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would assume, and I don\u2019t want \u2014 maybe assuming\u2019s a bad thing. He\u2019s gonna have to express some sort of an opinion that the cell phone was in this area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">THE COURT: No. She said he\u2019s not going [sic] express any opinions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">THE COURT: And, in fact, since he\u2019s not being called as an expert and not being qualified as such, he wouldn\u2019t be able to ex\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-13\">THE COURT: \u2014 to express that opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I guess we\u2019ll have to wait to see how he testifies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-15\">THE COURT: Right. I mean, it sounds like the records\u2014 there\u2019s \u2014 if there\u2019s a proper certification on them, they would be admitted into evidence. And he\u2019s taken those records which are certified and made up some map from them. But there are no opinions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-17\">THE COURT: That\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>THE COURT: All right. So that defense motion at this point is \u2014 it\u2019s not granted at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Initially, when Hanna testified that police obtained Wilder\u2019s cell phone numbers, and that this information was useful for \u201cfinding out a lot about a person through GPS or cell tower hits[,]\u201d there was no objection. Counsel did object, however, when Hanna recounted that he confronted Wilder with the fact that \u201ccellular telephone records\u201d provided information that contradicted Wilder\u2019s version of events. When Hanna described using software to produce a map that depicted locations of cell phone calls, defense counsel objected again, citing a lack of foundation. Later, when the State moved to admit State\u2019s Exhibit 29, described as a \u201cvery enlarged printout of the map,\u201d the cell phone calls, \u201ctower hits,\u201d and other information, counsel objected, without providing a basis. The trial court admitted the exhibit, and no further objections were made when Hanna described in detail what the map portrayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We briefly address the State\u2019s waiver argument. The State asserts that Wilder\u2019s appellate argument differs from that raised before the trial court. The Court of Appeals has emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">the general rule in Maryland [is] that \u201cwhere a party makes a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible evidence, and that evidence is subsequently admitted, the party who made the motion ordinarily must object at the time the evidence is actually offered to preserve [its] objection for appellate review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\"><em>Brown v. State, </em>373 Md. 234, 242, 817 A.2d 241 (2003) (quoting <em>Reed v. State, </em>353 Md. 628, 637, 728 A.2d 195 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">A timely general objection may satisfy this requirement. We believe that Wilder\u2019s challenge to Hanna\u2019s testimony has not been waived. First, after objecting on hearsay grounds, defense counsel made a general objection when Hanna mentioned using cell phone records and cell tower hits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>during his interrogation of Wilder. Defense counsel also made a timely contemporaneous objection to the admission of the evidence that was created by Hanna based on the cell phone records. Hanna\u2019s subsequent testimony reflected his work on the \u201cmap,\u201d the admission of which was subject to counsel\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">We also conclude that, while Wilder offered specific bases for his objection to Hanna\u2019s testimony, both in argument on the motion <em>in limine, </em>and after portions of Hanna\u2019s testimony, his objection to the admission of the map, and Hanna\u2019s accompanying testimony, (State\u2019s Exhibit 29), constitutes a general objection. Recently, Judge Murphy pointed out for the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">The record also shows that Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel interposed a timely <em>general </em>objection to Officer Tucker\u2019s opinion. Under Md. Rule 4-323(a), the Circuit Court could have directed that Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel state the grounds for the objection. The Circuit Court, however, overruled the objection without directing that the grounds for the objection be stated. In <em>DeLeon v. State, </em>407 Md. 16, 962 A.2d 383 (2008), this Court reaffirmed the well settled principle that \u201cparty basing an appeal on a \u2018general\u2019 objection to admission of certain evidence, may argue any ground against its inadmissibility. <em>Boyd v. State, </em>399 Md. 457, 475-76, 924 A.2d 1112, 1122-23 (2007).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24-25, 962 A.2d at 387 (emphasis in original). Under these circumstances, Petitioner\u2019s present argument was not waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\"><em>Johnson v. State, </em>408 Md. 204, 223, 969 A.2d 262 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The Court of Appeals has emphasized that the \u201c \u2018effect of a general objection in this State is far-reaching----We have said that when the trial court does not request a statement of the grounds for an objection, a general objection is sufficient to preserve all grounds which may exist.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyd v. State, </em>399 Md. 457, 476, 924 A.2d 1112 (2007) (quoting <em>Ali v. State, </em>314 Md. 295, 305-306, 550 A.2d 925 (1988)). We shall therefore address Wilder\u2019s challenge to the admission of cell phone location evidence and testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Hanna testified that, once the police suspected Wilder, they sought to obtain his cell phone records. Hanna explained the facility of using the records and derivative methods of charting location:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">Because we\u2019ve used it many other times. It\u2019s a successful tool in locating or finding a lot about a person through GPS or cell tower hits and just ... who they know, who they talk to, the times of day they talk to them, all kinds of different\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">You can get a lot out of a cell phone record and a cell phone signal that\u2019s actually cornin\u2019 off of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">Q. Now, when you say you have used this investigative technique before, can you say how many times in your duties as a law enforcement officer you have used that technique?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">A. Just approximately 25. It may be more, it may be less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ5\">Q. Okay. So once you obtained the cell phone numbers, what \u2014 what did you do next with regard to the cell phone numbers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">Q. All right. And what, if any, certification did you have for those cell phone records?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">A. Certification came from the cell phone company[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Hanna then explained how he used the cell phone records to create a map of call locations from Wilder\u2019s cell phone records.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7f\">Q. Now, Detective, when you got the cell phone records, what \u2014 and I\u2019m talking about after \u2014 not\u2014not anything in terms of locating the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">A. Um-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\">Q. But what, if anything, did you do with the records otherwise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-14\">A.... And then the time even after we located him, after we \u2014 after I even did the interview and all, I tried to figure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>it all out and piece it all together and came up with, basically, the tower locations generally, who was trying to\u2014 or at least addresses of people who were either calling him or he was calling or that the phone was calling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">And I also at some point put together a map using Microsoft Streets and Trips and just tried to map out for my \u2014 for myself to see where these \u2014 these towers were hitting off of and to see kind of when and \u2014 when, where, and how that all came together usin\u2019 the cell phone records that were provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">Q. Okay. What is Microsoft Streets and Trips?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">A. It\u2019s just a Microsoft program that we just happen to use for a lot of our Investigations to do a lot of mapping. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s pretty user friendly as far as allowin\u2019 you to map latitude and longitude on the map without really knowing where the latitude and longitude may be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">It allows you to map addresses, and it allows you to label things and kind of manipulate it for presentation or maybe some other type of use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">We only use it for, obviously, puttin\u2019 together maps and just kinda givin\u2019 people an idea of where this stuff is that we\u2019re talkin\u2019 about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Detective, I\u2019m going to show you what\u2019s been entered into evidence already as State\u2019s Exhibit 23. And if you could, please\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">Well, what is State\u2019s Exhibit\u2019s 23?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">A. It\u2019s the cell phone records provided by Sprint Nextel Corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">Q. Okay. Can you please explain to the jury what information is on this particular page of the records, the first page?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-13\">A. Okay. Well, they\u2019re kinda coded at the top. Some of them don\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. But the first column is actually the target number, or in this case one of the cell phones he was using.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>A. The second column is the date of when the call took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">The third column \u2014 third column is the call initiation time, or when the call started.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">The fourth column is the duration of the call in seconds. That actually will pick up \u2014 whether someone picks up the phone or not, it still records from the time you hit the talk button on your cell phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">The type of call is the next column. It just simply says inbound or outbound, meaning outbound meaning he made \u2014 or the person using this phone made the call, and inbound meaning somebody called the phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">And then the following two columns are the coded originating and terminating cellular phone tower sites. It starts with originating and ending and terminating. Those columns sometimes have the same exact information in them and other times they \u2014 the 24 towers will be different in each column.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">Q. Okay. And the \u2014 what is it that actually appears in these two columns, originating cell site and terminating cell site? What is all of that \u2014 what are all of those letters and numbers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">A. It\u2019s basically the code \u2014 for whatever reason, they decide to use a code of some sort at Nextel Sprint that doesn\u2019t mean anything to anybody unless you have \u2014 unless you ask them or you look at a spreadsheet of what this code means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">And it basically correlates to latitude/longitude, and they even actually sometimes label a cell site tower with an address and things like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-12\">Q. Okay. Do you have access to the spreadsheet that converts these codes to longitude and latitude?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-14\">Q. Okay. And if you have that, what can you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>A. Well, once I figure out that this code means a certain latitude/longitude then I just simply \u2014 using that Microsoft Streets and Trips program, you search for that latitude/longitude, and it pinpoints it on the map.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAD\">Q. Okay. And did you do that in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1J\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqvA\">Q. And did you create a map?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax2\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">At this point, defense counsel objected, citing the lack of a proper foundation for the map because it was derived from records that had not been certified. Following a discussion at the bench, questioning resumed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">THE COURT: All right. There was an objection but there was no pending question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Detective, you just testified that you created a map.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-13\">Q. And to create that map you used records that you received when?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-14\">A. The day of the crime, July 25th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-15\">Q. Okay. Have you since that time had an opportunity to view a certified copy of these same records?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-17\">Q. And, in fact, were you able to view the certified copy that has been already entered into evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit Number\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-18\">THE CLERK: 22 and 23.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-19\">[PROSECUTOR]: \u2014 22 and 23?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-20\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-21\">Q. And from looking at those, were you able to make any determination as to whether or not the information you had in July of 2007 that you used to create the map is the same as the information that is contained in the certified records entered into evidence today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-22\">A. Yes. It matched exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Q. Okay. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">I\u2019ll show you, Detective, what has been marked as State\u2019s Exhibit Number 29. What is State\u2019s Exhibit 29?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">A. That is a very enlarged printout of the map that I created on my laptop usin\u2019 Microsoft Streets and Trips.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWj\">Q. Okay. And would you be able to, step by step, explain exactly how you created this map?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">Q. Okay. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">A. Okay. Well, basically, like I said before, after getting the longitude and latitude for every originating and terminating cell cite tower, I would use those longitudes and latitudes to find a \u2014 find the locations on the map.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">I also correlated that with the phone call \u2014 or the phone number associated with that tower hit; the direction of the call, meaning the outbound or inbound; the time of the call; and the duration of the call in seconds. All that information\u2019s on the map. The map\u2019s also numbered in chronological order from the time I have the first bit of information, which I believe starts at 4:29 a.m. on July 25th, and ends on the same date at 5:55 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">Basically, the numbers \u2014 all the numbers on the map are tower hits other than Number 5 and 12; 5 is the location of the shooting and the time \u2014 the approximate time it occurred, and Number 12 is the location of where Aubrey, the defendant, was arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">So I just chronologically made a \u2014 basically, a time line on a map showing when the shooting occurred, the calls surrounding that shooting, and the locations of where the towers are hitting off of those calls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-12\">Q. Okay. And the numbers that appear in these white boxes, were they obtained from the cell phone records?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjM\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-13\">Q. And did you have an opportunity to view these locations actually in real life to verify that the cellular phone towers are where they appear to be on this map?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">Q. Okay. And you checked everyone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: State\u2019s going to move to admit 29.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiR\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">THE COURT: All right. Exhibit 29 will be admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Maryland Rule 5-702 governs expert testimony, and provides in relevant part: \u201cExpert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Md. Rule 5-702.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See </em>6 L. McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 702:3 at 734-35 (2001 &amp; 2009 Supp.). \u201c[E]xpert testimony is admissible only if it is relevant,\u201d and \u201csuch evidence is relevant if the jury will find the testimony helpful in resolving the issues in the case.\u201d <em>Bomas v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 204, 208, 956 A.2d 215 (2008) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>412 Md. 392, 987 A.2d 98 (2010).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Wilder asserts, in the words of his brief, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVI\">[t]he admission of Detective Hanna\u2019s testimony directly contradicts the holding of <em>Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 870 A.2d 609 (2005). In <em>Ragland, </em>the Court of Appeals held that \u201cMd. Rules 5-701 and 5-702 prohibit the admission of \u201clay opinion\u201d testimony based upon specialized knowledge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>skill, experience, training, or education.\u201d An expert from the cell phone company or an engineer familiar with cell phone technology would have been the proper person to testify as to those matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Ragland was convicted of distribution of cocaine. Among the State\u2019s witnesses were two police officers who opined, over objections, that, based on their observations, Ragland had been engaged in a drug transaction. Neither officer had been proffered or qualified as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On appeal, Ragland asserted that the testimony of the officers characterizing the transaction they observed as a \u201cdrug transaction\u201d was expert testimony. He claimed that the trial court erred in admitting this testimony because neither officer had been identified as an expert in the State\u2019s required discovery, and also because the State failed to qualify them as experts at trial. The Court of Appeals agreed with Ragland, and ruled that the opinion testimony of those officers was expert testimony, given the nature of their conclusions. Such testimony was inadmissible because the discovery and evidentiary predicates had not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Examining relevant conflicting authority in light of the amendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence that became effective in 2000, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">We think the better view in interpreting the rule regarding opinion testimony is the more narrow one, and the view as expressed in the amended Fed.R.Evid. 701. We also agree with the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and those courts that have found that by permitting testimony based on specialized knowledge, education, or skill under rules similar to Md. Rule 5-701, parties may avoid the notice and discovery requirements of our rules and blur the distinction between the two rules. Accordingly, we will follow the approach as reflected in the 2000 amendment to Fed.R.Evid. 701 and hold that Md.

The Court concluded that the \u201capproach as reflected in the 2000 amendment to Fed.R.Evid. 701\u201d offered an appropriately narrow interpretation of the rule, which would preserve the distinction between lay and expert opinion testimony. Indeed, the Federal Rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">[had] been amended to eliminate the risk that the reliability requirements set forth in Rule 702 will be evaded through the simple expedient of proffering an expert in lay witness clothing. Under the amendment, a witness\u2019 testimony must be scrutinized under the rules regulating expert opinion to the extent that the witness is providing testimony based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702. <em>See generally Asplundh Mfg. Div. v. Benton Harbor Eng\u2019g, </em>57 F.3d 1190 (3d Cir.1995). By channeling testimony that is actually expert testimony to Rule 702, the amendment also ensures that a party will not evade the expert witness disclosure requirements set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 and Fed.R.Crim.P. 16 by simply calling an expert witness in the guise of a layperson. <em>See </em>Joseph, <em>Emerging Expert Issues Under the 1993 Disclosure Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, </em>164 F.R.D. 97, 108 (1996) (noting that \u201cthere is no good reason to allow what is essentially surprise expert testimony\u201d, and that \u201cthe Court should be vigilant to preclude manipulative conduct designed to thwart the expert disclosure and discovery process\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Figueroa-Lopez, </em>125 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.1997) (law enforcement agents testifying that the defendant\u2019s conduct was consistent with that of a drug trafficker could not testify as lay witnesses; to permit such testimony under Rule 701 \u201csubverts the requirements of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(E)\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Federal Judicial Conference, Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, <em>Report of the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules (Committee Note to Rule 701) </em>at 26-27 (1999), <em>reprinted in </em>Court Rules: Amendments to Federal Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Evidence (Committee Note to Rule 701), 192 F.R.D. 340, 416-17 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Although we shall hold that the use of cell phone site location evidence and the accompanying testimony of a law enforcement officer who explained its use require the qualification of the sponsoring witness as an expert, we recognize authority permitting the lay testimony of a police officer with respect to cell site location. In <em>Perez v. State, </em>980 So.2d 1126 (Fla.App.3d Dist.), <em>rev. denied, </em>994 So.2d 305 (Fla.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>556 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1618, 173 L.Ed.2d 1003 (2009), the defendant asserted that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting custodians of cellular telephone records to testify about the relative locations of cell phone callers and the cell phone tower that was identified with those calls. Perez contended that such testimony was beyond the expertise of the records custodians. The Florida court rejected that argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">We find that the testimony of ... the records custodians from Sprint-Nextel and Metro PCS, did not constitute expert testimony under section 90.702, Florida Statutes (2007), and therefore was properly admitted. As in <em>Gordon v. State, </em>863 So.2d 1215, 1219 (Fla.2003), the record demonstrates that Plasmir \u201csimply factually explained the contents of phone records.\u201d As in <em>Gordon, </em>the custodians factually compared the locations on the phone records to locations on the cell site maps. Plasmir testified that a typical cell site covered an area of one to three miles. She then stated that the record for a particular cell phone details the actual cell tower off of which the call bounces. This testimony constituted general background information interpreting the cell phone records which did not require expert testimony. It did not reveal the precise location within that one to three mile radius from which the calls were generated. It only served to explain the concept of a cell site and how it generally related to cellular telephone company records. Moreover, there was no direct evidence presented by the defendant to dispute these generalized facts or question their validity. <em>Compare United States v. Sepulveda, </em>115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>F.3d 882 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that scientific cell site analysis is necessary to determine liability for unauthorized use of cellular air time). A juror\u2019s own knowledge, experience and familiarity with the addresses of the receiving cell towers themselves as shown on the site map coupled with the familiarity of the location of the origin of the calls were sufficient for each juror to determine the location of the tower without the need for expert testimony. <em>See McGough v. State, </em>302 So.2d 751 (Fla.1974). Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the defendant\u2019s objections and denying the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial where the cell phone records and accompanying testimony were properly introduced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><em>Perez, </em>980 So.2d at 1131-1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Taking into account the narrow approach of <em>Ragland, </em>we believe that the better approach is to require the prosecution to offer expert testimony to explain the functions of cell phone towers, derivative tracking, and the techniques of locating and/or plotting the origins of cell phone calls using cell phone records. Other jurisdictions have adopted that procedure. In <em>Wilson v. State, </em>195 S.W.3d 193 (Tex.App.-San Antonio-2006, no pet)., the defendant contested the trial court\u2019s admission of the testimony of a Sprint employee, claiming that she was not qualified. The Texas appellate court rejected this challenge, and its description of the witness\u2019s credentials and experience merits our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">The State called Sprint employee Danko as the custodian of Wilson\u2019s cellular phone records to lay the appropriate predicate under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. Tex.R. Evid. 803(6). The records were admitted, but in addition to being the custodian of the records, the State also sought Danko\u2019s opinions as an expert regarding the interpretation of those records based on her training and experience. Danko explained that the signal from a cellular phone is transmitted from cellular towers, usually transmitting from the tower closest to the person placing the phone call. If the individual is moving, the signal may be pulled from a different tower. The phone records denote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the first tower accessed when the call began and the last tower utilized when the call ended. Each tower has a general range of up to three miles, with three different sectors showing the direction of the call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">Danko explained that the location of the cellular towers and Wilson\u2019s cellular phone records reflect a map of Wilson\u2019s movements</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">Danko\u2019s training and experience allowed her to understand and interpret the computer generated records. The trial court determined Danko possessed \u201cspecialized knowledge which the court believes could or would assist the trier of facts to understand something that is in issue and ... her skill, experience, training and knowledge,\u201d would provide assistance to the jury on the point at issue. It is reasonable to conclude, given Danko\u2019s background, that her explanation of the reports and the information contained therein, specifically the incoming and outgoing calls, cell tower locations and general technology with regard to tracking cellular calls, would assist the trier of fact to better understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. See Tex.R. Evid. 702. The record further supports that officers and emergency vehicles relied on Danko to make similar interpretations on a daily basis. Under this record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Danko\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFR\"><em>Wilson, </em>195 S.W.3d at 200-202.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In <em>State v.

The defendant sought to rebut the expert\u2019s testimony through his own personal \u201cknowledge regarding cellular towers.\u201d <em>Manzella, </em>128 S.W.3d at 608-09. The trial court permitted the defendant to \u201ctestily about certain aspects of his cellular bill, such as telephone calls made and received and charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, the trial court refused to permit the defendant to offer rebuttal testimony because the defendant \u201cwas not qualified to discuss the portion of the record referring to cellular towers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Missouri intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of this testimony, concluding, as did the trial court, that \u201c[d]efendant did not demonstrate how his experiences as a Cingular customer qualified him to testify about cellular towers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We recognize that cellular telephone technology has become generally understood. <em>See e.g., Pullin v. State, </em>272 Ga. 747, 534 S.E.2d 69, 71 (2000) (noting expert opinion that \u201cbasic properties of cellular technology are well understood\u201d and judicial acceptance of \u201cbasic principles of cellular technology\u201d). Moreover, the use of telephone company cell phone records for investigative purposes has been noted in Maryland cases. <em>See, e.g., Whiting v. State, </em>389 Md. 334, 338, 885 A.2d 785 (2005) (police traced calls using subpoenaed records of victim\u2019s cell phone); <em>Pantazes v. State, </em>141 Md.App. 422, 435, 785 A.2d 865 (2001) (records suggested that call from victim\u2019s phone to defendant\u2019s phone not made from victim\u2019s house), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 Md. 241, 792 A.2d 1178 (2002). <em>Cf. Ragland v. State, supra, </em>385 Md. at 710, 870 A.2d 609 (police used cell phone records to confirm calls made from pay telephones under surveillance); <em>Triggs v. State, </em>382 Md. 27, 30 n. 1 &amp; 32 n. 2, 852 A.2d 114 (2004) (use of records to establish number of calls made to victim). It may well be that information in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>cellular phone record about when a call was placed, and whether it was from or to the subscriber\u2019s cell phone, could readily be discerned by a juror familiar with his or her own cell phone bill. But, as Professor McLain has pointed out, \u201c[n]o longer need the subject matter be so far \u2018beyond the ken of laymen\u2019 that the finder of fact could not have any understanding of the particular issue without expert help.\u201d McLain, <em>supra, </em>Maryland Evidence \u00a7 702:3 at 735-36 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In the case before us, Hanna\u2019s testimony implicated much more than mere telephone bills. He elaborated on the information provided by the cell phone records \u2014 the bills and records of calls \u2014 by his use of a Microsoft software program to plot location data on a map and to convert information from the cellular phone records in order to plot the locations from which Wilder used his cell phone. This procedure clearly required \u201csome specialized knowledge or skill ... that is not in the possession of the jurors[.]\u201d <em>Ragland, </em>385 Md. at 720, 870 A.2d 609 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Following <em>Ragland, </em>the Court of Appeals has reiterated that \u201copinions based on a witness\u2019s \u2018training and experience ... should only [be] admitted as expert testimony, subject to the accompanying qualifications and discovery procedures.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>408 Md. at 225, 969 A.2d 262 (quoting <em>Ragland, </em>385 Md. at 709, 870 A.2d 609). Hanna\u2019s description of the procedures he employed to plot the map of Wilder\u2019s cell phone hits was not commonplace. Because his explanation of the method he employed to translate the cell phone records into locations is demonstrably based on his training and experience, we conclude that he should have been qualified as an expert under Md. Rule 5-702, and that the State was obliged to fulfill its discovery obligations under Md. Rule 4-263(b)(4)(2006). The trial court ought not have permitted Hanna to offer lay opinion testimony about the cell site location, and to describe the map created based on the cellular telephone records.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">As we have concluded, the error in the admission of Hanna\u2019s testimony was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The Court of Appeals has articulated the standard for harmless error in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). In cases of established error, that error will be deemed harmless if a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict. <em>See id. </em>at 659, 350 A.2d 665. <em>See Washington v. State, </em>406 Md. 642, 656, 961 A.2d 1110 (2008) (citations omitted). We cannot so declare.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We cannot say, based upon our independent review of the record, that the error in the admission of Hanna\u2019s opinion testimony, did not contribute to the verdict in this case. The evidence was used for the sole purpose of placing Wilder at or near the scene of the shootings at the Williams residence. That, we believe, is compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\n<em>4.
