On December 7, 2006, a jury trial was held in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, Maryland, before Judge Donald C. Davis. The jury found appellant guilty of two counts each of burglary in the second degree, burglary in the fourth degree, and theft over $500, and one count of wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun in a vehicle on public roads. The judge sentenced appellant to an aggregate sentence of 33 years in prison, with all but 17 years suspended, and five years probation. Appellant was also ordered to pay restitution to the owners of the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">On appeal, appellant presents four issues<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for our review, which we have condensed into two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">I. Did the trial court err in denying the motion to suppress appellant\u2019s statement to police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">II. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion in hmiting appellant\u2019s examination of two witnesses?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In June 2006, Fratelli\u2019s Restaurant was burglarized twice. The first burglary occurred early in the morning on June 23, 2006. At approximately 2 a.m., Sergeant Brian Waller of the Salisbury University Police Department reported to the restaurant in response to a security alarm, but did not see anything when he arrived. Nicholas Sakellis, one of the owners of Fratelli\u2019s Restaurant, testified that he discovered the restaurant had been burglarized when he arrived at about 9 a.m. He testified that he found the restaurant\u2019s side-door locked, an office window broken, a crowbar on the desk in the restaurant\u2019s office, and a Fratelli\u2019s bank bag missing. According to Sakellis, the missing bank bag contained seven or eight thousand dollars. He testified that nothing else was taken from the restaurant. Eugene Peed, a Salisbury University employee, testified that he saw a dark-colored Honda parked in the back of Fratelli\u2019s early in the morning on June 23, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In the early morning hours of June 25, 2006, Fratelli\u2019s was burglarized again. Sergeant Waller responded again, along with Officer Kelly Craven of the Salisbury University Police Department. Sergeant Waller testified that they saw a red Oldsmobile Alero parked in the restaurant\u2019s parking lot, and it was warm to the touch. He stated that Officer Craven informed him that the car had not been there when she patrolled the area earlier that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Both Sergeant Waller and Officer Craven testified that, when they went to inspect Fratelli\u2019s, a man ran out of the restaurant and fled. Sergeant Waller chased him on foot, as did Sergeant Anthony Glenn, another police officer who responded to the scene of the burglary. Sergeant Waller and Officer Glenn lost sight of the suspect, searched the Salisbury University campus for forty-five minutes, but did not locate the man.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Sergeant Waller testified that he momentarily got a view of the man\u2019s side profile, and for the most part, only saw the man\u2019s back or his \u201cback side at an angle.\u201d He described the man as six feet tall, slenderly built, light-skinned black or dark-skinned white, and wearing a light colored ball cap and a white t-shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">At about 8:30 a.m., on June 25, appellant was arrested in the Fratelli\u2019s parking lot when he arrived in a dark-colored Honda Accord with Corey Clark, Jessica Murphy, and Jose Luis Gonzales Ruperto. Appellant was driving the Honda toward the Alero, which was owned by Clark. Several officers testified that Ruperto was acting \u201cantsy,\u201d \u201cnervous, [and] kind of flighty\u201d as he moved \u201call over the back of the [Honda]\u201d and reached down \u201cunderneath the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d Appellant was described as being out of it, going \u201cin and out of being asleep and awake\u201d while seated in the car. Sergeant Waller testified that at one point, appellant was \u201claid over the steering wheel making a sound that sounded to me like he was snoring with his eyes shut and drool.\u201d Comparing appellant and Ruperto with the suspect he had chased hours before, Sergeant Waller testified that, although Ruperto was a little taller, he could not exclude either of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">During a search of the Honda, officers found a handgun under the driver\u2019s seat and tools that matched the color and brand of the crowbar that was left at Fratelli\u2019s following the first burglary. The Alero was also searched; in the glove compartment officers found appellant\u2019s wallet containing his Maryland driver\u2019s license, social security card, and $810 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Officer Bobbie Jo Donoway drove appellant to the Sheriffs Office following his arrest. Officer Donoway testified that, during the transport, Mr. Rodriguez went \u201cfrom one extreme to the other;\u201d he was \u201ccompletely enraged\u201d one moment and then \u201cfalling] asleep\u201d the next. According to Officer Donoway, appellant\u2019s \u201ceyes were extremely red, and he was very upset.\u201d Officer Donoway testified that she asked him a series of questions in an effort \u201c[t]o calm him down and to make sure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>that he was, in fact, okay.\u201d She testified that, at one point appellant said: \u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this, I\u2019m already in trouble, I\u2019m going to jail, I did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">At appellant\u2019s trial, on December 7, 2006, Clark and Murphy testified for the State. Clark stated that she had known appellant for a couple months, and they had spent a lot of time together. In the beginning her relationship with appellant was \u201csexual,\u201d but then they were \u201cjust friends.\u201d Clark testified that she would use heroin and crack cocaine with appellant. Clark stated that on the evening of June 24, she and appellant were at \u201c[sjome house over on the west side\u201d with Murphy, Ruperto, and a Puerto Rican man. According to Clark, she, Murphy, appellant, and Ruperto were all \u201cgetting high\u201d over the course of the next 12 hours. Clark testified that appellant left the house around 3 a.m. on June 25 and returned a couple hours later without her car. Clark also testified that she remained in one room the entire night with Murphy and Ruperto, and was \u201cawake that whole time.\u201d Clark also testified that a few days before June 25, she saw a bank bag in appellant\u2019s car and appellant \u201call of a sudden\u201d was in possession of a large sum of money that he kept in stacks folded in a towel in his closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Murphy testified that on the evening of June 24, she, Clark, appellant, Ruperto, and some other men were at a house on the west-side. Murphy admitted that she, Clark, appellant and Ruperto were doing drugs and engaging in sexual activities. Murphy stated that appellant left the house sometime in the early morning for \u201cmaybe an hour and 45 minutes.\u201d She only learned that appellant had left when she noticed that Clark\u2019s car was not outside the house. Murphy testified, as did Clark, that later in the morning of June 25, appellant drove her, Clark, and Ruperto to Fratelli\u2019s restaurant to pick up Clark\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Appellant testified in his own defense. According to appellant, on the evening of June 24, 2006, he and Ruperto rode in appellant\u2019s Honda to meet Clark and Murphy in the parking lot of Fratelli\u2019s Restaurant. Appellant testified that Clark and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Murphy were in Clark\u2019s Alero, and the four agreed to leave the Alero at Fratelli\u2019s so that they could ride in one car to buy drugs for the night. Appellant testified that they then drove to a house \u201cjust to have sex and use some drugs.\u201d Appellant testified that the four left the house in his Honda and returned to Fratelli\u2019s parking lot to pick up Clark\u2019s car. Finally, appellant stated that the cash in his wallet was part of the $2000 that his parents had sent him to rent an apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The defense also called Ruperto to testify. Outside the presence of the jury, Ruperto invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when asked about the burglaries. With the jury present, Ruperto was questioned about the gun found under the driver\u2019s seat of appellant\u2019s Honda and invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Following Ruperto\u2019s testimony, Deputy Mark Walker took the stand. Deputy Walker testified that Ruperto admitted to him that the gun was his. Deputy Walker explained that, after Ruperto testified at appellant\u2019s trial, Ruperto was taken to the holding area. At some time thereafter, Ruperto started beating on the holding cell door. Deputy Walker asked him if there was something wrong. Ruperto responded, in broken English, \u201cgun mine, charges mine, he\u2019s innocent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">At the conclusion of trial on December 7, 2006, the jury returned a verdict, finding appellant guilty of two counts of burglary in the second degree, two counts of burglary in the fourth degree, and two counts of theft over $500, and one count of wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun in a vehicle on public roads. The judge sentenced appellant to 15 years\u2019 in prison with all but seven years suspended on one count of second degree burglary, to a consecutive 15 years\u2019 imprisonment with all but seven years suspended on the other count of second degree burglary, and to a consecutive three years\u2019 incarceration on the hand gun charge. Appellant was placed on five years\u2019 probation upon release from incarceration. The remaining convictions merged for sentencing purposes. Appellant was also ordered to pay restitution to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>owners of Fratelli\u2019s Restaurant. On December 26, 2006, appellant timely noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">We will set forth additional facts and proceedings below as necessary to discuss the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Motions Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">On December 1, 2006, at a motions hearing, the defense sought to suppress statements made by appellant to Officer Donoway while appellant was being transported to the Sheriffs Office in her patrol vehicle following his arrest. The defense moved to exclude appellant\u2019s statements, arguing that his statements were obtained in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) and additionally were not voluntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Officer Donoway was the only witness who testified at the suppression hearing. Her testimony is set forth in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: State[ ] your name and agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">[WITNESS]: Deputy [ ] Donoway with the Wicomico County Sheriffs Office, currently assigned to the SRO Division.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: On June 25th of 2006 at approximately 9:46 a.m., were you working at the Sheriffs Office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">[WITNESS]: Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: What was your assignment at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-16\">[WITNESS]: I was actually assigned to the airport duty when I was called to a different location to transport a subject for detectives at our agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-17\">[PROSECUTOR]: What location were you called to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-18\">[WITNESS]: 306 South Salisbury Boulevard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-19\">[PROSECUTOR]: Is that Fratelli\u2019s Restaurant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-20\">[WITNESS]: Yes, it is, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: When you went to that location, did you make contact with someone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">[WITNESS]: I did. I made contact with First Sergeant Tim Robinson who advised me that I needed to transport a subject for the detectives to the Sheriffs Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Had you had any involvement in the investigation of that case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">[WITNESS]: I did not. I [was] working the airport prior to the transport.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you have any involvement in the investigation after the transport?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">[WITNESS]: No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Who was the subject that Sergeant Robinson asked you to transport?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">[WITNESS]: He didn\u2019t actually advise me of the subject\u2019s name prior to the transport. I found out later that it was Jose Luis Rodriguez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Do you see that person in the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-13\">[WITNESS]: Yes, sitting at the defense table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: And the record reflect she identified [appellant]. Were you in a marked police car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-15\">[WITNESS]: Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-16\">[PROSECUTOR]: Where did you place [appellant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-17\">[WITNESS]: In the front seat passenger\u2019s side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-18\">[PROSECUTOR]: Was he in handcuffs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-19\">[WITNESS]: Yes, he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-20\">[PROSECUTOR]: Do you have any information regarding whether he was advised of his Miranda rights prior to transport?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-21\">[WITNESS]: I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-22\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you advise him of Miranda rights before transport?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-23\">[WITNESS]: I did not. I did not place him under arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: During the transport, were you intending to interrogate him for investigative purposes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">[WITNESS]: No, I was [not],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Describe what happened during the transport, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">[WITNESS]: Actually, the other officers placed him in my patrol vehicle. When we were in route back [appellant] became very angry and upset using profanity. He was enraged that he was being taken into custody. He went from moments of complete outrage[ ] to that he seemed like he was going to pass out. I kept asking [appellant], are you okay? He was mumbling things. Sometimes he used profanity and I couldn\u2019t understand him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">One of the things he said to me was I can\u2019t do this anymore, I have to stop this. [Appellant] then slumped down into the seat and his eyes were extremely red, and I was concerned that something was wrong with him. So I asked him, again, are you okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">[Appellant] replied, yes. I asked [appellant] \u2014 what [ ] lead to this was that he was upset. He said that he didn\u2019t do anything, that he was going to go to jail. And I asked [appellant], I said, have you been arrested before because, you know, that\u2019s something to consider if you haven\u2019t been arrested before. I don\u2019t know why you are so upset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">He had made the comment, yes, for taking a car. I can\u2019t keep doing this. I\u2019m already in trouble. I\u2019m going to jail. I did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">After that, I placed [appellant] into a cell at the Sheriffs Department and I let detectives know that he was there, and he was fine, and I let them know some of the comments that he had made because I wasn\u2019t familiar with [appellant] or anything that was going on at Fratelli\u2019s, but obviously, he was upset about something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: What was your purpose in speaking to [appellant] during the transport?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>[WITNESS]: I was concerned. Like I said, he went from moments of outrage to anger where I was trying to calm him down during the transport to where he acted like he was going to pass out. So I didn\u2019t know if he was okay. If I needed to take him to the hospital. So I wanted the detectives to also know that he went from one extreme to the other, you know, in case there was an episode with them when they actually came back and spoke to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: What was your purpose in asking, have you been arrested before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">[WITNESS]: I was trying to calm the subject down. Obviously, he did not want to go to jail. I was trying to make him feel better. If he didn\u2019t have a record, you know, maybe things would work out better for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Was your purpose in speaking to [appellant] to obtain incriminating information, statements from him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">[WITNESS]: No, it was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did he appear to you to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">[WITNESS]: I\u2019m not sure if he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol or if he was suffering from sleep deprivation. I\u2019m not sure. He was not acting in his right mind, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you make any threats to [appellant] before, during transport?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">[WITNESS]: No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you make any promises to him to get him to speak to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-14\">[WITNESS]: No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Apply any coercion to him whatsoever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-16\">[WITNESS]: No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-17\">[PROSECUTOR]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-18\">Your witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-19\">CROSS-EXAMINATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You indicated, and these are my words, you indicated that he was out of it. Is that a fair characterization of what was [going] on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And he was coming back into the ability to converse with you and then he didn\u2019t have the ability to converse with you, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">[WITNESS]: He went from using profanity and cussing me out and every single law enforcement officer out that was at the scene to not talking and acting like he was going to go to sleep. Those are the two extremes that he was going back and forth from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The particular statement that I\u2019m concerned about is the statement where at the end of the statement is, I did it. That was a statement that he made immediately following your question, have you ever been arrested before, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">[WITNESS]: Actually, he made other comments before he said, I did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I understand that, but the question that you offered to him most recent in time prior to him saying I did it was have you ever been arrested before, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">[WITNESS]: To the best of my knowledge, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And when you asked him have you ever been arrested before, he answered the question that he had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">[WITNESS]: He didn\u2019t say, yes, I had. He said, I keep doing this. I\u2019m already in trouble. I\u2019m going to jail. I did it. He did not say he had actually been in jail, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you record that statement in some way in terms of notes or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-15\">[WITNESS]: Yes. Actually when I came back to the Sheriffs Department, I spoke to the detectives, and they asked me to write a supplement in which I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The questions, are you okay, were those questions that were out to [appellant] before, after, or both before and after the point in time that you asked the question, have you ever been arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">[WITNESS]: During the entire transport, I kept asking him if he was okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So you asked him that question after you asked him, have you ever been arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3jX\">[WITNESS]: Yes. I asked him if he was okay when I placed him in the cell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">How many times did you ask him that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqv\">[WITNESS]: I can\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The extent of your interaction with [appellant] lasted just during the period of time of transport in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">[WITNESS]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Then you placed him in a cell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVK\">[WITNESS]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Any other law enforcement officers in the car during the time of transport?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">[WITNESS]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t have any further questions of this witness, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">In denying defense counsel\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-17\">Well, here, I agree with [defense counsel] at least in part.

Specifically, appellant contends that Officer Donoway\u2019s questioning of appellant constituted custodial interrogation and was not subject to an exception from <em>Miranda </em>for questions relating to routine booking or public safety, \u201cas it did not occur during routine booking and was not justified by an emergency.\u201d Further, appellant argues that Officer Donoway\u2019s questions were the functional equivalent of custodial interrogation, because she should have known that her questions were likely to elicit an incriminating statement from appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Finally, appellant contends that the trial court improperly interpreted <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980), when it based its decision \u201con whether a direct response to the question \u2018Have you ever been arrested before?\u2019 would be incriminating.\u201d The proper inquiry under <em>Innis, </em>appellant asserts, was \u201cwhether, under the totality of the circumstances, Officer Donoway\u2019s <em>questions </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response, not whether a <em>direct response </em>to her questions would have been incriminating.\u201d (Emphasis in original). According to appellant, a correct application of <em>Innis </em>would have led the court to the conclusion that, \u201c[gjiven [appellant\u2019s] impaired mental condition, his emotional volatility, and his demonstrated tendency to ramble in response to the officer\u2019s initial questions, Officer Donoway should have known that continued question<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ing was likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d We disagree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In <em>Miranda, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Custodial interrogation refers to \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a suspect is in custody, \u201c[p]rior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\u201d <em>Id. A </em>person may waive the effectuation of his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights, \u201cprovided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">It is well established that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required in the absence of interrogation. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 300, 100 S.Ct. 1682 (\u201cIt is clear therefore that the special procedural safeguards outlined in Miranda are required not where a suspect is simply taken into custody, but rather where a suspect in custody is subjected to interrogation.\u201d); <em>see also Ashford v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 1, 37, 807 A.2d 732 (2002). In <em>Innis, </em>the Supreme Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A01\">the term \u201cinterrogation\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682 (footnote omitted). In other words, custodial interrogation involves \u201ceither express questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300-01, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Appellant\u2019s initial argument focuses on the phrase \u201cexpress questioning\u201d in <em>Innis. </em>Appellant puts forth a two-part analysis. First, appellant contends that Officer Donoway\u2019s questioning of appellant constituted \u201cexpress questioning,\u201d because she directly questioned appellant when appellant was in custody. Second, appellant argues that the only exceptions to the \u201cexpress questioning\u201d test of <em>Innis </em>are where the officer\u2019s questions relate to routine booking or public safety. Appellant, in effect, contends that any question posed by a law enforcement officer to a suspect in custody, other than a question relating to routine booking or public safety, constitutes \u201cexpress questioning,\u201d under <em>Innis </em>and thus is violative of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The legal basis for appellant\u2019s argument was rejected by the Court of Appeals in the recent case of <em>Prioleau v. State, </em>411 Md. 629, 984 A.2d 851 (2009). In <em>Prioleau, </em>undercover detectives observed the petitioner enter a home at 1610 Regester Street, emerge with a bag of suspected cocaine, and hand the bag to Keith Evans, who strolled back and forth on Regester Street engaging in \u201chand to hand transactions\u201d with individuals who approached. <em>Id. </em>at 633, 984 A.2d 851. The police then arrested Evans and escorted him into the house at 1610 Regester Street, where numerous torn clear plastic bags were found on the floor, indicating drug activity in the house. <em>Id. </em>at 634, 984 A.2d 851. The petitioner was also arrested, driven to 1610 Regester Street, and was walked up to the entrance of the house by the arresting officer. <em>Id. </em>When the petitioner reached the front door, a detective was standing there. <em>Id. </em>The detective said to the petitioner: \u2018What\u2019s up, Maurice?\u201d <em>Id. </em>The petitioner then said: \u201cI\u2019m not going in that house. I\u2019ve never been in that house.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The Court of Appeals held that the above statements by the petitioner were not the product of either actual interrogation or its functional equivalent. <em>Id. </em>at 639, 984 A.2d 851. The Court began its analysis by observing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As6\">it is clear that (1) Petitioner was \u201cin custody\u201d when he made the inculpatory statement, and (2) none of the exceptions to the requirements of <em>Miranda v.

The Court quoted with approval the case of <em>Johnson v.

The Court concluded that the question \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Maurice?\u201d did not constitute actual or express interrogation contemplated by <em>Miranda.

Judge Moylan wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">What Precisely is <em>Miranda </em>Interrogation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">In its simplest form, interrogation is an easy concept to grasp. It is a police officer asking a question of a suspect about the suspect\u2019s involvement in a crime. At the edges, however, the concept can get a little blurry. It is not always an orchestrated set of alternating questions and answers. Every actual question, moreover, is not necessarily followed by a question mark. It has been the more shadowy concept of the functional equivalent of interrogation that <em>Miranda </em>has had to come to grips with in terms of its applicability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 540-41, 974 A.2d 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Therefore, \u201cexpress questioning\u201d under <em>Innis </em>refers to the commonly understood concept of interrogation, namely, a law enforcement officer asking a question of a suspect in custody about the suspect\u2019s involvement in a crime or where, under the totality of the circumstances, the officer knew or should have known that the question was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>none of Officer Donoway\u2019s questions asked appellant about his involvement in a crime. Officer Donoway\u2019s repeated questions, \u201care you okay?,\u201d sought information about appellant\u2019s physical well-being. Officer Donoway\u2019s somewhat garbled question, \u201cI asked [appellant] \u2014 what lead to this was that he was upset,\u201d was not an inquiry into appellant\u2019s involvement in a crime. Finally, the key question of \u201chave you ever been arrested before,\u201d was directed toward appellant\u2019s prior contact with the criminal justice system and not with appellant\u2019s involvement in an earlier crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Nevertheless, appellant argues that Officer Donoway\u2019s questioning \u201cwas still interrogation because Officer Donoway should have known that her questions were likely to elicit an incriminating response from [appellant].\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In <em>Hughes, </em>the Court of Appeals stated that the \u201c[assessment of the likelihood that an otherwise routine question will evoke an incriminating response requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances in each case, with consideration given to the context in which the question is asked.\u201d 346 Md. at 95, 695 A.2d 132. The intent of the police may be helpful in the analysis, but it is not dispositive. <em>See State v. Conover, </em>312 Md. 33, 44 n. 6, 537 A.2d 1167 (1988); <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301 n. 7, 100 S.Ct. 1682 (\u201cThis is not to say that the intent of the police is irrelevant, for it may well have a bearing on whether the police should have known that their words or actions were reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response.\u201d). The police, however, \u201ccannot be held accountable for the unforeseen results of their words or actions.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 302, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Here, the question that produced appellant\u2019s incriminating response was \u201chave you ever been arrested before.\u201d Appellant asks us to inquire, \u201cwhether, under the totality of the circumstances, Officer Donoway\u2019s <em>questions </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response, not whether a <em>direct response </em>to her question[ ] would have been incriminating.\u201d The problem with this contention is that at the motions hearing defense counsel argued only that \u201can objective officer under the circumstances might expect that <em>a question </em>dealing with [appellant\u2019s] prior criminal behavior ... might elicit an incriminating response.\u201d (Emphasis added). Defense counsel did not claim that any other question, alone or in combination, played a role in causing the incriminating response. Thus appellant\u2019s challenge to the other questions posed by Officer Donoway has not been preserved for appellate review. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(a). Nevertheless, we will consider all of the questions posed by Officer Donoway to appellant as a part of our consideration of the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Officer Donoway was not involved in the investigation of the robberies at Fratelli\u2019s restaurant either before or after the transport of appellant to the Sheriffs Office. She was working at the airport when she was told to transport \u201ca subject\u201d to the Sheriffs Office. Officer Donoway did not know appellant\u2019s name and was not familiar \u201cwith [appellant] or anything that was going on at Fratelli\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">During the transport, appellant displayed extreme mood swings \u2014 he \u201cbecame very angry and upset using profanity\u201d and then \u201che seemed like he was going to pass out.\u201d He kept going back and forth between the extremes. When appellant acted like he was going to pass out, Officer Donoway asked him if he was okay. The purpose of the question was to determine if Officer Donoway needed to take him to the hospital. Appellant answered \u201cyes\u201d (he was okay), and when they arrived at the Sheriffs Office, Officer Donoway told the detectives that appellant \u201cwas fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">During the times that appellant was angry and using profanity, Officer Donoway tried to calm him down. She asked appellant, in effect, why was he upset. Appellant answered that he did not do anything and that he was going to jail. Officer Donoway then asked him, \u201cI said, have you ever been arrested before <em>because, you know, that\u2019s something to consider if you haven\u2019t been arrested before.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Officer Donoway testified that she was trying to make appellant \u201cfeel better,\u201d because if he did not have a record, \u201cmaybe things would work out better for him.\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cyes, for taking a car. I can\u2019t keep doing this. I\u2019m already in trouble. I\u2019m going to jail. I did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">It is clear that Officer Donoway\u2019s only job was to transport appellant to the Sheriffs Office; she played no role in the criminal investigation of the robberies at Fratelli\u2019s restaurant. During the transport, Officer Donoway was called upon to respond to appellant\u2019s behavior. Her questions were directed to finding out if appellant was okay when he appeared to pass out or to calming him down when he was angry and using profanity. Officer Donoway testified that she had no intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>of interrogating appellant during the transport for investigative purposes and that her purpose in speaking to appellant was not to obtain incriminating statements from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Regarding the precise question at issue, \u201chave you ever been arrested before,\u201d we agree with the trial court that the question was \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the criminal investigation of the instant case, and that appellant\u2019s initial answer, \u201cyes, for taking a car,\u201d was \u201ccertainly not inculpatory so far as this particular case is concerned because what is inculpatory here relates to the circumstances and facts of this case, not some other case ... for which he may have been arrested.\u201d After having answered Officer Donoway\u2019s question appropriately, appellant proceeded to spontaneously make four statements having nothing to do with the question, the last of which was \u201cI did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">After a consideration of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the transport of appellant to the Sheriffs Office by Officer Donoway, we cannot conclude that Officer Donoway should have known that her question to appellant, \u201chave you ever been arrested before?,\u201d was \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\u201d from him. <em>See Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682. Appellant\u2019s response, \u201cI\u2019m already in trouble. I\u2019m going to jail. I did it,\u201d was \u201ca classic \u2018blurt,\u2019 to which the protections of <em>Miranda </em>do not apply.\u201d <em>Prioleau v.

Thus, \u201c[o]rdi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>narily, the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s inculpatory statement is determined based on a totality of the circumstances test.\u201d <em>Harper, </em>162 Md.App. at 72, 873 A.2d 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Maryland non-constitutional law, however, \u201c \u2018requires that \u201cno confession or other significantly incriminating remark allegedly made by an accused be used as evidence against him, unless it first be shown to be free of any coercive barnacles that may have attached by improper means to prevent the expression from being voluntary.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Harper, </em>162 Md.App. at 73, 873 A.2d 395 (quoting <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 307, 765 A.2d 97 (2001)). Under Maryland non-constitutional law a confession is involuntary when a defendant \u201cis so mentally impaired that he does not know or understand what he is saying,\u201d or when the confession \u201cis induced by force, undue influence, improper promises, or threats.\u201d <em>Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 482-83, 536 A.2d 622 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">There is no evidence of force, threats, improper promises, or coercion of any kind. Appellant only challenges his statements under Maryland non-constitutional law because he claims that his mental impairment prevented him from knowing or understanding what he said. Accordingly, the \u201c \u2018crucial question\u2019 \u201d becomes \u201c \u201cwhether [appellant\u2019s] disclosure[ ] to the police w[as] freely and voluntarily made at a time when he knew and understood what he was saying.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 536 A.2d 622 (quoting <em>Wiggins v.

Appellant answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question, \u201care you okay?\u201d When asked whether he had been arrested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>before, appellant answered \u201cyes, for taking a car.\u201d Appellant\u2019s responses to Officer Donoway\u2019s questions convinced Officer Donoway that appellant was okay and that he was not in such a condition that he had to be taken to the hospital. In fact, upon arriving at the Sheriff\u2019s Office, Officer Donoway informed the detectives that appellant \u201cwas fine.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the State met its burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that appellant was not so mentally impaired that he did not know what he was saying or understand what was being said to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">When considering the totality of the circumstances under the State and Federal Constitutional provisions, we also conclude that appellant\u2019s statements were voluntary. Appellant was being transported to the Sheriffs Office by one officer who had no knowledge of appellant or the crime under investigation; appellant had been arrested before and thus was familiar with the process; he correctly answered the questions posed to him and his answers demonstrated that he understood the severity and consequences of his actions; and Officer Donoway was not forceful or vociferous, but rather attempted to ease some of appellant\u2019s concerns and calm him down. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we are persuaded that appellant freely confessed to Officer Donoway that he committed the burglary. Therefore, the motions judge did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Examination of Two Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Appellant argues that the trial court \u201cinfringed on [appellant\u2019s] right to present a full defense by not allowing him to introduce evidence implicating third-party guilt,\u201d which was the defense theory at trial. First, appellant contends that the court improperly limited defense counsel\u2019s examination of Sakellis regarding whether he ever suspected that Saul Hernandez, a former employee of Fratelli\u2019s, committed the burglary, when there was \u201ca police report recording Sakellis\u2019s suspicions.\u201d Appellant insists that the excluded evidence was more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>than a \u201cblind allegation,\u201d and its weight \u201cwas for the jury to decide.\u201d Second, appellant argues that \u201cthe trial court abused its discretion by not allowing the defense to question [Ruperto] about the burglaries,\u201d when there was evidence that Ruperto \u201cwas a plausible alternative suspect in the burglaries.\u201d Appellant also asserts that the court\u2019s erroneous exclusion of evidence implicating Hernandez and demonstrating Ruperto\u2019s involvement in the burglaries was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u201cThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights guarantee a defendant in a criminal case the right to confront the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Ebb v.

State, </em>320 Md. 300, 307, 577 A.2d 356 (1990) (citations and internal quotations omitted). The trial court thus conducts a \u201cbalancing test:\u201d the trial court \u201cmust allow a defendant wide latitude to cross-examine a witness as to bias or prejudices, but the questioning must not be allowed to stray into collateral matters which would obscure the trial issues and lead to the factfinder\u2019s confusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307-08, 577 A.2d 356 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Sakellis</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">In his brief, appellant states that, immediately following the first burglary, Sakellis told police that he suspected that Hernandez had committed the first burglary. Appellant now complains that the court should have allowed him to question Sakellis regarding this statement and present the police report to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">At trial, defense counsel inquired into this matter during the cross-examination of Sakellis. Defense counsel asked Sakellis whether anyone by the name of Saul Hernandez had ever worked for him, and Sakellis responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Defense counsel pressed the issue further and the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your testimony today is that you didn\u2019t speak to law enforcement officers on the 23rd day of June and told them that you suspected that Saul Hernandez had committed the burglary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-12\">Move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-13\">THE COURT: Basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: It\u2019s not relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, my theory is that someone other than [appellant] committed this crime.

Absolutely no proof whatsoever to make that allegation even if he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-14\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-15\">I will sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">Later in the trial, defense counsel asked the trial court to revisit this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Had I been permitted to, I would ask some [ ] further follow-up questions on a subject of [ ] Hernandez based on a report I received. My understanding is that [] Sakellis told the police officer who responded on the date of the first burglary that he believed that [Hernandez], a Hispanic employee who had worked for him for a few days had committed this crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-18\">[ ] Sakellis indicated that he had employee papers with [Hernandez\u2019s] information on his desk and that Sakellis said that [Hernandez\u2019s] employee information was also missing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Also, I want on the record, Your Honor, that he gave absolutely no foundation for drawing that conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">THE COURT: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: And has testified here today that nothing else was missing except the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">THE COURT: Well, I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">It seems to me ..., what is the purpose for which you want to pursue this line of inquiry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I just want to develop as many plausible alternative suspects as I can for [appellant\u2019s] benefit. We have fingerprint testing that was available in the sense that there were fingerprints suitable for comparison found that were not compared to anyone beside my client under circumstances where [ ]. Sakellis believed that this person may have been involved because certain items were taken during the course of the burglary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">I believe that he is a plausible alternative suspect who should have been investigated, was not investigated, and is to the detriment to my client, that\u2019s the only reason I am making an issue out of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">You are not seeking to ask these questions from the impeachment standpoint. You are not trying to impeach [ ] Sakellis, but only to show that there is another plausible suspect who was not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s the purpose, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-14\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-15\">All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-16\">Well, I will sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-17\">Based on our review of the record, we agree with the State that appellant\u2019s allegation that Hernandez was a suspect \u201clacked any foundation.\u201d Defense counsel clearly stated that the purpose of his inquiry was not to impeach Sakellis; it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\u201cto develop as many plausible alternative suspects ... for [appellant\u2019s] benefit.\u201d The record, however, fails to support appellant\u2019s proffer as to what Sakellis\u2019 proposed testimony would have been. Sakellis had already testified that Hernandez never worked for him and that nothing was missing from the restaurant after the first burglary, except the money. Thus Sakellis had denied the very facts that appellant was seeking to elicit from him. Absent a factual predicate for defense counsel\u2019s further questioning regarding Hernandez\u2019s connection to the burglary, the court\u2019s allowance of the requested cross-examination would have served only to confuse the jury. <em>See Smallwood, </em>320 Md. at 307, 577 A.2d 356. Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the prosecutor\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Ruperto</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Defense counsel also called Ruperto as a witness to establish that Ruperto was a plausible suspect with respect to the burglaries and the firearm counts. Prior to Ruperto\u2019s taking the stand, Ruperto\u2019s counsel informed the court that Ruperto intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in response to all questions. The court permitted defense counsel to question Ruperto regarding his involvement in the burglaries outside the presence of the jury. In response to all questions, Ruperto exercised his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The court then permitted defense counsel to question Ruperto in front of the jury concerning the handgun recovered from under the driver\u2019s seat of appellant\u2019s Honda. Ruperto exercised his Fifth Amendment privilege as to all questions asked regarding the handgun. Appellant asserts that the court erred in refusing to allow defense counsel to question Ruperto about the burglaries before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>We need not address the merits of appellant\u2019s contention because, even assuming an abuse of discretion, appellant was clearly not prejudiced by the court\u2019s ruling. <em>See Nottingham Vill, Inc. v. Balt. County, </em>266 Md. 339, 356, 292 A.2d 680 (1972) (noting that the trial court\u2019s decisions regarding matters concerning the nature and scope of cross-examination will only be disturbed upon a showing of a prejudicial abuse of discretion). After Ruperto asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege before the jury, he was taken to a holding cell where he admitted to Deputy Walker that the handgun was his. Defense counsel was allowed to reopen his case and call Deputy Walker as a witness. Deputy Walker testified that Ruperto told him in broken English, \u201cgun mine, charges mine, he\u2019s innocent.\u201d Because Ruperto\u2019s confession to the gun and the \u201ccharges\u201d was before the jury, we conclude that appellant has not shown prejudicial abuse of discretion occasioned by the refusal of the trial court to allow defense counsel to question Ruperto about the burglaries before the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMICO COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-11\">.

Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). I believe that Officer Donoway violated Rodriguez\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights the moment that her dialogue with him shifted from general inquiries about his well-being to specific inquiries about his prior arrest record.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980), defined the meaning of \u201cinterrogation\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. The rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>in <em>Innis </em>is clear: \u201cinterrogation\u201d includes both \u201cexpress questioning\u201d by a law enforcement officer and also \u201cwords or actions on the part of police officers that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301-02, 100 S.Ct. at 1689-90 (emphasis removed). The majority interprets <em>Innis </em>in light of the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Prioleau v. State, </em>411 Md. 629, 984 A.2d 851 (2009), to hold that Donoway\u2019s questioning of Rodriguez did not violate his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In that case, the Court of Appeals held that defendant Maurice Prioleau\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights were not violated when a detective asked Prioleau \u201c[w]hat\u2019s up, Maurice?\u201d at the scene of Prioleau\u2019s arrest. <em>Prioleau, </em>411 Md. at 632, 984 A.2d at 852. The Court stated that it was not reasonably likely that the detective\u2019s greeting in that case would elicit an incriminating response. <em>See id. </em>at 651, 984 A.2d at 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In my opinion, the majority construes <em>Prioleau </em>far too broadly. In the present case, Donoway\u2019s comments are by no means as innocuous as those at issue in <em>Prioleau. </em>Had Donoway gone no further than repeated inquiries into whether Rodriguez was \u201cokay,\u201d she would not have run afoul of <em>Miranda. </em>Instead, she chose to question Rodriguez as to his past history with law enforcement and arrests, a topic that had nothing to do with calming him down, as she claimed, and everything to do with evoking a conversation about his problems with the law, including the circumstances of his present arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Donoway\u2019s question to Rodriguez is clearly distinguishable from the question posed in <em>Prioleau, </em>which was permissible in part because it did not involve \u201ca question on anything that [involved] illegal activity.\u201d <em>Prioleau, </em>411 Md. at 651, 984 A.2d at 864. Regardless of whether Donoway was credible in explaining that she had no intention of eliciting incriminating statements from Rodriguez through her questioning, her remarks do not pass muster under the objective standard imposed by <em>Innis. </em>446 U.S. at 301-02, 100 S.Ct. at 1689-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Because Donoway\u2019s questioning of Rodriguez was unconstitutional interrogation under <em>Miranda, </em>Rodriguez\u2019s statements to the officer should be suppressed.
