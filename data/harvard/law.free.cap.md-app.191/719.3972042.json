KENNEY, III, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AJf\">(Retired, Specially Assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">This appeal arises from a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County filed on March 27, 2007, by appellant, Kristin Herlson. She sought a declaration of her rights under a contract for the purchase of a condominium unit then under construction in the Palladian Condominium at Rockville Town Square in Montgomery County. The action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>was resolved in favor of appellees, RTS Residential Block 5, LLC, and RTS-RD Rockville Investments II, LLC, the sole member and manager of RTS Residential Block 5, LLC (collectively referred to as \u201cRTS\u201d), and against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In her complaint, appellant alleged that amendments made by RTS to the Public Offering Statement (\u201cPOS\u201d) materially affected her rights as a purchaser of the condominium and permitted rescission of the agreement by written notice to the seller within five days of receipt of the amendments. But, when she attempted to rescind her purchase contract, RTS refused to return appellant\u2019s deposit and to acknowledge rescission of her contract. Appellant requested that the circuit court: (1) adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to the contract; (2) declare that the changes made to the POS were substantial and material; and (3) declare that she had the right to rescind the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">RTS filed an answer to the complaint for declaratory judgment seeking dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> RTS alternatively requested that the court declare that the changes made to the POS were neither substantial nor material and that appellant did not have the right to rescind her contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">On November 16, 2007, appellant moved for summary judgment, which the court denied on January 23, 2008. At trial, on December 17, 2007, RTS\u2019s oral motion for judgment was denied, but, after hearing all of the testimony, the circuit court found in favor of RTS and, on December 24, 2007, filed a notice of judgment in RTS\u2019s favor. This timely appeal followed, presenting three issues for our review, which we have consolidated into two:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>I. Whether the trial court erred in its interpretation of \u00a7 126 of the Maryland Condominium Act [(the \u201cMCA\u201d), Md.Code Ann. (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 11-126 et seq. of the Real Property Article (\u201cReal Prop.\u201d).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">II. Whether the trial court erred in finding that the changes made to the condominium documents in the instant case did not materially affect the rights of the plaintiff as purchaser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">In 2005, appellant, an employee of the Mayhood Company, was assigned to perform sales and marketing tasks with respect to Rockville Town Square, a new community being developed by RTS in Montgomery County. She was given the opportunity to be one of the first purchasers of one of the condominium units that RTS had available for sale. Because of her employment, she was familiar with the POS relating to the sales contract for the condominiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">On June 4, 2005, appellant entered into a sales contract for the purchase of a residential condominium unit in the Palladian Condominium, then under construction. The \u201cinitial sales price was $403,900,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and [a]ppellant made a deposit of $20,200.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Appellant\u2019s Sales Contract at Addendum #4, Repurchase Addendum, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>[I]n farther consideration of the mutual promise of the parties, the parties agreeing to be legally bound do hereby agree as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">1. Purchaser hereby represents to Seller that he/she is purchasing the Unit as his/her primary, year round residence and covenants and agrees not to lease the Unit until after the Purchaser has occupied the Unit as his/her principle year round residence for twelve (12) consecutive months. .... Seller shall have all remedies at law and in equity to enforce this covenant and agreement against Purchaser____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">2. Purchaser hereby agrees that if Purchaser sells the Unit within the twelve (12)-month period following the date of the Purchaser\u2019s acquisition of title to the Unit, Seller shall receive seventy-five percent (75%) of the Net Sales Proceeds, as defined below, from the sale of the Unit by the Purchaser. In order to induce Seller to sell the Unit to Purchaser, Purchaser agrees that the deed of conveyance from Seller conveying the Unit to Purchaser shall contain a covenant in favor of Seller for seventy-five percent (75%) of the Net Sales Proceeds, as defined below, of the sale of the Unit by the Purchaser if such sale occurs within the Restriction Period. For purposes of the Leasing and Resale Addendum, \u201cNet Sales Proceeds\u201d shall mean the total sales price of the Unit appearing on the settlement statement of the Purchaser, as seller, less the payoff of any bona fide lender holding a first deed of trust on the Unit, less down payment, less customary closing costs in Maryland payable to bona fide third parties unrelated to the Purchaser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">3. It is the intent of the Seller that these provisions are to limit the sale of units to investors and not to limit the flexibility of Purchaser who, in good faith, acquired to own the Unit as his/her primary year round residence. As such, the provisions of this Addendum shall not apply if unforeseen circumstances arise which require Purchaser to sell or lease the Unit prior to expiration of the Restriction Period. Such unforeseen circumstances shall include: [a. Job loss resulting in 10% decrease in annual income; b. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Relocation of employment over 50 miles from the Unit; c. Any reasonable change as approved by the Seller.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-Y\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The sample deed given to appellant as part of the POS included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">SPECIFICALLY RESERVING UNTO SELLER, the right to repurchase from the Purchaser the Unit, Parking Space and Storage Space in the event that Purchaser shall either sell, rent, or lease the Unit, or attempt to sell, rent or lease the Unit during the period that is twelve (12) months from the date of conveyance of the Unit to Purchaser (the \u201cRepurchase Period\u201d). In the event that Purchaser shall, or attempt to, convey, rent or lease the Unit during the Repurchase Period, the Purchaser shall be obligated to notify Seller in wilting and Seller shall for a period of fifteen (15) days following its receipt of such written notice have the right (but not the obligation) to repurchase from the Purchaser the Unit, Parking Space and Storage Space at the same purchase price paid by Purchaser pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Appellant testified that she considered those provisions to be \u201csignificant aspects\u201d of the POS. They were important in her decision to purchase because the restrictions would decrease the number of investment units, and thereby create a stable living environment, less prone to the turnover of leased apartments. In her view, they would ultimately help to increase the value of the condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">On January 31, 2007, appellant received a packet of materials from RTS that included \u201ca few updates\u201d to her POS.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Upon reviewing the documents, she found that the amended sales contract and deed for future purchasers no longer restricted the amount of time a purchaser would be required to occupy his or her unit before renting it and that the time a purchaser would be required to own the unit before selling it had been increased \u201cfrom one to two years.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">When asked, \u201c[H]ow did [the amendments to the POS] affect your thinking of purchasing a condominium,\u201d appellant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">Well, it changed completely in my mind, because to me it affected the character of the community, it affected my investment that I put into it, and in the long run it would affect that, as well. Also, the fact that in those four buildings there are shared amenities, as well as, as the pool, and the fact that now there could be a full tenant occupancy in a building where I\u2019m paying a condo fee to share those amenities didn\u2019t seem fair to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Appellant testified that this change to the condominium scheme would affect \u201cthe character of the community\u201d and her long term investment negatively because buyers intending to occupy the units they have purchased would, presumably, take better care of their units than would more transient renters. According to appellant, had she known that such a change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>might be made to the condominium documents, she would not have contracted to purchase the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Consequently, on February 1, 2007, appellant sent via certified mail, and hand-delivered to RTS, a letter advising that she did not agree with the changes to the POS and requesting the cancellation of her contract and the return of her deposit. RTS refused to cancel the contract or to return appellant\u2019s deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">At the close of appellant\u2019s case, RTS moved for judgment on the basis that appellant could rescind the contract only if the amendments materially affected her rights, and that the amendments did not do so. The circuit court, stating that there was no disagreement between the parties with respect to what the documents said, only with the interpretation of the documents, denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">RTS called as a witness Renee Finley, the attorney who had drafted most of the documents making up the POS at issue in the case, as well as the sales contract and addenda thereto. She testified that the amendment to Addendum 4 to the sales contract, the repurchase addendum, would affect only future sales, not the sale of units already under contract, such as appellant\u2019s. It was Finley\u2019s opinion that the changes to the deed for future purchasers did not in any way change the deed for which appellant had previously bargained.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">H. Michael Schwartzman, vice president and director of development of Ross Development and Investment, testified that Addendum 4 was amended because, after an initial burst of sales of the condominium units at Rockville Town Square, \u201cthe [housing] market slowed, ... the Mayhood Company was replaced for lack of performance,\u201d and the new management recommended that \u201cif [RTS] were to allow renting ..., but extended the sales lockout period, [it] would effectively be neutral but might be able to attract more purchasers.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In his opinion, those decisions and the resulting changes to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>POS documents did not affect appellant\u2019s contract. Appellant\u2019s contract was exactly the same as other purchasers with the same contract who had already settled on their units.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In closing, appellant argued that she was entitled to the benefit of her bargain, which was changed by the developer as a result of Amendment 4 to the POS. She stated that, pursuant to Real Prop. \u00a7 ll-126(e), she was allowed to rescind the contract because changes were made to the purchaser\u2019s POS, which was part and parcel of her contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">RTS argued that appellant had failed to show a single change to her contract, that is, something she bargained for in her individual contract that she did not receive from the developer. According to RTS, it could not have been the intent of the legislature, in enacting the applicable statute, to subject a developer making a change to its POS that did not materially affect a purchaser\u2019s rights to the risk that every purchaser could rescind his or her contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The circuit court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">[Gjoing to the statute that is involved here, I don\u2019t find-looking at every end of the plaintiffs argument, laboring over it and giving the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt in every way that, that we can, I don\u2019t find any of the alleged amendments to materially affect the plaintiffs rights at all. And we\u2019ve gone over every one of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">And I\u2019ve gone over them ad nauseam, because, quite frankly, looked [sic] for a way to grant the plaintiff the relief that she is requesting. But in order for a court to do that, it must be legal. And to do it in this case, I don\u2019t find that you have the leg to stand on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-10\">With respect to leasing unsold units and what the rights were with buyers that were going to come, obviously, after the plaintiff, that didn\u2019t affect this plaintiffs contract. Her contract didn\u2019t change at all. It didn\u2019t affect her rights materially.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>So whether you go through with it and end up living there or not, certainly an argument could be made that a person who buys in a particular neighborhood, notwithstanding what you might think about their opinion regarding whether they\u2019re MPDUs [moderately priced dwelling units] or whether they\u2019re renters or what have you, you may not\u2014 one may not like a buyer\u2019s attitude about that, but in the real world, those are things that people are concerned about.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">And when people buy homes they want to know what kind of neighborhood they\u2019re buying a home in. Right or wrong, they have a right to be concerned about that. And if it, if what you think you\u2019re buying is not what you\u2019re getting because of changes made by the seller, that\u2019s a real concern. It\u2019s a legitimate concern. And there is a place for that argument, it\u2019s just not in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The plaintiffs case had to be based on what it was based upon, and that is the statute. Because real estate contracts in Maryland, and certainly in Montgomery County, are controlled by statute. The contracts themselves are form contracts ... and the terms of these contracts are, are there pursuant to the statute. And unless there is a clear violation of a statute or a breach of one of the terms, it is very difficult for plaintiffs to prevail in situations like this.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">There isn\u2019t anything illegal. There isn\u2019t any violation of a statute that the Court can find in this case. As I said, even though I\u2019ve searched for it, I\u2019ve looked for it, but it\u2019s just not there. They haven\u2019t violated the statute at all. They haven\u2019t made any, any changes that materially affect the, the rights of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Sure, the change, some of the changes, particularly with respect to changing the policies on rental units certainly will affect the plaintiff query [sic], whether it\u2019s material or not, query [sic] it will affect her rights. It certainly will affect her lifestyle. It\u2019ll affect her property values. It\u2019ll affect many things, you know, if she goes through with the contract, which is an option you have.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>But the Court doesn\u2019t find that there\u2019s any violation of the statute here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">* \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">There is still, notwithstanding the Court\u2019s ruling in this case, which \u2014 make it very clear for the, Mr. Clerk here, this is the, a declaratory judgment action, and the Court finds that the plaintiff does not have a right under the statute, as she has argued, to rescind the contract in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Because this case involves the interpretation of Real Prop. \u00a7 ll-126(e), \u201cwe review the Circuit Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>Gleneagles, Inc. v. Hanks, </em>385 Md. 492, 496, 869 A.2d 852 (2005) (citing <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78 (2004) (noting that because \u201cprovisions of the Maryland Code, and the Maryland Rules are appropriately classified as questions of law, we review the issues <em>de novo </em>to determine if the trial court was legally correct in its rulings on these matters.\u201d)); <em>See Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175 (2006) (\u201cAs the question before the Court involves the interpretation and application of Maryland constitutional, statutory and case law, we shall review the case <em>sub judice </em>under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d); <em>Hillsmere Shores Improvement Assoc. v. Singleton, </em>182 Md.App. 667, 690, 959 A.2d 130 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">Declaratory Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Declaratory judgments permit trial courts to \u201csettle and afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations.\u201d Md.Code (2002 Repl.Vol., 2004 Supp.), \u00a7 3-402 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCts. &amp; Jud. Proc.\u201d). The Court of Appeals has held that \u201cwhere a party requests a declaratory judgment, it is error for a trial court to dispose of the case simply with oral rulings and a grant of ... judgment in favor of the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 87, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>660 A.2d 447 (1995). \u201c \u2018[WJhen a declaratory judgment action is brought, and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, the trial court must render a declaratory judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Md. Cas. Co. v. Hanson, </em>169 Md.App. 484, 524, 902 A.2d 152 (2006) (quoting <em>Christ by Christ v. Maryland Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 435, 644 A.2d 34 (1994) (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In <em>Case v. Comptroller, </em>219 Md. 282, 288, 149 A.2d 6 (1959), the Court of Appeals held that \u201cwhether a declaratory judgment action is decided for or against the plaintiff, there should be a declaration in the judgment or decree defining the rights of the parties under the issues made.\u201d <em>See also Md. Cas. Co., </em>169 Md.App. at 524, 902 A.2d 152 (quoting <em>Case </em>and citing <em>Christ by Christ, </em>335 Md. at 435-436, 644 A.2d 34 (\u201c[t]he court\u2019s rejection of the plaintiffs position on the merits furnishes no ground for\u201d failure to file a declaratory judgment)); <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>303 Md. 461, 467, 494 A.2d 934 (1985) (\u201cthe trial judge should have declared the rights of the parties even if such declaration might be contrary to the desires of the plaintiff\u2019), <em>appeal after remand, Broadwater v. State, </em>306 Md. 597, 510 A.2d 583 (1986); <em>East v. Gilchrist, </em>293 Md. 453, 461 n. 3, 445 A.2d 343 (1982) (\u201cwhere a plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment ..., and the court\u2019s conclusion ... is exactly opposite from the plaintiffs contention, nevertheless the court must, under the plaintiffs prayer for relief, issue a declaratory judgment\u201d), <em>appeal after remand, </em>296 Md. 368, 463 A.2d 285 (1983); <em>Shapiro v. Board of County Com\u2019rs, </em>219 Md. 298, 302-303, 149 A.2d 396 (1959) (\u201c\u2018even though the plaintiff may be on the losing side of the dispute, if he states the existence of a controversy which should be settled, he states a cause of suit for a declaratory decree.\u2019 1 Anderson, Declaratory Judgments, Section 318.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In <em>Salamon v. Progressive Classic Ins. Co., </em>379 Md. 301, 307, n. 7, 841 A.2d 858 (2004), the Court of Appeals quoted its decision in <em>Jackson v. Millstone, </em>369 Md. 575, 593, 801 A.2d 1034 (2002), where it instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">\u201c[T]he [trial] court must, in a separate document, state in writing its declaration of the rights of the parties, along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>with any other order that is intended to be part of the judgment. Although the judgment may recite that it is based on the reasons set forth in an accompanying memorandum, the terms of the declaratory judgment itself must be set forth separately. Incorporating by reference an earlier oral ruling is not sufficient, as no one would be able to discern the actual declaration of rights from the document posing as the judgment. This is not just a matter of complying with a hyper-technical rule. The requirement that the court enter its declaration in writing is for the purpose of giving the parties and the public fair notice of what the court has determined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">(Internal quotations and citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Here, the record is devoid of a written declaration of rights, separate from and independent of the circuit court\u2019s judgment. As appellant had petitioned for a declaration of rights, it was error for the court to dispose of the case simply with an oral ruling and a grant of judgment in favor of a party. <em>Harford Mut. Ins. Co. v. Woodfin Equities Corp., </em>344 Md. 399, 414, 687 A.2d 652 (1997). This error, however, \u201cis not jurisdictional and is not fatal to our reaching the merits of [the] appeal.\u201d <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 609, 937 A.2d 242 (2007).

In essence, she contends that \u00a7 ll-126(e) says what it means and means what it says. Because the statutory language is, in her view, \u201cdemonstrably clear and unambiguous,\u201d there was no reason for the circuit court \u201cto undertake an interpretation of \u00a7 ll-126(e).\u201d Having undertaken such an interpretation, the circuit court erred again in determining that the purchaser could rescind a contract for sale only if the changes to the POS <em>materially </em>affected the purchaser\u2019s rights. Moreover, and even if the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of the statutory language was correct, the court erred in concluding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>changes to the POS did not affect materially the rights of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">RTS, on the other hand, contends that \u00a7 11-126(e) of the MCA is rendered ambiguous by \u00a7 11 \u2014 126(d)(1) and (2) and its use of the word \u201capproval:\u201d (1) \u201cmay not amend ... without the <em>approval </em>of the purchaser if the result would affect materially the rights of the purchaser[;]\u201d and (2) <em>\u201cApproval </em>is not required if the amendment is required by governmental authority, or if the amendment is made as a result of events beyond the control of the vendor or in the ordinary course of affairs of the council of unit owners.\u201d According to RTS, \u201capproval\u201d in subsection (d)(1) and (2) is \u201csynonymous\u201d with the purchaser\u2019s rescission rights in subsection (e). We understand RTS\u2019s argument to mean that there is no right to rescission if a purchaser\u2019s approval is not required. According to RTS, appellant\u2019s interpretation of subsection (e) renders subsection (d)(1) and (d)(2) \u201csuperfluous\u201d and ignores \u201cthe transitory nature of condominium development reflected throughout \u00a7 11-126.\u201d That \u201ctransitory nature\u201d is reflected in words like \u201cproposed,\u201d \u201cprojected,\u201d \u201cestimated,\u201d \u201canticipated,\u201d and \u201ccontemplated\u201d used to indicate certain components of the POS.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">We look first, as we must, to the language of the statute itself. Section 126(e) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">[A]ny purchaser may at any time ... within 5 days following receipt of the information required under subsection (d) of this section, rescind in writing the contract of sale \u2022without stating any reason and without liability on his part, and he shall be entitled to the return of any deposits made on account of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The plain language of \u00a7 ll-126(e) is hardly ambiguous. The \u201cinformation\u201d that a purchaser is required to receive under \u00a7 ll-126(d)(3), is \u201c[a] copy of <em>any </em>amendment\u201d to the POS. (Emphasis added.) Once a copy of <em>any </em>amendment is received, the purchaser has 5 days, pursuant to \u00a7 ll-126(e), to rescind the contract. Significantly, the purchaser can rescind the contract without stating <em>any </em>reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Nor are we persuaded that subsections (d)(1) and (2) render the statute ambiguous. Subsections (d)(1) and (2) do deal with amendments to the POS. The first provides that no amendment that \u201cwould affect materially the rights of the purchaser\u201d can be made \u201cwithout the approval of the purchaser.\u201d The latter excepts from the purchaser\u2019s approval those amendments made for reasons \u201cbeyond the control of the vendor or in the ordinary course of affairs of the Council of unit owners,\u201d including an amendment \u201crequired by any governmental authority or public utility!,]\u201d even if such an amendment would \u201caffect materially the rights of the purchaser.\u201d An example might be an access or utility easement that negatively impacts the unit or the common area. Were that the case, should a purchaser not have the opportunity to rescind his contract even if his approval of the amendment is not required? This interpretation is consistent with the fact that subsection (d)(3) does not limit amendments to the POS that must be delivered to the purchaser to those for which approval is required. Instead, it requires the delivery of \u201cany amendment.\u201d By permitting rescission \u201cwithout stating any reason and without liability\u201d on the purchaser\u2019s part, the issue of \u201cmateriality\u201d rests with the purchaser to \u201capprove\u201d the amendment by proceeding to settlement or to \u201cdisapprove\u201d by either rescinding the contract to purchase, or, perhaps, in some instances, renegotiating the contract. In sum, we see nothing in subsections (d)(1) or (d)(2) that indicates a clear intention to limit the purchaser\u2019s rescission rights under subsection (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">From a policy standpoint, the right to rescission based on an amendment to the POS is not illogical. Whether an amendment materially affects the rights of a purchaser may, like beauty, be in the eyes of the beholder. If that issue must be resolved, ultimately, in a court or some other form of adjudicatory tribunal, neither the seller nor the purchaser will benefit when, as it most often is in projects of this nature, time is of the essence. Subsection (e) provides a simple and timely solution by giving the purchaser a narrow window of time to accept or reject an amendment to the POS.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Although we perceive no ambiguity, we have also considered the legislative history of Real Prop. \u00a7 11-126, which was enacted in 1975 as \u00a7 11-124 of the Real Property Article, providing, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">(b) <em>Change in material following delivery to </em>purchaser.\u2014 Any material furnished pursuant to subsection (a) may not be changed or amended following deliver [sic] to the purchaser, if the change or amendment would affect materially the rights of the purchaser, without first obtaining approval of the purchaser.

These materials may be in the nature of unrecorded unexecuted drafts. However, in the event of any change or amendment which would <em>\u201cmaterially </em>affect the rights of the purchaser\u201d then the purchaser must be furnished with the changes or amendments and shall have 5 days following his receipt of the amended materials within which to rescind his agreement of sale. If the purchaser does not elect to rescind within the time provided in subsection ll-124(c), then the amendments shall be considered approved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">The right to rescind created pursuant to subsection 11-124(c) may be exercised by the purchaser without liability. Subsection ll-124(e) prohibits attempts to waive the \u201crights of the purchaser\u201d to receive the information and materials required to be disclosed pursuant to this section and prohibits attempts to waive the \u201crights of the purchaser\u201d to rescind.

According to appellant, RTS breached the contract by representing that appellant was buying into an owner-occupied building with lease and sales restrictions in the first year, and, then, after she signed the sales contract, notifying her that the leasing restrictions promoting owner occupation of the condo complex were no longer in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">\u201cMaterial\u201d is defined by <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>991 (7th ed. 1999) as \u201c[o]f such a nature that knowledge of the item <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>would affect a person\u2019s decision making process; significant; essential[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The District Court of Appeals for the Fourth District of Florida had occasion to interpret \u00a7 718.506 (2009) of Florida\u2019s Condominium Statute, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">(1) Any person who, in reasonable reliance upon any material statement or information that is false or misleading and published by or under authority from the developer in advertising and promotional materials, including, but not limited to, a prospectus, the items required as exhibits to a prospectus, brochures, and newspaper advertising, pays anything of value toward the purchase of a condominium parcel located in this state shall have a cause of action to rescind the contract or collect damages from the developer for his or her loss prior to the closing of the transaction.

The renter lacks some incentive to improve the property because he or she would only benefit from the current enjoyment, not from an increased market value..... [I]t seems obvious that an owner-occupant is both psychologically and financially invested in the property to a greater extent than a renter, [n 10 Surely, the psychology of this is recognized by prospective purchasers, who assess whether to make purchases based in part on expectation that owner-occupant neighbors are likely to make such investments in maintenance.] Personal motivation can surely achieve better results than contractual compulsion in many cases. This is not a matter of reweighing evidence. Both parties\u2019 experts testified that owners maintain property better than do renters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">Here, appellant testified that she would not have purchased the condominium unit had she known she were buying into a rental property complex. We are persuaded that a reasonable buyer would find the change from owner-occupied to renter-occupied to be significant enough to alter the buyer\u2019s decision to enter the contract. Therefore, the amendment to the POS was material to the rights of appellant under the statute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The obvious purpose of the amendment was to increase the sales of units. Whereas the marketing approach under which appellant bought excluded \u2014 or, at least, discouraged \u2014 investor-owners through one-year sale and lease restrictions on the units, the amendment to be applied to future contracts was designed to attract investors by eliminating the one-year leasing restriction. That approach could result in a major change in the character of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">It is quite clear that the original marketing approach was to induce appellant and others to purchase into an owner-occupied condo complex. RTS explicitly represented in the POS sample sales contract the intent to \u201climit the sale of units to investors\u201d and reinforced this intention with a right to repurchase a rented unit in the sample deed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant was entitled to rely on the seller\u2019s representation to her that she was buying into an owner-occupied community when making a $400,000 decision to purchase the unit. We do not characterize the marketing approach as a \u201cbait and switch,\u201d but, the amendment, in our view, entitled appellant and others who bought in under the original terms, to rescind their contracts if they chose to do so within the statutory time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">RTS argues that the sales contract provided that, had the seller not sold all of the units, it would have had the right to directly lease out the apartments. If that happened, appellant could have ended up living in a condominium that included leasees. We do not find this argument particularly persuasive. RTS did not represent that it would not attempt to sell the unsold condo units and seek out only leasees at the time appellant signed the sales contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">RTS made the decision to change the character of the complex for its own financial reasons, and it was entitled to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>so. A seller may determine, for whatever purpose, that the proposed marketing plan and restrictions on the use of units has been unsuccessful. But, when the changes require amendments to the POS, the seller must accept the risk of rescission by purchasers who bought under the earlier proposal. As the circuit court recognized, whether a community is primarily made up of owners or renters is important to the decision to purchase a residence, especially in a common interest community involving shared facilities and costs. The circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">So whether you go through with it and end up living there or not, certainly an argument could be made that a person who buys in a particular neighborhood, notwithstanding what you might think about their opinion regarding whether they\u2019re MPDUs [moderately priced dwelling units] or whether they\u2019re renters or what have you, you may not\u2014 one may not like a buyer\u2019s attitude about that, but in the real world, those are things that people are concerned about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">And when people buy homes they want to know what kind of neighborhood they\u2019re buying a home in. Right or wrong, they have a right to be concerned about that. And if it, if what you think you\u2019re buying is not what you\u2019re getting because of changes made by the seller, that\u2019s a real concern. It\u2019s a legitimate concern.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Section 11-126 was enacted to encourage comprehensive disclosure by sellers and to provide anti-fraud protections to purchasers. For this reason, we are not persuaded that the General Assembly intended to narrowly limit the purchaser\u2019s \u201crights\u201d under Real Prop. \u00a7 ll-126(e) to the property rights provided in a contract for a single unit. Therefore, we are persuaded that it was error for the circuit court to focus only on how the amendment affected appellant\u2019s contract, and, because \u201cher contract did not change at all,\u201d to conclude that the amendment did not \u201caffect her rights materially.\u201d As the circuit court stated, knowing \u201cwhat kind of a neighborhood [a purchaser is] buying a home in\u201d is a \u201creal\u201d and \u201clegitimate concern.\u201d In our view, it is a material concern that, in the circumstances of this case, would permit rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT TO ENTER DECLARATORY JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-8\">. RTS first moved to dismiss the complaint due to appellant's failure to abide by the mandatory arbitration provisions set forth in the sales contract. The circuit court denied the motion, finding that the sales contract also contained a provision, required by the Montgomery County Code, permitting a purchaser to disaffirm the arbitration clause in a contract for the sale of a new home and that appellant had disaffirmed arbitration and was entitled to litigate the matter in the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\">. Appellant also asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8QB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Whether the trial court erred in finding that \u00a7 126(e) of the [MCA] allows a purchaser to rescind the contract of sale only if changes to the condominium documents substantially affect the rights of the purchaser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">We have combined this question with question I, as they ask substantially the same question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-13\">. Appellant later added two parking spaces and a storage facility to the contract, raising the purchase price to $431,800.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b747-9\">. The amendments included the following: 1) change to the proposed Management Agreement to reflect the name of the council of unit owners; 2) change to the sample deeds to units in the Palladian; 3) deletion of section regarding the rights of the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission as inapplicable; 4) changes to sales agreements and sample deeds for future sales to the effect that future purchasers would be prohibited from selling their units for two years instead of one year after purchase without forfeiting a portion of the net proceeds, and future purchasers would have no restriction on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>their ability to lease their units; 5) change to sales agreement for MPDUs (moderately priced dwelling units); and 6) changes to the proposed Management Agreement to reflect the name of the Palladian\u2019s new management agent. While appellant attempted to rescind her sales contract based on her disagreement with all the amendments, in her brief, appellant\u2019s main argument is based on the effect of amendment number 4, the changes to the time restrictions on an owner\u2019s occupancy of the unit before selling or renting it. This opinion will focus on amendment four.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b748-9\">. The documents reflect that the time a purchaser would be required to occupy the unit before selling it had been changed to \"the date that the Seller conveys title to a buyer of the last unit within the Condominium to be sold by Seller (the \u2018Repurchase Period\u2019) (however, in no event shall the Repurchase Period go beyond such time that is two (2) years form (sic) the date of settlement of the Unit by Purchaser)!)]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\">. At the time of trial, of the 152 units in appellant\u2019s building, the Palladian, 75 had been sold and 10 were under rent-to-own contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\">. We recognize that appellant had earlier sought to be relieved from her contractual obligation for reasons unrelated to the POS amendments. That did not appear to play any part in the circuit court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\">. The Sales Contract at Addendum # 4, Repurchase Addendum, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9I\">[I]n further consideration of the mutual promise of the parties, the parties agreeing to be legally bound do hereby agree as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8n\">1. Purchase hereby represents to Seller that he/she is purchasing the Unit as his/her primary, year round residence and covenants and agrees not to lease the Unit until after the Purchaser has occupied the Unit as his/her principle year round residence for twelve (12) consecutive months..... Seller shall have all remedies at law and in equity to enforce this covenant and agreement against Purchaser....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-8\">3. It is the intent of the Seller that these provisions are to limit the sale of units to investors and not to limit the flexibility of Purchaser who, in good faith, acquired to own the Unit as his/her primary year round residence. As such, the provisions of this Addendum shall not apply if unforeseen circumstances arise which require Purchaser to sell or lease the Unit prior to expiration of the Restriction Period. Such unforeseen circumstances shall include: [a. Job loss resulting in 10% decrease in annual income; b. Relocation of employment over 50 miles from the Unit; c. Any reasonable change as approved by the Seller.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">The sample deed given to appellant as part of the POS included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-13\">SPECIFICALLY RESERVING UNTO SELLER, the right to repurchase from the Purchaser the Unit, Parking Space and Storage Space in the event that Purchaser shall either sell, rent, or lease the Unit, or attempt to sell, rent or lease the Unit during the period that is twelve (12) months from the date of conveyance of the Unit to Purchaser (the \u201cRepurchase Period\u201d). In the event that Purchaser shall, or attempt to, convey, rent or lease the Unit during the Repurchase Period, the Purchaser shall be obligated to notify Seller in writing and Seller shall for a period of fifteen (15) days following its receipt of such written notice have the right (but not the obligation) to repurchase from the Purchaser the Unit, Parking Space and Storage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Space at the same purchase price paid by Purchaser pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">. For example, deeds recorded prior to RTS's January 31, 2007 modification of the proposed deed in the POS would presumably include the language in the sample deed. The recordation of these deeds containing the one year lease and sale restriction served to perpetuate RTS's notice to the public that the restriction applied generally to the complex, not to individual units.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
