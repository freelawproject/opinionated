Appellant Maceo Neal (Mr. Neal) appeals the decision of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County affirming the decision of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (the Board), appellee, to deny permanent partial disability benefits for Mr. Neal. Mr. Neal presents one issue for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">I. Whether a victim of crime who loses an eye is entitled to permanent partial disability benefits as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We conclude that Mr. Neal is entitled to permanent partial disability benefits and reverse the decision of the Board to deny Mr. Neal these benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">On July 12, 2002, Mr. Neal was assaulted while he slept in the Division of Corrections. As a result of the assault, his right eye was injured and subsequently had to be removed. The medical work to repair Mr. Neal\u2019s eye was performed by Johns Hopkins University Clinical Practice Association and the bills were sent to Prison Health Services (PHS). PHS paid only a portion of the amount billed to Mr. Neal by Johns Hopkins, leaving an unpaid balance of $1,858.48. In July 2005, Mr. Neal\u2019s counsel attempted to get information from Johns Hopkins\u2019 billing department to find out whether the hospital was pursuing a settlement agreement with PHS to cover the unpaid bills, but he could not reach anyone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">At the time of his injury, Mr. Neal was scheduled for work release. This process was delayed by three weeks due to the injury sustained as a result of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">On November 4, 2004, Mr. Neal filed a Crime Victims\u2019 Compensation Application with the Board and sought to recover for medical expenses and the disability he incurred as a result of the assault. On November 30, 2004, the Board denied his claim for compensation because, it concluded, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>had no unreimbursed medical expenses nor had he lost two continuous weeks\u2019 earnings. On December 22, 2004, Mr. Neal filed a petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. The Board consented to a reconsideration of his case and held a hearing on September 27, 2006. After the hearing, Mr. Neal was awarded $213.87<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in temporary total disability, but he was denied permanent partial disability for the same reason as the original decision, namely, that he had returned to work with no diminution in earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">On January 25, 2007, Mr. Neal sent a letter to the Board requesting that it reconsider its decision. On February 28, 2007, the Board issued its final decision, again denying Mr. Neal permanent disability but granting $213.87 in temporary total disability because the injury had delayed his assignment to work-release employment for three weeks. The Board stated in its final decision that the remainder of the medical bills were being reviewed for payment by other sources. Mr. Neal filed a second petition for judicial review in the Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court on May 7, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">On February 27, 2009, a hearing was held in the circuit court and Mr. Neal requested that the court reverse the Board\u2019s denial of his claim for permanent disability benefits. Mr. Neal asked that the Board be directed to pay his permanent partial disability benefits plus his outstanding medical bills. The court affirmed the Board\u2019s denial in an oral decision, and Mr. Neal timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Mr. Neal contends that the full panoply of disability benefits under Md.Code (1991, 2008 Repl. Vol.), Title Nine, Subtitle Six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>of the Labor and Employment Article are available to crime victims under Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), Title Eleven, Subtitle Eight of the Criminal Procedure (CP) Article (criminal injuries compensation statute). He argues that the Board ignored the plain meaning of the criminal injuries compensation statute and the intent of the General Assembly to assist victims in obtaining disability benefits when the legislature removed the \u201cserious financial hardship\u201d requirement from the statute in 2001. Thus, he argues that a claimant no longer needs to show loss of earnings as a prerequisite to an award of permanent partial disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The Board, on the other hand, contends that its decision to deny the permanent partial disability award was based on a correct conclusion of law. The Board argues that it was correct not to apply the workers\u2019 compensation statutory standards to Mr. Neal\u2019s claim for permanent partial disability because he failed to present any evidence of a loss in earnings or earnings capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Because this is an appeal from a circuit court\u2019s review of an agency\u2019s final decision, our role in this appeal is precisely the same as that of the circuit court. <em>Maryland Secs. Comm\u2019r v. U.S. Secs. Corp., </em>122 Md.App. 574, 585, 716 A.2d 290 (1998). Appellate review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision is ordinarily narrow. <em>Finucan v. Md. State Bd. of Physician Quality Assur., </em>151 Md.App. 399, 411, 827 A.2d 176 (2003). We are limited to determining whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determining if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We are also constrained by the Administrative Procedure Act, set forth in Md.Code Ann., State Government \u00a7 10-222 and \u00a7 10-223, from reversing or modifying the administrative decision unless it is: (1) unconstitutional; (2) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker; (3) results from an unlawful procedure; (4) is affected by any other error of law; (5) is unsupported by competent, material, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>and substantial evidence in light of the entire record submitted; or (6) is arbitrary or capricious. We may not uphold the agency order unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency. <em>Johnson v. Crim. Injuries Comp. Bd., </em>145 Md.App. 96, 106, 801 A.2d 1092 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. <em>Finucan, </em>151 Md.App. at 411, 827 A.2d 176. Therefore, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. <em>Id.; People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. County v. Elm St. Dev., Inc., </em>172 Md.App. 690, 701, 917 A.2d 166 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">When the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, according to their commonly understood meaning, our inquiry ordinarily ends. <em>Fister v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>366 Md. 201, 212, 783 A.2d 194 (2001). Canons of construction are \u201cno more than rules of thumb that help courts determine the meaning of legislation\u201d and we must \u201cpresume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\u201d <em>Connecticut Nat\u2019l Bank v. Germain, </em>503 U.S. 249, 253-54, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992). Therefore, only when a term is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning do we consider extrinsic evidence in order to ascertain its meaning. <em>Fister, </em>366 Md. at 216, 783 A.2d 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">However, the plain-meaning rule is not absolute. <em>Johnson v. Crim. Injuries Comp. Bd., </em>145 Md.App. 96, 111, 801 A.2d 1092 (2002). Rather, the statute must be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body. <em>Id. </em>A Maryland court looks at the larger context, including the legislative purpose, within which statutory language appears. <em>Id. </em>Construction of a statute which is unreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">The Criminal Injuries Compensation Act (the Act) is the statute through which the General Assembly undertook to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>provide a measure of financial assistance in specified circumstances to innocent victims of crime and their dependents. <em>Gossard v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, </em>279 Md. 309, 310, 368 A.2d 443 (1977). The specific provisions at issue in this case are codified in the Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 11-810 of the CP Article, and read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6E\">\u00a7\u00a7 11-810.

Amount of award</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">(a) In general.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">(1) (i) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an award under this subtitle shall be made in accordance with the schedule of benefits, as it existed on January 1, 2001, and degree of disability as specified in Title 9, Subtitle 6 of the Labor and Employment Article and any other applicable provisions of the Labor and Employment Article, except for Title 9, Subtitle 8 of the Labor and Employment Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">(ii) For determining the amount of an award under this subtitle, the term \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d does not include tips, gratuities, and wages that are undeclared on the claimant\u2019s State or federal income tax returns for the applicable years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">(iii) If a claimant does not have \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d to qualify under the formula in Title 9, Subtitle 6 of the Labor and Employment Article, the award shall be in an amount equal to the average of the maximum and minimum awards listed in the applicable portion of that subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">(2) An award for loss of earnings or support made under this subtitle may be up to two-thirds of the victim\u2019s gross average wage, but may not be less than the amount provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-12\">(b) Limits. \u2014 Compensation awarded under this subtitle may not exceed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-13\">(1) for a disability-related or dependency-related claim:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-14\">(i) except as provided in item (ii) of this paragraph, $25,000; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>(ii) if the injury to the victim results in permanent total disability, up to an additional $25,000 after a disability-related claim has been awarded to the victim[ ... ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In its findings of fact, the Board stated that \u201c[t]he claimant suffered temporary total disability for three weeks, after which he was able to begin work-release employment.\u201d The Board\u2019s conclusions of law were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">(1) the claimant is the innocent victim of crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">(2) the claimant satisfied the statutory criteria to qualify for an award for temporary total disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">(3) The claimant, who returned to work with no evidence of diminution in earnings, does not qualify for permanent partial disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The Board awarded $213.87 for the three-week temporary total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">Mr. Neal argues that once he satisfied the statutory criteria outlined in CP \u00a7 11-810<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and showed that the loss of his eye was irreversible, the Board had no discretion to deny him benefits pursuant to the schedule outlined in CP \u00a7 11-811.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>CP \u00a7 11-811 explicitly incorporates benefits under Maryland\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute, which is codified at Title Nine, Subtitle Six of the Labor and Employment Article. Thus, he argues that the loss of his right eye constitutes a permanent partial disability under the statute, and that he is entitled to the schedule of benefits outlined in the workers\u2019 compensation law for the loss of an eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">LE \u00a7 9-627(d)(l)(vi) mandates that compensation shall be paid for 250 weeks for the loss of an eye.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mr. Neal argues that his award should be based on \u201cthe average of the maximum and minimum awards\u201d listed in Title Nine, Subtitle Six of the Labor and Employment Article. Mr. Neal argues that this amount is $359.00.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although compensation for a period of 250 weeks at an average weekly wage of $359.00 would result in an award of $89,750.00, CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 811(b)(1) limits compensation to a maximum of $25,000<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for most disability-related claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The Board contends that Mr. Neal is not entitled to further financial assistance solely because he sustained a permanent injury. The Board argues that he was compensated pursuant to CP \u00a7 ll-810(c)(2) for his lost earnings by the award of $218.37, and that because he failed to make the threshold showing of a diminution in earning capacity due to his disability, his award should not be calculated in accordance with the workers\u2019 compensation schedule for permanent partial disabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ty benefits for the loss of an eye. In effect, the Board argues that it has the discretion to deny permanent disability benefits to a claimant if the claimant is unable to show a diminution in actual-earning capacity or a diminution in future-earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The Board argues that the substantive standards that govern whether a workers\u2019 compensation claimant qualifies for a disability award from the workers\u2019 compensation commission are not incorporated by CP \u00a7 11-811. Thus, the Board contends, it is irrelevant that a workers\u2019 compensation claimant is not required to show evidence of an actual earnings loss to qualify for an award for permanent partial disability. <em>Miller v. Western Electric Co., </em>310 Md. 173, 187-8, 528 A.2d 486 (1987). To support this interpretation of the statute, the Board argues that the criminal injuries compensation program for crime victims was never intended to provide compensation for a victim\u2019s injury, but instead to provide compensation for an injured victim to the extent of the loss of earnings or earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Mr. Neal urges us to look beyond <em>Williams v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, </em>307 Md. 606, 516 A.2d 573 (1986). The Court of Appeals held in <em>Williams </em>that an employee who was shot and blinded did not show that his injuries would cause him additional expenditures and loss of income in the future and thus had failed to show the requisite serious financial hardship required for an award of permanent partial disability benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 616, 516 A.2d 573. The Board did, however, award Williams money for his medical expenses and lost earnings. <em>Id. </em>at 609, 516 A.2d 573. The Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">The Act makes no provision for a compensatory award for a permanent partial disability independent of the type of pecuniary losses expressly enumerated in \u00a7\u00a7 12(f)(1). Nor is there anything in \u00a7\u00a7 12(b) of the Act, impheating the payment schedules of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, which authorizes the Board to make any additional award to a claimant for permanent partial disability; indeed, that subsection merely establishes a framework within which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Board is to measure the maximum amount of benefits to be paid to an eligible claimant where a \u00a7\u00a7 12(f)(1) award has been made. To adopt Williams\u2019 construction of the statute would be to sanction an award for a purpose and in an amount greater than that authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 12(f)(1) without regard to serious financial hardship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 614-15, 516 A.2d 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In 2001, the General Assembly deleted language requiring a showing of \u201cserious financial hardship\u201d before an award could be made under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act. The specific language which was deleted stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">The Board may make an award under this subtitle only if the Board determines that, without the award, the claimant will suffer serious financial hardship from the loss of earnings or support and medical and other expenses incurred as a result of the injury or death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The Court of Appeals relied on the lack of a showing of serious financial hardship in order to deny permanent partial disability benefits to Williams. The Court held in <em>Williams:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALC\">Therefore, a crime victim who demonstrates serious financial hardship by showing the requisite level of out-of-pocket expenses, and/or lost earnings, and/or loss of support, and who is compensated for those losses, is not entitled to further pecuniary recompense solely because he sustained a permanent injury, such as the loss of an eye. On the record in this case, there is no showing that Williams\u2019 permanent disability will in the future cause him additional expenditures or loss of income for which he will have the requisite degree of financial need under \u00a7\u00a7 12(f)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 615-16, 516 A.2d 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">The Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Williams, </em>was that expenses/lost earningsAoss of support were separate from the determination of permanent partial disability, and that the statutory predicates had to be satisfied in both instances in order for the claimant to recover for the permanent disability. In essence, the Board argues the same thing today: a crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>victim who can show lost wages or unreimbursed expenses pursuant to CP \u00a7 11-810 and who is then compensated for those losses, as Mr. Neal undeniably was, is not entitled to an additional award based solely on the basis of a permanent injury. The Court\u2019s logic in <em>Williams, </em>however, did not survive the 2001 statutory changes. The Board presented little in the way of evidence or reasoning to support its argument, beyond its reminder that the statute was adopted with statutory prerequisites for monetary awards because the funds to be distributed under the statute are public funds.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Although we owe deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the Act, we are not persuaded by the Board\u2019s argument. The Board conceded that Mr. Neal met the requirements of CP \u00a7 ll-810(c)(2) and is entitled to benefits. What the Board failed to explain adequately, however, is why those benefits would be limited to temporary disability benefits for the loss of an eye when the workers\u2019 compensation statutory schedule requires the $25,000.00 payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">For us to accept the Board\u2019s argument that it has wide discretion to categorize the claimant\u2019s injuries, even after the claimant has satisfied one of the predicate requirements listed in CP \u00a7 ll-810(c), we would have to grant more power to the Board than the General Assembly has expressly allocated per the statute. Furthermore, this allocation of further discretion to the Board would occur even though the General Assembly recently removed the requirement of serious financial hardship in order to make it easier for a claimant to recover under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In <em>Opert v. Crim. Inj. Comp. Bd., </em>403 Md. 587, 602, 943 A.2d 1229 (2008), the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">[I]t is clear from the statement of legislative policy in CP \u00a7 11-802 that the law is remedial in nature, and remedial statutes are to be liberally construed. The Legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>recognized and articulated that \u201cthere is a need for government financial assistance for these victims\u201d and that \u201c[t]he policy of the State is that help, care, and support be provided by the State, as a matter of moral responsibility, for these victims.\u201d CP \u00a7 11-802. That objective, that policy, is advanced by construing ambiguous language in favor of eligibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Therefore, the plain language of the statute, as well as the important public policy that animates the original passage of the statute and the statutory revisions of 2001, all mitigate in favor of an award of permanent partial disability benefits for Mr. Neal. We hold that the Board erred in denying those benefits for Mr. Neal and remand the case to the circuit court with instructions that the court order the Board to award $25,000.00 in permanent partial disability benefits to Mr. Neal.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS THAT THE COURT ENTER AN ORDER REQUIRING THE BOARD TO AWARD $25,000.00 IN PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY BENEFITS TO THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-12\">. The Board later found, however, that there were no unreimbursed medical expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b689-10\">. The Board\u2019s final decision does not clarify how it calculated the amount of this award, but the workers\u2019 compensation statute specifies that a claimant who is permanently partially disabled is entitled to compensation equaling two-thirds of the claimant\u2019s average weekly wage for the period that the claimant is temporarily totally disabled. Md.Code (1991, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 9-621 of the Labor and Employment Article (LE).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b694-11\">. The parties agree that Mr. Neal proved that he had lost three weeks\u2019 earnings as a result of the injury and thus he satisfied the predicate requirement of CP \u00a7 ll-810(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b694-12\">. We need not address Mr. Neal\u2019s argument that, as a result of the statutory changes in 2001, simply making a disability claim is sufficient to obtain benefits, because the parties agree that he satisfied the threshold requirement in CP \u00a7 11-810(c)(2). However, the plain language of the statute does not support Mr. Neal\u2019s argument. The relevant statutory provision that is cited by Mr. Neal is CP \u00a7 11-810(c)(l)(vi), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-13\">c. The Board may make an award only if the claimant, as a result of the injury on which the claim is based, has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-14\">(1) incurred at least $100 in unreimbursed and unreimbursable expenses or indebtedness reasonably incurred or claimed for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-15\">(vi) disability or dependent claim[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-16\">The appellant's reading of this statutory excerpt as requiring only the filing of a disability or dependent claim does not hold up under close scrutiny. According to the plain language of the excerpt, the claimant must have incurred at least $100 in either (1) unreimbursed or unreimbursable expenses, or (2) indebtedness. This requirement still acts as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>predicate to the phrase \"claimed for ... disability or dependent claim.\u201d If the General Assembly had intended to remove the $100 requirement entirely in the case of disability claims, it could have done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\">. Mr. Neal calculated this amount by averaging the state average weekly wage for 2001, which was $668.00, with the minimum award listed in LE \u00a7 9-626, which is $50.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b695-10\">. The claimant is entitled to $50,000 if the injury results in permanent total disability. CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 811 (b)(l)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">. What the Board did not address is why the existing statutory prerequisites, such as CP \u00a7 11-810(c), as well as other limits on recovery such as the $25,000.00 threshold, are not sufficient to ensure the functionality of the statutory scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
