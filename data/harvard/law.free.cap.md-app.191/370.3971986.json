KENNEY, III, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A4c\">(retired, specially assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe was tried before a jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Washington County and convicted of first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, two counts of first degree assault, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun. The jury announced its verdict in open court, no juror objected to the verdict when hearkened by the clerk of the court, and all of the jurors individually agreed to the verdict when polled. Ogundipe was sentenced to life imprisonment plus ten years. Days after the court entered judgment reflecting the jury\u2019s verdict, defense counsel was made aware that the verdict sheet reflected that the jury had answered \u201cyes\u201d to questions asking whether Ogundipe was guilty of the charges of murder, attempted murder, and two counts of assault in the first degree, but, rather than skipping questions related to the same charges in the second degree as instructed, the verdict sheet indicated that the jury answered \u201cno\u201d as to whether Ogundipe was guilty of those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Ogundipe presents two questions on appeal, which we have reworded:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>I. Did the circuit court err by accepting an inconsistent verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">II. Did the circuit court err by failing to disclose the verdict sheet to Ogundipe?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">For the reasons that follow, we answer \u201cno\u201d to both questions and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The charges against Ogundipe stem from an altercation that occurred on July 23, 2006, in which one person was killed and another person was seriously injured. Ogundipe was charged with the following offenses: first and second degree murder and first and second degree assault of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez; attempted first and second degree murder and first and second degree assault of Tony Perry; first and second degree assault of Steven Ramel Broadhead; use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence; wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun; and felon in possession of a handgun.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">After a two-day trial, which began on May 13, 2008, the judge instructed the jury concerning its deliberations, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">Alright, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you will retire to consider your verdict in this matter. As I indicated, there is a verdict sheet that will be given to you. It consists of twelve questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Questions One and Two relate to the charges of first and second degree murder of Jackson Rodriguez. Question is: As to the charge of first degree murder of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez, on or about July twenty-three 2006, how do you find the defendant Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe, guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">You\u2019re given further instruction then: If your answer to that question would be not guilty, then I would ask you to consider Question Number Two, which is second degree murder of Jackson Rodriguez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">After you have done that, then Question Three and Four relate to the attempted first and second degree murder of Tony Perry. You would consider first degree murder. If your answer to that would be not guilty then you would consider attempted second degree murder of Tony Perry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">Questions Five and Six relate to the first degree assault of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez. Using the same means of analysis, Questions Seven and Eight relate to the first and second degree assault of Tony Perry. And Questions Nine and Ten relate to the first and second degree assault of Steven Broadhead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">Question Eleven relates to the charge of the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. I would ask you to once again consider the instructions that were given. Before you consider that question and the last question is as to the charge of wearing and carrying and transporting a handgun. How do you find the defendant, guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">Once again, I would remind you that your decision must be unanimous. In other words, all twelve of you must agree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Two hours after the jury retired to deliberate, the court reconvened, and the following discourse took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">The Court: Alright, the defendant is present. Please bring the jury in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">(The jury returns to the jury box.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Alright, the jury is present. The defendant and counsel are present. It\u2019s my understanding the jury has reached a verdict. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">Foreman: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">The Court: Okay. Mr. Clerk, if you would take the verdict of the jury, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">Clerk: Yes, sir. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, are you agreed as to your verdict? If so, please answer, \u201cWe are.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">Jury: We are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">Clerk: Who shall say for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">Jury: Our foreman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">Clerk: Please stand. As to the charge of first degree murder of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez ... how do you find the defendant ... guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">Foreman: Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-13\">Clerk: As to the charge of attempted first degree murder of Tony Perry ... how do you find the defendant ... guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">Foreman: Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-15\">Clerk: As to the charge of first degree assault of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez ... how do you find the defendant ... guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-16\">Foreman: Not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-17\">Clerk: As to the charge of second degree assault of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez ... how do you find the defendant ... guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-18\">Foreman: Not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-19\">Clerk: As to the charge of first degree assault of Tony Perry ... how do you find the defendant ... guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-20\">Foreman: Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-21\">Clerk: As to the charge of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence ... how do you find the defendant ... guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-22\">Foreman: Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Clerk: As to the charge of wearing, carrying and transporting a handgun ... how do you find the defendant ... guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">Foreman: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">After the foreman reported the jury\u2019s verdict, the clerk of the court hearkened the verdict. The clerk stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, hearken your verdict as the Court hath recorded it. Your foreman saith that Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is guilty of first degree murder of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez on or about July 23, 2006. That Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is guilty of attempted first degree murder of Tony Perry on or about July 23, 2006. That Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is not guilty of first degree assault of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez on or about July 23, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">That Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is not guilty of second degree assault of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez on or about July 23, 2006. And Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is guilty of first degree assault of Tony Perry on or about July 23, 2006. That Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is guilty of first degree assault of Steven Ramel Broadhead on or about July 23, 2006. That Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is guilty of the charge of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence on or about July 23, 2006. And that Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is guilty of wearing, carrying and transporting a handgun on or about July 23, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">And so say you all? If so, please answer, \u201cWe do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">After the jury replied, \u2018We do,\u201d Ogundipe\u2019s counsel requested that the jury be polled. Each juror was asked individually, \u201c[I]s this your individual verdict?\u201d Each responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">At some time, in the days following the trial, appellant\u2019s counsel learned that the verdict sheet, signed by the jury foreman, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\">Question # 1: First degree murder of Jackson Rodriguez Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFg\">Question # 2: (To be answered only if the answer to Question # 1 is Not Guilty) Second degree murder of Jackson Rodriguez Not Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Question # 3: Attempted first degree murder of Tony Perry Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">Question # 4: (To be answered only if the answer to Question # 3 is Not Guilty) Attempted second degree murder of Tony Perry Not Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">Question # 5: First degree assault of Jackson Rodriguez Not Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">Question # 6: (To be answered only if the answer to Question # 5 is Not Guilty) Second degree assault of Jackson Rodriguez Not Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">Question # 7: First degree assault of Tony Perry Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-11\">Question # 8: (To be answered only if the answer to Question # 7 is Not Guilty) Second degree assault of Tony Perry Not Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\">Question # 9: First degree assault of Steven Broadhead Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-14\">Question # 10: (To be answered only if the answer to Question # 9 is Not Guilty) Second degree assault of Steven Broadhead Not Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-16\">Question # 11: Use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-18\">Question # 12: Wearing, carrying and transporting a handgun Guilty</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-19\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b399-20\">Ogundipe argues that the circuit court erred by accepting an inconsistent verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-21\">When the trial court took the verdict from the foreperson, it only asked the jury foreperson for verdicts on questions numbered One (first degree murder of Jackson Rodriguez), Three (attempted first degree murder of Tony Perry), Five (first degree assault of Jackson Rodriguez), Six (second degree assault of Jackson Rodriguez), Seven (first degree assault of Tony Perry), Nine (first degree assault of Steven Broadhead), Eleven (use of a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence), and Twelve (wearing/carrying a handgun.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-22\">The jury\u2019s verdict in Appellant\u2019s case is irreconcilably inconsistent in violation of Maryland\u2019s common law. The verdict shows Appellant not guilty of lesser included offenses and guilty of the greater offenses as they pertain to each victim in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>He relies on <em>Price v. State, </em>405 Md. 10, 23-24, 949 A.2d 619 (2008), in which the Court of Appeals ruled that inconsistent verdicts in criminal cases would no longer be tolerated under Maryland common law. According to the Court, a \u201clegally inconsistent verdict occurs where a jury acts contrary to a trial judge\u2019s proper instructions regarding the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 949 A.2d 619. We explained, in <em>Tate v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 114, 131, 957 A.2d 640, <em>cert. denied, </em>406 Md. 747, 962 A.2d 373 (2008):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">A legal inconsistency ... occurs when the crime for which a defendant is acquitted is, in its entirety, a lesser included offense within the greater inclusive offense for which a defendant is convicted. The commission of the greater crime cannot, as a matter of law, take place without the commission of the lesser crime. The lesser crime is a required element of the greater. The acquittal of the lesser crime precludes the finding of that required element of the greater crime for which the defendant was convicted. That is legal ... inconsistency. It is something that does not involve speculation about possible or probable factual findings. It is something that can be explained in algebraic terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The State characterizes the jury\u2019s responses to the charges of second degree murder, attempted second degree murder, and second degree assault, where the jury had found appellant guilty of the first degree charges, as \u201csimply erroneous.\u201d According to the State: \u201cThe only properly returned verdicts [were] those announced in open court, hearkened, and about which the jury was polled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In <em>Jones v. State, </em>384 Md. 669, 675, 866 A.2d 151 (2005), four counts against the defendant went to the jury: attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, attempted robbery, possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a crime of violence, and use of a handgun in commission of a crime of violence. On the verdict sheet, the jury found the defendant guilty on all four counts. <em>Id. </em>at 675, 866 A.2d 151. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Presumably, the verdict sheet was handed by the foreman to the court clerk.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The court clerk only asked the foreman whether the jury found the defendant guilty as to the counts of \u201cattempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon,\u201d \u201cattempted robbery,\u201d and \u201cpossession of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676, 866 A.2d 151. The foreman answered \u201cguilty\u201d as to each count. <em>Id. </em>The jury was polled and the verdict was hearkened as to only these three counts. <em>Id. </em>at 676-77, 866 A.2d 151. The defendant was sentenced for \u201cattempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon,\u201d \u201cuse of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence,\u201d and \u201cpossession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony or crime of violence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">On appeal, the defendant argued that the sentence imposed for \u201cpossession of a firearm by a person previously convicted for a felony or crime of violence should not stand because the jury foreman did not announce the guilty verdict in open court,\u201d and the sentence for that count was, therefore, illegal. <em>Id. </em>This Court stated that \u201cwhere it is unmistakable that the jury found the defendant guilty, \u2018substance will prevail over form even if the guilty verdict is not announced and even if it is neglected again when the jury is polled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677, 866 A.2d 151. This Court ultimately \u201cdeclined to disturb the sentence imposed for the firearm possession charge and concluded that the issue was not properly preserved by Jones because he had failed to object at any time when the verdict was delivered or when he was sentenced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 866 A.2d 151. The Court of Appeals granted Jones\u2019 petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>and reversed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The <em>Jones </em>Court reviewed the history of procedures used for returning the verdict from the colonial period through today. <em>Id. </em>at 680-81, 866 A.2d 151. It stated that \u201cthe \u2018return\u2019 of a verdict by a jury has been comprised of three distinct procedures, each fulfilling a specific purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>682, 866 A.2d 151. Those procedures are 1) the foreman\u2019s oral statement of the verdict, 2) polling the jury, and 3) hearkening the jury to its verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 682-84, 866 A.2d 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Addressing the issue before it, the <em>Jones </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">The State argues that the probable handing of the verdict sheet to the clerk constitutes a proper \u201creturn\u201d of the jury\u2019s verdict for Count nine. We, however, disagree. \u201cReturning\u201d the verdict in open court mandates an oral announcement of the verdict upon the conclusion of the jury\u2019s deliberations to enable the defendant to exercise the right to poll the jury as to the verdicts. Furthermore, orally announcing each count of the verdict prevents possible confusion during polling and hearkening where there are multiple counts considered by the jury, as in the present case..... Therefore, we conclude that for a verdict to be considered final in a criminal case it must be announced orally to permit the defendant the opportunity to exercise the right to poll the jury to ensure the verdict\u2019s unanimity.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 684-85, 866 A.2d 151. <em>See also Heinze v. State, </em>184 Md. 613, 616, 42 A.2d 128 (1945) (\u201cIt is a fundamental principle that the verdict of a jury in a criminal case has no effect in law until it is recorded and finally accepted by the court.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Recently, in <em>State v. Santiago, </em>412 Md. 28, 40, 985 A.2d 556 (2009), the Court of Appeals addressed the procedure for returning a verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">In <em>Jones [v. State, </em>173 Md.App. 430, 458, 920 A.2d 1 (2007)] we concluded that the return of a jury verdict is comprised of three distinct procedures: (1) oral announcement of the verdict, (2) unanimity, except that a defendant may waive the requirement of unanimity and that he has an absolute right to poll the jury, (3) after polling, the traditional third step is to hearken the verdict. <em>Id. </em>Hearkening removes the case from the jury\u2019s further consideration. <em>Jones, </em>384 Md. at 684, 866 A.2d at 160. If polling of the jury follows hearkening, then polling of the jury serves the same function as hearkening. <em>Id. </em>In other words, either hearkening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>or polling is the final third step, depending upon the circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">As we stated previously, hearkening of the verdict is conducted to \u201csecure certainty and accuracy, and to enable the jury to correct a verdict which they have mistaken, or which their foreman has improperly delivered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Givens v. State, 76 </em>Md. [485,] 488, 25 A. [689,] 689-90 [1893]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In <em>Heinze, </em>184 Md. at 616-17, 42 A.2d 128, the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">.... Any member of the jury has the right <em>sua sponte </em>to dissent from the verdict as announced by the foreman at any time before it is recorded and affirmed by the jury. If no objection is made by any of the jurors or by the State or the accused, the verdict as announced is the verdict of the whole panel; and it is then the duty of the clerk to record the verdict and have it affirmed by the jury in the presence of the court by calling upon the whole panel to hearken to their verdict as the court has recorded it, and by repeating to them what has been taken down for record. Until the announcement that the verdict has been recorded, the jury have the right to amend or change any verdict; and when it is so amended it is the real verdict of the jury and it may be properly accepted by the court. <em>Ford v. State, </em>12 Md. 514, 546 [(1859)]; <em>Givens v. State, </em>76 Md. 485, 25 A. 689; <em>Grant v. State, </em>33 Fla. 291, 14 So. 757, 23 L.R.A. 723, 731 [(1894)]; 23 C.J.S., Criminal Law, Sec. 1412.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Through <em>Santiago, Jones, </em>and <em>Heinze, </em>the Court of Appeals has made clear that the verdict sheet itself is a tool for the jury to utilize in deciding its verdict but it does not constitute the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Ogundipe argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">When the trial court was taking the verdict from the foreperson, the court did not ask for the jury\u2019s verdict on the verdict form questions numbered Two (second degree murder of [Jackson] Augustin Rodriguez), Four (attempted second degree murder of Tony Perry), Eight (second degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>assault of Tony Perry), or Ten (second degree assault of Steven Broadhead), all of which were marked \u201cNot Guilty\u201d on the verdict form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Ogundipe, in effect, is asking, if a jury is directed by the court not to answer a question related to the second degree of a crime when the jury finds the defendant guilty of that crime in the first degree, is the clerk of the court required to ask the jury for its answer to those questions once the jury announces, in open court, that it finds the defendant guilty of the crimes in the first degree? In our view, the answer is, \u201cNo.\u201d The clerk of the court was following the directions of the circuit court by skipping the second degree questions after the jury announced that the defendant was guilty of the charges in the first degree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Once the jury found the defendant guilty of the crimes in the first degree, there was no reason to consider the second degree charges as they legally merged with the greater charges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, addressing the second degree charge was contrary to the express directions on the verdict sheet itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>After the foreperson announced the verdict, the jury hearkened to that verdict. Despite the gratuitous consideration of the second degree charges indicated on the verdict sheet, we are satisfied the announced verdict, hearkened to by the jury, whose members were then individually polled, reflected the jury\u2019s unanimous verdict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Disclosure of Verdict Sheet</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Appellant contends that he should have been shown the verdict sheet before the jury was dismissed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">.... [A] large portion of the verdict that went unspoken and unaddressed constituted evidence of confusion, inconsistency, and potential acquittal which Appellant should have been able to address while the jury was constituted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">He contends that, by failing to disclose the verdict sheet, the circuit court violated Rule 4-326(d), and, in turn, infringed upon his Maryland and federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Maryland Rule 4-326(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">The court shall notify the defendant and the State\u2019s Attorney of the receipt of any communication from the jury pertaining to the action as promptly as practicable and in any event before responding to the communication. All such communications between the court and the jury shall be on the record in open court or shall be in writing and filed in the action. The clerk or the court shall note on a written communication the date and time it was received from the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">Indeed, as appellant points out, we have consistently held that when communications from the jury pertaining to the action are received by the court and not disclosed to the parties this is an error committed by the court that is, usually, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>not considered harmless. <em>See Denicolis v. State, </em>378 Md. 646, 837 A.2d 944 (2003); <em>Allen v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 537, 545, 551 A.2d 156, <em>cert. denied, </em>315 Md. 692, 556 A.2d 674 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>320 Md. 15, 575 A.2d 742 (1990); <em>Smith v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 603, 624, 505 A.2d 564, <em>cert. denied, </em>306 Md. 371, 509 A.2d 134 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Whether Rule 4-326(d) applies to a jury verdict sheet, however, appears to be a question of first impression. To answer this question, we look to Rule 4-327 and the procedure for returning a jury verdict. Rule 4-327 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL2\">(a) Return. The verdict of a jury shall be unanimous and shall be returned in open court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">(b) Sealed verdict. With the consent of all parties, the court may authorize the rendition of a sealed verdict during a temporary adjournment of court. A sealed verdict shall be in writing and shall be signed by each member of the jury. It shall be sealed in an envelope by the foreperson of the jury who shall write on the outside of the envelope \u201cVerdict Case No.........\u201d \u201cState of Maryland vs. ...............\u201d and deliver the envelope to the clerk.

When there are two or more defendants, the jury may return a verdict with respect to a defendant as to whom it has agreed, and any defendant as to whom the jury cannot agree may be tried again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">(d) Two or more counts.

On request of a party or on the court's own initiative, the jury shall be polled after it has returned a verdict and before it is discharged.

Rule 4-327. The clerk then must poll the jury if requested, and, if not, hearken the verdict. <em>Santiago, </em>412 Md. at 40, 985 A.2d 556. If the jury is unanimous, the verdict is perfected. <em>Givens, </em>76 Md. at 487, 25 A. 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Rule 4-327 does not require the judge to review the verdict sheet or to show the verdict sheet to the defendant at any time during the return of the verdict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the jury verdict sheet is not a \u201ccommunication\u201d from the jury to the court seeking a response by the court. Its purpose is to facilitate the deliberations of the jury. In sum, the jury verdict sheet is not a \u201ccommunication\u201d from the jury to the court as contemplated by Rule 4 \u2014 326(d), and, therefore, the court was not required to notify or disclose the verdict sheet to the parties or counsel before the jury was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY AFFIRMED.
