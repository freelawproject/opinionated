Herman v. Dulles, 1953, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 303, 205 F.2d 715, affirming Herman v. Acheson, D.C.1952, 108 F.Supp. 723. The present suit is like the former one, but alleges that the plaintiff has newly-discovered evidence of bias and prejudice on the part of those who made the original administrative decision adverse to him (viz., the former membership of the International Claims Commission). The District Court again granted summary judgment. We again affirm. The issue of bias and prejudice was raised in appellant\u2019s first action, was urged here in his brief on appeal, and was determined against him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The matter is <em>res judicata. </em>Calvin v.
