In 1951 appellant brought suit against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2671 et seq., alleging negligence on the part of the Forest Service officials and praying damages on account of \u201cthe loss of the comfort, society, and companionship of his son, and contributions toward his support.\u201d The suit was dismissed on motion of the government on the ground that the complainant\u2019s exclusive remedy is provided by the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 751 et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">While it was not in terms alleged that the complainant is a non-dependent parent, we assume for decisional purposes that such was his status. As a nondependent he is entitled to benefits under the Employees\u2019 Compensation Act to the extent only of a burial allowance in an amount not exceeding $400. 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 761. Because under the Compensation Act no benefits are payable on account of his asserted loss he urges that the Act should not be construed as depriving him of a remedy under the Tort Claims statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">By amendment to the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act adopted October 14, 1949, 63 Stat. 854, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 757(b), Congress declared the liability of the United States thereunder to be exclusive of all other liability to any person on account of the service-incident death or injury of government employees. Section 757(b) in material part reads: \u201cThe liability of the United States or any of its instrumentalities under sections 751-756, 757-791, and 793 of this title or any extension thereof with respect to the injury or death of an employee shall be exclusive, and in place, of all other liability of the United States or such instrumentality to the employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, <em>and anyone otherwise entitled. to recover damages from the United States or such instrumentality, </em>on account of such injury or death, in any direct judicial proceedings in a civil action * * * or under any Federal tort liability statute: * * [Emphasis supplied.] Apparently out of an abundance of precaution, the provision regarding exclusiveness of remedy was made to apply, with exceptions not here material, \u201cto any case of injury or death occurring prior to the date of enactment of this Act.\u201d Section 303(g), 63 Stat. 867, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 757 note.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">In Johansen v. United States, 343 U.S. 427, 72 S.Ct. 849, 96 L.Ed. 1051, the Supreme Court held the 1949 amendment above quoted to be merely declaratory of the pre-existing law. Apart from that holding, it is hardly open to question that Congress possessed authority to provide as it did that the amendment itself was to operate retroactively. Accordingly our sole problem is one of statutory construction. Preliminarily it is significant to observe that the statute speaks only in terms of the liability of the United States. In unmistakable language it precludes resort to a suit in damages against the United States for injury to or death of an employee by <em>anyone </em>who might in the absence of the statute have been entitled to maintain an action for such injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-15\">Comparable provisions of state workmen\u2019s compensation acts have been uniformly construed as barring independent common law suits against employers in situations, as here, not falling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>within the coverage of the compensation acts. We need not burden this opinion with .citations of the cases, a number of which are referred to in Underwood v. United States, 10 Cir., 207 F.2d 862. There appear to have been but two federal circuits- which have spoken on the subject. The- Tenth Circuit in the Underwood case above mentioned held that the terms of the Act bar an independent common law suit, the suit in that case being by a husband for loss of consortium. The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit in Hitaffer v. Argonne Co., 87 U.S.App.D.C. 57, 183 F. 2d 811, 23 A.L.R.2d 1366, reached a contrary result. The latter decision supplies appellant\u2019s chief if not his only authority. We think the decision is wrong.,</p>\n<p id=\"Ara\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-10\">. Appellant claims that under Montana law he would have a right of action, for the loss suffered. We assume, as apparently the trial court did, that such is the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
