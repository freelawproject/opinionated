After this showing that reasonable grounds existed for belief that the Bankrupt had committed an act which precludes a discharge, the burden of disproving the proscribed act shifted to the Bankrupt under the terminal proviso of Section 14, sub. c of the Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 32, sub. c. In re Muss, 2 Cir., 100 F.2d 395; Federal Provision Co. v. Ershowsky, 2 Cir., 94 F.2d 574. The Referee found that the Bankrupt failed to sustain this burden. On review of the Referee\u2019s order, his findings were approved by the District Court. We find nothing in the record which even suggests that his findings of fact were \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d within the meaning of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. His findings were, therefore, binding on the Judge below \u2014 and equally binding on us. In re Sandow, 2 Cir., 151 F.2d 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number> The failure to keep books having thus been sufficiently proved, the only remaining question is whether the failure was \u201cjustified under all the circumstances of the case\u201d within the meaning of Section 14, sub. c(2), 11 U. S.C.A. 14, sub. c(2). As we held In re Sandow, supra, on review of the Referee\u2019s order this was a question of law open for independent decision by the Judge. The Judge, quoting from our opinion in the Sandow case, decided the question adversely to the Bankrupt and sustained the Referee\u2019s conclusion that the failure was not justified. We cannot say that the decision was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
