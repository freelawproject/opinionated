Discharged from the hospital on August 14, 1952, she retained Jules Chopak as her lawyer. His investigation disclosed that Hartford Wiley owned and had operated the automobile which struck the plaintiff. On September 4, 1952, Chopak sent Wilhy a letter advising him of plaintiff\u2019s claim. Receiving no response, Chopak sent Wiley a similar letter on September 9, 1952, and again received no response.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-7\">The Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, on December 29, 1951, had issued an accident policy to Wiley covering his liability to others in automobile accidents, up to the amount of $10,000; this policy was in force when the accident in question occurred. On September 11, 1952, Griffith, an insurance broker who represented Wiley, sent the insurance company a letter notifying it of plaintiff\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On either September 11 or September 17, the company received this letter together with Chopak\u2019s claim letter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-15\">On September 17, 1952, plaintiff began suit against Wiley, in the New York Supreme Court, by serving him with a summons and complaint. The complaint stated the date of the accident and the nature of plaintiff\u2019s resultant injuries. On September 19, 1952, the company received from Griffith the plaintiff\u2019s summons and complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-16\">On September 23, 1952, an employee of the company phoned Chopak, inquiring about plaintiff\u2019s claim; in answers to questions, Chopak then orally gave the company\u2019s employee the details of the accident. Until that telephone conversasion, neither Chopak nor plaintiff knew of the insurance policy. On October 7, 1952, the company wrote Griffith a letter disclaiming liability under the policy because no notice of the accident had been given to the company until September 11, 1952, although the accident had occurred on August 6, 1952.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-17\">In plaintiff\u2019s suit against Wiley, a judgment for plaintiff was entered on May 6, 1953, in the sum of $7,702.13. On the same day, plaintiff served Wiley and the insurance company a copy of that judgment with notice of its entry. The judgment was not paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-18\">On June 12, 1953, plaintiff began the present suit against the insurance company in the New York Supreme Court; the complaint was based on Section 167 of the New York Insurance Law, McK. Consol.Laws, c. 28. The case was remov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>ed to the court below. At the close of the trial, the judge instructed the jury that it must consider that plaintiff \u201chad given notice of the accident to defendant insurance company on the day it [the defendant] got notice from Wiley\u2019s broker, which was either on September 11 or September 17, 1952.\u201d The judge charged that the sole question for the jury was whether plaintiff did \u201cas soon as reasonably possible after the accident, notify the defendant insurance company of the accident. * * * The accident happened on August 6, 1952. So that your question is whether it was reasonably possible for Mrs. Pitts and those representing her to notify the company between that date and the date when the insurance company received the notice from Wiley\u2019s broker.\u201d The jury returned a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor for $7,-702.31 with interest, or $8,106.66. From the judgment in that amount, entered on the verdict, defendant appeals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-4\">The pertinent parts of \u00a7 167 of the New York Insurance Law read as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">\u201c1.

Section 167, subd. 1(d) of the statute provides that \u201cfailure to give any notice required to be given by such policy within the time prescribed therein shall not invalidate any claim made by the insured or by any other claimant thereunder if it shall be shown not to have been reasonably possible to give such notice within the prescribed time and that notice was given as soon as was reasonably possible.\u201d On September 11 or September 17,1952, or at most 42 days after the accident, the company received written notice from Wiley\u2019s broker. Assuming for the moment that this notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>sufficiently complied with \u00a7 167, subd. 1 (c), we think that the jury was not irrational in finding as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">2. We think the written notice from Wiley\u2019s broker satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 167, subd. 1(c). True, the notice was not \u201cby or on behalf of the injured person\u201d, since Griffith acted not on plaintiff\u2019s behalf but on that of Wiley, the insured. We think, however, that the statute in using the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d \u2014-in the words \u201cby or on behalf of the insured or * * * by or on behalf of the injured person\u201d \u2014 does not require the injured person to give written notice, when one had already been given by or on behalf of the insured. The legislature, we think, intended to provide (a) that the insured company should receive written notice and (b) that, if the insured failed to give written notice, the injured person must do so. We cannot believe that the legislature meant to call for a useless ceremonial by the injured person. In Bazar v. Great American Indemnity Co., 306 N.Y. 481, 119 N.E.2d 346, as we read it, the court held that, had the insured given written notice, the injured person, although he gave no notice, could have recovered against the insurance company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">3. Defendant argues that here\u00bb so far as Wiley, the insured, was concerned, his written notice was not timely either under \u00a7 167, subd. 1(d) or under the provisions of the policy, and that therefore that notice could not serve as a substitute for a timely written notice by plaintiff, the injured person. The trial judge supplied the answer to that argument in his charge to the jury, when he said: \u201c[E]ven if you think that such a delay on the part of Mr. Wiley, the insured, to give notice would have been unreasonable, that would not answer the question before you. The question with respect to Mr. Wiley is entirely different because he was confronted with different circumstances from those which confronted Mrs. Pitts. The most important of these is that he knew that he was insured. Mrs. Pitts and her lawyer did not know about the insurance until after they had brought suit. * * * The injured person has to have a reasonable time to find out who injured him and then ascertain from the person who injured him, as best he can, whether he is insured and, if so, the name and address of the insurance company.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\">. The court held that, although Section 167, subd. 1(e) speaks of \u201cnotice given by or on behalf of the insured\u201d but speaks of \u201cwritten notice\u201d on behalf of the injured persons, a provision of an insurance policy calling for written notice by the insured is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">In the instant case, the trial judge in his charge said that \u201cThe insurance company had not only received a notice from Wiley\u2019s broker, but the summons and complaint which gave it complete notice of the accident.\u201d Bazar v. Great American Indemnity Co., 306 N.Y. 481, 119 N.E.2d 346, perhaps holds that the summons and complaint do not constitute written notice by or on behalf of the insured to the insurance company. But even if, as to the summons and complaint, the trial judge here erred, the error is immaterial since the written notice from Wiley\u2019s broker was alone enough, and the jury was not misled since this issue was not left to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The court in the Bazar case did not reach what was the main issue in the instant case: whether or not the injured party gave notice to the insurance company \u201cas soon as reasonably possible after the accident.\u201d It would have been futile for the Bazar court to consider that question, for Bazar, the injured party, did not give notice to the company until twenty-nine months after the accident, which was not \u201cas soon as reasonably possible,\u201d since he made no effort to determine whether the automobile which struck him was insured, and apparently learned of it, not through his own efforts, but by a telephone call from an agent of the insurer some twenty months after the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b113-14\">. It is suggested that the oral disclosure by plaintiff\u2019s lawyer to the company on September 23, 1952, may be regarded as a sort of adoption on plaintiff\u2019s behalf of the previous written notice, given on behalf of the insured. But we do not consider that suggestion because the judge did not leave to the jury the question whether a notice as late as September 23 was timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>L. HAND, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AtJ\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">I concur; but I am in more doubt than my brothers about the scope of Bazar v. Great American Indemnity Co., 306 N.Y. 481, 119 N.E.2d 346. I am disposed to confine it to a ruling that notice, if given by the insured, as well as if given by the injured party, must be in writing. On the facts the decision seems to have gone further; for it held that a delay by the insured to give notice defeated recovery by the injured party, who, so far as appears, was not dilatory after he learned of the insurance; but it is so unlikely that the injured person should be vicariously charged with the insured\u2019s delay that we may safely believe the decision to be limited to the point I mention.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
