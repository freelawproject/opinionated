Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 192 F.2d 160, that the order forbidding the interrogation of employees was too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">An examination of the evidence, as Board and respondent set it out, convinces us that, fairly considered, the evidence supports the findings of examiner and Board. Since, however, the order is too broad in unqualifiedly forbidding mere interrogation of employees concerning their union affiliations, the order will be amended by inserting before the word \u201cinterrogating\u201d the words \u201ccoercively or otherwise unlawfully\u201d. As thus amended, the order will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Amended and enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
