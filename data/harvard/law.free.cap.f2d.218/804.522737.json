The first of these is the order of Nov. 19th, entered on King\u2019s motion filed July 21st, to dismiss the action as to him. The second is the order of March 6, 1954,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> entered on the bank\u2019s motion to dismiss the suit for plaintiff\u2019s failure to furnish security for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Here, complaining of the November 19th order, to the extent that the order was based upon the finding that the Adams County decree \u201cis res judicata as to all matters complained of as against King\u201d, that the hearing was had and the judgment entered without notice to him, without adequate pleading and proof to support it, and without any basis in law or in fact, appellant insists that the judgment of dismissal was erroneous and may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">His complaints of the order dismissing the cause as to the bank are: (1) that he had no notice of the order of November 24, 1953, requiring him to give security for costs until Dec. 3, 1953; and (2) that, on December 8th, he filed notice of his election to stand upon his pleadings and moved the court to dismiss the cause as to the bank in order that he might appeal. Based on these complaints, he insists that the court erred when, on March 6, 1954, instead of dismissing the action on plaintiff\u2019s motion, it dismissed it on the bank\u2019s motion for security for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">We agree with appellant that the record affords no basis for the con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>elusion of the district judge that the Adams County decree is res judicata of all matters alleged in plaintiff\u2019s suit, and that it should be dismissed on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">But this is not to say that the judgment of dismissal as to King is erroneous and may not stand. For we think it clear that though the reasons assigned by the district judge for his action in dismissing the suit will not support it, the dismissal was proper for another reason. This is that, search the complaint as one may, while it does contain an allegation that plaintiff was deprived of the use and occupancy of the Florence plantation by the fraudulent and negligent acts of the bank, King, and others, no facts are, indeed not a single fact is, alleged which will support a claim of wrongdoing on King\u2019s part or show how anything that he did could have caused any of the damages and losses sued for.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Matters standing thus on plaintiff\u2019s pleadings and the record showing that plaintiff repeatedly declared both before and after the order dismissing his suit as to King that he would stand upon his pleadings and suffer judgment if they did not entitle him to recover, the order of the district judge dismissing plaintiff\u2019s action as to King is affirmed, though not for the reason that the Adams County judgment is res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">When it comes to the order dismissing the suit as to the bank, we think it too plain for discussion that on this record, the district judge had no alternative. His order requiring security for costs had been for months ignored, if not defied. If, however, we should accept appellant\u2019s suggestion that he had the alternative of dismissing the action on plaintiff\u2019s motion, plaintiff would stand no better here. For, as we have pointed out in the opinion this day filed in Vaughan v. City Bank, 5 Cir., 218 F.2d 802, plaintiff could not have complained of a dismissal on his own motion since on the plainest principles he was not entitled to a summary judgment on his pleadings and a dismissal for want of prosecution was demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">The judgments appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-6\">.
