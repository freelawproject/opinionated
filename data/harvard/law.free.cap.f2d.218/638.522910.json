The trial court dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>missed the complaint for want of jurisdiction, on the theory that the attorney\u2019s fees were not recoverable, and therefore the amount in controversy did not exceed $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Article 2226, Vernon\u2019s Civil Statutes, as amended Acts 1953, 53rd Leg., p. 101, ch. 67, \u00a7 1, clearly provides for recovery of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, in addition to the claim and costs, on valid claims for, among other things, materials furnished, or suits founded upon a sworn account or accounts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This right to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, in addition to the claim and costs, is a liability properly enforceable in a federal court, to be included in determining the amount in controversy.
