That being true, a statutory condition precedent to remission or mitigation of forfeiture was that one or more of the designated authorities, in answering the claimant\u2019s inquiry, should have informed claimant that the purchaser had no such record or reputation, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3617(b). The answer from the Alcohol Tax Unit cannot fairly be so construed. Read as a whole, it disclaims knowledge of the purchaser\u2019s record or reputation for violating state liquor laws. The claimant then bore the burden of making further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">It is appellant\u2019s misfortune that the sufficiency of such an answer from the Alcohol Tax Unit is tested for the first time on its claim, but the granting of relief under this statute is not a matter of equity or discretion until the applicable conditions precedent to such relief have been met. United States v. Dodd, 5 Cir., 205 F.2d 260, 262. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
