Petitioner has appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Eligibility for an annuity is based upon the employment status of the applicant as defined in the Act. A person must have been an \u201cemployee\u201d on or after August 29, 1935, the enactment date, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 228a(j), \u00a7 228b(a) (1952). He is an \u201cemployee\u201d if he was on the enactment date in the service of an \u201cemployer\u201d or if he was in an \u201cemployment relation to an employer.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 228a(b) (1952). The Board, in affirming adjudications of the Bureau of Retirement Claims and of the Appeals Council, held that petitioner had been \u201cdischarged or retired\u201d before August 29, 1935, was not in an \u201cemployment relation\u201d on said date, and, consequently, was not entitled to an annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Petitioner has advanced two main reasons why the Board erred. First, he alleges erroneous findings by the Board. Petitioner argues there was no substantial evidence adduced to support the finding that he had no \u201cemployment relation\u201d on August 29, 1935. The record shows that the Board relied on an \u201cEmployment Relation Questionnaire,\u201d submitted to it by petitioner\u2019s last employer, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. In answers to pertinent employment questions, the Railroad Company stated that the \u201cdate and cause of separation from service\u201d were \u201c3-7-33. Record closed and held no rights for recall to Service.\u201d It seems such positive evidence could support a finding that petitioner\u2019s employment relation had been terminated prior to August 29, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">The Board may consider reports and answers to questionnaires which are not under oath, and such evidence can support the Board\u2019s decision. Ellers v. Railroad Retirement Board, 2 Cir., 1943, 132 F.2d 636. An administrative agency, as here, is not restricted to the same rules of evidence as apply in court proceedings; a finding can be supported if the evidence is of a kind on which fairminded men are accustomed to rely in serious matters. Ellers v. Railroad Retirement Board, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">The petitioner asserts that \u201cfuture\u201d relief dues deducted from a January pay check he received in April, 1933 and from a relief check dated March 1, 1933, indicate that he was \u201cstill on the rolls and was never retired.\u201d He also alleges that he was seriously injured in his employment January 4, 1933 and that intermittent treatment by Company doctors for two or three years after the injury indicates a continuation of the employment relationship. Such evidence does not prove petitioner\u2019s record was not closed, especially when met by an unqualified statement of the Railroad Company that their records show petitioner\u2019s record as an employee had been closed on March 7, 1933. Petitioner\u2019s argument that his discharge was invalid because he received no notification of the action is meaningless without showing a requirement for such notification. No such requirement existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\"> A review of the record indicates that there is substantial evidence present to support the decision of the Board in finding that petitioner had been \u201cdischarged or retired\u201d prior to August 29, 1935. Consequently, the Board\u2019s decision on this point may not be disturbed. Barton v. Railroad Retirement Board, 3 Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 710; South v. Rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>road Retirement Board, 5 Cir., 1942, 131 F.2d 748, certiorari denied, 1943, 317 U.S. 701, 63 S.Ct. 525, 87 L.Ed. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Petitioner\u2019s second, and main argument against the decision of the Board involves the interpretation of section 1 (d), subdivision iii (A) of the Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 228a(d) (1952). It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoOM\">\u201c(d) An individual shall be deemed to have been in the employment relation to an employer on the enactment date if (i) * * *; or (ii) * * *; or (iii) before the enactment date he did not retire and was not retired or discharged from the service of the last employer by whom he was employed or its corporate or operating successor, but (A) solely by reason of his physical or mental disability he ceased before the enactment date to be in the service of such employer and thereafter remained continuously disabled until he attained age sixty-five or until August 1945 or (B) * * *, or (C) * * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Petitioner argues this section provides that a separation due solely to permanent disability continues the \u201cemployment relation.\u201d He contends that at the moment his permanent disability separated him from service on January 4, 1933, section 1(d) (iii) (A) of the Act'preserved his \u201cemployment relation\u201d against any attempt to close his record. Petitioner, in effect, claims that because his services were terminated after incurring the disability he was not discharged. However, it has been held that a discharge terminates the \u201cemployment relation,\u201d even though the discharge took place after the employee had been totally disabled. South v. Railroad Retirement Board, supra; Bruno v. Railroad Retirement Board, D.C.W.D.Pa.1942, 47 F.Supp. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">He further claims that Regulation 204.6 under the Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denominating manner of \u201cdischarge or retirement\u201d is invalid. Petitioner argues that clause (A) in Section 1(d), supra, stands by itself and is not affected by an alleged discharge of an individual after a permanently disabling injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\"> The Board, on the other hand, advocates that after a \u201cdischarge or retirement\u201d in 1933, there could not have been an \u201cemployment relation\u201d on August 29, 1935. We are thus called upon to interpret the meaning of this section of the Act. The cases hold that where the meaning of a statute is clear, and where the language is plain, no construction is permissible. Caminetti v. United States, 1917, 242 U.S. 470, 485, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442; United States v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 1929, 278 U.S. 269, 277, 49 S.Ct. 133, 73 L.Ed. 322. Under subsection (iii), it is clear that there can be no \u201cemployment relation\u201d on the enactment date if an individual had been \u201cretired or discharged\u201d before the enactment date. Clause (A) clearly does not set up an exception among those who have been discharged or retired. It merely sets up an entirely new concept when there is <em>no </em>retirement or discharge and still an employee <em>\u201cceased </em>* * * to be in the service of such employer * * * \u201d by other means. Such interpretation is entirely consonant with any accepted definitions of the word \u201cbut,\u201d which introduces clause (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">The Board, in its findings of fact, held that petitioner was \u201cretired or discharged\u201d from the service of the railroad prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>to August 29, 1935. Therefore, within the plain meaning of section 1(d) (iii) of the Act, supra, petitioner had no \u201cemployment relation\u201d on or after the enactment date, and is not entitled to an annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The decision of the Railroad Retirement Board will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">. 20 Code Fed.Regs. \u00a7 204.6 (1949) (Regulations under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">\u201cCircumstances under which employee status is terminated. An individual shall be deemed to have retired or to have been retired or discharged if there was a rule or practice in effect on the employer in accordance with which the individual\u2019s rights as an employee were terminated, or if he was discharged, was granted a continuing pension or gratuity, was superannuated, or if bis <em>record was closed out, </em>or if the employee resigned or relinquished his rights or otherwise separated himself from employer service. Discharge, resignation, superannuation or retirement must be determined according to the substance of the transaction, even though the transaction may have been otherwise denominated.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
