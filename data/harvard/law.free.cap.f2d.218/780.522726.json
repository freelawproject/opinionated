More than five years ago the applicability in Alaska of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was specifically determined by this court in Cutting v. Bullerdick, 9 Cir., 178 F.2d 774, 777, with a caveat \u00e1gainst \u201cany relaxation in the requirements of the rules in cases to which they are applicable.\u201d The same is true of the rules of this court and the present appeal is subject to dismissal for the noncompliance referred to. Inasmuch as all questions on the merits apparently urged in appellants\u2019 argument have been decided adversely to appellants\u2019 contentions in Jones v. U. S., 9 Cir., 195 F.2d 707, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
