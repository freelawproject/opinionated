Rodgers, 5 Cir., 218 F.2d 536. We there held, as we do here, that in a prosecution for receiving and concealing, under the second clause of section 174, Title 21, it is not necessary to allege that the narcotics had been imported contrary to law where it charged that the defendant knew that it had been so imported.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-18\">Here appellant made no motion to dismiss, as did Rodgers, but moved in arrest' of judgment on the same ground. Since the indictment was good, there is no necessity for discussion of appellant\u2019s insistence that he did not waive the defect by failure timely and properly to raise the question before trial under Rule 12(b) (2) and (3), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
