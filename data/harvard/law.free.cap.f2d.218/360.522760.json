The proof, given largely by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>bank employee himself, showed that the conspiracy called for Allen\u2019s taking a particular shipment of money that was expected on December 30, 1953 and, after counting it in his cage, then on the following morning putting it in a brief case and handing it over to defendant Mitchell, who would leave the bank and drive away in a car driven by appellant. All of these plans were carried out. Allen took the money from the cage over which he presided as teller, handed it to Mitchell in the men\u2019s room of the bank, Mitchell left the bank and was driven away by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">All appellant has to say in support of his theory that no embezzlement was proved is summed up in the following paragraph from his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">\u201cIt is appellant\u2019s contention that when Allen placed the money in the cash box, where he customarily left it, on the afternoon of December 30, 1953, he delivered it to his employer, and that when he took it out the following morning he did so with a felonious intent and was guilty of theft and not of embezzlement, because his taking of the money on the morning of December 31, to deliver it to Mitchell was wrongful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The simple answer to this contention is that the only reason Allen had access to the money was because he was the teller in charge of this particular operation. His possession of it on the morning of the crime was as a trusted employee of the bank. This he testified to. Therefore, when he took advantage of his legal possession of the money to \u201cabstract\u201d it, he was guilty of the offense of embezzlement. Lea v. United States, 5 Cir., 159 F.2d 939, certiorari denied 331 U.S. 833, 67 S.Ct. 1513, 91 L.Ed. 1846; Eslick v. United States, 6 Cir., 76 F.2d 706, certiorari denied 295 U.S. 766, 55 S.Ct. 926, 79 L.Ed. 1707; Weinhand-ler v. United States, 2 Cir., 20 F.2d 359, certiorari denied 275 U.S. 554, 48 S.Ct. 116, 72 L.Ed. 423.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">The trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"AsT\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\">. Cf. Williams v. United States, 5 Cir., 208 F.2d 447, in which we held that the act of a federal employee to obtain possession initially of specific property which otherwise would not have come into his possession, made his wrongful disposition thereof theft and not embezzlement, where he acted to obtain possession after forming the intent to steal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
