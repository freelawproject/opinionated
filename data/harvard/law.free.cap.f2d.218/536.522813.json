The trial court sustained a motion to dismiss and the Government appeals. We hold the indictment is sufficient. It charges a violation of section 174, Title 21, U.S.C.A. and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">\u201cOn or about April 5, 1953, in Bexar County, Texas, within said district and division, Homer Lavel Rodgers knowingly and fraudulently received and concealed a narcotic drug, to wit, eight and one-half (8%) grains of heroin, after being imported and brought into the United States; and the said Homer La-vel Rodgers then knew said heroin had been imported into the United States contrary to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">The court held the indictment \u201cinsufficient in that it fails to allege that the heroin was imported contrary to law, which allegation should have been made in addition to the allegation that the defendant knew that the heroin had been imported contrary to law at the time he received and concealed it.\u201d In other words, the court held that the words, \u201ccontrary to law,\u201d should have followed \u201cafter being imported.\u201d We think this reasoning is unsound. It reads words into the second clause of the statute, upon which the indictment was based, which are not a part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 reads, so far as pertinent here, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-16\">\u201cWhoever fraudulently or knowingly imports or brings any narcotic drug into the United States * * * contrary to law, or receives, conceals * * * any such narcotic drug after being imported or brought in, knowing the same to have been imported contrary to law * * * shall be fined * * * and imprisoned * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-20\">It will be observed that the statute denounces: (1) fraudulent or knowing importation or bringing in of any narcotic drug contrary to law; and (2) receiving, concealing, etc., any such narcotic drug, after being imported or brought in, knowing the same to have been imported contrary to law. The indictment here follows the exact language of the second clause of the statute. The phrase, \u201ccontrary to law,\u201d as used in the first clause, is not a part of the offense defined in the second clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even if it had been used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>there, it is difficult to understand how a defendant could know that a narcotic drug had been imported contrary to law unless it had been so imported.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">In Wong Lung Sing v. United States, 9 Cir., 3 F.2d 780, the court upheld an indictment in the identical language used here. The language charges at once that the narcotic drug had been imported into the United States contrary to law and that the defendant knew it at the time he received and concealed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-21\">. Cf. Shafer v. United States, 9 Cir., 179 F.2d 929, 930, holding that \u201cfraudulently or knowingly,\u201d used in the first clause, is not a part of the offense defined in the second clause; and Aeby v. United States, 5 Cir., 206 F.2d 296, making the same distinction,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
