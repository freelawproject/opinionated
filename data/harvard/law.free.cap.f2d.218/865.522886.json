Its amended by-laws state that it was formed <em>\u201cfor the </em>purpose of aiding the families of- deceased members; first, by providing with certainty and promptness a substantial sum for their relief in the most equitable manner, and at as near the actual net cost of insurance as possible; second, by securing for them without cost the pensions to which they may be legally entitled.\u201d (Ass\u2019n Bylaws, Art. I, Sec. 1, as amended (1880).) These are cross appeals from a declaratory judgment that the Association is subject to the provisions of the Life Insurance Act of the District of Columbia, 48 Stat. 1125 et seq., D.C.Code 1951, \u00a7\u00a7 35-301 to 35-803, but not subject to the tax on insurance companies provided by Title II of the Act of August 17, 1937, 50 Stat. 675 et seq., D.C.Code 1951, \u00a7\u00a7 47-1801 to 47-1808. We think the District Court was clearly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
