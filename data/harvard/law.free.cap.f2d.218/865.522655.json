From a verdict and judgment for the defendant, plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-21\">We think that the trial court correctly applied the rule in force in Maryland in holding that, under the circumstances of the case, the plaintiff was either a trespasser or, at most, a licensee. This being so, the jury was properly instructed that \u201cdefendant owes the duty to refrain from wantonly or willfully causing\u201d minor plaintiff harm and \u201cowes the duty of not exposing plaintiff to hidden perils or dangers which [he] could not avoid by reasonable care on his part.\u201d See Carroll v. Spencer, 204 Md. 387, 104 A.2d 628; State, to Use of Stanfield v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co., 1914, 123 Md. 120, 91 A. 149, 52 L.R.A.,N.S., 1170; Grube v.
