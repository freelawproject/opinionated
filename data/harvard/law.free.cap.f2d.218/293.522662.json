He filed notice of appeal with the district court and now seeks to docket his appeal here and proceed without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">He would have been released from Alcatraz, he alleges, on June 7, 1954, if he had been given credit for good time earned. However, after a hearing the Good Time Board forfeited his good time.' His contention is that the Board acted arbitrarily. Banghart is no longer in custody of Swope. Since the question is moot his petition is ordered dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
