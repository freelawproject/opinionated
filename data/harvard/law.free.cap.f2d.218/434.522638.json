This toy has been marketed by them, after a considerable expenditure of time, effort, and money, to fulfill a seasonal demand created by the Howdy Doody television program, on which a chimpanzee named Zippy appears. Despite the fact that defendants\u2019 doll is substantially identical to, and was obviously copied from, that of plaintiffs, the judge below refused to grant a preliminary injunction before full trial. His memorandum of decision stated: \u201cFrom the papers submitted I am satisfied that there is a genuine triable issue as to the validity of plaintiffs\u2019 copyright and in view of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to show irreparable damage, the granting of the drastic remedy of a preliminary injunction is not justified in advance of a trial of the issues.\u201d Plaintiffs appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292, controverting both assumptions on which the denial of injunction rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-23\">From the pleadings and affidavits before us, on which Judge Inch based his decision, there seems little doubt as to the validity of plaintiffs\u2019 copyright or as to its infringement. Copyright protection extends to any production of some originality and novelty, regardless of its commercial exploitation or lack of artistic merit. Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630; see also Notes in 68 Harv.L. Rev. 517 (1955) and 66 id. 877 (1953). Indeed, we have said: \u201cAll that is needed to satisfy both the Constitution and the statute is that the \u2018author\u2019 contributed something more than a \u2018merely trivial\u2019 variation, something recognizably \u2018his own.\u2019 Originality in this context \u2018means little more than a prohibition of actual copying.\u2019 No matter how poor artistically the \u2018author\u2019s\u2019 addition, it is enough if it be his own.\u201d Alfred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Bell &amp; Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, <em>2 </em>Cir., 191 F.2d 99, 102, 103, per Circuit Judge Frank. Here, moreover, mere judges can hardly risk condemning Zippy for lack of artistry and thus prove themselves false prophets to the far-flung faithful Howdy Doody audience, which seemingly adores his bizarre features and funny face. The mere fact that these were based on a live model does not deprive them of the necessary amount of originality.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Nor can we agree with defendants\u2019 contention that plaintiffs waived their copyright by permitting photographs of Zippy to appear in trade journals. Where, as here, each copyrighted object is itself properly labeled to comply with the notice requirements of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 10, reproductions in trade journals do not result in loss of the copyright. Alfred Bell &amp; Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, supra, 2 Cir., 191 F.2d 99, 105. Plaintiffs correctly point out that defendants\u2019 copy could in any case have been derived only from the three-dimensional figure itself. The evidence which supports this \u2014 the reproduction of plaintiffs\u2019 mold number, and of plaintiffs\u2019 copyright notice, on defendants\u2019 dolls \u2014 also makes infringement indisputable, since the visual resemblance between the two dolls is apparent. See F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts, 1 Cir., 193 F.2d 162, affirmed 344 U.S. 228, 73 S.Ct. 222, 97 L.Ed. 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"> When a prima facie case for copyright infringement has been made, plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction without a detailed showing of danger of irreparable harm. Houghton Mifflin Co. v. Stackpole Sons, Inc., 2 Cir., 104 F.2d 306, certiorari denied Stackpole Sons, Inc. v. Houghton Mifflin Co., 308 U.S. 597, 60 S.Ct. 131, 84 L.Ed. 499; L. C. Page &amp; Co. v. Fox Film Corp., 2 Cir., 83 F.2d 196; American Code Co. v. Bensinger, 2 Cir., 282 F. 829; Fishel v. Lueckel, C.C.S.D.N.Y., 53 F. 499. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the market for their toy is seasonal and likely to be exhausted by Easter is nowhere controverted. Hence the district court erred in refusing to grant a preliminary injunction to plaintiffs in this case. Its order is accordingly reversed, and the case is remanded for immediate entry of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
