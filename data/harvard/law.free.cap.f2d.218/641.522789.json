On November 1, 1954, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, which imposed sentence, denied a motion to vacate sentence or correct erroneous sentence made by Hiller. The court denied permission to appeal forma pau-peris.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\"> He now seeks from this court permission to appeal forma pauperis. His theory is that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568 prevents a federal court from imposing consecutive sentences. The exact same contention was made under the predecessor statute to \u00a7 3568 and disposed of contrary to Hiller\u2019s view. United States v. Solomon, 2 Cir., 70 F.2d 834; accord, Parmagini v. United States, 9 Cir., 42 F.2d 721. A petition for leave to prosecute an appeal in forma pauperis is granted only when there is some merit in the appeal. Fisher v. Cushman, 9 Cir., 99 F.2d 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">The application to appeal forma pau-peris is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
