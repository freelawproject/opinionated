The fourth count charged that Farina and Coudert con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>spired together to sell heroin. Coudert\u2019s conviction on all counts is not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The government argues that from the evidence the jury could reasonably find the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Coudert and Farina were members of a ring trafficking in drugs between Mexico City and New York. Sometime in 1953, Coudert brought six kilos of heroin from Mexico City to New York in the false sides of two trunks. He delivered them to Farina. Farina sold them and accounted to Coudert for their proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In December, 1953, Coudert met two men posing as potential drug purchasers. He agreed to supply them regularly with narcotics. As a starter, he promised to retrieve \u2014 for sale to them \u2014 a part of the six kilos he had previously delivered to Farina. The government aborted the transaction by arresting Coudert and Farina on the eve of Farina\u2019s flight to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Farina argues that there was insufficient evidence to justify the jury\u2019s finding that he was a party to the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">1. The bulk of evidence adverse to Farina consisted of conversations between Coudert and the two men whom Coudert believed, at the time of the conversations, to be potential purchasers of heroin, but who were, in reality, Bureau of Narcotics agents. Farina was not present at any of these conversations. Thus their content was, as to him, inadmissible hearsay unless the government could independently establish Farina\u2019s connection with the conspiracy. United States v. Nardone, 2 Cir., 106 F.2d 41, 42, reversed on other grounds 308 U.S. 338, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307; Montford v. United States, 5 Cir., 200 F.2d 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Independent evidence of Farina\u2019s connection with the conspiracy included the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">(1) Confronted with Coudert, Farina, denied that he had ever before seen him. Such an exculpatory statement, when proved to be false, is circumstantial evidence of \"guilty consciousness\u201d and has \u201cindependent probative force.\u201d United States v. Smolin, 2 Cir., 182 F.2d 782, 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">(2) There were a series of meetings and telephone calls between Farina and Coudert, in the ten-day period immediately prior to their arrest, during which they were under constant surveillance by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">(3) There was evidence of a conversation between Coudert and Farina, overheard by an eavesdropping government agent employing an electronic device. Introduction of evidence so obtained is permitted by the doctrine of Goldman v. United States, 316 U.S. 129, 62 S.Ct. 993, 86 L.Ed. 1322. Farina\u2019s reference, in the conversation, to Mexico, to \u201cthe entire six kilos you have given me,\u201d to \u201cwe\u2019ll make the final accounting,\u201d to \u201c24,000\u201d and \u201c12,000,\u201d all tended to establish his role in the conspiracy, when coupled with other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-16\">(4) Various exhibits were found in the possession of Farina and Coudert at the time of their separate but simultaneous arrests, e. g., Coudert had $100 bills in numerical sequence with $100 bills found in Farina\u2019s possession; Farina had an amount of cash equal to the amount mentioned to Coudert during the eavesdropping conversation; each had slips containing telephone numbers (including Mexico City numbers) called by the other; each had papers in identical handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-17\">We find the above evidence, viewed \u2014 as it must be \u2014 in the light most favorable to the government, sufficient to permit the jury to infer Farina\u2019s connection with the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-18\">2. The defendant argues that the evidence shows that the relationship between him and Coudert was merely that of buyer and seller, The short answer is that, operating under proper instructions from the judge, the jury found otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
