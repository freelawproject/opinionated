Briscoe was injured driving a truck. The deputy commissioner awarded compensation based on findings that Harris was Briscoe\u2019s general employer and Maloney Concrete Company, Inc., his special employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Harris, the Maloney Company, and the Company\u2019s insurance carrier have appealed from several judgments of the District Court (1) dismissing suits to set aside the basic award;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) dismissing a suit to set aside a supplementary order of the deputy commissioner declaring the amount in default;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) requiring payment to Briscoe of the amount in default as declared by the supplementary order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The appellants attack the deputy commissioner\u2019s findings that Harris and the Maloney Company were Briscoe\u2019s employers within the meaning of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 44 Stat. 1424, 33 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 901 et seq. These findings are supported by substantial evidence. We find no error in the judgments dismissing the suits to set aside the basic award.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\"> By \u00a7 21(a) of the Act a compensation award is made \u201ceffective\u201d when it is filed in the office of the deputy commissioner, and is made \u201cfinal\u201d thirty days later unless proceedings to suspend it or set it aside are instituted under \u00a7 21(b). 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921(a), 44 Stat. 1436.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\u201cIn case of default by the employer in the payment of compensation due under any award * * * for a period of thirty days after the compensation is due and payable,\u201d \u00a7 18 authorizes the deputy commissioner to \u201cmake a supplementary order, declaring the amount of the default, which shall be filed in the same manner as the compensation order.\u201d 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 918, 44 Stat. 1434. Payments called for by an \u201ceffective\u201d compensation award are \u201cdue and payable.\u201d Twine v. Locke, 68 F.2d 712, 714. Harris v. Briscoe, 94 U.S.App.D. C. -, 212 F.2d 619. Accordingly the deputy commissioner, on Briscoe\u2019s application, made a supplementary order declaring the amount in default. The appellants were notified of the application and were asked to show what payments, if any, had been made on the basic award. They failed to respond or to apply for the hearing which \u00a7 19(c) permits. Section 18 declares the deputy commissioner\u2019s supplementary order \u201cfinal\u201d and directs the District Court, upon the filing of a copy, to \u201center judgment for the amount declared in default by the supplementary order if such supplementary order is in accordance with law.\u201d The District Court accordingly dismissed appellants\u2019 suit to set aside the supplementary order and entered judgment for the amount in default. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">Section 21(b) provides that \u201cIf not in accordance with law, a compensation order may be suspended or set aside * * * through injunction proceedings * * *. The payment of the amounts required by an award shall not be stayed pending final decision in any such proceeding unless upon application for an interlocutory injunction the court, on hearing, after not less than three days\u2019 notice to the parties in interest and the deputy commissioner, allows the stay of such payments, in whole or in part, where irreparable damage would otherwise ensue to the employer. The order of the court allowing any such stay shall contain a specific finding, based upon evidence submitted to the court and identified by reference thereto, that such irreparable damage would result to the employer, and specifying the nature of the damage.\u201d 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921(b), 44 Stat. 1436. The appellants failed to show irreparable damage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the District Court accordingly denied their application for an interlocutory injunction staying payment of the amounts required by the basic award. But a panel of this court of which the writer of this opinion was a member permitted the appellants to supersede, pending appeal, the District Court\u2019s judgment entered under \u00a7 18 requiring payment to Briscoe of the amount in default. Harris v. Briscoe, supra. The question whether supersedeas should have been granted has now become moot. The writer of this opinion now thinks supersedeas should probably not have been granted, and if the question were in issue would request a rehearing by the court in banc. Concerning this matter the other members of the present panel express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">All the appealed judgments are</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-14\">.
