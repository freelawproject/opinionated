The plaintiff concedes that the trial judge\u2019s instructions on this question were proper if there was evidence from which the jury might find the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence over and above his assumption of the risk of his employment. Our examination of the record satisfies us that there was such evidence. We accordingly find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-26\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed, each party to bear its own costs in this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
