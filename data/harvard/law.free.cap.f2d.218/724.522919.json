About 4:45 on the afternoon of that day, she entered the hardening freezer at the plant where she was working to buy some ice cream for her own use. While inside the freezer, the door in some way became locked and she was injured while extricating herself. Her claim for workmen\u2019s compensation was denied, the State Industrial Commission specifically finding that the injury did not arise out of and in the course of her employment; that she was not acting within the scope of her employment or for the benefit of her employer, but was acting as a customer of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-16\">After this order became final, she instituted an action in the District Court of Oklahoma County against Gilt Edge to recover damages by reason of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>alleged negligence. The suit was settled by agreement of the parties without prejudice to the rights of the two insurance companies to deny liability under their respective policies. Whereupon, this declaratory action was commenced in the federal court for the Western District of Oklahoma by American against Pacific, the Dairy and Gri-der, for a declaration of nonliability under its comprehensive liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Issues having been joined on the pleadings and agreements of the parties, the court held Pacific primarily liable and American secondarily liable under their respective policies. Pacific has appealed from this judgment, contending simply that the findings and conclusions of the State Industrial Commission are res judicata and decisive of the issues of liability. The argument is that since, under the binding order of the Commission, Grider\u2019s injuries did not arise out of and in the course of her employment, its policy does not cover the risk; and that since she occupied the status of a customer \u2014 a member of the general public, the risk is covered by American\u2019s comprehensive policy. It is said that there can be no overlapping or primary-secondary coverage, as the trial court held.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">To support its contention that American\u2019s policy covers the risk, appellant relies primarily upon cases generally to the effect that an employee is not engaged in his employment within the meaning of exclusionary provisions in policies like American\u2019s, while riding to and from his employment, or while not otherwise actually engaged in the pursuance of his duties as an employee. Boyle-Farrell Land Co. v. Standard Accident Ins. Co., 8 Cir., 24 F.2d 55; Lesser v. Great Lakes Casualty Co., 171 Or. 174, 135 P.2d 810; Hoosier Casualty Co. v. Miers, 217 Ind. 400, 27 N.E.2d 342. See also B &amp; H Passmore Metal &amp; Roofing Co. v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., 10 Cir., 147 F.2d 536, Tri State Casualty Co. v. Loper, 10 Cir., 204 F.2d 557; I-L Logging Co. v. Manufacturers &amp; Wholesalers Indemnity Exchange, Or., 273 P.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The finding of the Commission to the effect that Grider\u2019s injuries did not arise out of and in the course of her employment within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is basic to its adjudication of nonliability under the Act \u2014 a matter clearly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission. We accept the adjudication of the Commission on the question of liability under the Oklahoma Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law and if the limits of Pacific\u2019s liability under its policy are measured by the incidence of that law, we should accept the order of the Commission as conclusive of Pacific\u2019s contractual liability. But this suit does not involve coverage under the Oklahoma Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. It involves coverage under two insurance contracts, a matter not committed to nor decided by the Commission. The issue of coverage depends upon the interpretation of the contracts as to which the subsidiary findings of the Commission are merely gratuitous and not binding on any party here, especially American.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">By its clear terms, Pacific\u2019s policy was intended not only to cover liability imposed by the Oklahoma Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, but to also indemnify the insured employer against loss by reason of liability imposed upon him. by law for damages on account of injury to employees \u201cas are legally employed.\u201d American Mutual Liability Ins. Co. v. Duesenberg, 214 Ind. 488, 14 N.E.2d 919, 16 N.E.2d 698, 117 A.L.R. 1293; Edward Stern &amp; Co. v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 269 Pa. 559, 112 A., 865; Carolina Veneer &amp; L. Co. v. American Mutual Liability Ins. Co., 202 S.C. 103, 24 S.E.2d 153. In the language of the Oklahoma Courts, \u201cThe policy was issued to an employer who employed: workmen falling within the Workmen's. Compensation Law to whom he might, become liable under and by virtue of' that law and to whom he might become. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>liable in tort or for negligence.\u201d Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York v. Gray, 181 Okl. 12, 72 P.2d 341, 345. The purpose of the second insuring clause in the policy was to afford coverage to Gilt Edge for injuries to employees growing out of the business carried on by Gilt Edge, where the injury did not occur to the employee in the course of his employment and hence would not be covered by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and the first insuring clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The two policies were designed to provide complete coverage for the insured\u2019s operations. They assumed two entirely separate and distinct risks, one, the risk incident to the employment of employees, the other, liability to the general public. Lumber Mutual Casualty Ins. Co. v. Stukes, 4 Cir., 164 F.2d 571; State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. v. Braxton, 4 Cir., 167 F.2d 283; State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. v. Brooks, 8 Cir., 136 F.2d 807. And, the liability under the respective policies is determinable by a construction of the language used to delineate coverage, or in other words, to describe the risk assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">If, at the time of the injury, Grider was \u201clegally employed\u201d within the meaning of Pacific\u2019s policy, we need not determine whether she was injured while \"\u201cengaged in the employment\u201d of the insured within the meaning and intendment of American\u2019s policy, for, if Pacific\u2019s policy covers the risk, American\u2019s policy is clearly inoperative, there being no excess liability. Bennett v. Preferred Accident Ins. Co. of New York, 10 Cir., 192 F.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">If, as we have seen, the use of the words \u201csuch employees as are legally employed\u201d was intended to provide coverage beyond the narrow limits of liability imposed by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws, it seems only reasonable and rational to say that to come within the coverage of Pacific\u2019s policy, the injury need not arise out of or in the course of employment. Nor must the injury have occurred while actually engaged in the employment of the insured. It is sufficient, we think, if it can be said that the injury resulted from a hazard reasonably incident to or in some way casually connected with her employment. Given this construction, the two policies provide the complete and separate coverage they were intended to effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">While it is not clear from the record whether, at the tijne of her injury at 4:45 in the afternoon, Grider had ceased her day\u2019s work, or whether she had temporarily departed from her duties to attend to personal affairs, it is decisively clear that she had not departed from the premises where she was employed and that the hazard to which she was subjected and which brought about her injury was incident to and reasonably associated with her status as one \u201clegally employed\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">Our facts and contract are not like Boyle-Farrell Land Co. v. Standard Accident Ins. Co., supra, where the policy covered liability imposed by law for damages on account of bodily injuries sustained by reason of the operation of the business by any employee. \u201cThe policy\u201d said the court, \u201cdid not cover all the relations of employment, but limited the liability of the defendant to the relationship that existed while the employee was actually engaged in the work of his employment.\u201d [24 F.2d 56.] Nor is this case like Lesser v. Great Lakes Casualty Co., supra, where the contract covered liability imposed by law for bodily injuries suffered by any person \u201cnot employed by the assured\u201d. [171 Or. 174, 135 P.2d 811.] The injured party paid for her apartment partly in cash and partly in service, with the understanding that she would have the privilege of all tenants for the use of the laundry room and equipment. She was injured while temporarily digressing from the use of the laundry facilities to perform a duty not incident to the services performed for the use of the apartment. The court rightly concluded that she was not employed within the meaning of the policy. And, our case is clearly distinguishable from, Hoosier Casualty Cq. v. Miers, supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>where an employee, injured while the guest of his employer on a hunting trip, was held not to be an employee within the meaning of a policy which covered liability imposed by law upon the insured for damages on account of bodily injuries upon any person, except employees of the insured or his family. The court very prop#erly concluded that the injury was wholly disconnected and foreign to the relationship of employer and employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Unlike those cases, here there was a reasonable relationship between the injury and the employment. We conclude, therefore, that Grider was \u201clegally employed\u201d within the meaning of Pacific\u2019s policy, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
