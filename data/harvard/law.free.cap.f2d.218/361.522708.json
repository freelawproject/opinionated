He based this testimony on his office records. On cross-examination the government called appellant\u2019s attention to the fact that the \u201c4\u201d of the \u201cAugust 14\u201d on his records was handwritten quite heavily in ink, whereas the remainder of the date was stamped. In explanation, appellant testified that the date originally stamped on the record was the 14th and that the same handwritten figure \u201cwas put in by myself at the time of the visit. That happens often, the stamp is incomplete or fades, and I write over it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-27\">Appellant was subsequently indicted, tried and convicted of perjury, on the ground that the original stamped date was August 18, and that he knew this to be so at the time he falsely testified otherwise. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>At the trial of this case various enlarged photographs of the writing in question were admitted in evidence. These showed what appeared to be a round-bodied figure underlying the \u201c4,\u201d and were such that the jury could properly have concluded from them that the \u201c4\u201d had been superimposed on an \u201c8.\u201d Two government witnesses were qualified as experts in examining such documents, and testified, over objection, that in their opinion the handwritten \u201c4\u201d had been superimposed on an \u201c8.\u201d In addition, the government\u2019s case included evidence of a number of corroborating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Appellant\u2019s first contention on this appeal is that the opinions of the expert witnesses as to the existence of a figure \u201c8\u201d under the \u201c4\u201d should have been excluded as invading the province of the jury. That argument was rejected by the Supreme Court in United States v. Johnson, 1943, 319 U.S. 503, 519, 63 S.Ct. 1233, 1241, 87 L.Ed. 1546, with the comment that it \u201ctacitly assumes that juries are too stupid to see the drift of evidence. * * * So long as proper guidance by a trial court leaves the jury free to exercise its untrammeled judgment upon the worth and weight of testimony, and nothing is done to impair its freedom to bring in its verdict and not someone else\u2019s, we ought not be too finicky or fearful in allowing some discretion to trial judges in the conduct of a trial and in the appropriate submission of evidence within the general framework of familiar exclusionary rules.\u201d Applying this language to the present case, we find no merit in the appellant\u2019s contention, in view of the \u25a0court\u2019s correct instructions to the jury in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\"> It is next argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict, in that the stringent degree of proof which is necessary to establish perjury was not met. The rule is that the falsity cannot be proved by circumstantial evidence alone nor by the uncorroborated testimony of one witness. Weiler v. United States, 1945, 323 U.S. 606, 65 S.Ct. 548, 89 L.Ed. 495; Hammer v. United States, 1926, 271 U.S. 620, 46 S.Ct. 603, 70 L.Ed. 1118; Ra-domsky v. United States, 9 Cir., 1950, 180 F.2d 781; Allen v. United States, 4 Cir., 1912, 194 F. 664, 39 L.R.A.,N.S., 385. The proof in this case contained neither defect. The questioned writing itself, as revealed by the photographs, was directly, and not circumstantially, probative of the falsity of appellant\u2019s oath, and since this was in essence \u201cdocumentary or written testimony springing from\u201d the appellant, there was no failure to meet the required standards of proof. United States v. Wood, 1840, 14 Pet. 430, 39 U.S. 430, 10 L.Ed. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Appellant further claims error in the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that if appellant had sworn falsely \u201cinadvertently, inconsiderately, or carelessly,\u201d or \u201cwith a mistaken but honest belief as to the truth of his testimony,\u201d then he must be acquitted. While such an instruction would have been proper, the court adequately covered the point by instructing the jury that willfulness in testifying falsely was \u201cprobably the essence of the offense,\u201d and by defining \u201cwillfully\u201d to mean \u201cknowingly and intentionally, done with corrupt design or purpose.\u201d Moreover, the requirement of willfulness was repeatedly adverted to by the court throughout the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The remaining questions on this appeal are concerned with whether the court properly instructed the jury as to the stringent burden of proof peculiar to perjury cases. Appellant submitted four requested instructions, set out in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> relevant to the rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>circumstantial evidence alone is insufficient to establish the offense of perjury, as also is the uncorroborated testimony of one witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">All four of these requested instructions were refused. The court charged the jury that the burden was \u201cupon the United States to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt by clear, convincing and direct evidence.\u201d The jury was also charged that the introduction of documentary evidence \u201cdoes not dispense with the requirement that such evidenc\u00e9 be direct and positive as distinguished from circumstantial or negative.\u201d Other than these two passages, the jury was told nothing concerning the unique burden of proof obtaining in a perjury case, nor of the meaning of the terms direct and circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The law is clear that appellant was entitled to an instruction on the extraordinary burden of proof in perjury cases. Weiler v. United States, 323 U.S. 606, 65 S.Ct. 548, 549, 89 L.Ed. 495. That case expressly reaffirms that \"The general rule in prosecutions for perjury is that the uncorroborated oath of one witness is not enough to establish the falsity of the testimony of the accused set forth in the indictment.\u201d The case also clearly holds that \u201cIt is the duty of the trial judge, when properly requested, to instruct the jury on this aspect of its function, in order that it may reach a verdict in the exercise of an informed judgment.\u201d The Weiler opinion makes clear that this duty exists without regard to the number of prosecution witnesses who may have actually testified; that it is the function of the jury, not the court, to determine whether the standard has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">In the Weiler case, as in the present case, more than one witness actually gave testimony on behalf of the prosecution. In that case, as in this, there was in fact direct documentary evidence of perjury originating with the appellant himself. See Court of Appeals opinion in the Weiler case, 3 Cir., 143 F.2d 204, 209. There, as here, it was argued to the court that, in view of the record, the failure to instruct on the \u201ctwo witness rule\u201d did not prejudice the appellant. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of conviction because of the trial court\u2019s failure to so charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Whatever our independent judgment might otherwise be, we conclude that Weiler v. United States determines the question, and requires reversal of this conviction for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">The fact that two of the requested instructions were not completely accurate statements of the law did not operate to forfeit appellant\u2019s right to have the jury properly instructed on the points raised by the requests. Request No. 9 failed to define \u201cdirect evidence\u201d broadly enough to include documentary as well as testimonial evidence, and the second sentence of request No. 18 would have improperly restricted the jury from basing a conviction on direct documentary evidence \u201cspringing from\u201d appellant. United States v. Wood, supra; see Maragon v. United States, 1950, 87 U.S. App.D.C. 349, 187 F.2d 79. In . the Weiler case itself, as was pointed out in the Maragon case, the request which was denied contained the same defect as appellant\u2019s request No. 18 in this case. See also Fraser v. United States, 6 Cir., 1944, 145 F.2d 145, 152. Moreover, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>quests Nos. 10 and 11, dealing with circumstantial evidence, contained no such defect, and in this case instruction on that aspect of the law was probably as important.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">It only remains to comment upon appellant\u2019s contention that his requested instruction that \u201copinion evidence is in the nature of circumstantial evidence\u201d should have been given. While it may often be true that opinion evidence involves the witness\u2019s making an inference on the basis of established circumstances, that was not the case here. The expert witnesses in this case did substantially no more than testify what physical fact their more practiced eyes observed. As a trained musician may more readily distinguish a minute differentiation of pitch, so the jury would have been warranted in believing that these experts were able to see subtle differences of intensity. Their testimony as to their observation was therefore not circumstantial, and its credibility and weight were for the jury. For that reason, this request was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The points covered by the four requested instructions concerning the higher quantum of proof required in perjury cases should have been included in the court\u2019s charge, and for that reason the judgment is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-11\">. 9. I instruct you that evidence is \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d when the facts in dispute are related or communicated by witnesses who have actual knowledge of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">10. I instruct you that \u201ccircumstantial\u201d evidence is that which tends to establish the fact to be proved only through inference based on human experience that a certain circumstance is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>usually and reasonably present when another certain circumstance or set of circumstances is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">11. I instruct you that the defendant cannot be convicted of the offense of perjury by circumstantial evidence, however persuasive. In order to convict the defendant of perjury the United States must prove the falsity of the defendant\u2019s alleged sworn statement by direct and positive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">18. I instruct you that you cannot convict the defendant of the offense of perjury on the uncorroborated statement of any one witness. A conviction of perjury must be based upon the testimony of two or more witnesses, or if only one witness, then such witness must be corroborated by other substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
