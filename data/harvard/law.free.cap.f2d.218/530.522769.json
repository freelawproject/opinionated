World Pub. Co. v. United States, 10 Cir., 169 F.2d 186, and see United Business Corp. of America v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 62 F.2d 754; Chicago Stock Yards Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1 Cir., 129 F.2d 937, reversed on other grounds 318 U.S. 693, 63 S.Ct. 843, 87 L.Ed. 1086; Trico Products Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 424; Id., 46 B.T.A. 346; Nipoch Corp., 36 B.T.A. 662, dismissed 2 Cir., March 9, 1940; A. D. Saenger, Inc., v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 84 F.2d 23. See also 26 CFR \u00a7 39.102-2 and 1954 Federal Tax Service, Prentice-Hall, Yol. 1, Parg. 4721(b) (2). It has been suggested, however, that the recognized contingency is of little importance in its practical application since the absence of an undue accumulation is repugnant to the existence of the proscribed purpose. United States v. R. C. Tway Coal Sales Co., 6 Cir., 75 F.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\"> But conceding the erroneousness of the instructions of the court in that regard, we are constrained to hold that the question is not reviewable here. According to the record the collector filed with the clerk a requested instruction embodying this particular theory of the suit, and called it to the attention of the court prior to the charge. But the record also shows that no exceptions or objections were taken to the court\u2019s instructions after they were given. In that respect, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. Rule 51, 28 U.S.C.A. leaves no room for doubt. It provides that, \u201cNo party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>verdict; stating distinctly the matter to which, he objects and the grounds' of' his objection * * .</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">We have very recently had occasion to reiterate the importance of -this requirement in the field of procedural law, and to reaffirm the injunction that the correctness of the instructions of the-court are not open to review on appeal unless the matter is brought to the attention of the trial court by exceptions to the instructions or in some other appropriate manner. Jones v. Griffin, 10 Cir., 216, F.2d 885. See also Comins v. Scrivener, 10 Cir., 214 F.2d 810; Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. Andrews, 10 Cir., 211 F.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ3\">If the court failed to give the requested instruction literally or in substance, it was. the inescapable duty of counsel to call it to the attention of the court and to register his objections on the record. Certainly the failure of the court to give the requested instruction is not so palpably erroneous as to justify notice of the same sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-24\">. \u201c\u00a7 102.
