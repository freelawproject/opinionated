The agreement provided for the employment of plaintiff as the superintendent of defendant\u2019s lithograph plant in Vermont. It also provided:</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1001-9\">\u201cSubject to the general supervision and pursuant to the orders, advice and direction of the Employer, Employee shall have charge of and be responsible for the operation of said lithographic plant in North Bennington, shall perform such other duties as are customarily performed by one holding such position in other, same or similar businesses or enterprises as that engaged in by the Employer, and shall also additionally render such other and unrelated services and duties as may be assigned to him from time to time by Employer. * * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1001-11\">\u201cEmployer shall pay Employee and Employee agrees to accept from Employer, in full payment for Employee\u2019s services hereunder, compensation at the rate of $15,000.00 per annum, payable twice a month on the 15th and 1st days of each month during which this agreement shall be in force; the compensation for the period commencing August 1, 1952 through August 15, 1952 shall be payable on August 15, 1952. In addition to the foregoing, Employer agrees that it will reimburse Employee for any and all necessary, customary and usual expenses incurred by him while traveling for and on behalf of the Employer pursuant to Employer\u2019s directions. * * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1001-12\">\u201cIt is expressly understood and agreed that Employee shall not be entitled to any additional compensation by reason of any service which he may perform as a member of any managing committee of Employer, or in the event that he shall at any time be elected an officer or director of Employer. * * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1001-13\">\u201cThe parties hereto do agree that any differences, claim or matter in dispute arising between them out of this agreement or connected herewith shall be submitted by them to arbitration by the American Arbitration Association, or its successor and that the determination of said American Arbitration Association or its successors, or of any arbitrators designated by said Association, on such matter shall be final and absolute. The said arbitrator shall be governed by the duly promulgated rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association, or its successor, and the pertinent provisions of the Civil Practice Act of the State of New York relating to arbitrations [section 1448 et seq.]. The decision of the arbitrator may be entered as a judgment in any court of the State of New York or elsewhere. * * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1001-14\">\u201cThe parties hereto do hereby stipulate and agree that it is their intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>and covenant that this agreement and performance hereunder and all suits and special proceedings hereunder be construed in accordance with and under and pursuant to the laws of the State of New York and that in any action special proceeding or other proceeding that may be brought arising out of, in connection with or by reason of this agreement, the laws of the State of New York shall be applicable and shall govern to the exclusion of the law of any other forum, without regard to the jurisdiction in which any action or special proceeding may be instituted.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1002-4\">Plaintiff, having become a resident of Vermont, brought this action in the Vermont state court. His complaint set forth the agreement alleged that defendant had wrongfully discharged plaintiff, and asked damages. Defendant, having removed the suit to the court below, filed its answer, including a counterclaim. Defendant then made a motion for a stay; it alleged that it had served on plaintiff a demand for arbitration, and prayed that plaintiff\u2019s suit be stayed \u201cpending appointment of arbitrators and determination by such arbitrators of the controversies which are the subject matter of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1002-5\">The district judge denied the stay on the ground that, under Vermont \u201claw,\u201d an agreement to arbitrate \u201cis not binding and is revocable at any time before an award is actually made by arbitrators,\u201d and that, under Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, and related cases, Vermont \u201claw\u201d controlled, 122 F.Supp. 733.

We think that a stay, pursuant to Section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3, is not \u201csubstantive\u201d within the meaning of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, and Guaranty Trust Company of New York v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079. We so held, per Judge Learned Hand, in Murray Oil Products Company v. Mitsui &amp; Company, 2 Cir., 146 F.2d 381, 383, where we said: \u201cAi'bitration is merely a form of trial, to be adopted in the action itself, in place of a trial at common law: it is like a reference to a master, or an \u2018advisory trial\u2019 under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 39(c), 28 U.S.C.A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\"> 2. Section 3 applies whether or not the agreement is of a kind covered by Sec. 2, i. e., for purposes of Sec. 3, the agreement need not involve a maritime transaction or interstate or foreign commerce. The power to enact Sec. 3 derives from Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. See, e. g., Shanferoke Coal &amp; Supply Corp. v. Westchester Service Corp., 2 Cir., 70 F.2d 297, 298, affirmed 293 U.S. 449, 55 S.Ct. 313, 79 L.Ed. 583; Agostini Bros. Bldg. Corp. v. United States, 4 Cir., 142 F.2d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-19\">3. Plaintiff argues that Section 3 deals with a suit \u201cbrought in any of the courts of the United States\u201d and therefore not with a removed suit. We cannot agree. Murray Oil Products Co. v. Mitsui &amp; Co., supra, was a removed suit; see also Parry v. Bache, 5 Cir., 125 F.2d 493, 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-20\">4. Section 1 of the Act provides that \u201cnothing herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We need not in this case decide whether this clause is restricted in its application to those sections of the Act relating to interstate and foreign commerce or whether it applies to all sections, including Section 3. For assuming, arguendo, that the second interpretation is correct, we think the clause irrelevant here. The words \u201cany other class of workers\u201d, read in connection with the immediately preceding words, show an intention to exclude contracts of employment of a \u201cclass\u201d of \u201cworkers\u201d like \u201cseamen\u201d or \u201crailroad employees.\u201d<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Plaintiff was not hired as a \u201cworker\u201d but as a plant superintendent, at a salary of $15,000 a year, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>managerial duties fundamentally different from those of \u201cworkers.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The California arbitration statute excludes from its scope \u201ccontracts pertaining to labor.\u201d Code Civ.Proc. \u00a7 1280. The California courts have held that this exclusion does not cover a contract with a sales manager, hired at a salary of $100 per week; Kerr v. Nelson, 7 Cal.2d 85, 59 P.2d 821; or one with a motion-picture actor to be paid $1,000 per week; Universal Pictures Corp. v. Superior Court, 9 Cal.App.2d 490, 50 P.2d 500. See also Levy v. Superior Court, 15 Cal.2d 692, 104 P.2d 770, 773, 129 A.L.R. 956. We think these decisions most persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">.
