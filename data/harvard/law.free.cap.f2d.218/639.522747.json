The money received on these sales had been misappropriated by two of the taxpayer\u2019s officers. Before the end of the taxable year the embezzlement was discovered by the taxpayer\u2019s president and the embezzlers promised to make restitution, which they did in a subsequent year. The taxpayer contends that no deficiency resulted from failure to report the sales, because a deduction in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>amount of the embezzlement was allowable under section 23(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23(f), which permits the deduction of \u201closses sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.\u201d The Tax Court ruled that the loss was \u201cotherwise\u201d compensated for by reason of the embezzlers\u2019 promise to make restitution. In Earle v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 72 F.2d 366 we held that the obligation to repay which the law imposes upon an embezzler does not prevent deduction of the loss in the year the embezzlement occurred even though there is no proof of his financial inability to repay. This decision is distinguishable. 'Here the embezzlers promised to repay, they retained their offices and their promise was apparently accepted as assurance that their misappropriation would be made good, as it subsequently was. The taxpayer was on an accrual basis and the embezzlers\u2019 promise was a contract obligation which accrued within the taxable year. The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed on the opinion of Judge Raum.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
