Most of the evi-dentiary facts are set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion and need not be repeated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>here. After that opinion was rendered, the district court, upon the appellant\u2019s request, made certain additional findings of fact quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> None of the findings of evidentiary or primary facts are challenged by the appellant, but only the ultimate finding by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Appellee relies strongly on what we said when deciding a similar case in Lo-bello v. Dunlap, 5 Cir., 210 F.2d 465, 468: \u201cSince the question is one of ultimate fact, the judgment of the district court should be affirmed unless found to be clearly erroneous.\u201d Several of our earlier cases were cited in support of the assertion that the question is one of ultimate fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">It is also true, however, that the burden of showing a finding of fact \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d is not a measure of exact and uniform weight. Under the circumstances of each case, it depends on whether \u201cthe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 338 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746. The burden is especially strong when the trial court has had the opportunity, not possessed by the appellate court, to see and hear the witnesses, to observe their demeanor on the stand, and thereby the better to judge of their credibility. Grace Bros. v. C. I. R., 9 Cir., 173 F.2d 170, 173, 174. The burden is lighter, much lighter, when we consider logical inferences drawn from undisputed facts or from documents, though the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule is still applicable. United States v. United States Gypsum, supra; Benton v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 197 F.2d 745, 753. Insofar, however, as the so-called \u201cultimate fact\u201d is simply the result reached by processes of legal reasoning from, or the interpretation of the legal significance of, the evidentiary facts, it is \u201csubject to review free of the restraining impact of the so-called \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 rule.\u201d Lehmann v. Acheson, 3 Cir., 206 F.2d 592, 594. As succinctly stated by Professor Moore, \u201cFindings of fact that are induced by an erroneous view of the law are not binding. Nor are findings that combine both fact and law, when there is error as to the law.\u201d 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, 2d ed., Sec. 52.03(3), p. 2631. The language of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, speaking for the Court, in Baumgartner v. United States, 322 U.S. 665, 670, 671, 64 S.Ct. 1240, 1243, 88 L. Ed. 1525, is helpful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-11\">\u201cThe conclusiveness of a \u2018finding of fact\u2019 depends on the nature of the materials on which the finding is based. The finding even of a so-called \u2018subsidiary fact\u2019 may be a more or less difficult process varying according to the simplicity of subtlety of the type of \u2018fact\u2019 in controversy. Finding so-called ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u2018facts\u2019 more clearly implies the application of standards of law. And so the \u2018finding of fact\u2019 even if made by two courts may go beyond the determination that should not be set aside here. Though labeled \u2018finding of fact\u2019, it may involve the very basis on which judgment of fallible evidence is to be made. Thus, the conclusion that may appropriately be drawn from the whole mass of evidence is not always the ascertainment of the kind of \u2018fact\u2019 that precludes consideration by this Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The district court observed with reference to the ultimate question, that \u201cthe determination of this fact issue is not free of doubt.\u201d 116 F.Supp. at page 334. Some of the many factors to be considered are recounted in Dunlap v. Oldham Lumber Co., 5 Cir., 178 F.2d 781, and in Lobello v. Dunlap, supra 210 F.2d at page 468. While the ultimate question concerns the purpose for which the property was held at the time of sale,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is necessary to consider also the purpose for which it was held prior to sale.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the question relates to whether the property was held <em>primarily </em>for sale, etc. United States v. Bennett, 5 Cir., 186 F.2d 407, 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The appellant insists that the facts in the case of Victory Housing No. 2 v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 Cir., 205 F.2d 371, are identical in their material aspects with the instant case. That case, however, is distinguished on its facts from a case even more closely resembling this case in Home Co., Inc., v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 Cir., 212 F.2d 637, 641, and the distinguishing principle upon which the decision turns is thus stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">\u201cOne may, of course, liquidate a capital asset. To do so it is necessary to sell. The sale may be conducted in the most advantageous manner to the seller and he will not lose the benefits of the capital gain provision of the statute, unless he enters the real estate business and carries on the sale in the manner in which such a business is ordinarily conducted. In that event, the liquidation constitutes a business and a sale in the ordinary course of such a business and the preferred tax status is lost.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">\u201c[Footnote] 3. White v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, &amp; Cir., 172 F.2d 629.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">See, also, Brown v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5th Cir., 143 F.2d 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">Congress intended to alleviate the burden on a taxpayer whose property has increased in value over a long period of time. When, however, such a taxpayer endeavors still further to increase his profits by engaging in a business separable from his investment, it is not unfair that his gain should be taxed as ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">After careful consideration, we find ourselves in agreement with the opinion of the district court) 116 F.Supp, 333, and the judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\">. \u201c1: \u2014 When it was decided to sell these houses, they were placed on the market for sale and every effort made to sell them as quickly as possible. Plaintiff started selling houses on June 17, 1946, and by May 20, 1947 (less than one year), all the houses with the exception of two were sold. One of these was sold on July 14, 1947, and the other was sold on August 27, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u201c2: \u2014 All the houses were completed between the dates of April 15, 1943, and February 1, 1944. The first house sold was held for a period of more than three years. Some of the houses sold were held for a period of more than four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\u201c3: \u2014 Employees were maintained by plaintiff for the upkeep of the property, such as mowing the lawns, plumbing, painting and wiring and keeping everything in good shape. A very light vacancy was experienced. The corporation maintained its own rental offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">\u201c4: \u2014 Depreciation was claimed in the income tax returns of this plaintiff for the years 1943 to 1948, inclusive, on the houses in question, and after examination by revenue agents of all returns, this depreciation was allowed as claimed. No depreciation was claimed or allowed on the 97 houses sold during 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">\u201c5: \u2014 Plaintiff was notified by the Internal Revenue Agent, in whose hands its claim for refund was placed, substantially that the claim was rejected because \u2018Since the houses were held for sale to its customers in its ordinary trade or business, the profit is ordinary net income.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\">.
