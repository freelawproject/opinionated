C., declaring that an assault or battery becomes aggravated \u201cwhen committed by a person of robust health or strength upon one who is aged or decrepit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-20\">The State\u2019s evidence is to the effect that F. T. Hall, a man 66 years of age and totally blind, lived with his wife in a five-room house in the city of Houston, Texas; that they rented out rooms to the appellant and his wife who had lived in the house for some six or seven weeks. On the morning of the alleged assault, Hall had a conversation with the appellant relative to the payment of the rent which was some days past due. Appellant and his wife were moving out of the house and Hall was insisting upon the payment of the rent. As Hall was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the act of leaving the appellant\u2019s room, he was struck twice and knocked down, and then kicked in the back by the appellant. Hall was taken to the hospital in an unconscious condition and' some ten or eleven stitches were taken in his face. Hall testified that he made no attempt to strike the appellant and had no weapon of any kind in his hand at the time he was assaulted. He denied using any abusive language toward the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The appellant testified that he was 29 years of age and weighed 130 pounds; that he was suffering from a rupture and a weak heart. He testified that Hall came into the apartment occupied by the appellant and his wife on the morning of the alleged assault and demanded the payment of the rent; that Hall began cursing appellant in the presence of his wife; that appellant asked him to refrain from doing so. Hall became very angry at appellant and tried to hit him. Appellant caught hold of Hall and told him to get out of the room. As appellant opened the door, Hall \u201chung his foot or stumbled and fell.\u201d Appellant testified that he did not know' how Hall \u201cgot the gash down the side of his face\u201d; that he did not know what Hall fell over but believed he \u201chung his foot under the rug.\u201d Appellant testified further that he did not know how Hall got \u201churt on his back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The appellant\u2019s wife testified that she was present during the altercation and that she did not see her husband strike Hall. However, she testified that she fainted twice during that time and did not witness all that occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The wife of the injured party testified and denied that the appellant\u2019s wife fainted or was lying on the floor unconscious during the difficulty, but that she \u201cwas standing there screaming.\u201d Upon hearing the screams of the appellant\u2019s wife, the witness rushed into the room. From the testimony of the witness we quote:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u201cWhen I got in there Mr. Hall was sitting just on the floor and as I pushed the door \u2014 the door was ajar \u2014 and as I pulled the door back he was sitting there and he fell back. I saw he was unconscious and there was a big gash right here [indicating] on his face. * * * I picked his head up and called for help. No one else was in the room besides me and Mr. Hall and Mr. and Mrs. Lewing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">In the document denominated \u201cDefendant\u2019s Bill of Exception\u201d complaint is made of the action of the court in overruling the motion to quash the information for the reason that it was vague and indefinite and insufficient to charge an aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>assault committed by a person of robust health or strength upon one who is aged or decrepit. It is the contention of the appellant that the term \u201caged\u201d as used in the statute is indefinite and that therefore the statute is invalid. However, in the present instance, the charge was that the injured party was also \u201cdecrepit\u201d and this was definite and sufficient to render the statute valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In the case of Knight v. State, 46 S. W. (2d) 1006, in which the information charged that the injured party was \u201caged and decrepit,\u201d this Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u201cThe mere coupling of \u2018aged\u2019 with \u2018decrepit\u2019 in the State\u2019s pleading would not render it fundamentally bad. The word \u2018aged\u2019 might be disregarded as surplusage, and still the pleading would charge an offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The State\u2019s evidence showed without controversy that the alleged injured party was a man 66 years of age and totally blind. We do not think it can be denied that a blind man is a \u201cdecrepit\u201d person within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The term \u201cdecrepit\u201d is thus defined:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">\u201cInfirm; disabled, incapable or incompetent, from either physical or mental weakness or defects, whether produced by age or other cause, to such an extent as to render the individual comparatively helpless in a personal conflict with one possessed of ordinary health and strength.\u201d (Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, Baldwin Edition, p. 280.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">See, also, Branch\u2019s Ann. Texas P. C., p. 926, Section 1565, and cases collated; 4 Tex. Jur., p. 856, Section 22; Words &amp; Phrases (First Series), Vol. 2, p. 1908.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">As to the physical condition of the appellant, it is observed that he testified upon the trial that he was 29 years of age and weighed 130 pounds, but that he was suffering from a rupture and a weak heart. However, the wife of the alleged injured party testified that she had known the appellant for some six or seven weeks and replied to an inquiry by counsel that the appellant was a \u201cperson of robust health.\u201d While this may have been only an expression of her opinion, still the appellant testified as a witness upon the trial and was before the jury. Therefore, a controverted issue was presented for their solution; and we think the facts support their finding that the appellant was guilty of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Deeming the evidence sufficient to support the conviction, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
