D. Brogdon, by virtue of his contract of hiring with said D. D. Brogdon, did then and there unlawfully and without the consent of the said D. D. Brogdon, the owner thereof, unlawfully convert said ninety dollars in money, of the value of ninety dollars, to his, the said Piercie Whatley\u2019s own use and with the intent to deprive the said D. D. Brogdon, the owner thereof, of the value of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">It is observed that the word \u201cfraudulently\u201d is omitted from the indictment. The use of such word is indispensable in charging theft by bailee under Article 1429, P. C. Rhodes v. State, 54 S. W. (2d) 119; Patterson v. State, 56 S. W. (2d) 458. We quote said article as follows: \u201cAny person having possession of personal property of another by virtue of a contract of hiring or borrowing, or other bailment, who shall without the consent of the owner, <em>fraudulently </em>convert such property to his own use with intent to deprive the owner of the value of the same, shall be guilty of theft, and shall be punished as for theft of like property.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">The judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
