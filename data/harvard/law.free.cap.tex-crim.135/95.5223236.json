In the order over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ruling the motion for new trial there is no mention of any grant of time for the filing of bills of exception. In the absence of an order of the trial judge directing otherwise, our statute fixes the limit of time for filing bills of exception at thirty days after the adjournment of the trial term. The trial term of the court ended on January 1, 1938. Manifestly, the bills of exception were filed too late for our consideration. On the 21st of February, 1938, which was more than thirty days after the date of adjournment of the trial term, the trial judge made an order attempting to extend the time for filing the bills of exception. Under the circumstances, the court had no power to make an extending order. Article 760, C. C. P.; Kennedy v. State, 47 S. W.

We find the record in the same condition at this time, and we see nothing for us to review. We think our views expressed originally were correct, and this motion is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
