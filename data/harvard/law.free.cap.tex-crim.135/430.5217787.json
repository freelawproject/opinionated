The State failed to prove a single act of sexual intercourse between the parties. The only circumstances which the evidence established was that appellant visited at the Goodrich home; that at times he or she would give the son of Mrs. Goodrich money to go to the picture show while they remained at home and at times they would go to a restaurant together, accompanied, sometimes, by her husband. That at one time appellant inquired of the owner of a tourist camp the price of a cottage and thereafter Mrs. Goodrich rented a cottage and moved in. That appellant would frequently come there in his car to see her, but he never got out and entered her apartment, nor did he ever take her for a ride.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">These may be suspicious circumstances, but they are not sufficient to prove habitual sexual intercourse. The State, no doubt, realized this and therefore offered in evidence an ex parte affidavit by Mrs. Goodrich to the effect that she and appellant had engaged in sexual intercourse. Appellant objected to the introduction of the affidavit on various grounds, among them that it was an invasion of his constitutional right to be confronted with the witness. The court overruled the objection and appellant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">The ex parte affidavit was not admissible in evidence over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>appellant\u2019s timely objections, nor was the judgment of conviction of Mrs. Goodrich who was charged with the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Eliminating these, the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction. See Wilburn v. State, 77 S. W. 3; Hays v. State, 73 Texas Crim. Rep. 58; Newborn v. State, 292 S. W. 247; Torres v. State, 113 Texas Crim. Rep. 1; Buckner v. State, 72 S. W. (2d) 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In view of another trial, we direct the trial court\u2019s attention to the fact that there is no competent evidence in the record showing appellant to have been a married man. See Article 500, P. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">For the errors herein pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
