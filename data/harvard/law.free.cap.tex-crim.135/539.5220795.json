However, the facts upon which reliance is had are not brought forward for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The district judge having refused to issue the writ and no evidence having been heard on the application, no appeal would lie to the Court of Criminal Appeals. Such is the effect of established precedents. See Ex parte Hughes, 20 S. W. (2d) 1070; Ex parte Shelton, 20 S. W. (2d) 1058; Ex parte Wood, 18 S. W. (2d) 1080. See also Branch\u2019s Ann. Texas P. C., Section 243; 4 Tex. Jur., p. 483, Section 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Since this Court' is without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, it is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
