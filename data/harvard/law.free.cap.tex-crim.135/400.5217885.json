Entering the house through the back door, they heard a woman say: \u201cThere is the law.\u201d They then heard some kind of noise inside which sounded like the breaking of bottles. May, the owner of the house, was standing in the door leading to the back porch, with a hatchet in his hand. Entering a room in the house, one of the officers observed appellant standing over some broken bottles on the floor. No one saw appellant break the bottles. Besides appellant there were four other people in the house. There was a quantity of whisky on the floor and also some lysol. No one saw any whisky in unbroken bottles. The officers estimated the quantity of whisky on the floor to be more than a quart.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">Appellant timely and properly excepted to the charge of the court for its failure to submit an instruction on the law of circumstantial evidence. A requested charge on the subject was also presented and refused. We think the case was one depending wholly upon circumstantial evidence. It was not shown by direct evidence that appellant possessed more than a quart of whisky. There was no proof that he had sold or offered to sell any whisky. Under the circumstances, it was incumbent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>upon the State, in order to sustain a conviction, to prove that appellant possessed more than a quart of intoxicating liquor. Again, appellant\u2019s possession of the whisky was only shown circumstantially.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
