Hence no jurisdiction is shown in the county court. See Article 415, C. C. P.; and Olivares v. State, 76 S. W.

We have examined them and they appear to be in line with the decisions of this Court, and are such as we have uniformly upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">The statement of facts is short and shows, in substance, that upon a search of appellant\u2019s premises in Runnels County, in July, 1937, officers found 48 twelve ounce cans of beer, said beer containing alcohol in excess of one-half of one per cent, by volume, and that such county was a \u201cdry area\u201d at such time.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">The charge seems to be correct and the proof sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-16\">This cause is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b108-5\">Krueger, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"An7\">Appellant insists that the Court erred in holding the complaint and information sufficient to charge the offense. An examination thereof convinces us that the case was properly disposed of in our original opinion. The statement of facts is adequate to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
