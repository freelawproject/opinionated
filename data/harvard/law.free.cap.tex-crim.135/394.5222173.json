The appellant then demanded of the witness the name of such other party. The witness stated that such person was a man from Hardin-Simmons University, and, unless he was required to do so, he did not desire to reveal this person\u2019s name. The court in his qualification of such bill of exceptions states that the witness Dunsmore and such other person were working for the State Liquor Control Board, and such other party was a boy from this university, going about with Dunsmore, showing him where liquor could be purchased, Dunsmore making such purchases, while such boy was merely pointing out where such purchases could be made. It is to be noted that appellant introduced no testimony whatever. Under the circumstances we can see no useful purpose in requiring the witness to divulge the name of his companion, or in satisfying appellant\u2019s curiosity as to what his name might have been. No benefit could have resulted therefrom. It is to be noted that there is nothing in the bill to show that appellant did not know the name of such witness. There was no affirmative defense made hereto, although the testimony shows that there were other persons present at the time of the alleged offense, including appellant\u2019s wife. We see no reversible error reflected in such bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Bill of exceptions No. 2 complains of the fact that when appellant\u2019s attorney made the request to compel the witness to divulge the name of such boy, the county attorney said that \u201cit would not aid the defendant any to have said other person brought in because said other person\u2019s testimony would not help the defendant but would help the State.\u201d According to the court\u2019s qualification hereto, it seems that such remarks, although made in the presence and hearing of the jury, were addressed to the court, and the court immediately sustained the objection thereto and instructed the jury not to consider same for any purpose. There was no dispute relative to the sale. We think no serious error is disclosed in such bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In answer to appellant\u2019s bill of exceptions No. 3 we adopt the following part of the brief of the State\u2019s Attorney as our ruling thereon:</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u201cBy bill of exception No. 3 appellant claims that the charge relative as to what constituted a sale was on the weight of the evidence. In the first place, under the facts of the case, it was not necessary to define the term \u2018sale\u2019 at all. Stephens v. State, 96 S. W. 7; Trinkle v. State, 131 S. W. 583. Not only is that true, but, where there is no dispute as to the fact of sale, an error in defining the term \u2018sale\u2019 is harmless. Homan v. State, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>51 S. W. 237. Under the facts, appellant could not have been prejudiced by what the trial court said relative to the term \u2018sale,\u2019 because the facts showed a direct and positive transaction, amounting, in law, to a sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Perceiving no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
