His grounds of objection was that the search warrant was insufficient. The affirmance of the case, however, does not depend upon the sufficiency of the search warrant, because there is no statement of facts in the record. In its absence, we could not say that there was no evidence outside of the searching officers sufficient to make a case. It might be that appellant testified and admitted having the whisky, or such proof might have been produced from other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b539-15\">ON APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b539-16\">Christian, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AYt\">After re-examining the record in the light of appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing we are constrained to adhere to the conclusion expressed in the original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-17\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-18\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
