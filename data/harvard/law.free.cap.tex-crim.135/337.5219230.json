There appears in the transcript an affidavit filed in the trial court setting up the inability of appellant to pay for a statement of facts or to give security therefor. There is nothing to show that said affidavit was called to the attention of the trial judge. It follows that a reversal of the judgment on the ground that appellant has been deprived of a statement of facts would not be warranted. Fuller v. State, 264 S. W. 953; Beddingfield v. State, 93 S.
