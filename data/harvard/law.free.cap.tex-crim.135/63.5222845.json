We have heretofore held that a complaint is necessary in order to confer jurisdiction upon the county court. See Article 415, C. C. P.; McQueen v.

There are no bills of exception in the record. The facts seem to be.sufficient, and this judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b96-10\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b96-11\">Krueger, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A4D\">Appellant insists that the Court erred in holding the complaint and information sufficient to charge the offense. An examination thereof convinces us that the cause was properly disposed of in our original opinion. The statement of facts is adequate to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
