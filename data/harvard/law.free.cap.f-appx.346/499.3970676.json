After review, we vacate Perez\u2019s conviction and sentence on Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-24\">A grand jury charged Perez with one count of knowingly and falsely representing that a social security number was assigned to her for the purpose of obtaining an identification document issued by the State of Florida, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B) (Count 1), and one count of knowingly and willfully using without lawful authority the identification of another person during and in relation to a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(1) (Count 2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-25\">At a bench trial, the government presented the following stipulated facts. Perez, who was working as a prostitute, received a fraudulent Texas birth certificate and social security card in the name of Dana Renton from a pimp named \u201cJit Money.\u201d In 2006, Perez submitted these fraudulent documents to apply for and obtain a Florida identification card. Dana Renton is a real person.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-26\">Following the government\u2019s presentation, Perez moved for a judgment of acquittal on Count 2, the aggravated identity theft charge. Perez argued that the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ernment failed to present sufficient evidence that she knew that the identification documents she used belonged to a real person. The district court, relying on <em>United States v. Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d 603, 607 (11th Cir.2007), concluded that it need not make a finding as to Perez\u2019s knowledge and denied Perez\u2019s motion. In <em>Hurtado, </em>this Court held that \u00a7 1028A(a)(1) did not require the government to prove that a defendant \u201cknew that the means of identification that he possessed and used belonged to another actual person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610. The district court found Perez guilty, and Perez appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">On May 4, 2009, shortly after Perez filed this appeal, the Supreme Court issued a decision in <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. -, 129, S.Ct. 1886, 1894, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>overruled <em>Hurtado </em>and held that the government must show that the defendant knew the identification he used belonged to another person to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 1028A(a)(1). <em>Flores-Figueroa, </em>556 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 1890, 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">On appeal, Perez argues that the stipulated facts are not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she knew the identification she had used belonged to a real person and asks that her \u00a7 1028A(a)(1) conviction be vacated and remanded. The government concedes error that is not harmless and agrees that Perez\u2019s conviction on Count 2 must be vacated. Accordingly, in light of <em>Flores-Figueroa, </em>we vacate Perez\u2019s \u00a7 1028A(a)(1) conviction and sentence on Count 2 and remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of dismissing Count 2 of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-17\">. Perez does not challenge her conviction on Count 1 for social security fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
