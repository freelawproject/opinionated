Patterson committed the federal offenses between March 7 and March 16, 2006. The district court directed Patterson\u2019s 120-month sentence run consecutive to his undischarged state sentence of life plus 120 years\u2019 imprisonment, which he received based on his actions during a March 25, 2006, home invasion. This appeal raises the following issues: (1) whether the district court plainly erred in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(e) and directing Patterson\u2019s federal sentence run consecutive to his state sentence, and (2) whether the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence by directing Patterson\u2019s federal sentence run consecutive to his undischarged state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Patterson first argues the district court erred in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) and directing his federal sentence run consecutive to his state sentence. He contends the district court should have directed his federal sentence run concurrent to his undischarged state sentence pursuant to \u00a7 5G1.3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination a defendant\u2019s sentence should run consecutively to his undischarged state sentence. <em>United States v. Fuentes, </em>107 F.3d 1515, 1520 (11th Cir.1997). However, we review issues not raised before the district court for plain error. <em>United States v. Gerrow, </em>232 F.3d 831, 835 (11th Cir.2000). Under plain error review, we may, in our discretion, correct an error where (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, (3) the error affects substantial rights, and (4) \u201cthe error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777-79, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Section 5G1.3 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines provides, in relevant part:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"And\">(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and a term of imprisonment resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction under provisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) and that was the basis for an increase in the offense level for the instant offense under Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) or Chapter Three (Adjustments), the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">(1) the court shall adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served on the discharged term of imprisonment if the court determines that such period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">(2) the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">(c) (Policy Statement) In any other case involving an undischarged term of imprisonment, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b), (c) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">\u201cSections 5G1.3 and 1B1.3 interact to protect a criminal defendant from duplicative prosecutions ... These sections seek \u2018to provide one, uniform punishment for the same criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bidwell, </em>393 F.3d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Fuentes, </em>107 F.3d at 1522). When evaluating whether two or more offenses are part of the same course of conduct as provided for under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, the sentencing court should consider the degree of similarity between the offenses, the regularity (repetition) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 9(B); <em>see also Fuentes, </em>107 F.3d. at 1525.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">Here, Patterson relies upon our decision in <em>Fuentes </em>for the proposition the district court erred by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>treat his state offenses as part of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>course of conduct as his federal offenses pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This argument lacks merit because, unlike the offenses in <em>Fuentes, </em>Patterson\u2019s state and federal offenses were not \u201cnearly identical,\u201d and there is no indication the offenses \u201cwere committed with clear regularity.\u201d <em>See Fuentes, </em>107 F.3d at 1525. While Patterson and his co-defendant did possess two of the firearms present during the March 16 weapons transaction, the March 25 home invasion also involved kidnaping, aggravated assault, and armed robbery. The present case is also distinguishable from <em>Fuentes </em>because this case did not involve \u201ca deliberate attempt by the Government to manipulate the application of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>Bidwell, </em>393 F.3d at 1211. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err by applying \u00a7 5G1.3(c) in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Patterson next argues, even if \u00a7 5G1.3(e) applies, the district court disregarded its ability to impose a concurrent sentence. He contends the district court\u2019s failure to impose a concurrent sentence resulted in an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The imposition of consecutive rather than concurrent sentences is an issue of law subject to plenary review. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>956 F.2d 1098, 1101 (11th Cir.1992). In determining whether to impose a concurrent or consecutive term, the district court must consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 (referencing \u00a7 3553(a)), the type and length of the undischarged sentence, the time served on the undischarged sentence, and any other relevant circumstances. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, cmt. n. 3. \u201cMultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to run concurrently.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). We have concluded 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 \u201cevince[s] a preference for consecutive sentences when imprisonment terms are imposed at different times.\u201d <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502, 1506 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">\u201cWe review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1229 (11th Cir.2007). The reasonableness standard is synonymous with the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court need not discuss each of them individually. Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Ordinarily, we would expect a sentence within the guideline range to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Here, the district court considered the length of Patterson\u2019s undischarged state sentence prior to imposing the federal sentence. The district court also discussed other factors relevant under \u00a7 3584. For example, the district court stated it had fashioned the federal sentence to address \u201cthe goals of deterrence, punishment, and incapacitation and the violent nature of the defendant,\u201d and it noted it had taken into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>more, the sentence was within the guideline range. Based on the district court\u2019s consideration of the relevant factors and the facts of this case, we conclude the district court did not err in directing Patterson\u2019s federal sentence run consecutive to his undischarged state sentence, and Patterson\u2019s federal sentence is not unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\">. Subsection (a) of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 is not discussed because the parties agree, and it is clear, it does not apply in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">. In <em>Fuentes, </em>the district court sentenced the defendant to a federal sentence to run consecutively to an undischarged state court one, in which both cases involved the dismantling of automobiles to sell their parts for money. 107 F.3d at 1516. This Court concluded the conduct underlying the state and federal offenses constituted the same course of conduct and held the federal sentence was to run concurrently with the state sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1525.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
