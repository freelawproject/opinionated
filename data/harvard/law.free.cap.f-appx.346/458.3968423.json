The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court, in denying Stilling\u2019s motion to suppress the narcotics evidence that was seized during a traffic stop of his vehicle, erred by applying the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule. Stilling asserts the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress after finding the officer who conducted the initial stop lacked probable cause to do so, and that the inevitable discovery doctrine does not apply because the second deputy who arrived at the scene was not in \u201cactive pursuit\u201d of Stilling prior to the initial stop. After review, we affirm Stilling\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">\u201c[We review] a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress under a mixed standard of review, reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and the district court\u2019s application of law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Desir, </em>257 F.3d 1233, 1235-1236 (11th Cir.2001). Under the Fourth Amendment, individuals are protected from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1873, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). This safeguard extends to \u201cbrief investigatory stops of persons or vehicles that fall short of traditional arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). Accordingly, \u201can officer\u2019s actions during a traffic stop must be \u2018reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place\u2019... [and] the duration of the traffic stop must be limited to the time necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Purcell, </em>236 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>88 S.Ct. at 1879).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">When evidence is obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, it may not be used in a criminal prosecution against the victim of the illegal search and seizure. <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 416, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). The exclusionary rule, however, is not without limits. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>487 U.S. 533, 108 S.Ct. 2529, 2534, 101 L.Ed.2d 472 (1988) (explaining both the inevitable discovery and independent source doctrines). Under the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule, \u201cthere must be a reasonable probability that the evidence in question would have been discovered by lawful means, and the prosecution must demonstrate that the lawful means which made discovery inevitable were being actively pursued prior to the occurrence of the illegal conduct.\u201d <em>Jefferson v. Fountain, </em>382 F.3d 1286, 1296 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">The district court did not err in denying Stilling\u2019s motion to suppress because the evidence fell within the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule. With respect to the legality of the stop, the court determined (1) Deputy Lajic had probable cause to stop Stilling based on the two traffic citations he issued, and (2) Deputy Lajic\u2019s testimony was consistent, credible, and not rebutted by the evidence. While Stilling asserts the district court erred in finding Deputy Lajic\u2019s testimony credible, this Court accords great defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ence to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, <em>United States v. Clay, </em>376 F.3d 1296, 1302 (11th Cir.2004). The district court specifically found Deputy Lajic was credible based on his uncontroverted testimony that Stilling was speeding and driving at night without his headlights on. Notwithstanding Stilling\u2019s attempts to contradict Deputy Lajic\u2019s testimony, nothing in the record indicates the district court clearly erred in finding Deputy Lajic credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Nor did the court clearly err in finding Deputy Lajic was in \u201cactive pursuit\u201d of Stilling. With respect to this element of the inevitable discovery exception, the court found both Deputy Lajic and Deputy Ortiz were participating in the stop, and Deputy Lajic \u201cwould have stopped Lamarcus Stilling for speeding and not having his headlights on.\u201d The court also noted Deputy Lajic was on the lookout for Stilling \u201cin hopes that [Stilling] would commit a traffic violation that would give [Deputy Lajic] probable cause to stop [Stilling].\u201d The fact Deputy Ortiz was in front of Deputy Lajic, and was able to stop Stilling seconds before Deputy Lajic, did not controvert the court\u2019s finding that Deputy Lajic was in active pursuit of Stilling.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Furthermore, the district court\u2019s application of the inevitable discovery doctrine falls squarely within this Circuit\u2019s jurisprudence. As in <em>Jefferson, </em>the police had information that caused them to focus their attention on Stilling even before the stop. <em>See Jefferson, </em>382 F.3d at 1296. Moreover, and assuming the stop by Deputy Ortiz had not occurred, Deputy Lajic was seconds behind Deputy Ortiz in stopping Stilling and would have lawfully stopped him based on the traffic violations Stilling had committed. As Deputy Lajic testified, he was looking for probable cause to stop this particular vehicle, which had been identified as coming from a high drug-trafficking area. Upon a lawful stop of Stilling\u2019s vehicle, Deputy Lajic would have inevitably discovered the cocaine in Stilling\u2019s vehicle. There was a reasonable probability the drugs would have been discovered during Deputy Lajic\u2019s stop, and Deputy Lajic was actively pursuing Stilling prior to Deputy Ortiz\u2019s stop. \u2022 <em>See Jefferson, </em>382 F.3d at 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The district court also did not err in finding both the duration of the stop and the search itself were legal. Approximately ten minutes passed between the time when deputies pulled Stilling over and the time when the canine unit arrived. Ten minutes to issue the traffic citations and wait for the canine unit\u2019s arrival represents a time frame that falls within the ambit of \u201cthe time necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>See Purcell, </em>236 F.3d at 1277. Similarly, the district court did not err in finding there was probable cause to conduct the search based on the deputies\u2019 knowledge that Stilling had just come from a high drug-trafficking area and the drug dog\u2019s exterior alert to the presence of drugs in Stilling\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The district court did not err in applying the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule because: (1) there was a reasonable probability the narcotics would have been discovered by means of a lawful traffic stop; and (2) the lawful means that made discovery inevitable were being actively pursued prior to the occurrence of the unlawful stop. Accordingly, we affirm Stilling\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
