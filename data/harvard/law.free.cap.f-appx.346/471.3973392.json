Linehan, a Seventh-Day Adventist, appeals <em>pro se </em>from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to alter or amend its judgment, which granted in part, and denied in part, summary judgment on his Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\u201cRLUIPA\u201d) claims, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc. On appeal, Linehan argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to alter or amend the judgment on his RLUIPA claims because it failed to address the time period when the Florida Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d) had provided kosher meals to Jewish inmates, but not to Seventh-Day Adventist inmates. He also contends that the DOC\u2019s policy of not providing him with kosher meals during the period when it provided Jewish inmates with kosher meals was not the \u201cleast restrictive means in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest.\u201d Linehan does not directly argue that the DOC\u2019s current policy of not providing kosher meals to inmates is not the least restrictive means in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest, but because Linehan proceeds <em>pro se, </em>we will construe his appeal as including that argument. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u201cWe review the denial of a motion to alter or amend a judgment under Rule 59(e) for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Shuford v. Fidelity Nat\u2019l Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>508 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2007). The district court construed Linehan\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend as a motion for reconsideration. We also review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Simms, </em>385 F.3d 1347, 1356 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">In order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case under RLUIPA, \u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate 1) that he engaged in a religious exercise; and 2) that the religious exercise was substantially burdened.\u201d <em>Smith v. Allen, </em>502 F.3d 1255, 1276 (11th Cir.2007); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-l(a). If a plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden then shifts to the government to \u201cdemonstrate that the challenged government action \u2018is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest\u2019 and \u2018is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>502 F.3d at 1276 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000cc-1(a), 2000cc-2(b)). Context matters in the application of the compelling governmental interest standard. <em>Cutter v. Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. 709, 723, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 2123, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005). The standard should be applied with \u201cdue deference to the experience and expertise of prison and jail administrators in establishing necessary regulations and procedures to maintain good order, security and discipline, consistent with consideration of costs and limited resources.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Linehan\u2019s motion to alter or amend its judgment. First, contrary to Linehan\u2019s contention, the district court did address the time period when the DOC had a kosher meal program but denied Linehan participation because he was not Jewish. The district court granted Linehan nominal damages for his exclusion from the kosher meal program during that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>time period. Second, the DOC has a compelling governmental interest in keeping costs down and preventing security risks. The DOC submitted affidavits showing that its current policy of providing vegan and vegetarian meals instead of kosher meals was the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling governmental interests of keeping costs down and preventing security risks. <em>See Baranowski v. Hart, </em>486 F.3d 112, 125-26 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that, where kosher meals were not provided to a Jewish inmate, budgetary and security concerns were a compelling governmental interest). Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
