The district court granted the government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion based on Edwards\u2019s substantial assistance and sentenced Edwards to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, approximately half the high end of the applicable guidelines range of 188 to 235 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">When a sentencing guideline is amended and given retroactive effect, the district court may reduce an already incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under the amendment \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, unauthorized under section 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Amendment 706 \u2014 which became retroactive on 3 March 2008, U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. 1 May 2008) \u2014 reduced by two the base offense levels in crack cocaine sentences calculated pursuant to the drug quantity table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">The career offender guideline provides that \u201cif the offense level for a career offender ... is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the [career offender] offense level ... shall apply.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b). In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), we concluded that defendants sentenced as career offenders were ineligible for sentence reductions under Amendment 706 because defendants\u2019 guidelines ranges were not based on the drug quantity offense levels that had been lowered by Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">Edwards argues that he was not sentenced as a career offender because his total offense level was the same under either the drug quantity or career offender guideline and, thus, <em>Moore </em>does not preclude him from receiving a sentence reduction. <em>Moore </em>did not address explicitly the applicability of Amendment 706 to a defendant whose total offense level was the same under the drug quantity and career offender guidelines. But we conclude that Edwards\u2019s career offender designation ultimately drove the calculation of his guidelines range; and the district court correctly denied section 3582 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>In this case, the district court made a guidelines determination that Edwards was a career offender.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That his offense level under section 2Dl.l(e) also was 31 (because application of section 4Bl.l(b) did not result in a higher offense level) did not change his career offender status. Thus, in determining whether Amendment 706 reduced Edwards\u2019s guidelines range, the district court was required to consider not only whether the amendment reduced the drug quantity base offense level, but whether section 4Bl.l(b) produced a higher offense level than his amended drug quantity offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) (the court \u201cshall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Had Amendment 706 been in effect at Edwards\u2019s original sentencing, his drug quantity offense level would have been 29 instead of 31. But his career offender offense level would have remained at 31. Therefore, Amendment 706 did not have the effect of reducing Edwards\u2019s guideline range; and the district court concluded correctly that Edwards was ineligible for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\">. Edwards did not file a formal section 3582(c)(2) motion. Instead, on the promulgation of Amendment 706, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>appointed counsel for Edwards and ordered responses about his potential eligibility for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-15\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's legal conclusions about the scope of its authority in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v.
