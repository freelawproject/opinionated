Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Proceeding <em>in forma paupe\u00f1s </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d), Lee filed this <em>pro se </em>civil rights action, pursuant to <em>Bivens,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>against D. Hudson, Associate Warden at Federal Correctional Institution in Jesup, Georgia, \u201cother unnamed federal correctional officers,\u201d the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d), and the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d). He alleged that on March 14, 2008, Hudson, as part of what was supposedly a routine inspection, entered Lee\u2019s prison cell in his absence and removed several of his legal materials. As a result, Lee asserted that he was denied the right of access to the courts because Hudson removed all of the legal materials that Lee had compiled for an unrelated appellate brief that was due nine days later in this Court \u2014 in Case No. 08-10324. In addition to his access-to-courts claim, Lee alleged that Hudson\u2019s seizure and confiscation of his legal materials violated his Fourth Amendment and due process rights. With respect to his due process claim, Lee emphasized that he was never notified about the confiscation, in violation of the BOP\u2019s policy statements and legal directives. Lee also alleged that, before the March 14 incident, unnamed prison officials had delayed his outgoing mail, including his legal correspondence, in violation of federal criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Because Lee was proceeding IFP, a magistrate judge screened his complaint, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. In recommending that the district court dismiss Lee\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, the magistrate first concluded that Lee failed to state an access-to-courts claim against Hudson because he had not shown any actual injury. The magistrate also found that Lee made no factual allegations against the remaining defendants and, therefore, his complaint failed to set forth a short and plain statement, as required under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). Significantly, the magistrate did not address the remainder of Lee\u2019s allegations, including his due process claim. Overruling Lee\u2019s objections and supplemental objections, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and dismissed Lee\u2019s complaint. Lee subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court summarily denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, \u201cthe district court shall review, before docketing, if feasible or, in any event, as soon as practicable after docketing, a complaint in a civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a). \u201cOn review, the court shall identify cognizable claims or dismiss the complaint, or any portion of the complaint, if the complaint ... fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Similarly, the district court must dismiss any complaint filed by an individual proceeding IFP if it fails to state a claim. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">Applying the same standards used in the context of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), we review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>such dismissals <em>de novo, </em>viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>See Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t. of Corrs., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001) (addressing dismissals under \u00a7 1915A(b)); <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997) (addressing dismissals under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)). In this respect, we liberally construe Lee\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint. <em>Douglas v. Yates, </em>535 F.3d 1316, 1320 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We first conclude that Lee failed to state an access-to-courts-claim because he did not show any actual injury. <em>See Barbour v. Haley, </em>471 F.3d 1222, 1225 (11th Cir.2006). Although he asserts that Hudson confiscated all of the legal materials that he had compiled in preparation for an unrelated appellate brief due in this Court, a review of that appeal reveals that Lee filed his brief without incident. <em>See Bass v. Singletary, </em>143 F.3d 1442, 1446 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">We next conclude that Lee failed to state a Fourth Amendment claim, as the Supreme Court has held that \u201c[pjrisoners have no Fourth Amendment rights against searches of their prison cells.... \u201d <em>Padgett v. Donald, </em>401 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 525-26, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3200, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984)). We similarly conclude that dismissal was proper with respect to Lee\u2019s claims against the DOJ and BOP. <em>See F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 484-86, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1005-06, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994) (holding that <em>Bivens </em>does not provide a cause of action against federal agencies). Lee\u2019s allegation that unnamed prison officials violated federal criminal statutes by delaying his outgoing legal mail also does not state a claim under <em>Bivens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Although dismissal was proper with respect to the above claims, we vacate and remand Lee\u2019s due process claim because the district court failed to address it, and it is not readily apparent from the complaint why this claim is due to be dismissed as a matter of law. <em>See Simmons v. Wainwright, </em>462 F.2d 1340, 1342 (5th Cir.1972) (\u201cBecause of the district court\u2019s failure to enter findings and conclusions with respect to all of the appellant\u2019s claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, we are compelled to vacate the judgment below, and remand the cause.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate and remand Lee\u2019s due process claim for further proceedings, but we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\">. Although Lee cited 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, his complaint is properly construed as one brought pursuant to <em>Bivens, </em>as he sued only federal, not state, actors. <em>See Hartman v. Moore, </em>547 U.S. 250, 254 n. 2, 126 S.Ct. 1695, 1700 n. 2, 164 L.Ed.2d 441 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\">.
