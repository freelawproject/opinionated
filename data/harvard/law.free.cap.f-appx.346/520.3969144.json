Winston, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3) motion, in which he alleged that the government acted fraudulently in his underlying criminal proceedings. After his initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion was denied on the merits, Winston filed numerous additional post-conviction challenges, all of which were dismissed as successive. Winston then filed this Rule 60(b)(3) motion in which he explained that an exhibit pertaining to a car that was used to obtain his arrest warrant was no longer in the record, and argued that its absence from the record showed that it was falsified. The district court denied the motion, finding that the exhibit\u2019s absence from the court\u2019s file (1) did not prove that a fraud had occurred or that the prosecutor had engaged in misconduct, and (2) failed to prove that the car never existed. R4-176 at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">Winston argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 60(b)(3) motion because he submitted evidence showing that the government committed fraud in his underlying criminal proceedings by attributing to him possession of a car that did not exist. In his Rule 60(b)(3) motion, he did not identify the judgment from which he was seeking relief, but requested a mistrial as the remedy and did not allege fraud in his prior post-conviction proceedings. <em>See </em>R4-175 at 1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Turner v. Sec\u2019y of Air Force, </em>944 F.2d 804, 807 (11th Cir.1991). Under Rule 60(b), \u201cthe court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d based on, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cfraud ..., misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3). We, however, are obligated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>inquire into the existence of subject-matter jurisdiction at all times, <em>see Johansen v. Combustion Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>170 F.3d 1320, 1328 n. 4 (11th Cir.1999), and we \u201cmay affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any adequate ground, even if it is other than the one on which the court actually relied,\u201d <em>Smith v. Allen, </em>502 F.3d 1255, 1280 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Rule 60(b) does not provide for relief from judgment in a criminal case, <em>United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam), but may provide relief in limited circumstances from the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, <em>see Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 534, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2649, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). We construe a Rule 60(b) motion as a post-convietion motion to vacate a sentence under \u00a7 2255 where it \u201cseeks to add a new ground for relief,\u201d or \u201cattacks the federal court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 532, 125 S.Ct. at 2648 (emphasis omitted). In order to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a federal prisoner must obtain our permission. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h), <em>cross-referencing </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). A petitioner who files a Rule 60(b) motion may not circumvent the statutory restrictions on second or successive applications, unless the Rule 60(b) motion attacks a defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings, such as fraud upon the federal court that led to the denial of the original habeas petition. <em>Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 532, 125 S.Ct. at 2648.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of Winston\u2019s motion, regardless of whether it was characterized as a Rule 60(b)(3) motion seeking relief directly from his underlying conviction or as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion, because he sought to raise a merits challenge to the legality of his underlying conviction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
