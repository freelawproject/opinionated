He appeals, challenging his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-20\">First, Garcia-Perez argues that the district court committed a procedural error when it imposed a sentence without considering all of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) as required by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We disagree. In <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784 (11th Cir.2005), we held that, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Id. </em>at 786. In this case, the district court explicitly stated that he had considered the factors in \u00a7 3553 in imposing the sentence. (R.3-27 at 36.) Thus, the record supports a conclusion that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as required by <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-21\">Second, Garcia-Perez argues that the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence. The thrust of Garcia-Perez\u2019s argument is that he is currently serving a state sentence of ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>years\u2019 imprisonment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that this state sentence is sufficient to deter future criminal conduct and protect the community. Accordingly, Garcia-Perez argues that the district court should have imposed a 60-month sentence concurrent with his state sentence, and not consecutive to it. The district court imposed a sentence of 60 months, which is below the applicable guideline range of 70-87 months\u2019 imprisonment. Considering Garcia-Perez\u2019s lengthy criminal history, (R.3-27 at 30-31), the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a 60-month sentence to run consecutive to the undischarged state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-16\">. On April 11, 2008, Garcia-Perez pleaded guilty in a Florida state court to trafficking in cocaine and was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
