Day, Jr., a <em>pro se </em>state prisoner, appeals the dismissal of his Fed. R.Civ.P. 60 post-judgment motion challenging the dismissal without prejudice of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>court dismissed Day\u2019s first habeas petition <em>(Day </em>I) in 2005 for failure to exhaust state remedies, after the state asserted that Day had not exhausted all remedies. Day responded in two ways: (1) he filed another habeas petition, which the district court dismissed as untimely in <em>Day v. Hall, </em>No. 5:06-CV-052, 2006 WL 2947109 <em>(Day II), </em>but we reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings, <em>Day v. Hall, </em>528 F.3d 1315 (11th Cir.2008), and it is currently stayed pending our decision in this appeal; and (2) he tried to assert his supposedly unexhausted claims in state court, and the state court determined that Day\u2019s claims were barred by <em>res judicata </em>because he had brought them in previous state actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Subsequently, in May 2008, Day filed the present <em>pro se </em>Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the judgment in <em>Day I, </em>seeking to vacate the dismissal without prejudice on the ground that the state\u2019s inconsistent positions on exhaustion constituted \u201cfraud upon the court\u201d and prevented him from having his claims adjudicated on the merits. The district court dismissed the motion as untimely, finding that Day had not filed his Rule 60(b)(3) motion alleging fraud within a year of the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue: \u201c[wjhether the district court erred in determining that Day\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 60 motion was untimely.\u201d Day argues that the district court erred by dismissing his Rule 60 motion without considering if it fell within the savings clause of Rule 60(d), which lacks a time limit. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s ruling upon a [Rule 60] motion for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">Rule 60(b) motions challenging the denial of habeas relief are subject to the restrictions on second or successive habeas petitions if the prisoner is attempting to either: (1) raise a new ground for relief, or (2) attack a federal court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits. <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 530-32, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). Rule 60(b) may, however, be used to assert that a federal court\u2019s previous ruling precluding a merits determination was in error. <em>Id. </em>at 532 n. 4, 125 S.Ct. 2641.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">A COA is required \u201cfor the appeal of any denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from a judgment in a [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2254\u201d petition. <em>Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1294 (11th Cir.2007). Once granted, appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). However, procedural issues that must be resolved before we can address the underlying claim specified in the COA are presumed to be encompassed in the COA. <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1248 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001). Moreover, we may affirm the district court on any basis supported by the record. <em>Watkins v. Bowden, </em>105 F.3d 1344, 1353 n. 17 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and (d) provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Rule 60. Relief from a Judgment or Order</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">(b) Grounds for Relief from a Final Judgment.... On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment ... for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">(3) fraud ..., misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">(c) Timing and Effect of the Motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">(1) Timing. A motion under Rule 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time \u2014 and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">(d) Other Powers to Grant Relief. This rule does not limit a court\u2019s power to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">(1) entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment ...; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-12\">(3) set aside a judgment for fraud on the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">Thus, although subsection (b)(3) limits a pai'ty to bringing a motion within one (1) year, the district court may also entertain an independent action to \u201cset aside a judgment for fraud on the court\u201d even if more than a year has passed. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(d)(3); <em>Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., </em>573 F.2d 1332, 1337-38 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A court may consider a Rule 60(b) motion as an independent action for relief where the adverse party would not be prejudiced. <em>See Bankers Mortg. Co. v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 73, 77, 81 n. 7 (5th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-17\">\u201cFraud upon the court\u201d under Rule 60(d) embraces only \u201c ... fraud which does or attempts to, defile the court itself ... so that the [judiciary] cannot [properly decide the] cases that are presented for adjudication, and relief should be denied in the absence of such conduct. Fraud <em>inter parties, </em>without more, should not be fraud upon the court, but redress should be left to a motion under Rule 60(b)(3) or to an independent action.\u201d <em>Travelers Indem. Co. v. Gore, </em>761 F.2d 1549, 1551 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-18\">Moreover, the essential elements of an independent Rule 60(d) action were recited in <em>Bankers Mortg. Co. </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-19\">(1) a judgment which ought not, in equity and good conscience, to be enforced; (2) a good defense to the alleged cause of action on which the judgment is founded; (3) fraud ... which prevented the [movant] ... from obtaining the benefit of his [position]; (4) the absence of fault or negligence on the part of [movant]; and (5) the absence of any adequate remedy at law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-21\"><em>Bankers Mortg. Co., </em>423 F.2d at 79. Independent actions for relief under subsection (d) \u201cmust, if Rule 60(b) is to be interpreted as a coherent whole, be reserved for those cases of \u2018injustices which, in certain instances, are deemed sufficiently gross to demand a departure\u2019 from rigid adherence to the doctrine of <em>res judicata.\" United States v. Beggerly, </em>524 U.S. 38, 46, 118 S.Ct. 1862, 141 L.Ed.2d 32 (1998) (quoting <em>Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., </em>322 U.S. 238, 244, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944)).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Where the district court dismissed a habeas petition for failure to exhaust without prejudice, the petitioner may refile the action. <em>Leonard v. Wainwright, </em>601 F.2d 807, 808 (5th Cir.1979). Moreover, a harmless error, one which does not affect a party\u2019s substantial rights, is not a ground for \u201cfor vacating, modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. For an error to affect substantial rights, it generally \u201cmust have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The district court here correctly determined that a motion under Rule 60(b)(3) was untimely. However, because: (i) Day was proceeding <em>pro se; </em>(ii) he referenced \u201cfraud on the court\u201d at one point; (iii) \u201cfraud on the court\u201d can support an independent action under Rule 60(d); (iv) there is no express time limit on bringing such an action under Rule 60(d); and (v) the district court did not consider this possibility before dismissing Day\u2019s motion as untimely, the primary focus of our inquiry is on whether this was error, and, if so, whether it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Nevertheless, even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the district court abused its discretion by not liberally construing Day\u2019s motion as a timely one alleging an independent action under Rule 60(d), the record does not reflect the essential elements necessary to bring such an action. Indeed, with respect to the availability of an adequate remedy at law, the district court dismissed Day\u2019s original \u00a7 2254 petition <em>(Day I) </em>without prejudice for lack of exhaustion, and once Day exhausted his state remedies, he was free to refile his action\u2014 which he apparently did in <em>Day II, </em>a proceeding that remains pending. Therefore, to the extent the district court erred by: (i) failing to construe Day\u2019s untimely <em>pro se </em>Rule 60(b) motion as a timely one under Rule 60(d); and (ii) dismissing any request by Day for post-judgment relief thereunder, any error was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\">. Day also sought relief under Rule 60(b)(5) and (6), without success. Because he does not challenge the district court's ruling in this respect, however, those issues are abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 74, 172 L.Ed.2d 67 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-15\">.
