Juan-Juarez argues that his eighteen-month sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">In 2007, Juan-Juarez was convicted of aiding and abetting the transportation of illegal aliens, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii). He was sentenced to eleven months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by five years\u2019 supervised release with the special condition that, if deported, he would not re-enter the United States without the express permission of the United States Department of Homeland Security. In November 2007, Juan-Juarez was released from prison and, on December 20, 2007, he was deported to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">On October 15, 2008, Juan-Juarez was arrested for having re-entered the United States without permission and, in December 2008, he pleaded guilty to this offense in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The California district court sentenced Juan-Juarez to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. On February 9, 2009, Juan-Juarez\u2019s probation officer filed in the Middle District of Florida a petition to revoke Juan-Juarez\u2019s supervised release, because (1) Juan-Juarez was arrested and charged with being an illegal alien found in the United States following deportation; and (2) Juan-Juarez failed to notify his probation officer within seventy-two hours of being arrested. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a), Juan-Juarez\u2019s applicable guideline imprisonment range was four to ten months and under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), the statutory maximum penalty was three years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">At the supervised release revocation hearing, Juan-Juarez admitted both supervised release violations. (R.2-62 at 4.) The court noted that it had clearly informed Juan-Juarez, during his July 2007 sentencing, that he could not re-enter the United States without permission. <em>{Id. </em>at 8.) It noted that Juan-Juarez defied the court\u2019s order, as well as United States immigra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>tion laws, by promptly re-entering the country. <em>(Id. </em>at 9.) The court noted that the federal district court in California had sentenced Juan-Juarez to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment, but determined that \u201cthe violation here deserves a distinct penalty and is not subsumed by the penalty that was assessed in California.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 9-10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The court adjudicated Juan-Juarez guilty of the supervised release violations and sentenced him to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment to run consecutively to the thirty-month sentence imposed by the district court in California. (R.2-62 at 11.) It noted that it had considered the policies and guidelines of the United States Sentencing Commission, as well as the advisory guideline range and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>(Id. </em>at 11-12.) It explained that Juan-Juarez \u201cdemonstrated an unaccountable resilience to an 11-month sentence given earlier and an admonition not to enter the United States without [permission]\u201d by promptly re-entering the country. <em>(Id. </em>at 12.) The court noted that Juan-Juarez\u2019s prior offense was not \u201cmere presence,\u201d but rather involved the \u201clarge-scale transportation of aliens under grim circumstances.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The court found that Juan-Juarez had gained no respect for the law as a result of his prior sentence, appeared undeterred by that sentence, and was willing to commit further crimes. <em>(Id.) </em>The court determined that the sentence was \u201ccomfortably within the range of [a] reasonable sentence for someone who offends so quickly and so defiantly and ... without remorse.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 13.) It noted that the sentence was above the high end of the applicable guideline range, but stated that it chose to make an impression on Juan-Juarez at this stage in his life. Juan-Juarez objected \u201cas to [the] reasonableness\u201d of the sentence. <em>(Id. </em>at 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Juan-Juarez first argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of the eighteen-month sentence was procedurally unreasonable. We disagree. Juan-Juarez\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable, because the district court accurately calculated the advisory guideline range and treated the range as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and explained its reasons for imposing the sentence. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). The court also adequately explained its reasons for imposing an upward variance, noting that the variance was warranted by Juan-Juarez\u2019s prompt re-entry into the country in violation of immigration laws and the court\u2019s order, the failure of Juan-Juarez\u2019s previous eleven-month sentence to deter him from committing further crimes, and the court\u2019s desire to make an impression on Juan-Juarez at this stage in his life. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion and imposed a procedurally reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Juan-Juarez next argues that his eighteen-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. We disagree. The fact that Juan-Juarez violated the immigration laws and the terms of his supervised release by re-entering the United States less than one year after being deported indicates that his previous eleven-month sentence was an insufficient deterrent and that a lengthier sentence was necessary to promote respect for the law. Moreover, the court noted during the revocation proceeding that Juan-Juarez\u2019s previous conviction for aiding and abetting the transportation of illegal aliens was a serious offense. Thus, although Juan-Juarez\u2019s criminal history may not have been lengthy, his prior offense was a serious one. Finally, the eighteen-month sentence was well below the applicable statutory maximum three-year term of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>ment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In light of these facts, the eighteen-month sentence the district court imposed was substantively reasonable. We affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
