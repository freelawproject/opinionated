Salomon alleges that the excessive force caused him to sustain permanent physical injuries, and that he is therefore entitled to an award of money damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, dismissed Salomon\u2019s complaint which was barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata; </em>Salomon had suffered an adverse judgment in a case he had previously brought in the district court arising out of the alleged excessive force incident, <em>Salomon v. City of Jacksonville, etc., et al., </em>Civ. Action No. 3:05-cv-673-J-32HTS (M.D.Fla. July 19, 2005). For the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommended, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-10\">. Salomon alleges that he is entitled to recover under \u00a7 1983 on the grounds that officer Jameson's conduct violated his rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eightth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
