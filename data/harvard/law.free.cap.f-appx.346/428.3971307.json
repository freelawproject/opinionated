Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 926 (11th Cir.2009). The \u00a7 3582(c)(2) statute permits a district court to modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 926-27. When determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court is required to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 927. The district court need not articulate the applicability of any of the specific \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cas long as the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1255 (11th Cir.2009), the district court granted the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, but failed to discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Because there was no discussion of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we vacated and remanded the case back to the district court for consideration of the pertinent factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On the other side of the spectrum, in <em>Smith, </em>the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion brief referenced the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cand then presented arguments as to why those factors supported imposing a more lenient sentence.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 928. Both the defendant and the government then \u201cvigorously presented\u201d discussion about the applicability of specific \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 928-29. We found that, because the parties provided \u201can elaborate explication of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d the district court did in fact consider those factors, even though it made no mention of them in its final order. <em>Id. </em>at 929. In <em>Smith, </em>we distinguished <em>Williams </em>by stating that in <em>Williams, </em>there was no evidence in the record \u201cthat the district court had considered, or the defendant had even raised, the applicability of any of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In this case, the district court did not explicitly discuss the factors but the parties had discussed them in their briefs before the court, which the court stated it had considered. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). First of all, Clark\u2019s counseled brief before the district court reminds it that it must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in a \u00a7 3582 resentencing. In his motion before the district court, Clark extensively discussed his post-sentence activities and his rehabilitation in prison, which would fit under \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d That same document attached the portion of the original sentencing hearing where the parties discussed various \u00a7 3553(a) factors such as the history and characteristics of the defendant, the sentences of his co-defendants, the available sentences, and Clark\u2019s role in the offense. Thus, like the court in <em>Smith, </em>the court below was presented with argument concerning the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and although it did not discuss them, we can assume that it considered them.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">Clark next argues that the district court should have sentenced him below his amended guideline range because, post-<em>Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory. Clark concedes that his argument is foreclosed by our precedent, but he indicates that he wishes to preserve his position in case the pertinent precedent is overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). We are bound to follow our prior binding precedent \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this [C]ourt <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">As discussed <em>supra, </em>a district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant whose sentencing range has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 IB 1. 10, state that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A). We have held that this statement is binding on the district court, and that <em>Booker </em>does not render it advisory because <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-94 (11th Cir.2009), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Our decision in <em>Melvin </em>forecloses Clark\u2019s argument that in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding a district court can reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below his amended guideline range. Accordingly, we affirm this part of the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\">. <em>United States v.
