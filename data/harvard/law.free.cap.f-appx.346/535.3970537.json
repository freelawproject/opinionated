Bennett\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">Bennett challenges the denial of his motion to reduce on four grounds, all of which fail. First, Bennett argues that the district court was entitled to reduce his sentence under Amendment 706, but his argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008), because Bennett was sentenced to a statutory mandatory term of life imprisonment. Second, Bennett complains that the district court failed to address his arguments about drug quantity and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), but a district court may not revisit any \u201coriginal sentencing determinations.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) (Nov.2008); <em>see United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Third, Bennett argues that the district court had discretion to reduce his sentence below the amended range under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), but those decisions do not apply to a motion to reduce a sentence. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1191-93 (11th Cir.2009). Fourth, Bennett argues, for the first time on appeal, that the refusal to treat the Guidelines as advisory violated his rights to equal protection and due process, but Bennett was sentenced to a statutory mandatory term of life imprisonment based on his prior convictions. See <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1360-61 (11th Cir.2008). The district court did not err by denying Bennett\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">The denial of Bennett\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
