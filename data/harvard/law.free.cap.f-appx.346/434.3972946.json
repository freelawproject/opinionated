Sanders, a federal prisoner convicted of a craek cocaine offense and sentenced as a career offender, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence. Sanders based his motion on Amendment 706 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>cause Sanders was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering his guideline range, as required for relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). As a result, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Sanders\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">I.BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In 2001, Sanders pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Sanders\u2019s base offense level was 30 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. However, Sanders was also classified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because he was at least 18 years old at the time of the instant offense, the instant offense was a felony drug offense, and Sanders had at least two prior felony convictions for controlled substance offenses. Since the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) is 40 years imprisonment, the career offender guideline requires a base offense level of 34. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Sanders then received a downward departure of three levels for timely acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 31. Sanders\u2019s sentencing range was 188 to 235 months of imprisonment, and the district court sentenced Sanders to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">II.STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">III.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">A district court may modify a sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced ... <em>based on </em>a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ....\u201d\u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). In such a case, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence after considering applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction is not consistent with applicable policy statements and is not authorized if the retroactive amendment does not have the \u201ceffect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The retroactive amendment at issue here is Amendment 706, which reduces the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Sanders concedes that this Court previously decided the issue on appeal in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). <em>Moore </em>involved several defendants convicted of crack cocaine offenses who were sentenced under the career offender guideline \u00a7 4B1.1. In <em>Moore, </em>we held that a defendant whose original sentence was based ultimately on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1, such as the career offender guideline section of \u00a7 4B1.1, cannot receive a sentence reduction because Amendment 706 does not have the \u201ceffect\u201d of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. That is, a defendant cannot obtain relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if his sentence was based on the career offender guideline because Amendment 706 would not have reduced his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-16\">Sanders\u2019s conviction was based ultimately on the career offender guideline, rather than the offense level calculation under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u00a7 2D1.1. A career offender\u2019s base offense level is determined with regard to the statutory maximum sentence for the offense of conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Therefore, Sanders offense level was based on \u00a7 4B1.1, which calculated a base offense level of 34 after taking into regard the statutory maximum sentence for Sanders\u2019s offense of conviction. Consequently, Amendment 706 to \u00a7 2D1.1 does not have the effect of lowering Sanders\u2019s sentencing range, and the district court could not reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Sanders argues that <em>Moore </em>was decided wrongly. He asserts that regardless of whether the career offender guideline range was affected by Amendment 706, the district court must still consider \u00a7 3553(a), which requires that certain factors be taken into account in imposing a sentence on a defendant. However, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not give a district court unfettered authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. Instead, the court must determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if Amendment 706 had been in effect at the time Sanders was sentenced. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). A court shah only substitute the amendments that have been listed for retroactive application and \u201cshall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the application of a retroactive amendment did not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s sentencing range, then the district court has no jurisdiction to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. Therefore, the district court could not analyze the factors under \u00a7 3553(a) unless it first determined that Amendment 706 had the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s sentencing range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In <em>Moore, </em>we explicitly held that Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range if the defendant was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. <em>Moore </em>remains valid authority for a defendant sentenced under the career offender guideline. We may \u201cdepart from a prior panel decision based upon an intervening Supreme Court decision ... if that decision actually overruled or conflicted with it\u201d or if, sitting <em>en banc, </em>we overrule the decision. <em>United States v. Marte, </em>356 F.3d 1336, 1344 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Sanders did not qualify for the Amendment 706 reduction because he was a career offender, and the district court did not need to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because it lacked the authority to grant any reduction. We may not depart from <em>Moore </em>because it has not been overruled by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
