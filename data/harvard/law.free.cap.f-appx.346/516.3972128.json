He argues that the district court erred in deeming him to be eligible for the career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. He also asserts that the court erred by applying that enhancement even though the government did not file an information regarding its intent to rely on his prior drug conviction, as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. After reviewing the record, we find no error and thus AFFIRM his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b543-22\">In January 2006, Kicklighter pled guilty to one count of distribution of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u00a7 841(a)(1). Because the offense involved at least 50, but less than 150, grams of methamphetamine, Kicklighter\u2019s base offense level for the crime was 32. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 (c)(4) (Mar.2006). After a three-level sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility, his total offense level was 29. According to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Kick-lighter had three prior convictions \u2014 two for burglary of a residence and one for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana \u2014 that were either crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses. As a result, Kicklighter qualified as a career offender, which changed his criminal history category from V to VI. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Kicklighter filed a written objection to the PSI in which he asserted that the burglary convictions were not violent crimes and cited a prior district court ruling to that effect. At the sentencing hearing, the probation officer who compiled the PSI reaffirmed the career offender determination and noted that the district court order in question addressed a sentencing enhancement for possession of a firearm rather than the question of whether burglaries were violent crimes. Kicklighter\u2019s counsel stated that, after reviewing the documentation, he agreed that the ruling addressed a different issue and that any concerns about the PSI had been resolved. Additionally, Kicklighter indicated that the reason he mentioned that ruling was because the earlier court had considered the firearm enhancement a crime of violence and he wanted to prove that he was not violent. He also stated that he knew of no other errors in the PSI. The district court then adopted the factual statements in the PSI as findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The court noted that Kicklighter\u2019s total offense level of 29 and criminal history category of VI yielded a guidelines range of 151 to 188 months of imprisonment. The court ultimately sentenced Kicklighter to 180 months of imprisonment. Kick-lighter\u2019s counsel did not object to this sentence or to the court\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Kicklighter appealed his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">On appeal, Kicklighter raises two issues with respect to his sentence. He asserts that the district court erred by finding his two prior burglary convictions to be crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. He maintains that the statute under which he was convicted, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-7-1, encompasses conduct which both would and would not be considered a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.1, and that the court considered improper evidence in finding that his conviction was for a crime of violence. He also argues that the district court erred by imposing a career offender enhancement because the government did not provide notice of the convictions it intended to use in seeking an enhanced sentence, as required under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">A. <em>Career Offender Enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to classify a defendant as a career offender based on \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). However, if a defendant fails to raise an argument before the district court, we review it for plain error. <em>See United States v. Be La Garza, </em>516 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cUnder plain error review, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Section 4B1.1 deems a defendant to be a career offender if he was at least eighteen years old at the time he committed the offense for which he is being sentenced, that offense \u201cis a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense,\u201d and he \u201chas at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The sentencing guidelines define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a state or federal offense punishable by imprisonment for more than a year that \u201c(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">To determine whether an offense would qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.1, \u201ca district court may look outside of the \u2018offense of conviction\u2019 to the conduct surrounding that conviction if ambiguities in the judgment make the crime of violence determination impossible from the face of the judgment itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 842-43 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted). District courts thus may make additional fact findings \u201cwhen the crime for which the defendant was convicted encompasses both conduct that constitutes a crime of violence and conduct that does not constitute a crime of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843. The court can base these fact findings \u201con undisputed statements in the PSI.\u201d <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). We deem facts contained in a PSI to be undisputed and admitted if a party does not assert a specific and clear objection to them before the sentencing court. <em>See id.; see also Beckles, </em>565 F.3d at 844. The failure to make such a challenge \u201cto conclusory statements in the PSI renders those statements undisputed and permits the sentencing court to rely upon them without error even if there is an absence of supporting evidence.\u201d <em>Beckles, </em>565 F.3d at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The Georgia statute under which Kick-lighter was convicted of two burglaries, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-7-1, encompasses conduct that both would and would not constitute a crime of violence because it discusses burglaries that involve various locales, including dwellings. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-7-1; <em>see also Bennett, </em>472 F.3d at 832 (making a similar determination with respect to this statute). Because of this statutory ambiguity, the court was permitted to rely on the undisputed portions of Kicklighter\u2019s PSI to make factual findings about whether his convictions were for burglaries of a dwelling and thus would be crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Although Kicklighter objected before the district court to the PSI\u2019s characterization of his burglary convictions as crimes of violence, he did not argue specifically that they did not involve a dwelling. Because of this failure, we evaluate the court\u2019s determination for plain error. <em>See De La Garza, </em>516 F.3d at 1269. The PSI stated that the burglaries involved dwellings and that Kicklighter qualified for the \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement as a result. Since Kicklighter failed to make a specific and clear objection to these statements, they were undisputed, and the district court was permitted to rely on them in finding that Kicklighter\u2019s burglaries constituted crimes of violence. <em>See Beckles, </em>565 F.3d at 844. The court thus was warranted in finding that Kicklighter had at least two prior crimes of violence, as required for the \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement. Since it is undisputed that he met the other requirements for career offender status, the court did not plainly err in finding Kicklighter eligible for the \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>B. <em>Failure to File Information</em></p>\n<p id=\"AF\">Kicklighter argues that the government failed to provide notice that he was subject to an enhanced sentence based on his prior convictions under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. He maintains that, as a result, the district court erred by imposing a sentence based on the career offender enhancement. Because he did not raise this argument before the district court, we evaluate it for plain error. <em>See De La Garza, </em>516 F.3d at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u201cWe review the adequacy of a section 851 notice <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Ramirez, </em>501 F.3d 1237, 1239 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Section 851(a)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions, unless before trial, or before entry of a plea of guilty, the United States attorney files an information with the court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1). However, we have determined these notice requirements do not apply when the government seeks to use the prior convictions as the basis for a career offender enhancement, \u201cso long as the enhanced sentence still falls within the permissible statutory range.\u201d <em>Young v. United States, </em>936 F.2d 533, 536 (11th Cir.1991) (considering the issue in the context of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding). Kicklighter acknowledges this precedent but asserts that the rationale for the \u00a7 851 requirements should apply even to career offender enhancements. However, our prior panel precedent rule forbids us from reaching such a conclusion since there has been no contrary opinion by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting <em>en banc. See United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 1014 (11th Cir.2008). Because Kicklighter\u2019s sentence fell below the statutory maximum term of imprisonment, which was twenty years, the government was not required to provide \u00a7 851 notice. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err by enhancing his sentence as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 in the absence of such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Kicklighter argues that the district court erred by applying a career offender enhancement based on improper evidence and in the absence of the requisite \u00a7 851 notice. Because he did not object to the factual basis upon which the district court found him eligible for that enhancement and since the \u00a7 851 notice requirements do not apply to career offender enhancements, the court did not plainly err in applying the enhancement. We therefore AFFIRM his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
