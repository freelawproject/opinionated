On appeal, Mitchell argues that the mandatory minimum \u2014 which operated to deny him a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 \u2014 violates principles of equal protection and due process because the crack-to-powder cocaine sentencing ratio is unrelated to a legitimate state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">We review the denial of a section 3582(c)(2) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). But we review Mitchell\u2019s constitutional claim only for plain error because he did not raise it in the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment for a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). But a defendant who initially was sentenced to the statutory minimum is ineligible for a reduction under Amendment 706 and section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, because Mitchell received the mandatory minimum sentence, the district court abused no discretion in denying the section 3582(c)(2) motion; Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering his guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A) (noting that \u201cthe operation of another guideline or statutory provision,\u201d such as \u201ca statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment,\u201d would prevent Amendment 706 from \u201chav[ing] the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">About Mitchell\u2019s due process and equal protection claim, constitutional challenges to an original sentence are not cognizable under section 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-82 (11th Cir.2000) (concluding that a district court had no jurisdiction in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding to consider a defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment). Thus, the district court committed no plain error in denying the section 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-12\">. Amendment 706 \u2014 which became retroactive on 3 March 2008, U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. 1 May 2008) \u2014 reduced by two the base offense levels in crack cocaine sentences calculated pursuant to the drug quantity table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
