Adgar, a customer service agent for Delta Airlines, worked with Jon Patton, a security sereener for the Transportation Security Administration (\u201cTSA\u201d) at the Atlanta airport, Andre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Mays, another TSA officer, and Andrew Hughes, an unindicted Delta co-worker, to transport what she believed was cocaine and heroin from the Atlanta airport to New York\u2019s LaGuardia airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">On appeal, she argues that the evidence did not support her aggravating role enhancement, imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), because Hughes was not a participant within the meaning of that section. She also argues that the government engaged in sentencing factor manipulation when it used fake heroin, rather than fake cocaine, for the second of three transactions, and that the district court erroneously believed it could not grant her a downward departure on that ground. Finally, she contends that her sentence, the statutory mandatory minimum, was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">I. Aggravated Role Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u201cWe apply a two-pronged standard to review claims that the district court erroneously applied sentencing guidelines adjustments. First, we review the factual findings underlying the district court\u2019s sentencing determination for clear error. We then review the court\u2019s application of those facts to the guidelines <em>de novo. </em>Although the sentencing guidelines are now advisory after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts are still required to correctly calculate the appropriate advisory guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2008) (citations omitted). \u201cThe district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3B1.1 to determine that a person is a \u2018participant\u2019 is a question law that we review <em>de novo, </em>while we review the underlying factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">If the defendant was an organizer, leader, manage!*, or supervisor of the criminal activity, his offense level may be increased by two. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(e). \u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.2). The Guidelines define a \u201cparticipant\u201d to be \u201ca person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">To determine that an individual is a participant within the meaning of \u00a7 3B1.1, the court must determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the individual was criminally responsible. <em>Williams, </em>527 F.3d at 1248-49. Because the burden of proof at sentencing is different than the burden of proof at trial, a defendant may be subject to the role enhancement for managing or directing an individual who was acquitted of the underlying offense. <em>Id. </em>However, where the individual\u2019s involvement in the offense is <em>de minimus, </em>and the evidence is insufficient to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was criminally responsible for the offense, the enhancement is improper. <em>Id. </em>at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">To be held criminally responsible as a co-conspirator, a person must have formed an agreement with one or more persons, the object of which was to carry out an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means. <em>United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1182 (11th Cir.2006). The alleged conspirator must have known of the purpose of the agreement and must have knowingly and voluntarily entered into the agreement. <em>See United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2000). Deliberate ignorance is the equivalent of knowledge. <em>United States v. Peddle, </em>821 F.2d 1521, 1524 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">We conclude that Hughes was a participant within the meaning of \u00a7 3B1.1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>because, <em>inter alia, </em>he was paid to accompany Adgar on two trips in which they transported the same carry-on bag \u2014 which Adgar did not possess on their return trip and Adgar referred to Hughes as her \u201cpartner in crime.\u201d In addition, there was evidence that Hughes\u2019s role was to \u201ccarry the bag in case something happened,\u201d implying that Hughes knew that he was to dispose of the bag if something happened. Accordingly, we affirm Adgar\u2019s aggravating role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">II. Sentencing Factor Manipulation</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u201c[W]e have considered sentencing manipulation as a viable defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007). \u201c[Sentencing factor manipulation occurs when the government\u2019s manipulation of a sting operation, even if insufficient to support a due process claim, requires that the manipulation be filtered out of the sentencing calculus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe standard for sentencing factor manipulation is high, even in the circuits where it has been recognized as a viable defense to the application of a mandatory minimum,\u201d and an adjustment is appropriate only where the government engages in \u201cextraordinary misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1270-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">First, we note that Adgar misstates the law by characterizing an adjustment for the government\u2019s sentencing factor manipulation to be a \u201cdeparture.\u201d <em>See Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d at 1270 (noting that \u201can adjustment for sentencing factor manipulation is not a departure\u201d from a mandatory minimum, because, \u201c[w]hen a court filters the manipulation out of the sentencing calculus before applying a sentencing provision, no mandatory minimum would arise in the first place.\u201d). Next, we reject her argument that the district court believed it was not authorized to adjust her sentence based on a finding of sentencing factor manipulation, because the record shows that the district court\u2019s ruling was based on its belief that, under the facts of this case, such a finding would not be consistent with this Circuit\u2019s law. . Finally, we conclude that the government did not engage in \u201cextraordinary misconduct\u201d when it opted to use fake heroin, rather than fake cocaine, for the second transaction, because Adgar and Patton had agreed to smuggle drugs through the airport and did not limit the kind of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">III. Reasonable Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, \u201cthe district court is bound by the statutory mandatory minimums.\u201d <em>Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d at 1270. Therefore, we reject Adgar\u2019s argument that her sentence, the statutory mandatory minimum, was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Ad-gar\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-20\">.
