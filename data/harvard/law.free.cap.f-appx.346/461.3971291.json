The district court found that Torres\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion was an impermissibly successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate pursuant to <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). The court also deemed the motion untimely because it was filed twenty-two months after Torres\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion was denied. Torres argues that because the court did not address during his \u00a7 2255 proceedings his argument that two probation-related criminal history points should have been eliminated when the court corrected his sentence, his Rule 60(b) motion reasserting that argument was not a successive attack on the court\u2019s previous resolution of the issue. He also argues that his motion was not untimely because extended court proceedings justified any delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to consider a Rule 60(b) motion. <em>Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1298 (11th Cir.2007). Rule 60(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-22\">On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-23\">(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">(6) any other reason that justifies relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Fed.R.CivP. 60(b)(5), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In <em>Gonzalez, </em>the Supreme Court held that a Rule 60(b) motion may be treated as a successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition when it seeks to add a new ground for relief or attacks a federal court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits. 545 U.S. at 532, 125 S.Ct. at 2648; <em>see also Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>366 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cIn the context of certificates of appealability and Rule 60(b) motions, we apply 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and \u00a7 2255 cases interchangeably.\u201d). A Rule 60(b) motion is not a successive habeas petition, however, if it attacks only \u201csome defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 532, 125 S.Ct. at 2648. A Rule 60(b) motion that qualifies as a second or successive habeas petition must comply with the three requirements of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AED-PA). <em>Williams, </em>510 F.3d at 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Under AEDPA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">any claim that has already been adjudicated in a previous petition must be dismissed. Second, any claim that has not already been adjudicated must be dismissed unless it relies on either a new and retroactive rule of constitutional law or new facts showing a high probability of actual innocence. Third, before the district court may accept a successive petition for filing, the court of appeals must determine that it presents a claim not previously raised that is sufficient to meet \u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s new-rule or actual-innocence provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-10\"><em>Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 529-30, 125 S.Ct. at 2646 (citations omitted). When a Rule 60(b) motion is treated as a successive habeas petition, then, a defendant must ask us for an order authorizing the district court to consider it. <em>Williams, </em>510 F.3d at 1295. Without that authorization, the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Torres first raised his probation-related criminal history point argument in his reply to the government\u2019s response to his \u00a7 2255 motion. And contrary to Torres\u2019 assertion to us now, the district court did address it: The court specifically noted that it had considered Torres\u2019 reply and had weighed \u201cthe merits and demerits\u201d of the parties\u2019 positions in finding for the government. Torres\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion did not attack \u201csome defect in the integrity\u201d of his \u00a7 2255 proceeding, <em>Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 532, 125 S.Ct. at 2648, but simply reasserted the same argument he had offered in his \u00a7 2255 reply. Torres\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion was thus a successive motion to vacate. Because we did not authorize the district court to consider Torres\u2019 successive motion, that court lacked jurisdiction to decide it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Torres\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion and remand with instructions to dismiss the motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\">. We do not decide whether Torres' Rule 60(b) motion was timely filed because, even if it was, it would still be an impermissible successive motion to vacate and the district court would not have been authorized to hear it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
