Because there is evidence that Miles\u2019s coeonspirator possessed a firearm during the course of the conspiracy and that Miles saw and heard about the coeonspirator\u2019s gun, the district court did not clearly err by finding that Miles\u2019s codefendant\u2019s possession of a dangerous weapon was reasonably foreseeable to her. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 765 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Aguilera-Zapata, </em>901 F.2d 1209, 1215 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Miles argues that the district court erred in denying her a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The record shows that the district court did not deny acceptance of responsibility in retaliation for Miles\u2019s objections to the presentence report. The district court adopted the addendum to the presentence report and determined that Miles\u2019s objections conflicted with her prior statements to law enforcement authorities. The district court\u2019s finding that Miles had frivolously contested relevant conduct is not clearly erroneous, and its decision to deny a reduction for acceptance of responsibility is not without foundation. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1019-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
