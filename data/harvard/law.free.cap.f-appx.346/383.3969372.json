On appeal, Clark argues that she does not have an effective remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because she is time-barred from filing a new \u00a7 2255 motion, and because she cannot meet the requirements for filing a successive habeas petition. Thus, Clark asserts, her only viable habeas remedy is through a \u00a7 2241 petition. Clark then goes on to argue that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the maximum sentence that could have been imposed on her was twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, and, thus, any statutes to the contrary are unconstitutional. Clark concludes that because she has already served twenty years of her 360-month sentence, she currently is being detained in violation of her Sixth Amendment rights, as described in <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.2006). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-16\">An application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. The burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the petitioner. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">We have established that the savings clause only applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense;\u201d and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). In order for a prisoner to avail herself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. A petitioner may not argue the merits of her claim until she has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause applies to her claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3. In <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>this Court held that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review. 266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 868 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply retroactively on collateral review).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Upon review of the record and Clark\u2019s brief, we discern no reversible error. Clark has failed to meet the first prong of the test in <em>Wofford </em>because her claim is based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi, </em>which has not been made retroactive on collateral review. Therefore, because Clark has not demonstrated that her claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision, the district court did not err in dismissing her \u00a7 2241 petition. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
