On appeal, Suraneni raises three challenges to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Suraneni first argues that the district court committed reversible error by improperly relying on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1 in calculating his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(1), the guidelines provision applicable to money-laundering offenses. Suraneni contends that the money-laundering charge was based on the earnings that he derived from working in violation of his own immigration status and, thus, the district court should not have relied on \u00a7 2L2.1, which relates to offenses involving trafficking or assisting others in the fraudulent acquisition of immigration credentials.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">With respect to guidelines issues, we review \u201cpurely legal questions <em>de novo, </em>a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and, in most cases, a district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts with \u2018due deference.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1136-37 (11th Cir.2004). When reviewing a district court\u2019s application of a guidelines provision to the facts, we have held that \u201cdue deference\u201d is tantamount to clear-error review. <em>See United States v. White, </em>335 F.3d 1314, 1318-19 (11th Cir.2003). For a finding to be clearly erroneous, we \u201cmust be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d at 1137 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a court determining the appropriate offense level must employ a two-step process. <em>United States v. Saavedra, </em>148 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir.1998). The court must first determine the applicable guidelines section based on \u201cthe offense of conviction.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(a). The offense of conviction denotes \u201cthe offense conduct charged in the count of the indictment ... of which the defendant was convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(a). Once the correct guidelines provision has been identified, the sentencing court must then select the appropriate base offense level from among those specified within that guideline. <em>Saavedra, </em>148 F.3d at 1314-15; U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 lB1.2(b), 1B1.3. Only then may a court consider relevant conduct which did not comprise an element of the offense of conviction. <em>Saavedra, </em>148 F.3d at 1314, 1316-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-16\">Where multiple counts of conviction have been adjudged, the district court must group together all counts involving substantially the same harm. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(b). The applicable offense level for groups of closely related counts is the \u201chighest offense level of the counts in the Group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Ordinarily, the court must calculate the offense level for each constituent count to ensure that the appropriate offense level has been identified. <em>United States v. Kuku, </em>129 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir.1997); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.3, comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Suraneni first alleges that the district court committed reversible error by using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1 to establish Suraneni\u2019s base offense level at 11. Suraneni argues that the district court should have used U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2 for a base offense level of 8. We conclude from the record that the district court properly utilized U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1 because the evidence established that Suraneni not only laundered the proceeds of his own visa fraud through Data Group\u2019s bank accounts, but also laundered the proceeds of Madhusudhan Koduru\u2019s visa fraud through Suraneni\u2019s company Sumach Business Solutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The guidelines contain a provision for \u201cMoney Laundering and Monetary Transaction Reporting.\u201d This provision states:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">(a) Base Offense Level:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">(1) The offense level for the underlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived, if (A) the defendant committed the underlying offense ...; and (B) the offense level for that offense can be determined; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">(2) 8 plus the number of offense levels from the table in \u00a7 2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) corresponding to the value of the laundered funds, otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Suraneni argues that the district court should have used U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2 because the $132,500 laundered by Suraneni with Data Group represented proceeds of his personal visa fraud. However, the uncontroverted evidence established that Suraneni not only laundered the proceeds of his personal visa fraud, but also laundered the funds of visa fraud committed by another person by running payrolls for Madhusudhan Koduru, pursuant to \u00a7 2L2.1. (R160-38-39).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">Application note 2 of the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1 provides guidance for the application of subsection (a)(1). Relevant for the purposes of this case is application note 2(A) which states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-13\"><em>Multiple Underlying Offenses. </em>\u2014 In cases in which subsection (a)(1) applies and there is more than one underlying offense, the offense level for the underlying offense is to be determined under the procedures set forth in Application Note 3 of the Commentary to \u00a7 1B1.5 (Interpretation of References to Other Offense Guidelines).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1, comment. (n.2(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">Application note 3 of the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.5 provides in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-17\">A reference may direct that, if the conduct involved another offense, the offense guideline for such other offense is to be applied.... Where there is more than one such other offense, the most serious such offense (...) is to be used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-V\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.5, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-18\">The evidence in this case demonstrates that Suraneni engaged in a conspiracy to launder funds for his own visa fraud and the visa fraud of another, that is, Madhusudhan Koduru; therefore, we conclude that the district court properly used the higher offense level of 11 found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1, which was the offense level for the \u201cmost serious such offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-19\">Suraneni next argues on appeal that the district court erred in applying a two-level sentencing increase under \u00a7 2S1.1(b)(3) for sophisticated laundering because the evidence did not support the district court\u2019s finding that his money-laundering scheme was committed in a sophisticated manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Section 2Sl.l(b)(3) of the Guidelines provides a two-level increase if an offense involved \u201csophisticated laundering.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1(b)(3). The guidelines commentary explains that sophisticated laundering \u201cmeans complex or intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 offense,\u201d and it typically involves the use of \u201cfictitious entities,\u201d \u201cshell corporations,\u201d \u201ctwo or more levels (i.e. layering) of transactions,\u201d or \u201coffshore financial accounts.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1, comment. (n.5(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Since Suraneni\u2019s money-laundering scheme involved two or more layers of transactions and the use of a shell corporation to conceal the source of his illicitly derived funds, we conclude Suraneni\u2019s conduct was committed in a sophisticated manner and, therefore, the district court properly applied the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Finally, Suraneni argues on appeal that the district court erred in applying a two-level role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) for being an organizer of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The district court initially imposed a four-level \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement for being an organizer of criminal activity involving five or more participants. At Suraneni\u2019s resentencing hearing, the role enhancement was subsequently reduced to two levels because the district court feared that the application of \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2)(A), under the auspices of \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(l), would result in impermissible double counting. As such, the district court applied the two-level \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement, though it did not explicitly determine whether Suraneni\u2019s role in the offense was more akin to an organizer or a mere supervisor of criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Suraneni claims the district court\u2019s finding that he was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), was improper. In support of his argument, Suraneni describes his conduct as merely referring others and assisting some with clerical tasks. The record demonstrates that Suraneni\u2019s conduct was much more. The evidence demonstrated that Suraneni exercised decision making authority, recruited accomplices, and claimed a right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime. Therefore, we conclude that the district court properly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Suraneni\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
