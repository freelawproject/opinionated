The district court dismissed Thrasher\u2019s complaint without prejudice for failure to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-14\">Thrasher argues primarily that the district court erred because it failed to \u201callow[ him] the maximum 40-day extension to file [his] brief\u2019 which he supposedly \u201crequested over the phone.\u201d But, to the extent that Thrasher is challenging the district court\u2019s failure to extend the 30-day deadline pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a) to file his notice of appeal, any such extension is within the district court\u2019s discretion, and Thrasher fails to explain how the district court supposedly abused its discretion in not granting the extension. <em>See Stotter v. Univ. of Texas at San Antonio, </em>508 F.3d 812, 820 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Gonzales-Reyes, </em>210 Fed.Appx. 416 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-15\">To the extent that Thrasher also argues that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint was improper, this court has repeatedly held that conclusory statements of the type found in Thrasher\u2019s brief, such as \u201c[a]ll of my pleadings and motions ... will easily speak for themselves, and easily prove my claims and complaint are for real and valid,\u201d are insufficient even for a pro se appellant. <em>See Adams v. Unione Mediterranea Di Sicurta, </em>364 F.3d 646, 653 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cIssues not raised or inadequately briefed on appeal are waived.\u201d); <em>L &amp; A Contracting Co. v. S. Concrete Servs., Inc., </em>17 F.3d 106, 113 (5th Cir.1994) (argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>ment lacking cite to authority is deemed abandoned); <em>Leffebre v. Collins, </em>15 F.3d 179, 1994 WL 24883, at *2 (5th Cir.1994) (unpublished) (inadequate briefing, even for a pro se litigant, amounts to abandonment of argument); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744 (5th Cir.1987) (appeal of \u00a7 1983 action that does not address the merits of the lower court\u2019s opinion is abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1018-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
