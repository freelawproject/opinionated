We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). After the BIA has affirmed an IJ\u2019s order of removal, an alien may seek reconsideration on the ground that the BIA has made a legal or factual error. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). \u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). A motion to reconsider that merely restates the arguments the BIA previously rejected provides no reason for the BIA to change its prior decision. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329. \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law\u2019 as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Florez merely reiterates her previous arguments the BIA considered. She does not specify any \u201cerrors of fact or law\u201d that would necessitate the granting of her motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Florez\u2019s motion to reconsider, and we deny this portion of her petition. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Additionally, we lack jurisdiction to review Florez\u2019s underlying motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (\u201cThe petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d). The BIA denied Florez\u2019s motion to reopen on September 15, 2008. On October 15, 2008, she filed a motion to reconsider with the BIA, and, on January 22, 2009, petitioned this Court for review of the BIA\u2019s December 23, 2008 order denying the motion to reconsider. The filing of a motion to reconsider \u201cdoes not toll the time to petition for review.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1544, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Therefore, we dismiss Florez\u2019s petition to the extent she attacks the BIA\u2019s findings denying the underlying motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">PETITION DENIED as to the Motion to Reconsider, and DISMISSED as to the Motion to Reopen.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
