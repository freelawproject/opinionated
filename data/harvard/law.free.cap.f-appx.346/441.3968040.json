On appeal, Clark and Callaway argue that: (1) the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed their case; (2) and the magistrate was biased against them because they were <em>pro se </em>litigants. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Our review of \u201csanctions under Rule 37 is sharply limited to a search for an abuse of discretion and a determination that the findings of the trial court are fully supported by the record.\u201d <em>Serra Chevrolet, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., </em>446 F.3d 1137, 1146-47 (11th Cir.2006) (citation and brackets omitted). The question on review \u201cis not whether [we] would, as an original matter, have dismissed the action; it is whether the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the action.\u201d <em>Aztec Steel Co. v. Florida Steel Corp., </em>691 F.2d 480, 481 (11th Cir.1982) (citing <em>Nat\u2019l Hockey League v. Metro. Hockey Club, </em>427 U.S. 639, 642, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 49 L.Ed.2d 747 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize that \u201c[i]f a party ... fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery,\u201d the presiding district court \u201cmay issue further just orders,\u201d including an order \u201cdismissing the action or proceeding.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(A)(v). We have recognized that \u201c[d]ismissal with prejudice is the most severe Rule 37 sanction and is not favored ... [b]ut, dismissal may be appropriate when a plaintiffs recalcitrance is due to wilfulness, bad faith or fault.\u201d <em>Phipps v. Blakeney, </em>8 F.3d 788, 790 (11th Cir.1993). Dismissal is not an abuse of discretion \u201c[w]hen a party demonstrates a flagrant disregard for the court and the discovery process.\u201d <em>Aztec Steel, </em>691 F.2d at 481. On the other hand, a \u201c[violation of a discovery order caused by simple negligence, misunderstanding, or inability to comply will not justify a Rule 37 ... dismissal.\u201d <em>Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., </em>987 F.2d 1536, 1542 (11th Cir.1993). In reviewing whether the district court properly dismissed the action, \u201cone consideration is whether a less drastic but equally effective remedy could have been fashioned.\u201d <em>Aztec Steel, </em>691 F.2d at 481-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Clark and Calla-way\u2019s case. Here, the district court warned Clark and Callaway that \u201cany further actions on their part which demonstrates a lack of diligence in prosecuting this action or a failure to comply with their obligations will result in a dismissal of their case.\u201d In their responses to the Defendants\u2019 attempts to schedule depositions, Clark and Callaway did not offer any reasons why they could not provide depositions at the suggested times. Instead, Clark and Callaway stated that they would only schedule depositions on the same day Defendant Keen agreed to be deposed. Clark and Callaway\u2019s demand came after the district court ruled that Keen did not have to be deposed. Because, as the district court found, Clark and Callaway willfully failed to comply with the court\u2019s discovery orders, the court did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>discretion when it dismissed their case as a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In addition, since Clark and Callaway never sought district court review of the magistrate\u2019s refusal to disqualify himself, we do not have jurisdiction to review the magistrate\u2019s decision. <em>United States v. Renfro, </em>620 F.2d 497, 499 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But even if we were to reach the merits of this claim, a claim of bias on the part of the magistrate judge would not excuse a plaintiffs failure to comply with discovery, or prove that the district judge\u2019s selection of a discovery sanction amounted to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-17\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
