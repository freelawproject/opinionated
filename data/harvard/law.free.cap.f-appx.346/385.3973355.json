O\u2019Donnell filed suit against Derrig, alleging three causes of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violations of her Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s claims included, <em>inter alia, </em>allegations of warrantless arrest without probable cause, excessive force, unlawful seizure, and deliberate indifference to her medical needs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a motion by Derrig, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Derrig on all claims, based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-19\">O\u2019Donnell now appeals, arguing: (1) the district court failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to her in assessing the unlawful seizure claim; (2) the district court erred in concluding that there were no disputed facts as to the claim of deliberate indifference to her medical needs; and (3) this court\u2019s precedent applies the sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>mary judgment standard in an unconstitutional manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Summary judgment is only appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and [ ] the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the record and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Patton v. Triad Guar. Ins. Corp., </em>277 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe nonmovant need not be given the benefit of every inference but only of every reasonable inference.\u201d <em>Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>193 F.3d 1274, 1282 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">II. Unlawful Seizure</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">In its order, the district court relied heavily on a videotape of the arrest, which was submitted as an exhibit to the motion for summary judgment. According to the district court, the video, \u201cviewed in the light most favorable to O\u2019Donnell,\u201d established the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">After stopping O\u2019Donnell\u2019s ear [for operating a vehicle with an inoperable license tag light], Derrig asked for her license and registration. She claimed not to have the car\u2019s registration, and Derrig then returned to his patrol car to write citations. Both the failure to have the registration in the car and the inoperable tag light are citable offenses in Florida. When Derrig returned to O\u2019Donnell\u2019s car and asked her to get out of the car to sign the citations, O\u2019Donnell refused. Eventually, she got out of her car, but still refused to sign the citations. Derrig warned O\u2019Donnell that if she continued to refuse, he would arrest her. O\u2019Donnell maintained her refusal to sign the citations, looked at the video camera and said, \u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d then took a call on her cell phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">Derrig then reached for O\u2019Donnell\u2019s arm but she pulled away and ran into the street. Derrig then grabbed O\u2019Donnell, brought her to the hood of the patrol car, and tried to handcuff her. She resisted, screaming at Derrig, and at one point she bit Derrig. <em>(See </em>Pl.\u2019s Dep. at 80.) After Derrig handcuffed O\u2019Donnell, an ambulance arrived and the EMTs asked whether she needed to go to the hospital. She said no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">\u201c[I]n order to receive qualified immunity, the public actor must prove that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority when the allegedly wrongful acts occurred.\u201d <em>Kesinger v. Herrington, </em>381 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2004). Once this has been demonstrated, \u201cthe burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the official is not entitled to qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Shop v. City of Atlanta, </em>485 F.3d 1130, 1137 (11th Cir.2007). To satisfy her burden, the plaintiff must show that \u201c(1) the defendant violated a constitutional right, and (2) this right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.\u201d <em>Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1264 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Brosseau v. Haugen, </em>543 U.S. 194, 199, 125 S.Ct. 596, 160 L.Ed.2d 583 (2004) (quoting <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)). \u201c[0]nly Supreme Court cases, Eleventh Circuit caselaw, and [state] Supreme Court caselaw can \u2018clearly establish\u2019 law in this circuit.\u201d <em>Thomas ex rel. Thomas v. Roberts, </em>323 F.3d 950, 955 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Individuals have the right to be free from unreasonable seizures. <em>Case v. Eslinger, </em>555 F.3d 1317, 1326 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cThe \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of a seizure or arrest under the Fourth Amendment turns on the presence or absence of probable cause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">It is undisputed that Derrig was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority when the alleged wrongful acts occurred. The burden, therefore, shifted to O\u2019Donnell to show that Derrig violated her clearly established constitutional rights. The district court concluded that O\u2019Donnell failed to meet this burden because \u201c[a]n officer in Derrig\u2019s position could reasonably have believed that there was probable cause to arrest O\u2019Donnell for refusal to obey a lawful police order.... Her refusal to sign a citation likewise gave Derrig probable cause to arrest her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">O\u2019Donnell concedes that she was lawfully ordered to sign the citation and could be arrested for refusing to sign it. O\u2019Donnell contends, however, that the district court failed to construe the facts in the light most favorable to her because the videotape shows that at several points she stated her desire to sign the citation. Thus, O\u2019Donnell argues that had the district court viewed the facts in the light most favorable to her, it would have concluded that she did not refuse to sign the citation, and therefore Derrig did not have probable cause to arrest her.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">O\u2019Donnell\u2019s recitation of the facts is, to say the least, quite selective. O\u2019Donnell purports to accept the authenticity of the videotape and relies on it throughout her brief, but selectively omits certain portions of the tape from her discussion. The videotape shows that after confirming the car\u2019s registration, Derrig placed the citation pad on the hood of his police cruiser, approached O\u2019Donnell\u2019s car, and asked her to exit the vehicle to sign the citation. O\u2019Donnell initially refused, but subsequently exited the car. By O\u2019Donnell\u2019s own admission, she then \u201cexhibited marked annoyance and anger which was directed at the police officer.\u201d Derrig repeatedly asked O\u2019Donnell to stand in front of his car, which was where the citation pad was located. O\u2019Donnell yelled numerous times that she wanted to sign the citation, but despite Derrig\u2019s continuous requests, O\u2019Donnell refused to stand in front of Derrig\u2019s car. Instead, she yelled for Derrig to \u201cget me the thing,\u201d apparently wanting Derrig to retrieve the pad and deliver it to her. O\u2019Donnell then directed statements towards the camera in Derrig\u2019s vehicle and fielded a cell phone call. Derrig nonetheless took out a pen, adjusted his citation pad (which remained on the hood of his vehicle), held the pen in front of the citation pad, and asked O\u2019Donnell to stand in front of the vehicle. O\u2019Donnell refused and walked to her car, ignoring Derrig\u2019s inquiry as to where she was going.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">O\u2019Donnell returned moments later and yelled at Derrig. After a brief argument, Derrig attempted to grab O\u2019Donnell\u2019s arm and O\u2019Donnell ran into the street. Derrig chased O\u2019Donnell, seized her, and restrained her against the hood of the cruiser. For several seconds, Derrig attempted to handcuff O\u2019Donnell\u2019s arms behind her back, at one point yelling for O\u2019Donnell to \u201cstop resisting.\u201d O\u2019Donnell replied, \u201cI\u2019m not resisting. Motherf \u2014 er, I\u2019ll show you resisting,\u201d and then attempted to strike Derrig. Derrig subdued O\u2019Donnell on the pavement and handcuffed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">When the videotape is viewed in its entirety, it is clear that O\u2019Donnell, numerous times, disobeyed Derrig\u2019s lawful orders for her to sign the citation. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to O\u2019Donnell, she failed to demonstrate unlawful seizure because the arrest was sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ported by probable cause. The district court did not err in concluding that Derrig was entitled to summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">III. Deliberate Indifference to Medical Needs</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">O\u2019Donnell next argues that the district court erred in concluding that Derrig was not deliberately indifferent to O\u2019Donnell\u2019s medical needs. The videotape clearly shows that following the arrest, an ambulance arrived to treat O\u2019Donnell. It is undisputed that O\u2019Donnell spoke with an EMT and declined medical attention. O\u2019Donnell contends that she did so because she assumed she was going to be released which, as the district court noted, was an unreasonable assumption considering the events that just transpired and that O\u2019Donnell remained handcuffed while speaking with the EMTs. Nonetheless, O\u2019Donnell, citing her husband\u2019s deposition, argues that once she was in the police cruiser she decided that she wanted to go to the hospital. O\u2019Donnell allegedly voiced this request to Derrig, but Derrig did not turn around or acknowledge her statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\u201cTo prove a deliberate indifference claim, a plaintiff must show: (1) a serious medical need; (2) the defendants\u2019 deliberate indifference to that need; and (3) causation between that indifference and the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Danley v. Allen, </em>540 F.3d 1298, 1310 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">First, it is not clear that O\u2019Donnell had a serious medical need because she declined medical treatment, reviewed and signed a document, and walked to the police cruiser under her own power. These actions are not consistent with the allegation that at the time O\u2019Donnell was suffering from a \u201cserious medical need.\u201d <em>Burnette v. Taylor, </em>533 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2008) (defining a \u201cserious medical need\u201d as \u201cone that is diagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment or one that is so obvious that a lay person would recognize the need for medical treatment\u201d). Second, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that O\u2019Donnell had a serious medical need, there is no evidence that Derrig behaved with deliberate indifference to that need. O\u2019Donnell rests her entire argument on her husband\u2019s testimony that even though Derrig did not acknowledge O\u2019Donnell\u2019s alleged request for medical treatment, \u201cI assume that he heard [it].\u201d This is insufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Derrig displayed a deliberate indifference to O\u2019Donnell\u2019s alleged medical need. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (\u201cA supporting or opposing affidavit must be made on personal knowledge .... \u201d); <em>see also Pace v. Capobianco, </em>283 F.3d 1275, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201c[A]n affidavit stating only that the affiant \u2018believes\u2019 a certain fact exists is insufficient to defeat summary judgment by creating a genuine issue of fact about the existence of that certain fact.\u201d). As such, summary judgment on the deliberate indifference claim was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">IV. Summary Judgment Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Finally, O\u2019Donnell argues that this circuit\u2019s application of the summary judgment standard is unconstitutional. She contends that this court has improperly interpreted the question of whether there is a \u201cgenuine issue as to any material fact\u201d by referencing to a \u201crational trier of fact.\u201d She argues that a court\u2019s \u201cdetermination of what a \u2018rational\u2019 jury might do ... in and of itself, is the resolution of a factual issue,\u201d which violates her Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">This argument warrants little discussion. The term \u201crational trier of fact\u201d is not a creature of Eleventh Circuit case-law, but rather a test expressly handed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>down by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (\u201cWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no \u2018genuine issue for trial.\u2019\u201d). We lack the authority to challenge the constitutionality of the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of federal law. <em>See Hohn v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 236, 252-53, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-12\">. The district court's order stated that O\u2019Donnell \u201ccontends that most of her claims are 'subsumed' into her unlawful seizure claim. She now claims only unlawful seizure and deliberate indifference to medical needs.\u201d O\u2019Donnell does not challenge this determination on appeal, and thus our discussion will be limited to these issues as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
