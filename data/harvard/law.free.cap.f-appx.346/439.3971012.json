The Commissioner contends substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s determination Davis was not eligible for disability benefits, and the district court erred in ruling to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). <em>\u201cA </em>clearly articulated credibility finding with substantial supporting evidence in the record will not be disturbed by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1562 (11th Cir.1995). If the ALJ fails to articulate the reasons for discrediting subjective testimony, however, the testimony is accepted as true. <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1225; <em>see also Holt v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1221, 1223 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201c[T]he ALJ\u2019s discretionary power to determine the credibility of testimony is limited by his obligation to place on the record explicit and adequate reasons for rejecting that testimony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">\u201cAn individual claiming Social Security disability benefits must prove he or she is disabled.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Social security \u201cregulations place a very heavy burden on the claimant to demonstrate both a qualifying disability and an inability to perform past relevant work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We apply a three-part pain standard when a claimant seeks to establish disability through his own testimony regarding pain or other subjective symptoms. <em>Holt, </em>921 F.2d at 1223 (\u201cThe pain standard requires (1) evidence of an underlying medical condition and either (2) objective medical evidence that confirms the severity of the alleged pain arising from that condition or (3) that the objectively determined medical condition is of such a severity that it can be reasonably expected to give rise to the alleged pain.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">The ALJ provided in the record specific reasons for disbelieving Davis\u2019s testimony regarding his pain and physical limitations. Citing the medical records provided by Davis, the ALJ noted that Davis\u2019s respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and musculoskeletal examinations were within normal limits, notwithstanding Davis\u2019s health complaints, which included shortness of breath, dizziness, and acute hip pain. The ALJ likewise cited several specific findings from the consultative physical examination performed on Davis, which he deemed consistent with the remaining medical records, and inconsistent with Davis\u2019s subjective pain and limitation reports. Finally, medical records tracking Davis\u2019s blood pressure over the year following his cessation of work were highlighted by the ALJ as indicative of a level of health inconsistent with that reported by Davis. In sum, the ALJ provided a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>clear articulation of his reasons for rejecting Davis\u2019s testimony, and provided substantial supporting evidence for that finding, consistent with our precedent. <em>See Foote, </em>67 F.3d at 1562; <em>Holt, </em>921 F.2d at 1223.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Admittedly, the ALJ also substantiated his credibility findings with purported inconsistencies between Davis\u2019s accounts of his daily living activities and the ailments or limitations he reported. In overturning the ALJ\u2019s ruling, the district court ignored the several medical bases the ALJ articulated in his written decision for denying Davis\u2019s claim for benefits. The ALJ\u2019s adverse determination was supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, and the district court erred in reversing the ALJ. Thus, we reverse the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
