The Champaign County Municipal Court entered judgment in favor of McArthur Chiropractic Center, and Randall appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">{\u00b6 2} Randall contends that the trial court erred by failing to consider R.C. 1751.60 in its decision. He further contends that the judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">{\u00b6 3} A crucial factual issue in this case is whether McArthur was a provider under contract with Randall\u2019s health-care insurer. McArthur testified that he was not; Randall testified that he was. In finding for McArthur on this issue, the magistrate erroneously stated that Randall had testified that McArthur was not a provider under contract with Randall\u2019s health-care insurer. We conclude that this constituted a fundamental factual error in the magistrate\u2019s decision, which was pointed out to the trial court in Randall\u2019s objections, but which was not addressed by the trial court. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b587-14\">{\u00b6 4} Brent McArthur, d.b.a. McArthur Chiropractic Center, filed suit in the Champaign Municipal Court alleging that Randall owed a total of $1,870 for services rendered during 2001 and 2002. The matter proceeded to a bench trial, during which the following evidence was adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-15\">{\u00b6 5} Dr. Brent McArthur testified that he had treated Randall for problems arising from an automobile accident. The treatment continued for more than a year. At the end of the treatment, Randall was billed for services. McArthur testified that at the time the services were rendered, he was not under contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>with Randall\u2019s insurance company, Anthem, and that he was not, at the time of the hearing, an Anthem provider. McArthur also testified that Randall did not provide a copy of his insurance card. Finally, McArthur testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cIf you look on a HIPA form which is a health insurance care form, there\u2019s a box that says is this care rendered due to work, auto or personal. Yeah, just general health. And this, this whole care has been rendered due to an accident, due to a car accident, lingering effects from a bad car wreck. Well, you, you can\u2019t bill an insurance company for an automobile accident \u2014 health care insurance company for an automobile accident when it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a totally different thing. And [Randall is] still pursuing, I would imagine, to, to settle this with his own car insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 7} In contrast, Randall testified that he had contacted his health-insurance carrier, Anthem, prior to treatment and was informed that McArthur had been under contract with Anthem since 1999. He further testified that he provided his health-insurance information to McArthur, but that McArthur had failed to bill Anthem.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 8} Following the trial, the magistrate decided in favor of McArthur, awarding $1,870 for services rendered. The decision included the following statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cBoth [McArthur and Randall] admit [Randall] received medical treatment from [McArthur]. [Randall] claims that [McArthur] was not a proper provider under his insurance. [McArthur] claims that he submitted proper paperwork for payment. [Randall] did receive medical treatment which should be paid for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">{\u00b6 10} Randall filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Along with his objection, he filed an exhibit purporting to be a photocopy of a page from Anthem\u2019s web site, which showed McArthur as an Anthem provider. The trial court, without analysis, overruled the objections and rendered judgment in favor of McArthur and against Randall. From this judgment, Randall appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">{\u00b6 11} Randall\u2019s First Assignment of Error states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to conclude that R.C. 1751.60 precluded direct billing of the appellant by the appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">{\u00b6 13} Randall contends that the trial court erroneously failed to consider the provisions of R.C. 1751.60 in determining this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 1751.60 expressly states that providers cannot, under any circumstances, seek payment from enrolle\u00e9s or subscribers, except for approved copayments and noncovered services. <em>Parmatown Spinal &amp; Rehab. Ctr., Inc. v. Lewis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Cuyahoga App. No. 81996, 2003-Ohio-5069, 2003 WL 22208786, \u00b624. \u201c[The statute] imposes a mandatory requirement upon health care facilities [and providers] that contract with health insuring corporations to seek compensation for covered services solely from the [health] insurer, except for approved co-payments and deductibles.\u201d <em>Grandview/Southview Hosps. v. Monie, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20636, 2005-Ohio-1574, 2005 WL 737393, \u00b6 10, citing R.C. 1751.60(A). In other words, if McArthur is an Anthem provider, he cannot seek payment from Randall, an Anthem insured, for anything other than approved copayments or noncovered services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">{\u00b6 15} This statute must be considered when a doctor is a contract provider for an insurance company and that doctor treats the insured of that company. In this case, neither the magistrate nor the trial court made any reference to this statute, despite the fact that Randall raised it many times during the pendency of this action. We presume that the magistrate and trial court did not consider this statute because they found that Dr. McArthur was not an Anthem provider.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. McArthur\u2019s testimony would support this finding. Therefore, we decline to find error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 16} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">{\u00b6 17} Randall\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">{\u00b6 19} Randall contends that the judgment against him is not supported by the evidence. Specifically, he claims that the magistrate\u2019s findings are erroneous and that the trial court erred by adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">{\u00b6 20} Obviously, the key issue in this case is whether McArthur had a contract with Anthem to act as a provider of medical services for individuals insured by Anthem. If he was a provider, then the provisions of R.C. 1751.60 require that he bill Anthem rather than Randall. If he was not, then the provisions of that statute do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>{\u00b6 21} As noted above, the magistrate made only three findings with regard to her decision in favor of McArthur: (1) that McArthur provided medical treatment to Randall, (2) that Randall testified that McArthur was not an Anthem provider, and (3) that McArthur submitted the proper paperwork for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">{\u00b622} It appears that the magistrate\u2019s decision was based, largely, upon a finding that McArthur was not an Anthem provider. Thus, we must decide whether, as claimed, the magistrate, and subsequently the trial court, erred in determining this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">. {\u00b6 23} We are cognizant of the fact that McArthur testified that he was not an Anthem provider and that this testimony was in direct contradiction of Randall\u2019s testimony. We are further aware that the magistrate, as the initial finder of fact, was in the best position to determine the credibility of the witnesses, and thus, was entitled to conclude that McArthur was the more credible witness. Thus, had the magistrate merely stated that she found McArthur\u2019s testimony more credible than Randall\u2019s, we would be constrained to conclude that the finding was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">{\u00b6 24} However, we cannot ignore the fact that the magistrate found that Randall testified that McArthur was not an Anthem provider. This finding is erroneous on its face, completely contrary to the transcript of the hearing, and thus, not supported by the evidence. Since the magistrate made a finding that is completely erroneous, and since that finding was in regard to a vital issue, we cannot say that this error was minor or harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">{\u00b6 25} Because we have found a serious factual error in the magistrate\u2019s decision, we conclude that the trial court erred in adopting that decision. \u201cMagistrates are neither constitutional nor statutory courts. Magistrates and their powers are wholly creatures of rules of practice and procedure promulgated by the Supreme Court. Therefore, magistrates do not constitute a judicial tribunal independent of the court that appoints them. Instead, they are adjuncts of their appointing courts, which remain responsible to critically review and verify the work of the magistrates they appoint.\u201d <em>Quick v. Kwiatkowski </em>(Aug. 3, 2001), Montgomery App. No 18620, 2001 WL 871406. \u201cCiv.R. 53(E)(4)(b) contemplates a de novo review of any issue of fact or law that a magistrate has determined when an appropriate objection is timely filed. The trial court may not properly defer to the magistrate in the exercise of the trial court\u2019s de novo review. The magistrate is a subordinate officer of the trial court, not an independent officer performing a separate function.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">{\u00b6 26} In this case, it appears that the trial court perfunctorily overruled Randall\u2019s objections, without review or analysis. Randall\u2019s objections raised the issue of the erroneous finding by the magistrate, and the record supported his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>objection. However, the trial court made no reference to this obvious error and failed to address, or otherwise correct, that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">{\u00b6 27} Furthermore, when Randall filed his objections, he also submitted evidence, in the form of a copy of Anthem\u2019s provider directory, indicating that McArthur was, in fact, an Anthem provider. A trial court has the discretion to \u201crefuse to consider additional evidence proffered upon objections.\u201d However, the trial court did not mention this evidence in its decision. Therefore, we do not know whether it decided not to consider this evidence or whether it simply did not review the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">{\u00b6 28} We conclude that the magistrate\u2019s decision contained an obvious error of fact and that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to address this error, which had been called to its attention. Therefore, we conclude that the judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">{\u00b6 29} The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">{\u00b6 30} Randall\u2019s second assignment of error having been sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b591-11\">Grady, P.J., and Brogan, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-12\">. The Cuyahoga Court of Appeals has found one exception to this rule. Specifically, that court has held that a doctor may bill the patient if the patient fails to comply with the \"evidence of coverage\u201d requirement. <em>Parmatown, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81996, 2003-Ohio-5069, 2003 WL 22208786, at \u00b6 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-13\">. However, given our disposition of the second assignment of error, we note that the failure to consider this statute would be erroneous if, on remand, the evidence supports a finding that McArthur is an Anthem provider.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b591-20\">. We do not reach the issue of whether this exhibit is admissible, but note that this evidence, if properly proffered, would tend to corroborate Randall\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
