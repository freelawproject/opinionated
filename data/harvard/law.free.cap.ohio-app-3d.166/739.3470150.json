The following facts give rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">{\u00b6 2} This is an odometer-fraud case in which appellee C. Ray Burkey, d.b.a. R.B. Motors (\u201cBurkey\u201d), admits that the written statements provided to appellant during the sales presentation, which were also contained in the sales contract, omitted the disclosure that the vehicle\u2019s odometer exceeded the 100,000-miles mechanical limit. Appellant purchased the vehicle believing the mileage on the odometer to be 56,984, when the actual mileage was 156,984.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">{\u00b6 3} On February 16, 2005, appellant filed her complaint seeking remedies under Ohio\u2019s Odometer Law, R.C. 4549.49, and the Consumer Sales Practices Act, R.C. 1345.09. Burkey filed an answer to the complaint and a counterclaim for the balance of the purchase price. On September 6, 2005, appellant filed a motion for summary judgment. Appellant\u2019s motion sought attorney fees of $3,500 for the time expended on the case through September 4, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court conducted a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion on October 3, 2005. At this hearing, appellant explained that she was entitled to damages in the amount of $1,649.20 as follows: two payments made on the vehicle totaling $250, repairs to the vehicle totaling $899.20, the down payment of $300, and the value of her trade-in vehicle of $200. The trial court granted appellant\u2019s request to file a supplemental affidavit seeking additional attorney fees. Counsel for appellant filed this affidavit on October 4, 2005, seeking an additional $1,050 in fees for services rendered through October 3, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-15\">{\u00b6 5} On October 28, 2005, the trial court issued a judgment entry granting appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The trial court\u2019s judgment granted appellant rescission under the Consumer Sales Practices Act and granted her a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>judgment of $1,500 as the statutory remedy under the odometer-fraud statute. The trial court also ordered Burkey to pay $3,500 in attorney fees incurred through September 4, 2005. Finally, the trial court dismissed Burkey\u2019s counterclaim with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant timely filed a notice of appeal and sets forth the following assignments of error for our consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cI. The trial court erred in failing to grant Sabbatis judgment for her payments in this transaction as necessary element of recision [sic].</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cII. The trial court erred in overlooking the October 4, 2005, supplemental affidavit of counsel in determining the attorney fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cIII. The trial [sic] erred and abused its discretion in failing to grant the plaintiffs motion to compel discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Summary Judgment Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">{\u00b6 10} Our standard of review is de novo, and as an appellate court, we must stand in the shoes of the trial court and review summary judgments on the same standard and evidence as the trial court. <em>Smiddy v. The Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 30 OBR 78, 506 N.E.2d 212. Accordingly, an appellate court must independently review the record to determine whether summary judgment was appropriate, and we need not defer to the trial court\u2019s decision. See <em>Brown v. Scioto Bd. ofCommrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153; <em>Morehead v. Conley </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 409, 411-412, 599 N.E.2d 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">{\u00b6 11} Civ.R. 56(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. * * * A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from the evidence or stipulation, and only [therefrom], that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, such party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in the party\u2019s favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">{\u00b6 13} Pursuant to the above rule, a trial court may not enter summary judgment if it appears a material fact is genuinely disputed. The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. The moving party may not make a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. The moving party must specifically point to some evidence that demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>strates that the nonmoving party cannot support its claim. If the moving party satisfies this requirement, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth specific facts demonstrating that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial. <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 429, 674 N.E.2d 1164, citing <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. It is based upon this standard that we review appellant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">{\u00b6 14} In her first assignment of error, appellant maintains that the trial court erred in faffing to grant her judgment for the money expended in this transaction as a necessary element of rescission. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">{\u00b6 15} According to R.C. 1345.09(B), under the Consumer Sales Practices Act, a consumer may either rescind a transaction or recover three times the amount of his or her actual damages. At common law, a party who has been fraudulently induced to enter into a contract has the option of rescinding the contract or retaining the contract and suing for damages based upon the tort of fraudulent inducement. See <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118; <em>Columbus &amp; Toledo RR. Co. v. Steinfeld </em>(1884), 42 Ohio St. 449. An election of remedies is required because it is inconsistent to allow the defrauded party to rescind the contract and yet, at the same time, receive the benefits of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cIf rescission is elected, it necessarily follows that the defrauded party is entitled to recover whatever he has already paid on the contract. This recovery is necessary because rescission is not merely a termination of the contract; it is an annulment of the contract. The primary purpose of \u2018rescission\u2019 is to restore the parties to their original positions as if the contract had never been formed. Returning the parties to status quo is an integral part of rescission, and in doing so it is generally necessary to award the party seeking rescission at least his out-of-pocket expenses. These out-of-pocket expenses are properly characterized as \u2018damages\u2019 for they represent the loss not cured by the cancellation of the contract that defendant has suffered as a result of the fraudulent inducement.\u201d <em>Mid-America Acceptance Co. v. Lightle </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 590, 599, 579 N.E.2d 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">{\u00b6 17} Thus, under R.C. 1345.09(B), a consumer that has been fraudulently induced to enter a contract may either rescind the contract and return the parties to the position in which they would have been if there had been no contract or retain the contract and sue for damages based upon the fraudulent inducement. Id. at 600, 579 N.E.2d 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">{\u00b6 18} In her motion for summary judgment, appellant elected the remedy of rescission. Under the remedy of rescission, appellant argues that she is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>to a judgment for the funds expended in connection with the transaction, which totals $1,649.20. The trial court did not compensate her for these expenses. We hold that appellant is entitled to be compensated for these \u201cdamages\u201d because these expenses represent the loss not cured by the cancellation of the contract that appellant incurred as a result of the fraudulent inducement. Reimbursement of appellant for these out-of-pocket expenses will return her to the status quo ante.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">{\u00b6 19} However, in awarding these damages, we note that the contract listed the trade-in value as $10. Accordingly, we award appellant $1,499.20 in damages. This matter is remanded to the trial court for that court to award appellant an additional $1,499.20 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">{\u00b6 20} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant maintains in her second assignment of error that the trial court erred when it overlooked her supplemental affidavit, filed on October 4, 2005, in support of her request for attorney fees. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Atwood Resources, Inc. v. Lehigh </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 293, 648 N.E.2d 548, we noted that the Ohio Supreme Court has set forth five factors to be considered by a trial court when awarding attorney fees. These factors are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c1. The time and labor involved in maintaining the litigation,</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c2. The novelty, complexity, and difficulty of the questions involved,</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c3. The professional skill required to perform the necessary legal services,</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c4. The experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys and</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c5. The miscellaneous expenses of the litigation.\u201d Id. at 299, 648 N.E.2d 548, citing <em>Villella v. Waikem Motors, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 36, 41, 543 N.E.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-15\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cA trial court\u2019s decision as to the appropriate award of attorney fees will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. at 300, 648 N.E.2d 548. In order to find an abuse of discretion, we must determine that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-16\">{\u00b6 29} In the case sub judice, appellant contends that it is evident from the transcript of the summary-judgment hearing that the trial court expected appellant\u2019s counsel to file a supplemental affidavit concerning the attorney fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>incurred since the filing of the motion for summary judgment. In its judgment entry granting appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court wrote, \u201cPlaintiffs legal counsel is granted leave to file a supplemental Affidavit in support of attorney\u2019s fees billed subsequent to 9/4/2005.\u201d In fact, the record indicates appellant had filed the supplemental affidavit on October 4, 2005. Therefore, it appears that the trial court was unaware that appellant had filed the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, we remand this matter to the trial court for the court to review the affidavit filed by appellant on October 4, 2005, in support of her request for attorney fees. It is within the trial court\u2019s discretion whether or not to grant the additional fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">{\u00b6 31} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">{\u00b6 32} In her third assignment of error, appellant maintains that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to grant her motion to compel discovery. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">{\u00b6 33} The trial court failed to rule on appellant\u2019s motion to compel. Appellant is correct in stating that a trial court\u2019s failure to rule on a motion is normally deemed to be a denial of that motion for purposes of appellate review. <em>State v. Olah </em>(2001), 146 Ohio App.3d 586, 767 N.E.2d 755, fn. 2. An appellate court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision regarding disposition of discovery issues absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel. The V Cos. v. Marshall </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 467, 469, 692 N.E.2d 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">{\u00b6 34} Appellant argues that if the trial court had granted her motion to compel, she may have discovered insurance coverage or further evidence of damages or willfulness. We find this argument speculative. Appellant does not claim that she was prejudiced by the lack of discovery. Thus, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied her motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">{\u00b6 35} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">{\u00b6 36} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Tuscarawas County, Ohio, is hereby affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b786-14\">Farmer, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b786-15\">Hoffman, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Hoffman, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AUe\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">{\u00b6 37} I concur in the majority\u2019s analysis and disposition of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">{\u00b6 38} I further concur in the majority\u2019s analysis and disposition of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error except for the damage allowance of $200 for appellant\u2019s trade-in. The contract listed the trade-in value as $10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trade-in value is flexible and a factor in establishing the ultimate selling price of the vehicle being purchased. Accordingly, I would award appellant only an additional $1,499.20 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">As to appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, because our remand is limited to consideration of appellant\u2019s claim for attorney fees under appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, I concur in the decision to overrule it, but would do so because the issue is moot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-17\">. It was represented at argument that appellant still has possession of the vehicle she purchased from appellee, but appellant\u2019s trade-in has been sold by appellee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b787-18\">. Appellant concedes that the issue is moot if she prevails on all the relief she requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
