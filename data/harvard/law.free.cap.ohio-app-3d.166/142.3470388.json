(\u201cMr. Excavator\u201d) was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>to coverage under State Auto\u2019s umbrella policy from the first dollar. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-appellees, Alvin and Laura McGuffin (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d), instituted this action on August 16, 2000, against Mr. Excavator, Alvin McGuffin\u2019s employer, and several other defendants. In the complaint, plaintiffs alleged that Alvin sustained injuries on August 19, 2000, when the sidewall on the trench in which he was working collapsed. The complaint specifically alleged that Mr. Excavator violated Ohio\u2019s \u201cfrequenter statute,\u201d R.C. 4101.11, and committed a substantially certain employer intentional tort. Mr. Excavator answered the complaint, denying liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 3} Upon service of the complaint, Mr. Excavator tendered the defense and indemnity of this lawsuit to its insurance carrier, State Auto. State Auto had issued a commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) policy and an umbrella policy to Mr. Excavator. On September 20, 2002, State Auto issued a reservation of rights letter in regards to the CGL policy, stating that it would provide Mr. Excavator with a defense, but denying any obligation to defend or indemnify Mr. Excavator against an adverse verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">{\u00b6 4} After receiving notice of State Auto\u2019s denial of coverage as to the umbrella policy, Mr. Excavator sought leave of court on October 25, 2004, to file a third-party complaint for declaratory relief, negligence, breach of contract, and reformation against State Auto and its insurance agents, Robert J. Clark and Denmark Insurance Services, Inc. The trial court granted Mr. Excavator leave to file and State Auto answered the third-party complaint, denying coverage under the CGL and umbrella policies on December 10, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">{\u00b6 5} On January 5, 2005, State Auto and Mr. Excavator submitted cross-motions for summary judgment on the coverage issues. The trial court, in its judgment entry and opinion dated May 26, 2005, determined that Mr. Excavator was entitled to coverage under the umbrella policy from the first dollar, but was not entitled to coverage under the CGL policy. State Auto filed a notice of appeal on June 24, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">{\u00b6 6} Plaintiffs and Mr. Excavator moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of a final appealable order, which this court denied on July 25, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">{\u00b6 7} Subsequently, on January 18, 2006, plaintiffs settled and dismissed with prejudice their action against Mr. Excavator. Accordingly, State Auto entered into a consent judgment in favor of Mr. Excavator, fixing damages for this appeal. Additionally, Mr. Excavator voluntarily dismissed the actions asserted in the third-party complaint against Robert J. Clark and Denmark Insurance Services, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>{\u00b6 8} We, therefore, address State Auto\u2019s sole assignment of error, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred in denying, in part, State Automobile Mutual Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment as no coverage for employer intentional tort claim is provided under the umbrella coverage issue to Mr. Excavator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">{\u00b6 10} We employ de novo review in determining whether summary judgment was properly granted. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241; <em>Zemcik v. LaPine Truck Sales &amp; Equip. Co. </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 581, 585, 706 N.E.2d 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">{\u00b6 11} Before summary judgment may be granted, a court must determine that \u201c(1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dussell v. Lakewood Police Dept., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 299, 2003-Ohio-3652, 791 N.E.2d 456, \u00b6 6, citing <em>State ex rel. Duganitz v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., </em>77 Ohio St.3d 190, 191, 672 N.E.2d 654; see Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">{\u00b6 12} The party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 367, 369-370, 696 N.E.2d 201. Once the moving party satisfies its burden, the nonmoving party \u201cmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the party\u2019s pleadings, but the party\u2019s response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Civ.R. 56(E); <em>Mootispaw v. Eckstein, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 383, 385, 667 N.E.2d 1197. Doubts must be resolved in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Murphy v. Reynoldsburg, </em>65 Ohio St.3d 356, 358-359, 604 N.E.2d 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">{\u00b6 13} With these principles in mind, we proceed to consider State Auto\u2019s sole assignment of error. State Auto contends that the umbrella policy issued to Mr. Excavator did not provide coverage for plaintiffs\u2019 intentional-tort claim against Alvin McGuffin\u2019s employer. For the following reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">{\u00b6 14} When construing a contract of insurance, \u201cInsurance policies are generally interpreted by applying rules of contract law. <em>Burris v. Grange Mut. Cos. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 84, 89, 545 N.E.2d 83, 88. If the language of the insurance policy is doubtful, uncertain, or ambiguous, the language will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. <em>Faruque v. Provident Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 34, 31 OBR 83, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>508 N.E.2d 949. However, the general rule of liberal construction cannot be employed to create an ambiguity where there is none. <em>Karabin v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 163, 166-167, 10 OBR 497, 499-500, 462 N.E.2d 403, 406-407. If the terms of a policy are clear and unambiguous, the interpretation of the contract is a matter of law. <em>Inland Refuse Transfer Co. v. Browning-Ferris Industries of Ohio, Inc. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 321, 15 OBR 448, 474 N.E.2d 271.\u201d <em>Progressive Ins. Co. v. Heritage Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 781, 783-784, 682 N.E.2d 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">{\u00b6 <em>15} In New Hampshire Ins. Group v. Frost </em>(1995), 110 Ohio App.3d 514, 674 N.E.2d 1189, this court held that \u201cwhere an employer is the insured, an intentional tort committed by the employer against an employee results in injuries \u2018expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 518, 674 N.E.2d 1189. In <em>New Hampshire, </em>the insurer appealed from a declaratory judgment requiring it to provide coverage to an employer for liability arising under an employer intentional tort. In that case, the New Hampshire policy covered damages resulting from an \u201coccurrence,\u201d which was defined in the policy as \u201can accident * * * which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d In finding that the New Hampshire policy did not provide coverage to the employer, we relied on <em>Wedge Prods., Inc. v. Hartford Equity Sales Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 65, 31 OBR 180, 509 N.E.2d 74, which involved identical policy language as that proffered in the New Hampshire policy. Id. at 515, 674 N.E.2d 1189. We stated, \u201cWedge found an employer incapable of committing an intentional tort without expecting the injury to occur because to commit an intentional tort an employer must, at a minimum, commit acts with the belief that an employee was substantially certain to be injured.\u201d Id. We, therefore, determined that \u201cwhere an employer is the insured, a finding of intent for purposes of an employer intentional tort necessarily means that the insured \u2018expected or intended\u2019 the injuries.\u201d Id. at 517, 674 N.E.2d 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">{\u00b6 16} Similarly, in <em>Altvater v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-422, 2003-Ohio-4758, 2003 WL 22077728, the Tenth District found that a policy that excludes coverage for expected or intended acts excludes coverage for substantially certain injuries or acts. The court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cAlthough the language in the present policies does not expressly exclude coverage for substantial-certainty employer intentional torts, as did the policy in <em>Penn Traffic [Co. v. AIU Ins. Co., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 227, 2003-Ohio-3373, 790 N.E.2d 1199], these policies do contain the same proscription against coverage for any bodily injury \u2018expected or intended.\u2019 Thus, we apply the following concepts from <em>Penn Traffic </em>to the present case: (1) where substantial certainty exists, intent to harm will be inferred as a matter of law, and (2) there is no coverage for substantial-certainty employer intentional torts where an insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>policy excludes coverage for bodily injury \u2018expected or intended\u2019 from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">{\u00b6 18} As in <em>New Hampshire </em>and <em>Altvater, </em>we find that the State Auto umbrella policy in effect at the time of the incident excludes coverage for plaintiffs\u2019 substantial-certainty employer intentional-tort claim. The umbrella policy in this case contains language that is nearly identical to that in <em>New Hampshire </em>and <em>Altvater. </em>The policy excludes coverage for \u201c \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 <em>either expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, because the umbrella policy language excludes coverage for injuries \u201cexpected or intended,\u201d the policy necessarily excludes coverage for plaintiffs\u2019 substantial-certainty employer intentional-tort claim. Therefore, we find merit in State Auto\u2019s sole assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">{\u00b6 19} Because we find that no coverage exists for Mr. Excavator under State Auto\u2019s umbrella policy, we find that State Auto\u2019s remaining arguments asserting no coverage are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">{\u00b6 20} We next address plaintiffs\u2019 and Mr. Excavator\u2019s assertions that State Auto waived any coverage defenses. Plaintiffs and Mr. Excavator maintain that although State Auto made a timely reservation of rights as to the CGL policy, it did not reserve its rights under the umbrella policy until two years after plaintiffs filed suit. Therefore, as a result of State Auto\u2019s failure to reserve its rights under the umbrella policy, it has waived and is estopped from asserting any coverage defenses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cBecause an excess insurer has no duty to defend its insured, it cannot later be estopped from raising coverage defenses, or be said to have waived those defenses, if it fails to reserve its rights when notified of a claim or suit potentially implicating its coverage. It is, after all, an insurer\u2019s duty to defend which compels it to reserve its rights, and without a duty to defend, an excess insurer has no obligation to issue a reservation of rights letter.\u201d Richmond, Rights and Responsibilities of Excess Insurers (2000), 78 Denv.U.L.Rev. 29, 49-50 (Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">{\u00b6 22} In the instant matter, the CGL policy provided for a duty to defend and, thus, a duty to reserve its rights. The umbrella policy, however, as an excess policy, did not have a duty to defend. Accordingly, State Auto did not have a duty to reserve its rights under the umbrella policy and is not estopped from asserting its coverage defenses under that policy. Therefore, State Auto\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained, and we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment to the extent that it found coverage under the State Auto umbrella policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-11\">Gallagher and Blackmon, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
