He was fined and sentenced to 180 days. We have stayed the jail sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">{\u00b6 2} On appeal, Yates\u2019s first assignment of error is that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Yates\u2019s trial counsel failed to file a timely motion to suppress. Had the motion been filed and sustained, the state would not have had a case because the incriminating statements Yates allegedly made and other incriminating evidence would have been suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">{\u00b6 3} The issue on a motion to suppress would have been whether Sgt. Wyatt of the Wright State Police Department had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that Yates was driving under suspension, so as to justify Sgt. Wyatt\u2019s prolonging an investigative stop in order to ask Yates if he had driving privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">{\u00b6 4} The jury trial transcript contains Sgt. Wyatt\u2019s testimony as to the circumstances culminating in the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-14\">{\u00b6 5} The stop occurred in the early afternoon of March 15, 2005. Wyatt had been dispatched to university housing on a report of several black males distributing advertising handbills. He observed four black males get into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Cadillac, and he followed the car as it drove through the Wright State University campus. As he followed the ear, he learned from running the car\u2019s registration through the Law Enforcement Automated Data System that the owner of the car was female and that she was under suspension. The driver of the car kept checking the rear view mirror, and the occupants kept looking back as Wyatt followed the car. Although the driver did not violate any traffic laws, the driver drove in an evasive, zig-zagging fashion through several parking lots. The car stopped at the BIOS building and the driver, whom Wyatt identified as Yates, exited, as did the front seat passenger, and the two exchanged places. Wyatt observed this from 75 yards away and could not ascertain from that distance whether Yates was male or female. When the car took off again, Wyatt made a traffic stop. With the driver and front seat passenger still in the car, he asked the driver, Lamont Chambers, for his operator\u2019s license, which Chambers produced. Wyatt then asked the front seat passenger, Yates, if he had driving privileges. Yates said \u201cno\u201d and also admitted to driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">{\u00b6 6} The state does not defend the failure of trial counsel to timely file a motion to suppress, but, rather, argues that a motion to suppress \u2014 had it been filed \u2014 would have been overruled so that Yates was not prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">{\u00b6 7} The record reveals that the information that the owner of the Cadillac was female and under suspension was filed and available for inspection by trial counsel within a day or so after March 15, almost five months prior to August 10, 2005, the trial date, when trial counsel first made an oral motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">{\u00b6 8} Trial counsel\u2019s stated reason for Yates\u2019s oral motion to suppress was:</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cSo this is a belated motion to suppress because obviously when he (Sgt. Wyatt) ran the plates as he said he did in the police report, it was clear that the owner of the car was a woman, her name is Charlene Chambers and all the individuals in the car were males. So it is my contention, I did not know that, I just found it out yesterday that she\u2019s a female, but it is my contention that the stop was unreasonable and unlawful because the officer knew that the driver of the car was not a female.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">{\u00b6 10} We agree with Yates that counsel\u2019s failure to timely move to suppress fell 'below an objective standard of reasonable representation. We are also satisfied that had a timely motion to suppress been filed, it would have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">{\u00b6 11} Sgt. Wyatt\u2019s only legitimate basis for making an investigative stop was his belief that the driver of the Cadillac may have been a female who was under suspension. Although he may not have been able to ascertain Yates\u2019s gender when he observed Yates \u2014 from a distance of 75 yards \u2014 exit the driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>seat, once he observed Yates in the passenger seat after the traffic stop, Sgt. Wyatt realized that Yates was not female. Upon discovering that Yates was not female, Sgt. Wyatt had no justifiable basis for prolonging the stop to ask Yates if he had driving privileges. Upon observing Yates to be a male, any reasonable, articulable suspicion that a female had been driving under suspension dissipated. See <em>State v. Chatton </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 59, 11 OBR 250, 463 N.E.2d 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">{\u00b6 12} The first assignment is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">{\u00b6 13} The second assignment contends that the verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Given our disposition of the first assignment, this assignment is overruled as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">{\u00b6 14} The judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-9\">Grady, P.J., and Donovan, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
