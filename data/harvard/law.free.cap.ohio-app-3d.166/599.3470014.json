On March 31, 2004, Harris brought suit against Ford Motor Company for violations of Ohio\u2019s Lemon Law, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, and the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, and for breach of warranty. Harris alleged that his Ford Taurus often failed to start, shut off for no apparent reason while he was driving, and had \u201cso many electrical problems that both the interior and exterior lights dim, flash, flicker and go out altogether without warning.\u201d Harris further alleged that there was a strong electrical burning smell from the vehicle and that it ran \u201cmysteriously even after the key is removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">{\u00b6 3} Ford filed an answer in which it denied the claims and asserted various affirmative defenses, including that Harris had failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. During discovery, Harris requested answers to interrogatories regarding Ford\u2019s defenses. In response to Harris\u2019s question as to how he had failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, Ford stated that he had \u201cfailed to pursue alternative dispute resolution through Ford\u2019s Dispute Settlement Board prior to filing suit in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On January 18, 2005, the parties submitted a joint pretrial statement. Ford listed its defenses to Harris\u2019s claims by stating that Ford \u201cdid not breach its express or implied warranties to Plaintiff, and therefore did not violate the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act or the CSPA, and that the vehicle does not meet the presumption of the Ohio Lemon Law.\u201d Ford made no mention of Harris\u2019s failure to pursue a settlement through Ford\u2019s DSB.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">{\u00b6 5} The case proceeded to trial in January 2005, but a mistrial was declared due to Ford\u2019s representative having a conversation with two jurors. A second trial began on June 6, 2005. During Ford\u2019s cross-examination of Harris, Ford elicited testimony that the warranty manual that Harris had received when he purchased his vehicle indicated that a warranty dispute must be submitted to Ford\u2019s DSB before an action may be filed under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act or state law, and that the owner\u2019s manual also indicated that the process was free to owners of Ford vehicles. Harris filed a motion in limine to exclude further evidence regarding Ford\u2019s DSB mechanism, to strike Harris\u2019s testimony regarding the mechanism, and to instruct the jury to disregard Harris\u2019s testimony in that regard, raising four arguments. First, he asserted that Ford had failed to raise his failure to comply with the informal dispute-resolution requirement set forth in R.C. 1345.77(B) in its answer, and thus Ford had waived the defense. Second, Harris argued that Ford had failed to produce evidence upon which it relied for its assertion that participation in the DSB process was mandatory. Third, Harris contended that Ford presently lacks \u00e1 qualified DSB and thus dismissal- of this action for the purpose of first complying with R.C. 1345.77 would be a vain act. Finally, Harris asserted that Ford had failed to comply with the condition precedents to mandatory participation in the DSB process, namely, that Ford had failed to provide proper written notice of the informal dispute-resolution requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">{\u00b6 6} The court sustained Harris\u2019s motion on the ground that Ford had failed to raise the affirmative defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies in a motion to dismiss, by answer, or by amendment under Civ.R. 15. The court reasoned that Ford\u2019s allegation that Harris had failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted was insufficient to allege the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, \u201cnor does it formulate in a simple, concise, and direct manner the issue to be resolved by the trial court.\u201d On June 7, 2004, the court instructed the jury to disregard all evidence regarding Ford\u2019s DSB and not to consider anything about the DSB when deciding the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">{\u00b6 7} At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found in favor of Harris on his Ohio Lemon Law, Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, and breach-of-warranty claims. The jury found that Ford had not committed any unfair or deceptive practices. The jury awarded damages in the amount of $3,000 on Harris\u2019s Magnuson-Moss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Warranty Act claim but awarded no damages for breach of warranty. Because Harris had elected to have Ford repurchase the vehicle under Ohio\u2019s Lemon Law, the court subsequently entered judgment in favor of Harris for $30,745.55 (Harris\u2019s damages under the Lemon Law) and required Harris to sign clear title to the vehicle to Ford upon payment of the judgment. The parties had previously stipulated that any damages awarded for breach of warranty and for violations of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act would merge with Harris\u2019s Lemon Law recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">{\u00b6 8} Ford raises one assignment of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred when it sustained plaintiffs motion to strike testimony, motion to instruct jury, and motion in limine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">{\u00b6 10} In its sole assignment of error, Ford claims that the trial court improperly purged all evidence regarding Ford\u2019s DSB from the case. Ford asserts that the requirement that a vehicle owner resort to a qualified informal dispute-settlement program is an element of the claim and not an administrative remedy. Alternatively, Ford contends that Harris had received timely notice of the dispute resolution mechanism and could not bring a cause of action under R.C. 1345.75 prior to resorting to that dispute resolution process.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 1345.75 establishes a cause of action against any manufacturer who fails to comply with R.C. 1345.72, which addresses the duty of the manufacturer, its agent, or its authorized dealer to conform new motor vehicles to any applicable express warranty by repairing or correcting any nonconformity. However, R.C. 1345.77(B) further provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cIf a qualified informal dispute resolution mechanism exists and the consumer receives timely notification, in writing, of the availability of the mechanism with a description of its operation and effect, the cause of action under section 1345.75 of the Revised Code may not be asserted by the consumer until after the consumer has initially resorted to the informal dispute resolution mechanism. If such a mechanism does not exist, if the consumer is dissatisfied with the decision produced by the mechanism, or if the manufacturer, its agent, or its authorized dealer fails to promptly fulfill the terms determined by the mechanism, the consumer may assert a cause of action under section 1345.75 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 1345.77(A) authorizes the Ohio Attorney General to adopt rules for the establishment and qualification of an informal dispute-resolution (\u201cIDR\u201d) mechanism to provide for the resolution of warranty disputes between the consumer and the manufacturer, its agent, or its authorized dealer. Those rules are set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-4-01 et seq. and 109:4-5-01 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Ford claims that the requirement that a consumer resort to a qualified IDR mechanism is an element of the consumer\u2019s claim and that the failure to first resort to the IDR mechanism is not an affirmative defense subject to waiver if not properly asserted by motion or in an appropriate pleading. Ford argues that the trial court improperly treated the requirement as an \u201cadministrative remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">{\u00b6 15} Certainly, R.C. 1345.77 mandates that a consumer first employ an IDR mechanism if one has been qualified by the Ohio Attorney General and the consumer receives timely written notice thereof. Although we find some appeal to Ford\u2019s argument that compliance with the IDR requirement is a precondition to the accrual of a consumer\u2019s cause of action, we do not agree with Ford that exhaustion of that requirement is an element of a consumer\u2019s claim. Rather, the statutory requirement that a consumer first utilize a qualified IDR mechanism is a procedural matter, setting forth the steps that a consumer must take prior to seeking judicial relief. In other words, the IDR requirement set forth in R.C. 1345.77(B) is properly viewed as an administrative remedy that constitutes a prerequisite to filing a civil action under R.C. 1345.75. Cf. <em>Rose v. Saginaw Cty. </em>(2005), 232 F.R.D. 267 (statutory exhaustion requirement of Prisoner Litigation Reform Act must be raised as an affirmative defense or is waived). This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that resorting to a DSB is required only if one has been qualified by the Ohio Attorney General and if proper written notification thereof has been provided to the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">{\u00b6 16} Exhaustion of administrative remedies is an affirmative defense that must be timely asserted or it is waived. <em>Driscoll v. Austintown Assoc. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 263, 71 O.O.2d 247, 328 N.E.2d 395; <em>Jones v. Chagrin Falls </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 456, 674 N.E.2d 1388. As stated in <em>Jones:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[U]nder our adversarial system of justice it is the responsibility of the party seeking to benefit from the doctrine [of exhaustion of administrative remedies] to raise and argue it. Once raised, it becomes the duty of the trial court to determine upon consideration of the affirmative defenses * * *, whether such action is proper. We do not perceive the obligation of arguing an affirmative defense to be unduly burdensome; it is consistent with the adversarial system of justice, and it protects the judiciary from the erosion of its authority represented by a holding that courts are without fundamental power to hear cases expressly placed within their purview by the General Assembly * * <em>Jones, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 462, 674 N.E.2d 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">{\u00b6 18} Because compliance with R.C. 1345.77(B) is a procedural matter and the failure to comply with that dispute-resolution- mechanism requirement is an affirmative defense, Ford was required to properly raise Harris\u2019s failure to exhaust that administrative remedy. Conversely, Harris was not required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>plead in his complaint that he had pursued a resolution of his warranty dispute through Ford\u2019s DSB as part of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">{\u00b6 19} Next, Ford asserts that even if exhaustion of the informal dispute resolution mechanism was an affirmative defense, it had adequately placed Harris on notice that it was asserting the defense when it alleged that Harris had failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">{\u00b6 20} Civ.R. 8(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cIn pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, want of consideration for a negotiable instrument, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALN\">{\u00b6 22} Although the failure to exhaust administrative remedies is not expressly listed in Civ.R. 8(C) as an affirmative defense, it is well established that it is an affirmative defense. E.g., <em>Jones, </em>supra; <em>Morris v. Morris, </em>Clark App. No. 2003-CA-94, 2004-Ohio-6059, \u00b6 42, 2004 WL 2588108, *5; <em>Shell v. Crain\u2019s Run Water &amp; Sewer Dist. </em>(Jan. 21, 2000), Montgomery App. No. 17961, 2000 WL 43713. Thus, in order to assert the failure to exhaust administrative remedies as \u00e1 defense, it must be clearly and expressly pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">{\u00b6 23} Here, Ford failed to assert Harris\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies in its answer. Although Ford answered Harris\u2019s interrogatory regarding his alleged failure to state a claim by indicating that he had \u201cfailed to pursue alternative dispute resolution through Ford\u2019s Dispute Settlement Board prior to filing suit in this case,\u201d we note that answers to interrogatories were not filed with the court. Moreover, in the joint final pretrial statement, Ford did not indicate that Harris\u2019s failure to pursue a settlement through Ford\u2019s DSB was one of its defenses. Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that Ford had failed to properly raise Harris\u2019s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies, i.e., settlement through Ford\u2019s DSB, and that Ford had thus waived this affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">{\u00b6 24} Citing <em>Covell v. Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(July 2,1998), Montgomery App. No. 16895, 1998 WL 350547, Ford argues that we have permitted the failure to exhaust administrative remedies to be raised as an allegation of failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. While Ford is correct, the motion to dismiss in <em>Covell </em>expressly stated that Coveil had failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Here, Ford\u2019s general averment in its answer that Harris had failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted did not satisfy Civ.R. 8\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>requirement that an affirmative defense be expressly stated. Ford\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">{\u00b6 25} The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">{\u00b6 26} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b645-7\">Grady, P.J., and Brogan, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
