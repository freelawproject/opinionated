In support of the appeal, Upshaw presents the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cI. Because the trial court failed to make the requisite findings pursuant to <em>Sell v. United States </em>[539 U.S. 166, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197 (2003) ], the trial court erred to the Defendant-Appellant\u2019s prejudice in granting the petition to forcefully medicate and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cII. Because Twin Valley failed to file the petition to request that they be permitted to forcefully medicate the Defendant-Appellant, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hold a hearing and render a decision on the request. Thus, the trial court\u2019s decision permitting forceful medication of the Defendant-Appellant must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cIII. The trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant the Defendant-Appellant\u2019s motion to continue and/or motion to bifurcate the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>because the Defendant-Appellant was severely prejudiced by being precluded from having a material and relevant witness testify at the hearing on his behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">{\u00b6 5} After considering the record and applicable law, we find that the first assignment of error has merit. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and this cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">{\u00b6 6} On September 27, 2004, an indictment was filed in Clark County Common Pleas Court, charging Raymond Upshaw with two counts of felonious assault and one count of abduction, all with firearm specifications. Subsequently, on November 12, 2004, Upshaw\u2019s attorney, a public defender, filed a motion asking that Upshaw be examined for competency. The trial court filed an order on March 8, 2005, finding that Upshaw suffered from severe mental disease and was not competent to stand trial. Based on this finding, the court ordered Upshaw to be committed to Twin Valley for competency restoration.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">{\u00b6 7} Upshaw obtained new counsel and appealed from the competency decision. However, we dismissed the appeal on April 13, 2005, for lack of a final, appealable order. At Upshaw\u2019s request, we certified a conflict to the Ohio Supreme Court. The Supreme Court accepted the conflict on September 7, 2005, but has not yet issued a decision. See <em>State v. </em>Upshaw, 106 Ohio St.3d 1501, 2005-Ohio-4605, 833 N.E.2d 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">{\u00b6 8} In the meantime, Upshaw\u2019s counsel, Adelina Hamilton, filed a motion in the trial court on May 19, 2005, seeking to withdraw as defense counsel. The reason given was that Upshaw had said that he wished to terminate Hamilton\u2019s services. An entry granting the motion was filed the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">{\u00b6 9} Around a week later, on or about May 25, 2005, Twin Valley sent the trial judge a letter requesting a court order for forced medication. Although this document had not yet been filed with the clerk, the trial judge set the matter for hearing on June 7, 2005, at 11:00 a.m. On June 2, 2005, Hamilton (who had apparently once again been retained as counsel), filed a motion to reschedule the hearing either for later in the day on June 7 or for another day and time. As grounds, Hamilton explained that she had been scheduled for over five months to take the federal bar examination at 9:30 a.m. on June 7, 2005. Hamilton claimed that she would not be able to take the exam and arrive in Springfield in time for the hearing. She also said that the exam would not be given again until the following December and that if she failed to take the test \u00f3n June 7, she would have to appear pro hac vice every time she wanted to litigate cases in federal court. The trial court overruled the motion, without explanation, on the day that it was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>{\u00b6 10} On the day of the hearing, the trial court said that it had been notified that another attorney in Hamilton\u2019s office was coming to represent Upshaw. Although the court waited until 11:20 a.m., no one appeared on Upshaw\u2019s behalf. The court then chose to start the hearing without counsel for Upshaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">{\u00b6 11} Only one witness (Dr. Bloom, from Twin Valley), testified at the hearing. Shortly after Dr. Bloom began to testify, Hamilton entered the courtroom. At the time, Dr. Bloom had simply answered a few preliminary questions about her background. Bloom then continued to testify. Dr. Bloom said that she had met with Upshaw and that he was psychotic, with delusions. Dr. Bloom also indicated that Upshaw\u2019s psychotic disorder could be helped with multimodal treatment and that her own area of expertise was medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">{\u00b6 12} At this point, attorney John Scaccia also entered the hearing. Like Hamilton, Scaccia was counsel for Upshaw and was present for the rest of the hearing. After Scaccia entered, Dr. Bloom continued to testify. Dr. Bloom indicated that she had not been able to give Upshaw any medications because he had refused to take them. She also said that if medications were administered, a chance existed that Upshaw could be restored to competency. However, she did not discuss any specific medications, did not outline the possible side effects, and did not outline a particular course of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">{\u00b6 13} Before Scaccia began cross-examination, he gave the court a motion for continuance that his office had prepared. In the motion, Upshaw\u2019s attorneys claimed that they had not been notified of the hearing until June 2, 2005, and had not had time to subpoena Upshaw\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Crystal Osborne, due to the short time that remained between finding Osborne and completing the investigation of potential testimony. Apparently, Osborne had told counsel the day before the hearing that she would not be able to attend because she held clinic between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. As a result, the motion requested a brief continuance so that Dr. Osborne\u2019s testimony could be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">{\u00b6 14} In court, Scaccia reiterated that Upshaw desired a continuance. However, Scaccia also suggested that the court could bifurcate the case, since the hearing had already started. The court did not respond to the request, but told Scaccia that he could cross-examine Dr. Bloom if he wished.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">{\u00b6 15} Scaccia then proceeded to conduct a fairly lengthy cross-examination of Dr. Bloom. Near the end of the cross-examination, Scaccia began asking questions directed toward the competency issue, rather than toward the issue of forced medication. At that point, the trial court intervened and stressed that the competency issue would not be revisited. When Scaccia argued that his client was competent at the time of the present hearing, the court directed Scaccia to proceed with questions of the pending witness. Scaccia continued to press the matter with the court, apparently intending to make a record. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>court responded by finding that Scaccia had no further questions for Dr. Bloom. The court then excused Dr. Bloom.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">{\u00b6 16} The state rested without calling further witnesses, and the court asked whether the defense had witnesses. Scaccia indicated that he had intended to call Upshaw\u2019s treating psychiatrist, but that she was not able to appear. Consequently, the court ended the presentation of testimony and also overruled the motion for continuance. The court followed by issuing a ruling on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">{\u00b6 17} In its ruling, the court noted Dr. Bloom\u2019s statement that Upshaw suffered from psychosis. The court found that Dr. Bloom needed considerable latitude to treat Upshaw as she deemed appropriate. In addition, the court concluded that there was evidence indicating that Upshaw was a violent person. In particular, the court relied on the grand-jury indictment, which was based on probable cause to believe that Upshaw had committed felonious assault and abduction with a firearm. Finally, the court noted that Dr. Bloom, not the court, had the expertise to decide which medications were appropriate. Accordingly, the court granted the motion for forced medication and authority to draw blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">{\u00b6 18} Defense counsel immediately asked for a stay, which was overruled. The next day (June 8, 2005), the trial court filed an order granting Twin Valley authority to prescribe any combination of 33 medications listed in \u201cExhibit A,\u201d which was attached to the order. The court had granted Twin Valley authority to draw blood in order to monitor medication levels. Upshaw appealed to our court on June 8, 2005, and also filed a motion for a stay. On June 9, 2005, we granted a stay of the forced-medication order. Subsequently, on June 15, 2005, the trial court filed a nunc pro tunc entry, ordering that the letter and application from Twin Valley be filed and be made a part of the trial court record as of May 25, 2005. This was apparently when the trial court received the letter from Twin Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">{\u00b6 19} After we granted the stay, the stay issue came before us again when we received notice from Twin Valley that Upshaw had been on a hunger strike for a week and had lost 13 pounds. After conferring with attorneys from both sides and with Twin Valley personnel, we modified the stay on November 10, 2005. The modification allowed Twin Valley to treat Upshaw\u2019s physical-health needs as well as any psychiatric conditions that affected his physical health, which had been put at risk by Upshaw\u2019s refusal of nutrition and hydration.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">{\u00b6 20} In the first assignment of error, Upshaw contends that the decision on forced medication should be reversed because the trial court failed to make the findings required by <em>Sell v. United States </em>(2003), 539 U.S. 166, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197. The state has not filed a brief and has, therefore, not responded to Upshaw\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Before discussing <em>Sell, </em>we will examine Ohio law pertaining to forced medication. The Ohio statute authorizing administration of forced medication is R. C. 2945.38(B)(1)(e), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cIf the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, if the chief clinical officer of the hospital or facility, the managing officer of the institution, the director of the program, or the person to which the defendant is committed for treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section determines that medication is necessary to restore the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial, and if the defendant lacks the capacity to give informed consent or refuses medication, the chief clinical officer, managing officer, director, or person to which the defendant is committed for treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment may petition the court for authorization for the involuntary administration of medication. The court shall hold a hearing on the petition within five days of the filing of the petition if the petition was filed in a municipal court or a county court regarding an incompetent defendant charged with a misdemeanor or within ten days of the filing of the petition if the petition was filed in a court of common pleas regarding an incompetent defendant charged with a felony offense. Following the hearing, the court may authorize the involuntary administration of medication or may dismiss the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. 2945.38 does not contain specific standards for deciding whether forced medication should be ordered. According to established authority, individuals have \u201ca \u2018significant\u2019 constitutionally protected \u2018liberty interest\u2019 in \u2018avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sell, </em>539 U.S. at 178, 123 S. Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197, quoting <em>Washington v. Harper </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 210, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178. In <em>Sell, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that because of this liberty interest, the government may involuntarily medicate mentally ill defendants for the purpose of rendering them competent to stand trial \u201conly if the treatment is medically appropriate, is substantially unlikely to have side effects that may undermine the fairness of the trial, and, taking account of less intrusive alternatives, is necessary significantly to further important governmental trial-related interests.\u201d 539 U.S. at 179, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Sell, </em>the Supreme Court also set out further findings that it felt were either stated by or implied in the above standard. The first of these is that \u201ca court must find that <em>important </em>governmental interests are at stake.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 180, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197. In this context, the Supreme Court acknowledged that the government has an important interest in bringing accused individuals to trial. However, the court also stressed that trial courts \u201cmust consider the facts of the individual case in evaluating the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ment\u2019s interest in prosecution,\u201d and that special circumstances may lessen the importance of the government\u2019s interest. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 25} Regarding the remaining findings, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cSecond, the court must conclude that involuntary medication will <em>significantly further </em>those concomitant state interests. It must find that administration of the drugs is substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial. At the same time, it must find that administration of the drugs is substantially unlikely to have side effects that will interfere significantly with the defendant\u2019s ability to assist counsel in conducting a trial defense, thereby rendering the trial unfair. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThird, the court must conclude that involuntary medication is <em>necessary </em>to further those interests. The court must find that any alternative, less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results. * * * And the court must consider less intrusive means for administering the drugs, <em>e.g., </em>a court order to the defendant backed by the contempt power, before considering more intrusive methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cFourth, as we have said, the court must conclude that administration of the drugs is <em>medically appropriate, i.e., </em>in the patient\u2019s best medical interest in light of his medical condition. The specific kinds of drugs at issue may matter here as elsewhere. Different kinds of antipsychotic drugs may produce different side effects and enjoy different levels of success.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) 539 U.S. at 181, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">{\u00b6 29} After applying these factors to the case it was considering, the Supreme Court vacated the order for forced medication. Among other things, the Supreme Court found that lower courts had focused primarily on the defendant\u2019s dangerousness, not on the need to bring him to trial. In this regard, the court stressed:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe failure to focus upon trial competence could well have mattered. Whether a particular drug will tend to sedate a defendant, interfere with communication with counsel, prevent rapid reaction to trial developments, or diminish the ability to express emotions are matters important in determining the permissibility of medication to restore competence, * * * but not necessarily relevant when dangerousness is primarily at issue. We cannot tell whether the side effects of antipsychotic medication were likely to undermine the fairness of a trial * * <em>Sell, </em>539 U.S. at 185-186, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">{\u00b6 31} In the present case, none of the above requirements were followed, nor were the appropriate findings made. As just one example, the court failed to make any findings about the side effects of the proposed medicines. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>also fails to contain evidence about what medications Twin Valley planned to use and the side effects, if any, of those medications. Exhibit A simply lists 33 medications that Twin Valley proposed using, with no indication of what specific medicines or combinations of medicines were going to be administered. And as we said, Dr. Bloom gave no indication of what medicines would be used or their potential side effects. We assume that Upshaw was not going to be given 33 medications. However, even if all these medications were to be used, there is no evidence in the record of their effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">{\u00b6 32} Because the trial court failed to comply with the requirements for ordering forced medication, the first assignment of error has merit and is sustained. This judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">{\u00b6 33} In the second assignment of error, Upshaw claims that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hold a hearing and to issue a decision because Twin Valley failed to file a petition to request forced medication. As noted above, Twin Valley wrote to the trial court, asking for a forced-medication order. The letter was apparently not filed when the trial court received it. However, the trial court \u201cfiled\u201d it as of the date it was received, via a nunc pro tunc entry. Upshaw contends that the nunc pro tunc entry was ineffective because it deprived him of an argument on appeal. In addition, Upshaw argues that backdating the filing is beyond the court\u2019s power to correct clerical mistakes in entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">{\u00b6 34} This assignment has no merit. The trial court could properly treat the Twin Valley letter of May 25, 2005, as a \u201cpetition\u201d under the provisions of R.C. 2945.38. Although the trial court did not file it on May 25, 2005, it did file it nunc pro tunc on June 14, 2005, as filed \u201cnow\u201d for May 25, 2005. This was a proper nunc pro tunc entry because the court did receive the letter or petition on May 25, 2005. Upshaw was given adequate notice of the June 7, 2005 hearing on the forced-medication request. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">{\u00b6 35} In his third assignment, Upshaw contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his request for a continuance to present the testimony of Dr. Osborne, his treating psychiatrist. We agree. Upshaw sought only a brief continuance so that important testimony could be presented. The third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>{\u00b6 36} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings so that Dr. Osborne may offer testimony to assist the court in determining whether the forced-medication request should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b144-5\">Grady, P.J., and Fain, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
