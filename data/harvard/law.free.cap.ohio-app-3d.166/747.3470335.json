McMonagle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Martha Shephard, appeals from the judgment of the common pleas court, which affirmed the finding of the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission (the \u201ccommission\u201d) that she quit her job without just cause and is therefore not entitled to unemployment benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">{\u00b6 2} Shephard filed an application for unemployment compensation with appellee, Director, Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. Appellee issued an initial determination of benefits granting the claim, finding that Shephard quit her employment with just cause due to a medical condition. The employer, Economy Enterprises, Inc., d.b.a. Nielsen\u2019s Stores, appealed this determination; appellee subsequently issued a redetermination that affirmed its earlier decision. The employer appealed the redetermination and the Director transferred jurisdiction to the commission, which assigned the matter to a hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">{\u00b6 3} Shephard and Jack Trombley, Vice-President of Economy Enterprises, Inc., testified at the hearing. Shephard was employed from October 1999 through February 2004 as an assistant manager/cashier at Nielsen\u2019s convenient store in the Diamond Building. Her duties included receiving and putting away deliveries, stocking and cleaning the shelves, and waiting on customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">{\u00b6 4} Shephard testified that when she was hired, she informed Nielsen\u2019s about problems she had with her right knee. In 2001, she submitted a doctor\u2019s statement to Nielsen\u2019s that indicated that she needed two 15-minute breaks each day due to her knee problems. Shephard testified that she was never able to take her required breaks, however, because of the volume of work she was expected to perform. Shephard testified further that the only accommodation her employer ever made for her was to provide her with two milk crates to sit on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>when there were no customers in the store. She admitted, however, that she never told Trombley that she was not getting enough time to sit during the day, even though he visited the store several times each month.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">{\u00b6 5} In September 2003, Shephard began experiencing problems with her right foot. She saw a doctor in October 2003 regarding her condition and learned that she had a heel spur. Shephard admitted that she told Dawn Swartwood, Nielsen\u2019s area manager, that she was having problems with her foot, but did not ask for any special accommodation in light of her condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">{\u00b6 6} On January 14, 2004, Shephard submitted a letter of resignation that stated, \u201cI Martha Shephard will no longer work for Nielsen\u2019s as of Feb. 6, 2004 after 2:30 p.m., due to pay rate and medical reasons. (R. Foot).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">{\u00b6 7} Shephard testified that she quit her job because of her health. According to Shephard, the condition with her foot \u201chad got so unbearable, it was kind of hard for me to even stand or walk on it. I couldn\u2019t perform the duties of standing * * * which that job called for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">{\u00b6 8} The record indicates that prior to February 6, 2004, the effective date of her resignation, Shephard presented no medical evidence to Nielsen\u2019s indicating that she was physically unable to work at her job. Instead, the record reflects that Shephard submitted a letter dated January 28, 2004 from Dr. Robert T. Bair, in which Dr. Bair advised that Shephard was examined on January 28, 2004, and cleared to return to work as of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">{\u00b6 9} After filing her claim, Shephard submitted a letter to appellee from Dr. Carl Robson. The letter, which was dated February 17, 2004, indicated that Dr. Robson was treating Shephard for degenerative arthritis and plantar fasciitis and that he had recommended that she quit her job because it involved \u201cstanding 8 hours, with much walking\u201d and \u201cshe is unable to continue with this work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">{\u00b6 10} Shephard testified that her resignation letter mentioned her pay rate because she was having a hard time paying her medical bills out-of-pocket. She testified that \u201ca raise would have helped me some,\u201d but insisted that she quit her job because of her health, not because of the pay. Shephard admitted that she had asked Trombley for a raise, but had never told him that she needed a raise due to her medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">{\u00b6 11} Trombley testified that when Shephard informed Nielsen\u2019s in 2001 of her knee problems, the company made arrangements to accommodate her by allowing her to sit during the day, even though the company generally does not like its employees to sit because of the image it presents to customers. Trombley testified further that the company would have been willing to make other accommodations for Shephard, but she never asked him for any accommodation regarding her foot problems. He admitted, however, that it would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>futile for Shephard to ask for a position where she did not have to be on her feet at all, because \u201cwe don\u2019t have positions for that.\u201d Finally, Trombley testified that Shephard asked him about a raise several times, but never mentioned that her requests were related to her medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">{\u00b6 12} The hearing officer subsequently issued a written decision modifying the Director\u2019s redetermination and concluding that Shephard had quit her employment without just cause. He stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cClaimant contends that she quit her employment with Economy Enterprises because she was no longer able to perform her duties as an Assistant Manager as the result of a heel spur on [her] right foot. The evidence, however, indicates that claimant was more concerned with her rate of pay than her foot. While claimant discussed her pay with the Vice-President on multiple occasions, she never broached the subject of accommodations with him before resigning.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cEven if her foot was the principal reason for claimant\u2019s resignation, by failing to inquire about accommodations for her condition, claimant did not take all of the steps reasonably available to her to maintain her employment before quitting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">{\u00b6 15} In light of his finding that Shephard quit without just cause, the hearing officer concluded that she was not entitled to unemployment compensation. In addition, he concluded that Dr. Robson had indicated that Shephard was unable to work and, accordingly, disallowed her claim for the weeks following her resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">{\u00b6 16} The commission subsequently disallowed Shephard\u2019s request for review. Shephard then filed an appeal with the common pleas court, which affirmed the commission\u2019s decision to deny unemployment benefits to Shephard on the basis that she had quit her employment without just cause. Shephard timely appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">{\u00b6 17} In her first assignment of error, Shephard contends that the trial court erred in affirming the denial of unemployment benefits because she had quit her job with just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">{\u00b6 18} Unlike most administrative appeals in which we employ an abuse-of-discretion standard, see <em>Lorain City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 260-261, 533 N.E.2d 264, our standard of review on appeal from a decision of the commission is the same as that of the common pleas court. This court \u201cmay reverse the board\u2019s determination only if it is unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Tzangas, Plakas &amp; Mannos v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Servs. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 694, 697, 653 N.E.2d 1207. In making this determination, we must give deference to the commission in its role as finder of fact. <em>Irvine v. Unemp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number><em>Comp. Bd. of Review </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 15, 18, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587. We may not reverse the commission\u2019s decision simply because \u201creasonable minds might reach different conclusions.\u201d Id. On close questions, when the board might reasonably decide either way, we have no authority to upset the agency\u2019s decision. Id. Instead, our review is limited to determining whether the commission\u2019s decision is unlawful, unreasonable, or totally lacking in competent, credible evidence to support it. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\"> {\u00b6 19} R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a) provides that an individual may not obtain unemployment benefits if he \u201cquit his work without just cause.\u201d Traditionally, just cause is that which, to an ordinarily intelligent person, is a justifiable reason for doing or not doing a particular act. <em>Irvine, </em>supra, at 17, 482 N.E.2d 587. The determination of whether just cause exists depends on the \u201cunique factual considerations\u201d of a particular case and is, therefore, primarily an issue for the trier of fact. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">{\u00b6 20} Initially, we note that it is well, established that the burden of proof in an unemployment compensation case is on the employee to prove that she was discharged by her employer without just cause, or quit work with just cause, and is therefore entitled to unemployment benefits under R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a). Accordingly, we reject Shephard\u2019s contention that the burden in this case was on her employer to demonstrate that she quit without just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">{\u00b6 21} We also reject Shephard\u2019s argument that the hearing officer was required to give more weight to her testimony than Trombley\u2019s because R.C. 4141.46 provides that the provisions of the Unemployment Compensation Act are to be liberally construed. \u201cThe agency and the court have a duty to construe the statute liberally for the claimant\u2019s benefit.\u201d <em>Dailey v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Seros. </em>(Jan. 22,1987), Cuyahoga App. No. 52633, 1987 WL 5642. \u201cHowever, neither the agency nor the court has a duty to construe the facts more favorably to either party.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">{\u00b6 22} Finally, we reject Shephard\u2019s argument that Trombley\u2019s testimony should have been disregarded because it was hearsay. It is well settled that a referee may use hearsay evidence in making unemployment compensation decisions because, as a general rule, administrative agencies are not bound by the strict rules of evidence applied in- a court. <em>Cully v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Seros. </em>(Oct. 13,1994), Cuyahoga App. No. 66187,1994 WL 568342.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">{\u00b6 23} Moreover, Trombley\u2019s testimony was not all hearsay. Trombley\u2019s testimony about his conversations with Shephard regarding her requests for a raise was obviously based on his personal knowledge of these conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Turning to the merits of her claim, Shephard argues that she quit her job with just cause because she was in intense pain and unable to stand on her feet, as required by her job. She argues that \u201cany ordinary, intelligent person experiencing the same pain and discomfort would have felt driven to leave the job,\u201d as she did. She argues further that she quit with just cause because her employer knew of her condition, but failed to accommodate her.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">{\u00b6 25} The record is clear that Shephard was indeed experiencing significant pain as a result of her arthritis and heel spur. The record is also clear, however, that before she quit, Shephard never asked Nielsen\u2019s to accommodate the condition with her heel spur.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[G]enerally[,] employees who experience problems in their working conditions must make reasonable efforts to attempt to solve the problem before leaving their employment. Essentially, an employee must notify the employer of the problem and request it be resolved, and thus give the employer an opportunity to solve the problem before the employee quits the job; those employees who do not provide such notice ordinarily will be deemed to quit without just cause and, therefore will not be entitled to unemployment benefits.\u201d <em>DiGiannantoni v. Wedgewater Animal Hosp., Inc. </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 300, 307, 671 N.E.2d 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 27} Employees who quit for medical reasons are no exception to the general rule. As the Ohio Supreme Court held in <em>Irvine, </em>19 Ohio St.3d 15, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587:</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cAn employee\u2019s voluntary resignation on the basis of health problems is without just cause within the meaning of R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a) when the employee is physically capable of maintaining a position of employment with the employer, but fails to carry her burden of proving that she inquired of her employer whether employment opportunities were available which conformed to her physical capabilities and same were not offered to her by the employer.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">{\u00b6 29} Here, the record is clear that Shephard never gave Nielsen\u2019s an opportunity to make any special arrangements for her before she quit her job. She admitted that although she told Nielsen\u2019s area manager about the problems with her heel spur, she never requested that Nielsen\u2019s make any special accommodation for her in light of her condition. Moreover, although she spoke with Trombley several times about her need for a raise, she never told him about the medical problems with her right foot. Furthermore, although Dr. Robson had apparently recommended that Shephard quit her job, Shephard did not provide any medical documentation regarding the severity of her condition to Nielsen\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>{\u00b6 30} <em>\u201cIrvine </em>found that an ordinarily intelligent person with a health problem would not quit his or her employment without first notifying his or her employer of the problem and thus giving the employer an opportunity to make suitable arrangements.\u201d <em>DiGiannantoni, </em>109 Ohio App.3d at 307, 671 N.E.2d 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">{\u00b6 31} Because Shephard failed to establish that she had notified Nielsen\u2019s of her problem and given it an opportunity to make suitable arrangements for her before she quit, we find that the commission\u2019s decision was not unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">{\u00b6 32} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">{\u00b6 33} In her second assignment of error, Shephard argues that the trial court erred in affirming the hearing officer\u2019s decision that she was unavailable for work in the weeks following her resignation and therefore not entitled to unemployment compensation.- Our resolution of Shephard\u2019s first assignment of error renders this assignment of error moot and therefore we need not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">{\u00b6 34} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b795-10\">Cooney, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b795-11\">Kilbane, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b795-12\">Mary Eileen Kilbane, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AnV\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">{\u00b6 35} I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion and would reverse the judgment of the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">{\u00b6 36} I agree with the majority that an individual may not obtain unemployment benefits if the employee quits work without just cause. R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a). \u201cJust cause\u201d is a justifiable reason for doing or not doing a particular act, and is measured by an ordinarily intelligent person standard. <em>Peyton v. Sun T.V. &amp; Appliances </em>(1975), 44 Ohio App.2d 10, 73 O.O.2d 8, 335 N.E.2d 751. \u201c \u2018There is, of course, not a slide-rule definition of just cause. Essentially, each case must be considered upon its particular merits. Traditionally, just cause, in the statutory sense, is that which, to an ordinarily intelligent person, is a justifiable reason for doing or not doing a particular act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Irvine v. Unemp. Comp. Bd. of Review </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 15, 17, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587, quoting <em>Peyton, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-16\">{\u00b6 37} When determining whether an employee quit work without just cause, courts must analyze the particular circumstances of the case in conjunction with the legislative purpose underlying the Unemployment Compensation Act. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>{\u00b6 38} As a general rule, employees experiencing problems in their working conditions must notify the employer of the problem, request that it be resolved, and give the employer an opportunity to solve the problem before a court will find just cause for quitting work. <em>King v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 664, 669-670, 679 N.E.2d 1158. \u201cAn employee who resigns before providing her employer with a reasonable opportunity to correct offensive conduct in the workplace risks quitting her employment without just cause.\u201d <em>Krawczyszyn v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Servs. </em>(1989), 54 Ohio App.3d 35, 37, 560 N.E.2d 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">{\u00b6 39} However, courts do not always require an employee to notify his or her employer if the circumstances justify the employee\u2019s choice not to notify the employer of the problem. <em>DiGiannantoni v. Wedgewater Animal Hosp., Inc. </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 300, 308, 671 N.E.2d 1378. For instance, if an employee notifies the employer of a problem and requests that the employer remedy the situation and the employer fails to do so, the employee may be relieved of her duty to further pursue internal remedies. <em>Krawczyszyn, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">{\u00b6 40} Moreover, although R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a) disqualifies a claimant who \u201cquit his work without just cause\u201d from collecting unemployment compensation benefits, R.C. 4141.46 requires that the unemployment compensation laws be liberally construed in favor of the applicant. See, also, R.C. 4141.46; R.C. 4141.29(J); and <em>Vespremi v. Giles </em>(1980), 68 Ohio App.2d 91, 22 O.O.3d 102, 427 N.E.2d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">{\u00b6 41} Shortly after beginning work- in 1999, Shephard complained of knee problems that required her to take breaks and sit often. In response, she was given two milk crates to use as a chair during any break periods. Although Shephard was able to use the milk crates to sit on during work hours, she refutes any statement that after complaining of a knee injury in 1999, she was given a \u201cchair\u201d to use during working hours. Shephard testified that although she provided her then area manager, Jerry Hauser, with an excuse from Dr. Bilfield in November 2001 requiring two 15-minute breaks, she could only intermittently use the two crates to sit, and could never take scheduled breaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">{\u00b6 42} In September 2003, Shephard began having additional medical difficulties and was experiencing severe pain in her foot, which was ultimately diagnosed as a heel spur. After receiving the diagnosis, Shephard informed her area manager, Dawn Swartwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">{\u00b6 43} Shephard also testified that she gave Swartwood two letters, one from Dr. Bair and one from Dr. Robson stating that she suffered from heel spurs. Trombley\u2019s later testimony supported both this assertion and Shephard\u2019s earlier medical complaints when he admitted receiving doctors\u2019 statements from She<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>phard regarding her knee in 2001 and 2002, and regarding her heel in January 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">{\u00b6 44} There have been repeated assertions that either Shephard did not inform her employer of her need for an accommodation or conversely, that when she did inform her employer of a medical need, the request was met with a sufficient accommodation. Upon direct questioning from Trombley at Shephard\u2019s hearing, Trombley stated, \u201cAnd we have told you at times, because it\u2019s certainly in \"writing from your doctor, but even since then, that even though we don\u2019t provide a seat per se, the milk crat.es, which is what most of the employees end up doing anyway, were there for you to take breaks with if you needed them; is that right?\u201d Shephard agreed that the milk crates were there if she needed them, but during the course of her duties, she rarely had a chance to use the crates.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">{\u00b6 45} The record also contains a March 17, 2004 e-mail from Jack Trombley stating, \u201c[Martha] told us she was supposed to stay off of her feet occasionally and we told her she could sit (not allowed by other personnel) whenever she felt it necessary.\u201d He also stated that, \u201c[d]espite our willingness to work with Martha, she voluntarily quit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">{\u00b6 46} Further, in response to the ODJFS\u2019s request for information, Trombley stated, \u201cThe most recent medical problems appeared to be her foot. She had previously and through most of her time with us, told us about \u2018leg\u2019 problems (some documentation in file concerning her knees). We had accommodated her by allowing her to sit as necessary behind the sales counter (not allowed with other employees).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">{\u00b6 47} While Trombley repeatedly argued that the company would have been willing to help Shephard in any way, in the over four years of her employment and despite receiving several medical reports, Shephard was only offered two milk crates to use as a chair. If such treatment qualifies as \u201creasonable accommodation,\u201d what other indication is there that if Shephard had continued to complain she would have received something greater than milk crates?</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">{\u00b6 48} It is also noteworthy that after Shephard filed her claim for workers\u2019 compensation, the initial examiner specifically found that Shephard quit her employment due to personal injury/illness. The examiner found that Shephard provided documentation to her employer, that her employer knew of her medical problems, and that Shephard\u2019s personal physician had advised her to resign. After making these findings, the examiner determined that Shephard had quit with just cause. Although the majority focuses on the subsequent denials of Shephard\u2019s claim, initially, this was not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>{\u00b6 49} For these reasons, I believe that Shephard\u2019s notification to her employer of her continued medical problems, coupled with her employer\u2019s unwillingness to provide her with anything other than a make-shift chair, qualified as a resignation with just cause. I would, therefore, reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
