The record shows that Lopez entered a no-contest plea after the denial of his motion to suppress evidence. The trial court accepted the plea and found Lopez guilty based on the facts presented by the state. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">{\u00b6 2} The evidence presented at the suppression hearing showed that on March 11, 2003, Sergeant Gregory Morgan of the Regional Enforcement Narcotics Unit (\u201cRENU\u201d) was patrolling Interstate 74 just east of the Indiana border. The purpose of his patrol was to help stop drug trafficking on the highway. Agents Thomas Canada, Christopher Arnold, and Rob Shircliff, who were all in uniform and driving marked police cars, were assisting Morgan that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">{\u00b6 3} Morgan observed a gray Chevrolet Impala in the high-speed lane following a Budget rental van so closely that he originally believed that the van could have been towing the Impala. He decided to stop the Impala for following the van too closely. As he approached the two vehicles near a truck weigh station, the Impala changed lanes, going into the right lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">{\u00b6 4} As the two vehicles approached the entrance ramp from the weigh station, a truck was entering the highway. The driver of the van, which was still in the left lane, seemed to be startled by the truck entering the highway and swerved sharply to the left, partially going over the berm lane lines. The van then swerved back to the right over the marked lane line, but overcompensated and almost collided with the truck to its right.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">{\u00b6 5} After observing these movements by the van, Morgan decided to stop the van instead of the Impala. He radioed to Agent Arnold to stop the Impala for following the van too closely. Arnold followed the Impala, which then committed several lane violations. Arnold testified that drug traffickers on the highway frequently travel in tandem and that one car would often commit traffic violations to distract police officers\u2019 attention from the vehicle actually carrying the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Morgan activated his lights and siren. Although the van pulled over to the berm and continued for a long time, it eventually stopped. The van had no rear windows. Before his approach on foot, Morgan could not see the driver or determine the number of occupants in the van. As he approached it from the passenger side, he detected an overwhelming odor of carpet freshener, which he described as \u201calmost sickening.\u201d He testified that carpet freshener was a method often used by drug dealers to mask the odor of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 7} Lopez was the driver of the van. Morgan took Lopez\u2019s driver\u2019s license and found that he had no criminal record. When asked about his erratic driving, Lopez stated that he was not used to driving the van. He also stated that he was traveling from Chicago to Cincinnati to sell boxes, although he later claimed to be traveling from Indianapolis. He did not know the name of the person he was going to meet in Cincinnati, but he stated that he expected that person to call him when he got closer. Morgan felt Lopez\u2019s inability to answer simple questions about his activities, along with the strong odor of carpet freshener, was suspicious. Lopez did not have the rental papers for the van. He told Morgan he was traveling alone, and he became very nervous when Morgan questioned him about the contents of the van and mentioned the possibility of a drug dog being brought to the scene to sniff the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">{\u00b6 8} Meanwhile, Agent Arnold had stopped the Impala, driven by Ernest Hollingsworth. As Arnold approached the car, he detected an odor of raw marijuana. Despite Hollingsworth\u2019s denial of any criminal record, Arnold discovered that he had an extensive record of drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">{\u00b6 9} Arnold had with him his drug-sniffing dog, Bo. Bo indicated the presence of drugs in the Impala. Agent Canada arrived to help with the stop. Inside the Impala, Canada found the rental documents for both the Impala and the van, which were both in Hollingsworth\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">{\u00b6 10} Morgan asked Arnold to bring Bo to his location to determine whether drugs were in the van. Lopez had previously refused to consent to a search of the van\u2019s cargo compartment. Bo indicated that drugs were present in the van. A search of the van resulted in the discovery of approximately 700 pounds of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">{\u00b6 11} Lopez now presents four assignments of error for review. Before addressing the merits of those assignments of error, we note that Lopez\u2019s original attorney in this appeal was granted permission to withdraw after he had filed a brief on Lopez\u2019s behalf. His newly appointed attorney has filed a \u201csupplemental\u201d brief in which he has relied upon the original briefs statements of fact, but has raised his own assignments of error. Although Lopez filed a pro se motion to strike the original brief, this court did not rule on that motion. Nevertheless, the assignments of error in the original brief were largely the same as those in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>supplemental brief. Consequently, we discuss only the assignments of error in the supplemental brief in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">{\u00b6 12} In his first assignment of error, Lopez contends that the stop of his vehicle violated his Fourth Amendment rights. He argues that the police officers lacked \u201cprobable cause\u201d to stop his vehicle. This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\"> {\u00b6 13} An investigative stop is a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment that must be supported by objective justification. <em>State v. Andrews </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 86, 87, 565 N.E.2d 1271; <em>State v. Neu </em>(Mar. 3, 2000), 1st Dist. No. 990552, 2000 WL 238098. The standard is not probable cause but reasonable suspicion, which is less demanding. <em>State v. Lowman </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 831, 837, 613 N.E.2d 692; <em>State v. Moore, </em>6th Dist. No. H-02-001, 2002-Ohio-4476, 2002 WL 1998447, \u00b6 10-11. See, also, <em>State v. Kiefer, </em>1st Dist. No. C-030205, 2004-Ohio-5054, 2004 WL 2244553, \u00b6 11-12 and 17-19. The police officers must point to specific and articulable facts that, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 54 Ohio St.3d at 87, 565 N.E.2d 1271, quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889. The standard is objective: would the facts available to the officers at the moment of the seizure have warranted an individual of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate? <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 54 Ohio St.3d at 87, 565 N.E.2d 1271; <em>State v. Black </em>(Dec. 31, 1998), 1st Dist. No. C-970874, 1998 WL 906351.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">{\u00b6 14} Specifically, in relation to automobiles, if there is a reasonable and articulable suspicion that an automobile or its occupants are subject to seizure for a violation of the law, stopping that automobile and detaining its occupants are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Delaware v. Prouse </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 648, 663, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660. A court determines the validity of an investigative stop by looking at the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Freeman </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 291, 18 O.O.3d 472, 414 N.E.2d 1044, paragraph two of the syllabus. An officer\u2019s observation of a traffic violation or erratic driving justifies an investigative stop. <em>Moore, </em>supra, at \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Pence </em>(July 29, 1996), 12th Dist. No. CA95-09-020, 1996 WL 421764. See, also, <em>State v. Robinette </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 234, 239, 685 N.E.2d 762; <em>State v. Evans </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 405, 407, 618 N.E.2d 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">{\u00b6 15} In this case, the police officers saw Lopez swerve far to the left, almost driving off the berm and into the grass median, and then overcompensate to the right to the point where he almost hit a truck. As the trial court noted, the testimony showed that Lopez had violated R.C. 4511.33, which requires vehicles to travel in marked lanes, and R.C. 4511.202, which prohibits operating a vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>without reasonable control. Thus, the officers could point to specific, articulable facts showing that Lopez was subject to seizure for violating the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">{\u00b6 16} Lopez\u2019s erratic driving went well beyond the slight weaving and \u201cinsubstantial drifts\u201d in the cases Lopez has cited. See <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 37, 663 N.E.2d 675; <em>State v. Drogi </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 466, 645 N.E.2d 153; <em>State v. Gullett </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 138, 604 N.E.2d 176. Further, those cases are no longer valid precedent. See <em>State v. Hodge, </em>147 Ohio App.3d 550, 2002-Ohio-3053, 771 N.E.2d 331, \u00b6 11-26; <em>State v. Hicks, </em>7th Dist. No. 01 CO 42, 2002-Ohio-3207, 2002 WL 1396802, \u00b6 15-34; <em>State v. Moeller </em>(Oct. 23, 2000), 12th Dist. No. CA99-07-128, 2000 WL 1577287. Under the circumstances, the stop of Lopez\u2019s vehicle did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights, and we overrule his first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">{\u00b6 17} In his second assignment of error, Lopez contends that his continued detention after the initial stop and the use of a drug-sniffing dog violated his Fourth Amendment rights. He argues that the search and seizure were unreasonable in the absence of an individual suspicion of wrongdoing. This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">{\u00b6 18} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201c[w]hen a police officer\u2019s objective justification to continue detention of a person stopped for a traffic violation for the purpose of searching the person\u2019s vehicle is not related to the purpose of the original stop, and when that continued detention is not based on any articulable facts giving rise to a suspicion of some illegal activity justifying an extension of the detention, the continued detention to conduct a search constitutes an illegal seizure.\u201d <em>Robinette, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 234, 685 N.E.2d 762, at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">{\u00b6 19} In this case, the police could point to specific, articulable facts showing that Lopez may have been violating the law, which justified his continued detention. One of the first things the officer noticed upon approaching the van was the overwhelming odor of carpet freshener, which, in his experience, was often used by drug dealers to mask the odor of drugs. A court reviewing a police officer\u2019s actions must give due weight to the officer\u2019s experience and training and view the evidence as those in law enforcement would understand it. <em>Andrews, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 88, 565 N.E.2d 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">{\u00b6 20} Further, Lopez was evasive in answering simple questions. The Impala had been closely following the van. As soon as the police showed an interest in the van, the Impala quickly sped away and committed several lane violations. The officers knew that drug dealers would often use another vehicle to distract police from the vehicle carrying the drugs. Based on these facts, the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>officers\u2019 continued detention of Lopez did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">{\u00b6 21} Further, if a vehicle is lawfully detained, an exterior sniff by a drug dog is not a search within the meaning of the United States or. Ohio Constitution. <em>United States v. Place </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 696, 707, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110; <em>In the Matter of Dengg </em>(1999), 132 Ohio App.3d 360, 365, 724 N.E.2d 1255; <em>State v. Bordieri, </em>6th Dist. No. L-04-1321, 2005-Ohio-4727, 2005 WL 2174652, \u00b6 22; <em>State v. Morales, </em>5th Dist. No. 2004 CA 68, 2005-Ohio-4714, 2005 WL 2175144, \u00b6 68. Police need not have a reasonable suspicion of drug-related activity before subjecting an otherwise lawfully detained vehicle to a drug sniff. <em>Dengg </em>at 365, 724 N.E.2d 1255; <em>Bordieri </em>at \u00b6 22. Because Lopez\u2019s vehicle was lawfully detained, the dog\u2019s sniff of his vehicle did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights. See <em>United States v. Foreman </em>(C.A.4, 2004), 369 F.3d 776, 781-786.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">{\u00b6 22} Under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement, police may conduct a warrantless search of an entire vehicle if the police officers have probable cause to believe that they will discover evidence of a crime. <em>United States v. Ross </em>(1982), 456 U.S. 798, 800-801, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572; <em>State v. Moore </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 47, 51, 734 N.E.2d 804; <em>Dengg, </em>132 Ohio App.3d at 365, 724 N.E.2d 1255. Once a properly trained dog indicates the odor of drugs in a lawfully detained vehicle, police have probable cause to search the vehicle. Id. at 366, 724 N.E.2d 1255; <em>Bordieri </em>at \u00b6 22; <em>Morales, </em>supra, at \u00b6 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 23} In this case, the dog\u2019s quick and decisive alert to drugs in the vehicle would alone have provided probable cause to search it. Certainly, the dog\u2019s alert, together with the tandem driving of the van and Impala, the odor of carpet freshener, and Lopez\u2019s evasiveness and nervousness, provided probable cause for the search of the van. Consequently, we find no violation of Lopez\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, and we overrule his second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">{\u00b6 24} In his third assignment of error, Lopez contends that the trial court erred by admitting testimony about the drug-detection dog\u2019s sniff of the van. He argues that the state failed to prove the dog\u2019s qualifications or that his handler was properly certified. This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">{\u00b6 25} As we have previously stated, an alert from a properly trained drug-detection dog provides probable cause to search a vehicle. <em>Dengg, </em>132 Ohio App.3d at 366, 724 N.E.2d 1255; <em>Bordieri, </em>6th Dist. No. L-04-1321, 2005-Ohio-4727, 2005 WL 2174652, at \u00b6 22: <em>Morales, </em>5th Dist. No. 2004 CA 68, 2005-Ohio-4714, 2005 WL 2175144, at \u00b6 68. Some disagreement exists among courts about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>what evidence is necessary to show that a dog is reliable and properly trained. Nevertheless, the majority hold that the state can establish reliability by presenting evidence of the dog\u2019s training and certification, which can be testimonial or documentary. Once the state establishes reliability, the defendant can attack the dog\u2019s' \u201ccredibility\u201d by evidence relating to training procedures, certification standards, and real-world reliability. <em>State v. Nguyen, </em>157 Ohio App.3d 482, 2004-Ohio-2879, 811 N.E.2d 1180, \u00b6 22-55; <em>State v. Calhoun </em>(May 3, 1995), 9th Dist. No. 94CA005824, 1995 WL 255929; <em>State v. Knight </em>(C.P.1997), 83 Ohio Misc.2d 79, 86, 679 N.E.2d 758; <em>United States v. Diaz </em>(C.A.6, 1994), 25 F.3d 392, 394-396. We agree with the reasoning of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 26} Lopez seems to argue that the state must present evidence on every requirement for training and certification of dogs and handlers in the Ohio Administrative Code. See Ohio Adm.Code 109:2-7-03 and 109:2-7-05. We disagree. In this case, the state submitted Arnold\u2019s and Bo\u2019s training certificates into evidence, as well as a letter from the training school showing that Arnold and Bo had passed the required courses. Lopez argues that these documents were inadmissible into evidence for various reasons. Even if they were inadmissible, Arnold testified that he and Bo were certified and that they went through the certification process every two years. He also testified regarding the training courses that he had taken with Bo. That evidence was sufficient to meet the state\u2019s burden of showing that the dog was reliable. Lopez could then have presented evidence that the proper procedures for training and certification in the administrative code were not followed. In fact, he cross-examined Arnold fairly extensively about Bo\u2019s training and reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 27} The trial court found that the dog was properly certified and that he was reliable. Because that finding was based on competent, credible evidence, this court must accept it. <em>State v. Brewster, </em>1st Dist. Nos. C-030024 and C-030025, 2004-Ohio-2993, 2004 WL 1284008, \u00b6 22. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to exclude testimony about the dog, and we overrule Lopez\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 28} In his fourth assignment of error, Lopez contends that the trial court erred in accepting his no-contest plea. At the plea hearing, Lopez stated that his due-process rights had been ignored and that he felt that he had no redress for those violations. He argues that his statements indicated that he wished to \u201cestablish his trial rights.\u201d This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">{\u00b6 29} If a defendant does not make a plea voluntarily, enforcement of that plea is unconstitutional. <em>State v. Engle </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 525, 527, 660 N.E.2d 450; <em>State v. Gordon, </em>149 Ohio App.3d 237, 2002-Ohio-2761, 776 N.E.2d 1135, \u00b6 16. A plea is voluntary if it \u201crepresents a voluntary and intelligent choice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.\u201d <em>Gordon, </em>supra, at \u00b6 17, quoting <em>North Carolina v. Alford </em>(1970), 400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162. The \u201cmotivational niceties\u201d of a plea are not an element of inquiry required of a trial court before it accepts the plea. The court\u2019s inquiry is whether the accused, no matter what his motivations, knows and understands the legal implication of waiving his statutory and constitutional rights. No violation of rights occurs unless the record shows from the totality of the circumstances that the accused\u2019s plea has not been intelligently and voluntarily made. <em>State v. Holder </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 486, 493, 646 N.E.2d 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 30} The record shows that the trial court initially accepted Lopez\u2019s no-contest plea. When the court asked Lopez if he wished to make a statement in mitigation of sentence, Lopez stated, \u201cSince my being stopped, I have had several problems as far as the issues concerning the due process. * * * There are a lot of things that, because of the way the cases have been set up in these courts, that I\u2019m not able to challenge.\u201d He discussed how he believed that the police officers had perjured themselves and that the drug task force involved in his stop had exhibited a pattern of inappropriate behavior. He added, \u201cI haven\u2019t had the opportunity to say anything since I have been here and it\u2019s not been in my best interest anyhow, other than this, and I don\u2019t expect it to be so much as acknowledged, but I did want to make at least that statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 31} Then, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m not sure I can accept this plea. What\u2019s he saying he\u2019s not been granted any due process rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cMR. GOLDBERG [Lopez\u2019s counsel]: * * * I believe he\u2019s addressing the suppression issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cTHE COURT: Is that what you\u2019re talking about\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cMR. GOLDBERG: The stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cTHE COURT: \u2014or something else?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cMR. GOLDBERG: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">{\u00b6 39} The court asked Lopez about the due-process violation that he believed had occurred. Lopez contended that when he was initially arrested, he was placed in a psychiatric unit in the jail, which he believed was a ploy to keep him from having access to the public and to his attorney. This exchange followed:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cMR. GOLDBERG: Judge, these issues really have nothing to do with the plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Right, correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>{\u00b6 42} \u201cTHE COURT: There\u2019s a statement on the record that he\u2019s been denied due process and I\u2019m not going to let that go, I want him to explain what he\u2019s\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I would be happy to, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cMR. GOLDBERG: He\u2019s not denying the facts in the indictment?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No, I\u2019m not.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cMR. GOLDBERG: Is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">{\u00b6 48} Thus, the record demonstrates that Lopez understood that by entering a no-contest plea he was admitting the facts in the indictment and that his \u201cdue process\u201d issues were related to matters decided by the court in overruling his motion to suppress or to matters that were irrelevant to the plea. Lopez did not waive the issues related to the denial of his motion to suppress by pleading no contest, and he has actually raised those issues on appeal. See Crim.R. 12(1); <em>State v. Feliciano, </em>11th Dist. No. 2004-L-205, 2006-Ohio-1678, 2006 WL 847125, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">{\u00b6 49} Our review of the record shows that the trial court strictly complied with the provisions of Crim.R. 11(C) and correctly informed Lopez of the constitutional rights enumerated in <em>Boykin v. Alabama </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274, that he would be waiving by pleading no contest. The court also substantially complied with the rule in all other respects. See <em>State v. Ballard </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 473, 477-481, 20 O.O.3d 397, 423 N.E.2d 115; <em>State v. McCann </em>(1997), 120 Ohio App.3d 505, 507-508, 698 N.E.2d 470. The trial court conducted a meaningful dialogue to ensure that Lopez\u2019s plea was made knowingly and voluntarily. Consequently, the trial court did not err in accepting his plea. We overrule Lopez\u2019s fourth assignment of error and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-13\">Hildebrandt and Painter, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
