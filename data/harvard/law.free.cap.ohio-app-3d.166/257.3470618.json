On June 2, 2003, attorneys for Matthew and for Barbara Buddendeck, Matthew\u2019s guardian ad litem, filed separate motions asking that Angela be ordered to show cause why she should not be found in contempt for preventing Kenneth\u2019s visitation and counseling sessions with Matthew. Angela was personally served with the motions and a notice of hearing on June 2, 2003. The contempt hearing was scheduled for June 6, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">{\u00b6 3} At the June 6, 2003 hearing, Angela told the magistrate that she had retained an attorney, who was unable to attend because of a prior, conflicting obligation, and she requested a continuance to permit her attorney to attend to represent her. The magistrate granted Angela\u2019s request for a continuance with respect to the relief requested on the contempt charges. However, the magistrate took testimony concerning Angela\u2019s alleged refusal to allow visitation between Matthew and Kenneth. Based on the evidence presented, the magistrate found that clear and convincing evidence demonstrated that it was in Matthew\u2019s best interests that his interim temporary custody be awarded to his paternal grandmother. The magistrate granted Angela unsupervised visitation and Kenneth supervised visitation with Matthew.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">{\u00b6 4} In order to effectuate the temporary custody order, the magistrate directed police to remove Matthew from Angela\u2019s care. However, Angela refused to reveal Matthew\u2019s location and, following questioning by the magistrate and the juvenile court, Angela was found in direct contempt for her refusal and was sentenced to serve a weekend in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">{\u00b6 5} Angela filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Her objections are not in the record before us. While those objections were pending, the parties entered into an agreed entry that was filed on January 23, 2004. Pursuant to the agreed entry, custody of Matthew was restored to Angela and the pending contempt charges were continued until further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">{\u00b6 6} On April 19, 2004, the juvenile court overruled Angela\u2019s objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision. Angela filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred in providing proper service of notice of hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Angela argues that the June 2, 2003 notice served on her to appear before the magistrate to defend against the pending contempt charges on June 6, 2003, allowed insufficient time for her new counsel to attend the contempt hearing. As a result, she was denied her right to due process of law in connection with the order of temporary custody, which was awarded to Matthew\u2019s grandmother, and the resulting finding of direct contempt based on Angela\u2019s refusal to reveal Matthew\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 9} The traditional due-process requirements of notice and opportunity to be heard apply to contempt proceedings in the juvenile court. <em>In re Rinehart </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 318,10 OBR 523, 462 N.E.2d 448. When Angela objected to the short notice of the June 6, 2003 hearing, the magistrate continued the proceedings on the indirect contempt charges that had been alleged, avoiding any prejudice to Angela with respect to those charges that may have resulted from the short notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">{\u00b6 10} Nevertheless, because of the allegations that were made in support of the contempt charges, the magistrate proceeded, without any prior notice, to take evidence relating to the issue of temporary custody and Matthew\u2019s best interest. The magistrate was authorized by Juv.R. 13(D) to take evidence for that purpose, \u201csummarily and without prior notice.\u201d The magistrate was not prohibited from taking evidence on that issue merely because the same evidence might likewise relate to the contempt charges that had been continued. Evidence may be offered for more than one purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">{\u00b6 11} Angela states that, relying on her lawyer\u2019s prior advice concerning the contempt charges, she elected to stand mute with respect to the question of temporary custody. That was her decision. The fact that she acted on her lawyer\u2019s advice, though given in connection with a different issue, does not demonstrate that the magistrate acted improperly in issuing the temporary custody order.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">{\u00b6 12} Angela was relieved of any prejudice she suffered as a result of the temporary custody order by the later agreed entry that restored Matthew\u2019s custody to her. Because the agreed entry superseded the magistrate\u2019s temporary custody order, the agreed entry also renders moot any error or abuse of discretion in the juvenile court\u2019s subsequent order of April 19, 2004, approving the magistrate\u2019s decision concerning the temporary order, from which this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">{\u00b6 13} The court\u2019s April 19, 2004 order also overruled Angela\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s order finding her in direct contempt for failing to reveal Matthew\u2019s location. Pursuant to Juv.R. 40(C)(3)(c), the magistrate\u2019s contempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>order was reviewed and approved by the juvenile court on the same date, June 6, 2003. It was then final and appealable. R.C. 2505.02(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">{\u00b6 14} Angela failed to file a notice of appeal from the contempt finding and jail sentence within 30 days after June 6, 2003. App.R. 4(A). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the assigned error with respect to the contempt finding in an appeal that Angela filed more than one year later, on May 19, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">{\u00b6 15} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe trial court erred in providing due process to appellant to fully present her case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">{\u00b6 17} Angela argues that her right to due process was violated by the magistrate\u2019s refusal to hear (1) testimony and evidence, including tapes from the victim witness division of the prosecutor\u2019s office, regarding Angela\u2019s allegations of sexual and physical abuse by Kenneth and (2) testimony by Matthew. Further, Angela contends that the trial court\u2019s order was based on reports and statements not made under oath or subject to cross examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">{\u00b6 18} As we stated above, Angela\u2019s failure to file a timely notice of appeal from the juvenile court\u2019s June 6, 2003 order finding her in direct contempt prevents our review of these allegations. To the extent that they relate to the later order of April 19, 2004, overruling Angela\u2019s objections and adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision, the prior agreed order of January 23, 2004, rendered moot the juvenile court\u2019s decision and any prejudice Angela may have suffered as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">{\u00b6 19} The second assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the juvenile court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b301-13\">Fain and Donovan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
