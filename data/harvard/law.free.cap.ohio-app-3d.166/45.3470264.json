Mammone is an appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">{\u00b6 3} This case arises as a result of a motor vehicle accident that took place on October 1, 2002, at the intersection of Noble Street and State Route 44, Stark County, Ohio. At the time of the accident, both plaintiff-appellant Frank Stinchcomb and defendant-appellee Megan Mammone were students at East Canton High School.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">{\u00b6 4} On the date of the accident, Stinchcomb left the locker room following football practice at East Canton High School and saw Mammone standing by her car. Stinchcomb asked Mammone for a ride home, and she agreed. Stinchcomb\u2019s home was located approximately five blocks from the high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">{\u00b6 5} Stinchcomb was seated in the left rear seat of the Mammone vehicle as it left the East Canton High School parking lot. After stopping at the stop sign located at the Noble Street/Route 44 intersection, Mammone proceeded into the intersection. As her vehicle traveled through the intersection, its right rear side was struck by an oncoming vehicle, causing appellee\u2019s vehicle to spin into a second vehicle. As a result of the accident, Stinchcomb sustained a left-knee laceration and a left-ankle fracture dislocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">{\u00b6 6} Paramedics removed Stinchcomb from the vehicle and transported him to Aultman Hospital, where doctors immediately operated on his ankle, inserting a plate, nine screws, and a pin.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">{\u00b6 7} On or about April 30, 2004, Stinchcomb filed a complaint in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas, alleging negligence against Mammone for failing to yield at the stop sign and negligent entrustment against her mother, Sharon Mammone.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">{\u00b6 8} During the course of the discovery portion of the case, Stinchcomb underwent an independent medical examination on February 22, 2005, at the office of orthopedic specialist Dr. Timothy L. Gordon of Willoughby Hills, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">{\u00b6 9} During the discovery phase of the case, counsel for Stinchcomb issued a subpoena duces tecum to Dr. Gordon requesting several items. Among other things, the subpoena required Dr. Gordon to produce:</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe number of all independent or defense medical examinations he had performed at the request of any defense law firm or insurance company from 2001-2005;</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe amount of money earned by him or his office in conjunction with the performance of independent or defense medical examinations from 2001-2005;</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cCopies of all tax form 1099\u2019s received by him or his business from any defense law firm or insurance company showing payments made to him from 2001-2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>{\u00b6 13} As a result of the receipt of the subpoena duces tecum, Dr. Gordon and Timothy L. Gordon, M.D. Orthopedics, PA, retained personal counsel to represent their interests in responding to the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">{\u00b6 14} In a letter to Stinchcomb\u2019s counsel, counsel for Dr. Gordon objected to the production of the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">{\u00b6 15} Subsequent to receiving Dr. Gordon\u2019s response to the subpoena, Stinchcomb filed a motion to compel compliance with the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">{\u00b6 16} Stinchcomb\u2019s counsel then filed a motion to compel with the trial court, indicating that the requested documents were relevant to demonstrate a possible bias or pecuniary interest in the event that Dr. Gordon performed examinations predominantly on behalf of the defense bar. In his motion, Stinchcomb alerted the trial court to a previous case in which it had allowed discovery in an identical case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">{\u00b6 17} In response to Stinchcomb\u2019s motion, Dr. Gordon filed a brief in opposition to the motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">{\u00b6 18} By judgment entry filed June 9, 2005, the trial court overruled Stinchcomb\u2019s motion, finding that \u201cDr. Gordon has provided more than sufficient information and Plaintiffs are not entitled to the privileged information sought in the subpoena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">{\u00b6 19} On or about June 10, 2005, Stinchcomb filed a motion for reconsideration, requesting that the trial court reconsider its ruling of June 9, 2005, and arguing that Dr. Gordon had not produced any information regarding the amount of money he earned from examinations performed on behalf of the defense bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">{\u00b6 20} On June 14, 2005, the trial court overruled Stinchcomb\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">{\u00b6 21} The parties recorded a videotape deposition of Dr. Gordon in which he testified that Stinchcomb\u2019s ankle was in \u201cgreat\u201d condition, that he had a \u201cgood\u201d prognosis, and that further surgery would not be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">{\u00b6 22} This matter proceeded to jury trial on June 27, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">{\u00b6 23} For purposes of trial, Mammone admitted that on October 1, 2002, she operated her vehicle in a negligent manner and caused the motor-vehicle accident in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">{\u00b6 24} The videotape of Dr. Gordon was replayed at the jury trial over objection by Stinchcomb\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">{\u00b6 25} In addition, at the time of trial, the court advised the jury that \u201cyou are going to be directed that the accident caused, was the direct cause of the knee laceration and fracture of the ankle of the Plaintiff.\u201d The jurors were further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>advised by the court that their tasks in the case were to determine \u201cthe extent of the injuries suffered by the Plaintiff and the compensation to which the Plaintiffs would be entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">{\u00b6 26} On June 29, 2005, the jury returned a verdict in Stinchcomb\u2019s favor in the amount of $21,349 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">{\u00b6 27} It is from this judgment entry that appellant prosecutes this appeal, assigning the following sole error for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\n<em>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cI. The trial court abused its discretion in denying Stinchcomb\u2019s request to discover, and possibly cross-examine on, how much the defendants\u2019 expert witness has earned performing examinations on behalf of the defense bar, which may have demonstrated his bias or pecuniary interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">{\u00b6 29} In his sole assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to compel compliance with the subpoena. More specifically, appellant argues that he should have been allowed to discover and cross-examine appellee\u2019s expert witness with regard to his bias or pecuniary interest. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">{\u00b6 30} Appellant argues that he is entitled to such discovery pursuant to Civ.R. 26(B)(1) and Evid.R. 611(B) and 616(A). Civ.R. 26(B)(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cUnless otherwise ordered by the court in accordance with these rules, * * * [pjarties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party * *</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">{\u00b6 32} Evid.R. 611(B) provides that the trial court shall allow cross-examination \u201con all relevant matters and matters affecting credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">{\u00b6 33} Pursuant to Evid.R. 616(A), \u201c[b]ias, prejudice, interest, or any motive to misrepresent may be shown to impeach the witness either by examination of the witness or by extrinsic evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">{\u00b6 34} However, Evid.R. 403(B) grants a court discretion to limit questioning if the \u201cprobative value is substantially outweighed by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">{\u00b6 35} Similarly, pursuant to Evid.R. 611(A), \u201cThe trial court shall exercise reasonable control over the manner and order of interrogating witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-16\">{\u00b6 36} An appellate court may not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision with respect to the scope of cross-examination absent an abuse of discretion. Calderon v. Sharkey (1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 218, 24 O.O.3d 322, 436 N.E.2d 1008. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Specifically, cross-examination of a medical expert regarding the expert\u2019s bias and pecuniary interest is also subject to the sound discretion of the trial court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">{\u00b6 37} In order to find an abuse of discretion, we must determine that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">{\u00b6 38} Appellant argues that he was prevented from discovering evidence that may have demonstrated bias or a pecuniary interest on the part of Dr. Gordon, appellee\u2019s expert witness. Specifically, appellant argues that the records sought \u201cmight have shown that Dr. Gordon received consistent referrals * * * from one particular defense firm \u2014 or the defense bar in general.\u201d Appellant argues that if this was, in fact, the case, the jury could have believed that \u201cDr. Gordon\u2019s opinion was influenced, whether consciously or not, by his pecuniary interest: obtaining future examination referrals and the fees associated with those examinations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">{\u00b6 39} The trial court, in its judgment entry of June 9, 2005, overruling appellant\u2019s motion to compel, found:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cUpon review of the Motion and the record, this Court finds Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel not well-taken and OVERRULES the same. Dr. Gordon has provided more than sufficient information and Plaintiffs are not entitled to the privileged information sought in the subpoena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">{\u00b6 41} In so ruling, the trial court had before it Dr. Gordon\u2019s initial response to appellant\u2019s subpoena, which included the number of independent medical examinations (\u201cIMEs\u201d) conducted by Dr. Gordon between October, 1998, and May 31, 2005; Dr. Gordon\u2019s price range for IMEs; the number of depositions provided by Dr. Gordon for the same time period; and the charges typically associated with such depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">{\u00b6 42} Additionally, the cross-examination portion of Dr. Gordon\u2019s video deposition, which was played at trial, is approximately 30 pages in length, 17 of which dealt specifically with Dr. Gordon\u2019s medical-legal practice and its economic aspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">{\u00b6 43} During the trial, when appellant objected to the introduction of Dr. Gordon\u2019s video testimony, the trial court, in overruling the objection, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cI have reviewed the deposition testimony. In addition to ruling on the objections, and I am not going to grant the motion that the testimony be disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">{\u00b645} \u201cThe Court believes that counsel adequately, I would say more than adequately made his financial [sic] during the course of cross-examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>{\u00b6 46} Based on the foregoing, this court finds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">{\u00b6 47} We likewise find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">{\u00b6 48} Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">{\u00b6 49} This cause is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b91-9\">Farmer, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b91-10\">Hoffman, P.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
