O\u2019Neill, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Joseph J. Filchock, was found guilty by a jury of aggravated vehicular homicide, vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of an accident, driving with a prohibited blood-alcohol content, and driving under the influence of alcohol. He received a prison term of six years on the first charge and concurrent six-month terms on the other charges. On appeal, Filchock challenges the constitutionality of his sentencing procedure, the propriety of his arrest, the trial court\u2019s guidance to the jury following a jury question, and the sufficiency of the evidence. On review, we affirm the convictions, but reverse the sentence pertaining to the conviction for aggravated vehicular homicide and remand the cause for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 2} Filchock and Dorothy Duhaime were each proceeding eastbound on Interstate 90 in Concord Township, Ohio, on November 4, 2002. Filchock was driving a Dodge truck, and Duhaime was driving a smaller Mazda truck. At approximately 9:15 p.m., Filchock, traveling at a high rate of speed, rear-ended Duhaime\u2019s vehicle, causing it to leave the highway and hit a tree. Duhaime was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">{\u00b6 3} Filchock was indicted for aggravated vehicular homicide in violation of R.C. 2903.06(A)(1), a felony of the second degree. The elements of this charge require that the operator of a motor vehicle must have caused the death of another as a proximate result of committing a driving-under-the-influence (\u201cDUI\u201d) offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">{\u00b6 4} A second aggravated vehicular homicide charge, pursuant to R.C. 2903.06(A)(2), was also lodged against him. The elements of this second count of the indictment differ in that the operator of a motor vehicle must have recklessly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>caused the death of another. A conviction under this latter count constitutes a felony of the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">{\u00b6 5} Filchock was also indicted pursuant to R.C. 4549.02, leaving the scene of an accident that resulted in the death of another. This crime is a felony of the third degree. Counts four and five of the indictment were driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol and driving with a prohibited blood-alcohol content, respectively. These were misdemeanor counts and were charged pursuant to R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) and 4511.19(A)(2), respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 6} Filchock filed a motion to suppress to challenge the propriety of the trooper\u2019s arrest. His argument was that Sergeant Kreft of the Ohio Highway Patrol did not have probable cause to arrest because he did not witness the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 7} At the suppression hearing, Trooper Smith testified that he had been dispatched to the scene of the accident, that when he came on the scene, the fire department and sheriffs deputies were already there, and that one of the deputies found a license plate registered to Filchock. Trooper Smith relayed the information about the plate, the owner of the plate, and the owner\u2019s address to another trooper, Sergeant Kreft. He also learned the identity of the driver of the Mazda truck and that she was deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 8} Sergeant Kreft went to Filchock\u2019s home. Filchock admitted that he was the driver of the Dodge truck that was involved in the accident and explained that the other driver had changed lanes in front of him. The sergeant smelled a strong odor of alcohol about his person, noticed that his eyes were bloodshot, and observed that his speech was slow and deliberate. Filchock stated that he had consumed one drink at home, but did not have any alcohol prior to returning home. He also stated that he had just returned home from work, but his wife stated that she understood him to have just come from dinner with co-workers. The sergeant and Filchock then went to the rear of Filchock\u2019s home. The Dodge truck was parked behind the house, concealed from the road. The sergeant observed that the front end of the Dodge truck had sustained significant damage and that the airbags had deployed. The sergeant escorted Filchock to the front seat of his patrol car. He asked him to make a written statement as to what happened. Filchock refused to give a statement until he had talked to an attorney. Sergeant Kreft read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Filchock at that time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Filchock refused to submit to field-sobriety tests. Sergeant Kreft arrested Filchock for driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d) and leaving the scene of an accident. Filchock was then transported to the highway patrol post, where he refused to submit to a breathalyzer. The sergeant then transported Filchock to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Lake East Hospital for a blood draw. The blood specimen was collected at 11:15 p.m. It tested at .157 grams percent by weight of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court overruled Filchock\u2019s motion to suppress. In so doing, it found that the warrantless arrest was valid based upon \u201cthe facts and circumstances of this case.\u201d The court was influenced by \u201c[t]he fact that the matter was a felony and the circumstances are exigent.\u201d The trial court further held that, notwithstanding that the blood draw may have happened more than two hours after the accident, such a chemical test was admissible at trial. Finally, the court held that no inadmissible searches took place during the investigation and that no improper statements were given by Filchock.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">{\u00b6 10} At trial, two witnesses who were in a trailing vehicle testified that Filchock was driving at speeds up to ninety miles per hour, that he was swerving in and out of lanes, and that he collided with the rear end of Duhaime\u2019s truck with sufficient force to push it off the road into the woods. They also saw Filchock\u2019s vehicle come to rest in the median strip approximately 2,000 feet away from the point of impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">{\u00b6 11} Filchock testified at trial. He is a carpenter by trade and was working in Summit County that day. After work, he went to a local restaurant, where, he admits, he consumed three to four margaritas. The restaurant is about 40 miles from his home in Concord Township. He stated that he left the restaurant at about 8:30 p.m. His account was that he was driving home at a normal speed. Soon after he entered 1-90 eastbound, another vehicle cut him off, and for the next few miles, he and the driver of the other vehicle were trying to outmaneuver each other. According to Filchock, they were both engaging in \u201cmonkey business.\u201d He stated that he came upon Duhaime\u2019s vehicle suddenly, as it was traveling .very slowly. He tried to swerve to avoid colliding with her vehicle, but was unable to do so and hit her left rear bumper. After the impact, his airbags deployed, he lost control of his vehicle, and he wound up on the median strip. After about ten minutes, he started his truck and drove home, parking the truck behind the house. Approximately seven to eight minutes after he arrived home, the highway patrol officer showed up.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 12} In the further presentation of his defense, Filchock introduced other facts and circumstances in order to cast reasonable doubt on whether his operation under the influence of alcohol was the \u201ccause\u201d of Duhaime\u2019s death. Specifically, his expert testified that Duhaime was traveling at too slow a speed\u2014 between 40 and 52 miles per hour \u2014 and, therefore, the contention is that her slow speed was the \u201ccause\u201d of her own death. He also testified about the \u201cmonkey business\u201d with another vehicle on the road, a Volkswagen, as if to say that the maneuvering of the Volkswagen, which caused Filchock to swerve in order to gain a favorable position on the^ roadway, was the \u201ccause\u201d of Duhaime\u2019s death. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>testimony was part of Filchock\u2019s defense and was meant to cast doubt on whether his impaired operation of his motor vehicle was the \u201cdirect cause\u201d of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 13} The jury instruction on causation relative to count one was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cCause is an essential element of the offense. Cause is an act or failure to act which in the natural and continuous sequence directly produces the death and without which it would not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cNow the charge goes on and it states that the defendant caused the death of Dorothy Duhaime as a proximate result of committing a violation of Section 4511.19(A) which is the driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cSo you\u2019re required to find that the death was the result, that is the direct, that\u2019s what proximate cause means, it is that you must find a direct relationship between the cause and the resulting injury}.] * * * [T]he party alleging that the proximate cause existed must prove not only that the other party caused the death but that there is a direct relationship between the cause and the resulting death.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cProximate cause is an act or failure to act which in a natural and continuous sequence directly produces the death and without which it would not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cCause occurs when the death is the natural and foreseeable result of the act or failure to act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">{\u00b6 20} During jury deliberations, the jury posed four questions to the court. In response to these jury questions, the trial court responded to each one in a separate writing. The court\u2019s responses were furnished to the jury over their lunch hour break, not in open court and not in the presence of the parties or their attorneys. The questions, and the court\u2019s responses, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(1) We would like the definition of the following words: wreckless [sic], cause, and knowingly. [In response to the first question, the trial court repeated its instructions on the elements of \u201crecklessness,\u201d \u201crisk,\u201d \u201cknowingly,\u201d and \u201ccause.\u201d]</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(2) What is the difference between count 1 and count 2? [In response to the second question, the trial court stated that count one requires the jury to find that Filchock caused the death of Duhaime as direct result of being under the influence of alcohol; and that count two requires the jury to find that Filchock recklessly caused the death of Duhaime while operating a motor vehicle.]</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(3) If we find guilty on count 1 do we have to vote on count 2? [In response to the third question, the trial court answered in the affirmative.]</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>{\u00b6 24} \u201c(4) Does directly mean the only factor?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 25} In response to the fourth question, the trial court asked the jury to explain what it meant in more detail. The jury then came back with a fifth question, which was, \u201c[d]oes direct mean the only cause of the accident. In Count 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 26} In response to this last question, the trial court gave the following response:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cRegarding Count One:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cYou must find the elements:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c1. Date</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c2. Venue</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c3. The defendant did</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c4. While operating, or participating in the operation of a motor vehicle</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c5. Caused (directly) the death of Dorothy Duhaime</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c6. As a proximate result of driving while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-15\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cYou are limited to considering the above elements in the context of the charge. You may not consider other causes than the one specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-16\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cYou are to further consider the following instruction in making your determination:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-17\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cOTHER CAUSES NOT A DEFENSE. There may be one or more causes of an event. However, if a defendant\u2019s act or failure to act was one cause, then the existence of other causes is not a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-18\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cINTERVENING CAUSES. The defendant is responsible for the natural consequences of the defendant\u2019s unlawful act or failure to act, even though death was also caused by the intervening act or failure to act of another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-19\">{\u00b6 39} The jury found Filchock guilty of Count One of the indictment, that being aggravated vehicular homicide. It found him not guilty of Count Two, another count of aggravated vehicular homicide, but found him guilty of the lesser charge of vehicular homicide, a misdemeanor. It also found him guilty of Counts Three, Four, and Five, leaving the scene of an accident, driving with a prohibited blood alcohol content, and driving while under the influence of alcohol, respectively. Filchock was given a six-year prison sentence on count one and six months for each of the other counts, all sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-20\">{\u00b6 40} Filchock filed a motion for new trial, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>{\u00b6 41} Filehock has asserted four assignments of error, the first of which follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cJoseph Filchock\u2019s six-year prison sentence violates the Jury Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the corresponding provision of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 43} Here Filehock is arguing that R.C. 2929.14(B)(2), which allows the trial court to impose more than the shortest sentence for an offense, is unconstitutionally invalid under <em>Blakely.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The recent case of <em>State v. Foster </em>held that R.C. 2929.14(B)(2) must be severed from Ohio\u2019s sentencing statutes because that statute requires \u201cjudicial factfinding before imposition of a sentence greater than the maximum term authorized by a jury verdict or admission of the defendant\u201d and is, therefore, unconstitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 44} For this reason, this matter will be returned to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 45} However, at resentencing, the trial court shall reconsider only the imposition of the six-year sentence. The other sentences imposed upon Filehock have not been challenged in this appeal and will not be disturbed. The third paragraph of the syllabus of <em>State v. Saxon </em>states:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cAn appellate court may modify, remand, or vacate only a sentence for an offense that is appealed by the defendant and may not modify, remand, or vacate the entire multiple-offense sentence based upon an appealed error in the sentence for a single offense.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">{\u00b6 47} Therefore, the trial court shall resentence only with respect to the conviction for aggravated vehicular homicide. The balance of Filchock\u2019s sentences remain undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">{\u00b6 48} Filchock\u2019s first assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">{\u00b6 49} Filchoek\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cThe trial court erred in its reply to the jury\u2019s question, during deliberations, regarding \u2018direct\u2019 and \u2018only\u2019 cause of the accident, by giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>inconsistent and confusing answers, thereby misleading the jury to the prejudice of Joseph Filchock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 51} With respect to the responses given by the trial court to the jury\u2019s questions, Filchock argues that the trial court gave two additional instructions not called for by the facts of the case and that the effect of giving the two additional instructions was to mislead the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 52} In this respect, argues Filchock, the situation is analogous to the situation in <em>State v. </em>Harvey.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Harvey, </em>which involved a drive-by shooting during which the defendant and another individual exchanged gunfire, the defendant was charged with aggravated murder. He was observed with a .45 caliber handgun before the shooting. He admitted on videotape that he had fired several shots on the night in question. Though the bullet did not remain in the victim\u2019s body and was never found, the coroner testified that the passage of the bullet through the body was consistent with a .45 caliber handgun shot. The trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury included relevant instructions on causation and proximate cause and irrelevant instructions on multiple, intervening, and superseding causes. This court held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c[The irrelevant instructions], although correct statements of the law, were not applicable to the facts of this case. Only one bullet killed [the victim]; there was no other cause contributing to his demise. Therefore, the instructions on multiple causation were extraneous and should not have been given.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">{\u00b6 54} Because of the irrelevant instructions, the jurors in <em>Harvey </em>inquired whether they could still convict the defendant of aggravated murder if they weren\u2019t sure that his bullet caused the death of the victim. The trial court refused to answer the question. This court said that the trial court should have answered the question:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cUnder these circumstances, the judge should have answered the question by telling the jury that, if they were not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant\u2019s bullet killed [the victim], they must find him not guilty of aggravated murder. Leaving the jury to struggle with instructions which were, in light of the facts, extraneous and confusing, without clarification, was an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">{\u00b6 56} We do not find <em>Harvey </em>applicable to the instant case. Unlike in <em>Harvey, </em>where one bullet killed the victim, the \u201ccause\u201d of Duhaime\u2019s death was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>open for the jury\u2019s deliberation. From the testimony at trial, the \u201ccause\u201d of her death could have been the fact that Filchock was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol; it could have been caused by his reckless or negligent operation of a motor vehicle; it could have been caused by Duhaime\u2019s slow speed; or it could have been caused as a result of the \u201cmonkey business\u201d with the Volkswagen. Specifically with respect to count one, the question for the jury was whether there was evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Filchock\u2019s act of operating of a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol was the direct cause of Duhaime\u2019s death and without which the death would not have happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 57} Moreover, we do not accept Filchock\u2019s argument that the additional instructions given by the trial court had the effect of misleading the jury. On the contrary, the instructions on \u201cother causes\u201d and \u201cintervening causes\u201d were correct statements of the law as applicable to this case. As stated above, the \u201ccause\u201d of Duhaime\u2019s death was a jury question, and the additional instructions merely clarified that Filchock would be criminally responsible for his acts even if other \u201ccauses\u201d came into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">{\u00b6 58} The second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">{\u00b6 59} Filchock\u2019s third assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cThe trial court erred in denying the pretrial motion to suppress evidence insofar as it raised the question of the inadequate evidence to support the arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c \u2018Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The appellate court must accept the trial court\u2019s factual findings, provided they are supported by competent, credible evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thereafter, the appellate court must independently determine whether those factual findings meet the requisite legal standard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">{\u00b6 62} The general rule is that a police officer may not make a warrant-less arrest for a misdemeanor unless the offense is committed in the presence of the officer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> An exception to this requirement was created by the Supreme Court of Ohio in the case of <em>Oregon v. Szakovits.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> Oregon </em>held that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>certain circumstances, a warrantless arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol was valid, notwithstanding that the arresting officer did not personally witness the accused operate the vehicle.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This court, following <em>Oregon, </em>has explained the rule thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cIn accordance with the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s decision in <em>Oregon, </em>we confirm that a police officer has probable cause to arrest for driving under the influence where the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the accused had operated the vehicle while under the influence. In making this determination, each drunk-driving case must be decided on its own particular and peculiar facts.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">{\u00b6 64} In this case, Sergeant Kreft went to Filchock\u2019s home based on the identification of the license plate found at the crash scene. When he knocked on the door, Filchock approached and admitted that he was the driver of the vehicle involved in the accident. Filchock then led this officer through his home to the rear of it to show him the damaged truck. The officer observed extensive damage to the front end of Filchock\u2019s truck. The officer also obtained Filchock\u2019s driver\u2019s license from him. Filchock stated that the accident happened because the driver of the Mazda had decided to change lanes. Filchock admitted having had one drink, but denied having anything to drink before he got home. The sergeant smelled a strong odor of alcohol and observed that Filchock\u2019s speech and walk were slow and deliberate and that his eyes were bloodshot. The sergeant escorted Filchock to his vehicle, but Filchock refused to perform any field-sobriety tests. Based upon the prior experience of the officer, who had made approximately 800 arrests for driving while under the influence, and the fact that he knew from radio reports that the accident in which Filchock had rear-ended the other automobile was serious, together with his observations of Filchock, the officer had probable cause, based upon the totality of the circumstances, to arrest Filchock for driving under the influence even though he had not personally observed Filchock operating his vehicle. Other factors that militate in favor of probable cause to make this arrest are that only 22 minutes had passed from the time of the accident until Sergeant Kreft arrived at Filchock\u2019s home; Filchock\u2019s story to the officer as to where he had been before arriving home differed from his wife\u2019s report; and Filchock\u2019s refusal to submit to field-sobriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>tests is a factor that may be considered in the determination of whether probable cause existed for the arrest.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">{\u00b6 65} For the foregoing reasons, Filchock\u2019s third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">{\u00b6 66} Filehock\u2019s fourth assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cCount 1, aggravated vehicular homicide, is not supported by sufficient evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">{\u00b6 68} \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe test (for sufficiency of the evidence) is whether after viewing the probative evidence and the inference drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all of the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>The claim of insufficient evidence invokes an inquiry about due process. It raises a question of law, the resolution of which does not allow the court to weigh the evidence. </em>* * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cIn other words, the standard to be applied on a question concerning sufficiency is: when viewing the evidence \u2018in a light most favorable to the prosecution,\u2019 * * * \u2018(a) reviewing court (should) not reverse a * * * verdict where there is substantial evidence upon which the jury could reasonably conclude that all of the elements of an offense have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">{\u00b6 70} Thus, \u201c[a]n appellate court must look to the evidence presented to determine if the state offered evidence on each statutory element of the offense, so that a rational trier of fact may infer that the offense was committed beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">{\u00b6 71} Moreover, the verdict will not be disturbed on appeal unless the reviewing court finds that reasonable minds could not have arrived at the conclusion reached by the trier of fact.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, in the instant case, the state was required to present sufficient evidence to establish that Filchock was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and that such operation proximately caused the death of Duhaime. The statute stating the offense provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>{\u00b6 72} \u201c(A) No person, while operating or participating in the operation of a motor vehicle * * *, shall cause the death of another * * * in any of the following ways:</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 73} \u201c(l)(a) As the proximate result of committing a violation of division (A) of [R.C. 4511.19].\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">(\u00b6 74} R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) stated that \u201c[n]o person shall operate any vehicle * * * if, at the time of operation, * * * the person is under the influence of alcohol * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">{\u00b6 75} Filchock concedes that he was operating his truck under the influence of alcohol. The jury found him guilty of operating his motor vehicle with a prohibited blood-alcohol content and operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">{\u00b6 76} Filchock argues instead that Duhaime\u2019s death was not caused by his impaired driving, but by some other cause, such as Duhaime\u2019s maintaining a slow speed on the highway, or perhaps the driver of the Volkswagen who was attempting to outmaneuver Filchock on the highway. He further argues that if he had hit a patch of ice and killed his passenger, or if he had been side-swiped by a semi-trailer truck and had killed someone in the opposite lane, his impaired driving would not have been the cause of the other party\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cIt is well established that the definition of \u2018cause\u2019 in criminal cases is identical to the definition of \u2018proximate cause\u2019 in civil cases. * * * The general rule is that a defendant\u2019s conduct is the proximate cause of injury or death to another if the defendant\u2019s conduct (1) is a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 in bringing about the harm and (2) there is no other rule of law relieving the defendant of liability. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cA defendant cannot be relieved of criminal liability merely because factors other than his acts contributed to the death, provided such other factors are not the sole proximate cause of death. * * * Indeed, we have specifically stated that the alleged contributory negligence of a victim may not be used as a defense in a subsequent aggravated vehicular homicide prosecution unless it is the sole proximate cause of death.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">{\u00b6 79} By finding Filchock guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide, the jury did not believe that Duhaime\u2019s slow speed was the sole or proximate cause of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>{\u00b6 80} Moreover, there was more than sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Filchock\u2019s operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol was the cause of Duhaime\u2019s death. He was observed to be swerving in and out of traffic; he was driving at a high rate of speed; he fled the scene without calling the police; he had a strong odor of alcohol on his person; he had bloodshot eyes; his speech and walk were slow and deliberate; he placed his vehicle behind his home so that it could not be seen from the street; he refused field-sobriety tests; and his blood-alcohol content was above the legal limit. Filchock testified that he could not rule out the role that alcohol played with respect to the accident and conceded that his testimony at trial was inconsistent with the story he told the trooper on the night of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">{\u00b6 81} Looked at in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence shows that reasonable minds could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Filchock\u2019s operation of his motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol was the cause of Duhaime\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">{\u00b6 82} This assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">{\u00b6 83} The judgment of the trial court convicting Filchock is affirmed. However, that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment entry imposing a six-year sentence for aggravated vehicular homicide is reversed in light of the decision in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470. The remaining sentences imposed upon Filchock remain undisturbed in light of the decision in <em>State v. Saxon, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, 846 N.E.2d 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b665-9\">Rice and O\u2019Toole, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\">. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b659-13\">. <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b659-14\">. <em>State v.
