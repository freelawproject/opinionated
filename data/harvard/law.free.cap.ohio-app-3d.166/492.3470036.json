The trial court granted Sneed\u2019s motion to suppress his admission. The state of Ohio appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">\n<em>Sneed\u2019s Prewarning and Postwaming Statements to Police</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">{\u00b6 2} At the hearing on his motion to suppress, Sneed testified that one night, as he was driving his vehicle, his passenger yanked the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to crash into a fence at a business facility. After the crash, the vehicle\u2019s engine would not start. Sneed realized that his vehicle would have to be towed, so he was afraid to leave a loaded gun in the vehicle\u2019s rear compartment. Sneed jumped out of the driver\u2019s seat and ran to the rear of the vehicle. Sneed lifted the hatchback and grabbed the gun from behind the tire jack. Then Sneed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ran down the street, threw the gun in some bushes, and returned to the vehicle to wait for the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">{\u00b6 3} Doug Jones testified that he was working at the facility when he saw the vehicle crash into the fence. Jones thought that the occupants of the vehicle might have been injured, so he called the police. Jones saw a man get out of the vehicle, run down the sidewalk toward some bushes, and return to the vehicle. When police officers arrived, Jones told them what he had seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">{\u00b6 4} Cincinnati Police Officer Michael Winslow testified that he and his partner were responding to the accident scene when they received an additional dispatch. The dispatch relayed a complainant\u2019s report that a man involved in the accident had thrown an unknown object into some bushes down the street, about 100 yards south of the wrecked vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">{\u00b6 5} When the officers arrived at the accident scene, they saw the vehicle\u2019s track marks leading up an embankment to a fence. The vehicle had rolled back down the embankment and had come to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">{\u00b6 6} Officer Winslow testified that there was some confusion at first as to who was at fault in the accident. The officers charged Sneed\u2019s passenger with driving under the influence of alcohol after determining that she had taken control of the vehicle and had caused the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">{\u00b6 7} The officers learned that Sneed had two outstanding bench warrants, so they placed him under arrest. He was handcuffed and placed in a police cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">{\u00b6 8} Officer Winslow testified that he noticed an odor of an alcoholic beverage and thought that Sneed might have tried to discard or hide alcohol in the bushes. So Officer Winslow asked Sneed, \u201c[W]hat is that object? * * * [I]s it alcohol or is it a gun of any sort or any kind of weapon?\u201d Sneed responded, \u201cWell, yeah, actually, it\u2019s a gun. * * * I\u2019ll show you right where it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">{\u00b6 9} Officer Winslow immediately read Sneed his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights. Sneed indicated that he understood his rights and agreed to speak to the officers. According to Officer Winslow, Sneed was cooperative as he directed the officer to the bushes where he had thrown the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">{\u00b6 10} Officer Winslow testified that he asked Sneed how he had gotten the gun from his vehicle to the bushes without anyone seeing it. He asked Sneed, \u201c[D]id you have it in your waistband?\u201d According to Officer Winslow, Sneed responded that he had stuck the gun in his waistband, in the small of his back, and that he had concealed the gun by putting his shirt over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Officer Winslow testified that he had not made any promises or threats to Sneed, and that he did not coerce Sneed or deny him necessary medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 12} Sneed, however, testified that he had not concealed the gun when he ran down the street. He said that he had simply held the gun at his side. Sneed also said that the officer had not advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\n<em>The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 13} Apparently, the trial court believed Officer Winslow\u2019s version of the events because it found that Sneed had been given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings following his admission that the thrown object was a gun. But the court found that Sneed\u2019s initial statements were not voluntary, \u201cgiven the inherently coercive circumstances of the custodial interrogation.\u201d The court concluded that the officer\u2019s \u201cmidstream\u201d <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not sufficient to cure the taint of coercion that carried over from the initial statements. Consequently, the court suppressed Sneed\u2019s postwarning statements to police about how he had carried the gun from his vehicle to the bushes.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\n<em>The State Appeals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">{\u00b6 14} In a single assignment of error, the state argues that the trial court erred by suppressing Sneed\u2019s postwarning statements. First, the state contends that Sneed\u2019s prewarning statements came within the \u201cpublic safety\u201d exception to the <em>Miranda </em>rule, so his postwarning statements should not have been suppressed. Second, the state argues that even if the public-safety exception did not apply, Sneed\u2019s prewarning and postwarning statements were voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">\n<em>Our Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">{\u00b6 15} Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In considering a motion to suppress, the trial court is in the best position to decide the facts and to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, we must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent and credible evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law, however, we apply a de novo standard of review and decide whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>Public-Safety Exception to the </em>Miranda <em>Warnings Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">{\u00b6 16} The state argues that Sneed\u2019s initial unwarned statements were admissible under the public-safety exception to the <em>Miranda </em>rule. The state contends that the trial court erred by excluding Sneed\u2019s postwarning statements as illegal fruit of a <em>Miranda </em>violation, when no such violation had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">{\u00b6 17} The United States Supreme Court enunciated the public-safety exception in <em>New York v. </em>Quarles.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In that case, police apprehended a suspect and had reason to believe that the suspect had just discarded a gun in a supermarket. Before advising the suspect of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, an officer asked him where the missing gun was. The suspect said, \u201c[T]he gun is over there,\u201d and officers recovered the loaded gun. After being arrested and advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the suspect admitted that he owned the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 18} The court recognized that the missing gun posed a great danger to the public and that there are situations in which the need for answers to questions regarding public safety outweighs the need for the prophylactic <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, the court adopted a public-safety exception to the <em>Miranda </em>rule: police may justifiably fail to inform a suspect of his <em>Miranda </em>rights in order to ask questions necessary to secure their own safety or the safety of the public.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The questions asked under the public-safety exception must be readily distinguishable from questions designed to elicit testimonial evidence from the suspect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 19} The availability of the public-safety exception does not depend upon the motivation of the individual officers involved.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> So application of the exception does not depend \u201con post hoc findings at a suppression hearing concerning the subjective motivation of the arresting officer.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 20} Here, police officers responding to the scene of a single-vehicle accident at night were informed that after the accident, a passenger had hurriedly thrown an object into some bushes about 100 yards away from the wrecked vehicle. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Officer Winslow suspected that Sneed was trying to hide or discard something, but admitted that he did not know whether the item was a weapon or alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 21} Certainly, a reasonable officer would have suspected that Sneed did not want investigating officers to discover the concealed object and would have suspected that such an object might have posed a threat to the public. Indeed, a reasonable officer might have been remiss in his duties to protect the public if he had not attempted to quickly ascertain the nature of the object.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 22} Had <em>Miranda </em>warnings deterred Sneed from responding to Officer Winslow\u2019s question about the nature of the thrown object, potentially \u201cthe cost would have been something more than merely the failure to obtain evidence useful in convicting [him].\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In any event, Officer Winslow\u2019s questions to Sneed were not designed to elicit testimonial evidence but to determine the character of the thrown object. The officer\u2019s prewarning questioning simply ensured that the public would not be endangered by the concealment of a dangerous item in a public area.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 23} Accordingly, we hold that Sneed\u2019s unwarned statements fell within the public-safety exception and that the trial court erred by excluding Sneed\u2019s subsequent warned statements as illegal fruits of a <em>Miranda </em>violation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\"><em>Admissibility of Postwarning Statements under </em>Elstad <em>and </em>Seibert</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 24} The state further argues that even if the public-safety exception did not apply, the trial court erred by excluding Sneed\u2019s postwarning statements based upon its finding that Sneed\u2019s prewarning statements were not voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">A. <em>Unwarned yet Uncoerced Statements </em>\u2014 Oregon v. Elstad</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Oregon v. </em>Elstad,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court held that a suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoercive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after being given <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">{\u00b6 26} The court recognized that the failure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not mean that a suspect\u2019s unwarned statements have actually been coerced.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The failure to warn simply creates a presumption of compulsion, so that un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>warned but otherwise voluntary statements must be excluded from evidence under <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">{\u00b6 27} The court stated, \u201cIt is an unwarranted extension of <em>Miranda </em>to hold that a simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\u2019s ability to exercise his free will, so taints the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period. Though <em>Miranda </em>requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"><em>B. \u201cQuestion-First\u201d Interrogation </em>\u2014 Missouri v. Seibert</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Missouri v. Seibert,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United States Supreme Court addressed the admissibility of a suspect\u2019s postwarning statements obtained as a result of a \u201cquestion-first\u201d interrogation strategy. In this strategy, police deliberately withhold <em>Miranda </em>warnings until their interrogation leads a suspect to confess.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Then police obtain a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights from the suspect and lead the suspect to relate the same material a second time.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cThe strategy is based on the assumption that <em>Miranda </em>warnings will tend to mean less when recited midinterrogation, after inculpatory statements have already been obtained.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 29} The court<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> held that the admissibility of postwarning statements continues to be governed by <em>Elstad </em>unless police used the deliberate question-first strategy.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If that strategy was used \u201cin a calculated way to undermine the <em>Miranda </em>warning,\u201d then postwarning statements related to the substance of prewarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures were taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>before the postwarning statements were made.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Curative measures \u201cshould be designed to ensure that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s situation would understand the import and effect of the <em>Miranda </em>warning and of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\n<em>Voluntariness of Sneed\u2019s Statements and Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Anx\">{\u00b6 30} In this case, Officer Winslow did not use a question-first interrogation strategy in a deliberate attempt to undermine the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. This was not like <em>Seibert, </em>in which the officer had conducted an extensive prewarning interview to obtain incriminating statements that would be used to elicit inculpatory postwarning statements. Here, in response to the officer\u2019s questioning, Sneed merely acknowledged that the object was a gun. At that moment, Sneed provided no information necessary for him to be charged with carrying a concealed weapon. Only after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights did Sneed implicate himself in the crime of carrying a concealed weapon. So it is clear that Officer Winslow did not rely on Sneed\u2019s prewarning statements to obtain his postwarning statements relating to his transportation of the gun. Because Officer Winslow did not use the question-first strategy, we must look to <em>Elstad </em>to determine the admissibility of Sneed\u2019s postwarning statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 31} <em>Elstad </em>requires that a court make a threshold inquiry into the effect of the <em>Miranda </em>violation on the voluntariness of a suspect\u2019s unwarned statement.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In determining whether a suspect\u2019s statement was made voluntarily, a court should consider the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> These circumstances include \u201cthe age, mentality, and prior criminal experience of the accused; the length, intensity, and frequency of interrogation; the existence of physical deprivation or mistreatment; and the existence of threat or inducement.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The same considerations apply to whether the suspect understood and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201c[E]vidence <em>of </em>police coercion or overreaching is necessary for a finding of involuntariness.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>{\u00b6 32} Once a court finds that a suspect\u2019s unwarned statement was voluntary, the focus of the inquiry shifts to whether the suspect\u2019s postwarning statement was knowingly and voluntarily made.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The fact that a suspect chooses to speak after being given <em>Miranda </em>warnings is highly probative.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 33} Here, there was no evidence of coercive tactics that would have rendered Sneed\u2019s unwarned statements or <em>Miranda </em>waiver involuntary. Police made no threats or promises to get Sneed to confess. And police did not subject Sneed to lengthy or intense questioning. Because Sneed voluntarily and knowingly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, we conclude that Sneed\u2019s postwarning statements were not involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 34} Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred by suppressing Sneed\u2019s postwarning statements. We sustain the single assignment of error and reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b541-9\">Gorman, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-12\">. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-12\">. <em>State v.
