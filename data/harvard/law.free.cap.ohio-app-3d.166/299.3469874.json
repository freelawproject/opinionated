Calabrese Jr., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff Randall Chesnut appeals from the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to Progressive Casualty Insurance Company (\u201cProgressive\u201d) on claims for violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act and unjust enrichment. After reviewing the facts of the case and pertinent law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">{\u00b6 2} On November 11, 2000, Chesnut, who is a Louisiana resident, purchased a used 2000 Saturn SL2 from Ray\u2019s Auto Sales (\u201cRay\u2019s\u201d) in Youngsville, Louisiana. In July 2000, Progressive, which insured the Saturn when it was driven by its original owner, declared the vehicle a total loss after estimating $9,921.36 to repair the vehicle after it was damaged in a fire. When Progressive sold the vehicle to Ray\u2019s at an auction, it determined that the cost of repairing the Saturn was less than 75 percent of the actual cash value (\u201cACV\u201d), which was $14,350. Pursuant to Louisiana law, specifically La.R.S. 32:702, the Saturn could be sold with a clean title, rather than a salvage title. Ray\u2019s took title to the Saturn on September 26, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">{\u00b6 3} Before Chesnut purchased the Saturn, he visited Ray\u2019s and saw the vehicle disassembled as it was being repaired. Ray\u2019s explained that the vehicle had suffered fire damage and was being rebuilt. Chesnut purchased the Saturn for $8,500, and the vehicle\u2019s odometer read 5,866 miles at the time. Since then, Chesnut has driven the Saturn approximately 50,000 miles. He has experienced no problems with the vehicle, with the exception of the vehicle\u2019s losing power one time. When he took it to a Saturn dealership, the technicians could not find any problem with the car, and Chesnut was not charged for the visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On January 28, 2002, Chesnut filed suit against Progressive, alleging violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (\u201cthe CSPA\u201d) and unjust enrichment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both claims are based on Chesnut\u2019s allegation that Progressive violated the Louisiana vehicle titling statute by not obtaining a salvage title for the Saturn after it was declared a total loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">{\u00b6 5} On February 23, 2004, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Progressive, finding the following: Progressive did not deceive Chesnut under the CSPA, Progressive acted lawfully under the Louisiana titling statute, Chesnut did not directly confer a benefit on Progressive, and Chesnut suffered no damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">{\u00b6 6} We initially note that all three of Chesnut\u2019s assignments of error relate to the court\u2019s granting summary judgment to Progressive and, therefore, appellate review is de novo. Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), the party seeking summary judgment must prove that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party. See, also, <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">{\u00b6 7} In his first assignment of error, Chesnut argues that \u201cthe trial court erred in granting Progressive\u2019s motion for summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Progressive acted lawfully under the applicable salvage title law.\u201d Specifically, appellant argues that an Ohio jury should have decided whether the Saturn sustained sufficient damage to require a salvage title under La.R.S. 32:702(11) and (12).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">{\u00b6 8} La.R.S. 32:702 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">\u201c(11) The term \u2018salvage title\u2019 shall mean a certificate used to evidence the declaration in an insurance settlement that a motor vehicle is a \u2018total loss\u2019 motor vehicle as provided in this Chapter, to be prescribed and distributed by the office of motor vehicles, to an insurance company, its authorized agent, or the owner of a \u2018total loss\u2019 motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">\u201c(12) The term \u2018total loss\u2019 means a motor vehicle which has sustained damages equivalent to seventy-five percent or more of the market value as determined by the most current National Automobile Dealers Association Handbook.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Chesnut argues that Progressive\u2019s initial repair estimate is not the only thing to be considered in determining the amount of damages the vehicle sustained when applying La.R.S. 32:702. For example, in the instant case, Progressive\u2019s repair estimate was $9,921.36 and the ACV of the Saturn was $14,350. Thus, the damage amounts to approximately 69 percent of the ACV, and the vehicle is not a total loss under Louisiana statute. However, within Progressive\u2019s internal file on the Saturn, a 40 percent supplement of $3,968.54 was used to decide whether the company should declare the vehicle a total loss. Chesnut argues that with the supplement, the \u201cdamage\u201d was $13,889.90, which is approximately 97 percent of the ACV, and under the Louisiana statute, this clearly requires a salvage title. Chesnut claims that \u201c[s]ince the supplemental estimate was used by Progressive to determine the total amount of repair costs, this same figure should have been used to determine whether or not a salvage title was required pursuant to Louisiana law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">{\u00b6 10} Progressive, on the other hand, first argues that statutory interpretation is a question of law for the court, not a question of fact for the jury. See <em>Roxane Laboratories, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 125, 127, 661 N.E.2d 1011. Additionally, Progressive argues that its estimate of record \u201cis the most accurate means of determining a vehicle\u2019s actual cost of repair.\u201d The estimator\u2019s notes in the Saturn\u2019s claim file indicate that a repair supplement may be necessary if there is unseen damage in the engine compartment. Progressive argues that supplements are really \u201cguesstimates\u201d of possible additional damage and are used internally to make cost-effective decisions on whether to declare a particular vehicle a total loss. Progressive notes that Louisiana law is silent on whether supplements should be used in determining the damage a vehicle sustained and that Chesnut points to no legal authority to support his contention that the estimate of record was incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">{\u00b6 11} A review of La.R.S. 32:702 and the relevant case law reveals nothing to support Chesnut\u2019s position that Progressive\u2019s initial estimate is not enough to determine damages under the statute. We conclude that an insurance company\u2019s internal policies and procedures for computing damage to a vehicle in deciding whether to declare it a total loss do not necessarily have to be the same policies and procedures for defining damages within a state\u2019s statute. The trial court\u2019s determination that Progressive was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of whether it violated La.R.S. 32:702 was proper. Accordingly, Chesnut\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">{\u00b6 12} In his second assignment of error, Chesnut argues that \u201cthe trial court erred in granting Progressive\u2019s motion for summary judgment because genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>issues of material fact exist as to whether Progressive committed an unfair, deceptive or unconscionable act under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act.\u201d Specifically, Chesnut alleges that Progressive committed a deceptive act, as defined by the CSPA, when it failed to obtain a salvage title for the Saturn. In this assignment of error, Chesnut makes four subarguments: (1) the CSPA applies to conduct outside Ohio, (2) Progressive is a \u201csupplier\u201d under the CSPA, (3) whether Progressive violated the CSPA was a question for the jury, and (4) he suffered damages as a result of Progressive\u2019s unfair and deceptive practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">{\u00b6 13} When the court granted summary judgment, it did so based on Chesnut\u2019s third subargument, finding that \u201cno issue of material fact has been created that would support a claim for unfair or deceptive activity on the part of Progressive\u201d and that, as a matter of law, Progressive did not violate the CSPA. However, both Chesnut and Progressive address the remaining issues in their appellate briefs; thus, we will review all four issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 14} The CSPA \u201csets forth standards of conduct for suppliers of consumer goods and makes certain deceptive practices actionable.\u201d <em>Davis v. Axelrod Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81765, 2003-Ohio-438, 2003 WL 194888. R.C. 1345.02(A) provides that \u201c[n]o supplier shall commit an unfair or deceptive act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction. Such an unfair or deceptive act or practice by a supplier violates this section whether it occurs before, during, or after the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\n<em>Conduct outside Ohio</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 1345.04 determines the reach of the CSPA, and it states that the act covers \u201cany supplier with respect to any act or practice in this state * * *.\u201d Courts have interpreted this to mean that \u201cthe statute is only applicable if the offending conduct took place within the territorial borders of the state of Ohio.\u201d <em>Shorter v. Champion Home Builders Co. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1991), 776 F.Supp. 333, 339. See, also, <em>Brown v. Market Dev., Inc. </em>(1974), 41 Ohio MisC. 57, 68 O.O.2d 276, 322 N.E.2d 367; <em>Brown v. Liberty Clubs </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 191, 543 N.E.2d 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">{\u00b6 16} Chesnut argues that because Progressive is headquartered in Ohio, the policies and procedures for handling total-loss and salvage claims emanate from Ohio. It is undisputed that the damage to the Saturn happened in Louisiana, the claim was adjusted in Louisiana, the vehicle was repaired and sold in Louisiana, and the clean title that is the subject of this appeal is a Louisiana title. According to Chesnut, however, the guidelines for titling the vehicle come from Progressive\u2019s headquarters in Ohio, and, therefore, the act must have occurred in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Progressive points out that Chesnut did not allege a violation of the Ohio vehicle titling statute, R.C. 4505.19, because the vehicle was not titled in Ohio, and this is a good indication that the conduct forming the basis for the instant case did not take place in Ohio. Progressive further argues that it did not direct and control Louisiana vehicle titling from its Ohio headquarters. Rather, salvage determinations are made \u201con a case by case basis in the state where the vehicle at issue was declared a total loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">{\u00b6 18} A recent case handed down by the Illinois Supreme Court is so factually and legally similar to the instant case, it is worth noting. In <em>Gridley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(2005), 217 Ill.2d 158, 298 Ill.Dec. 499, 840 N.E.2d 269, the plaintiff filed a class action complaint in an Illinois state court against State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, alleging unjust enrichment and violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act in connection with State Farm\u2019s sale of salvage vehicles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court dismissed the case against State Farm, and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">State Farm handles compliance with salvage laws on a state-by-state basis, rather than from State Farm\u2019s headquarters in Bloomington, Illinois, given the variation in each state\u2019s salvage laws. * * * Gridley is a resident of Louisiana. Gridley purchased his car in Louisiana and obtained automobile insurance in Louisiana. Gridley was involved in an accident in Louisiana and took his car to a repair center in Louisiana. State Farm\u2019s alleged deception \u2014 fraudulently obtaining a clean title rather than a salvage title on the vehicle sold to Gridley \u2014 occurred in Louisiana. * * * The majority of circumstances relating to the sale of the salvage vehicle in this case occurred primarily and substantially in Louisiana, so that Gridley does not have a cognizable cause of action under the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">{\u00b6 19} We agree with the analysis of the Illinois Supreme Court and hold that Chesnut cannot file suit under the CSPA for deceptive acts in titling a vehicle in Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\n<em>Supplier under the CSPA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. 1345.01(C) defines \u201csupplier\u201d as \u201ca seller, lessor, assignor, franchisor, or other person engaged in the business of effecting or soliciting consumer transactions, whether or not the person deals directly with the consumer.\u201d R.C. 1345.01(A) defines \u201cconsumer transaction\u201d as \u201ca sale, lease, assignment, award by chance, or other transfer of an item of goods, a service, a franchise, or an intangible, to an individual for purposes that are primarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>personal, family, or household, or solicitation to supply any of these things.\u201d Subsection (A) goes on to state that a consumer transaction does not include a transaction between an insurance company and its customers. Furthermore, Ohio courts have held that the CSPA does not apply to insurance companies conducting insurance transactions. See, e.g., <em>Johnson v. Lincoln Natl. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 249, 590 N.E.2d 761 (holding that \u201c[i]t is clear the Ohio Legislature meant to regulate the insurance industry in R.C. Title 39 and that the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act has no application to controversies over insurance policies\u201d); <em>Drozeck v. Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 816, 749 N.E.2d 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">{\u00b6 21} In the instant case, Progressive obtained a title for a vehicle it declared a total loss before selling it at an auto auction. This was clearly done in Progressive\u2019s capacity as an insurance company and is not subject to the CSPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\n<em>Deceptive act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">{\u00b6 22} Chesnut argues that Progressive violated the CSPA in two ways. First, violating the Louisiana titling statute violates R.C. 1345.02(B)(1) per se. R.C. 1345.02(B)(1) states that an act is deceptive if it represents that it has approval that it does not actually have. However, we have concluded that Progressive did not violate Louisiana titling laws, so this argument fails. Second, representing that the vehicle was not damaged to the extent that it was declared a total loss violates R.C. 1345.02(B)(2), which states that it is deceptive to represent that a thing is of a certain standard or quality when it actually is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 23} When determining whether an act or practice is deceptive, courts look at the incident from the consumer\u2019s standpoint. \u201cThe basic test is one of fairness; the act need not rise to the level of fraud, negligence, or breach of contract.\u201d <em>Mannix v. DCB Serv., Inc., </em>Montgomery App. No. 19910, 2004-Ohio-6672, 2004 WL 2848921. Furthermore, a deceptive act \u201chas the likelihood of inducing a state of mind in the consumer that is not in accord with the facts.\u201d <em>McCullough v. Spitzer Motor Ctr. </em>(Jan. 27,1994), Cuyahoga App. No. 64465, 1994 WL 24281.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">{\u00b6 24} In the instant case, Progressive titled a vehicle in accordance with the titling laws of the applicable state. As a result, the Saturn had a \u201cclean\u201d title, although it had previously been declared a total loss and was repaired before Chesnut purchased it. However, Chesnut was fully aware of the situation, as Ray\u2019s informed him that the Saturn had been damaged in a fire, and he observed the vehicle as it was being repaired. He also spent $8,500 on a car with approximately 6,000 miles on it, when the ACV was over $14,000. As Progressive stated in its brief, \u201cthis is not a ease where an unsuspecting consumer purchased a vehicle with no knowledge of its prior history and was deceived because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>vehicle\u2019s title failed to reveal that it had been damaged. Plaintiff here knew full well'that the vehicle had sustained fire damage and was able to purchase the vehicle for a fraction of its retail value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 25} We conclude that Progressive did not commit a deceptive or unfair act as contemplated by the CSPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\n<em>Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">{\u00b6 26} Finally, Chesnut argues that he did sustain a loss caused by Progressive\u2019s deception. It must be noted that Chesnut has not incurred an actual loss, as at the time the parties submitted their briefs, he was still driving the Saturn. However, Chesnut claims that the proper measure of damages in his case is the difference between the vehicle\u2019s value as it was represented to be and the actual value of the vehicle at the time of the purchase. Chesnut does not explain his measure of damages by inserting dollar amounts into his formula; therefore, we must speculate as to what exactly he means. As we see it, the represented value and the actual value were the same: $8,500 for a used vehicle that was repaired after sustaining fire damage. At no time did Progressive represent the vehicle to be anything else.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">{\u00b6 27} In summary of Chesnut\u2019s second assignment of error, he fails to establish that Progressive\u2019s acts were subject to the CSPA, let alone that they violated the statute. Additionally, Chesnut fails to establish that he suffered any damages at the hands of Progressive. His second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">{\u00b6 28} In his third and final assignment of error, Chesnut argues that \u201cthe trial court erred in granting Progressive\u2019s motion for summary judgment because there is no requirement that appellant must directly confer a benefit on Progressive to assert a claim for unjust enrichment.\u201d Specifically, Chesnut argues that although he bought the Saturn from Ray\u2019s, he conferred a benefit on Progressive because it sold the vehicle to Ray\u2019s with a \u201cclean\u201d title, making approximately $1,200 more than if it had sold the vehicle with a salvage title.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">{\u00b6 29} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201cunjust enrichment of a person occurs when he has and retains money or benefits which in justice and equity belong to another.\u201d <em>Hummel v. Hummel </em>(1938), 133 Ohio St. 520, 528, 11 O.O. 221, 14 N.E.2d 923. To establish unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must show the following: (1) a benefit conferred upon defendant by plaintiff, (2) knowledge by defendant of the benefit, and (3) the acceptance or retention by defendant of the benefit under circumstances that make it inequitable for defendant to retain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the benefit without payment of its value. <em>Hambleton v. R.G. Barry Corp. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 179, 183, 12 OBR 246, 465 N.E.2d 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">{\u00b6 30} Although the parties focus on whether the benefit was directly conferred, we find that this assignment of error can be disposed of by addressing the third prong of the unjust-enrichment test. In other words, for this claim to succeed, not only must there be an enrichment, but that enrichment must be unjust. \u201c[E]nrichment alone will not suffice to invoke the remedial powers of a court of equity. Because [the plaintiff] is seeking the equitable remedies available under a claim of unjust enrichment, it must show a superior equity so that it would be unconscionable for [the defendant] to retain the benefit.\u201d <em>Directory Seros. Group v. Staff Builders Intematl. </em>(July 12, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 78611, 2001 WL 792715.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">{\u00b6 31} In the instant case, it was not inequitable for Progressive to retain the profit from selling the Saturn to Ray\u2019s, because Progressive titled the vehicle in accordance with Louisiana titling laws. Accordingly, Chesnut\u2019s third assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b349-8\">Sweeney, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b349-9\">Gallagher, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-12\">.

It is interesting to note that the Belleville, Illinois plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys in <em>Gridley </em>are among the same attorneys who filed the case on behalf of Chesnut in the Cuyahoga County Court of <em>Common </em>Pleas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b349-10\">Sean C. Gallagher, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A5L\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">{\u00b6 32} I concur with the majority\u2019s determination that Chesnut does not have a valid Ohio CSPA claim. However, I respectfully disagree with some of the majority\u2019s analysis and conclusions regarding the CSPA claim. I also dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the grant of summary judgment on the unjust-enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">{\u00b6 33} I agree that Chesnut does not have a valid claim under Ohio\u2019s CSPA because salvage determinations are made on a case-by-case basis, compliance with Louisiana salvage laws are at issue, and \u201cthe majority of circumstances relating to the sale of the salvage vehicle in this case occurred primarily and substantially in Louisiana.\u201d See <em>Gridley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(2005), 217 Ill.2d 158, 298 Ill.Dec. 499, 840 N.E.2d 269, 275. Therefore, I believe that the majority correctly affirms the grant of summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">{\u00b6 34} Nevertheless, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the CSPA would not apply because an insurance transaction was involved. It is true that the CSPA does not apply to controversies over insurance policies and transactions. See <em>Johnson, </em>69 Ohio App.3d 249, 590 N.E.2d 761. Instead, R.C. Title 39 regulates the insurance industry with respect to matters involving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>business of insurance. This is not to say any matter involving an insurance company cannot be subject to the CSPA. As found in a similar salvage-title case, because the activity of buying and reselling cars is not an inherent part of the business of insurance, this practice is subject to the CSPA. <em>Conatzer v. Am. Mercury Ins. Co., Inc. </em>(Okla.Civ.App.2000), 15 P.3d 1252, 1255. Indeed, \u201cthere is clear authority that acts nearly identical to those alleged to have been committed * * * do provide a basis for a fraud-based consumer protection claim.\u201d Id.; <em>O\u2019Brien v. B.L.C. Ins. Co. </em>(Mo.1989), 768 S.W.2d 64. Therefore, had this action involved a vehicle titled in Ohio, then an argument could be made for application of Ohio\u2019s CSPA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 35} I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Progressive did not violate Louisiana titling laws. I believe that a question of fact has been presented as to whether the vehicle was a \u201ctotal loss\u201d under Louisiana\u2019s salvage title laws. Under La.R.S. 32:702, a \u201ctotal loss\u201d is defined as a vehicle that has \u201csustained damages equivalent to seventy-five percent or more of the market value as determined by the most current National Automobile Dealers Association Handbook [\u2018NADA Handbook\u2019].\u201d In <em>Clark v. McNabb </em>(La.App.2004), 878 So.2d 677, 681, the Louisiana court indicated that the valuation method used by the trial court is a question of fact. The court further stated that in valuing a vehicle, a trial court is not limited to the NADA Handbook and may value the vehicle based upon its own assessment of the evidence presented. Id. Similarly, the value of the damages sustained by the vehicle is a question of fact to be determined upon the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 36} In this case, there is a clear disparity as to the value to repair the vehicle. Progressive refers to the initial $9,921.36 estimate to repair the vehicle, which amounted to approximately 69 percent of the actual cash value. Based on this estimate, Chesnut alleges, Progressive obtained a clean title. However, this estimate did not include a supplement of $3,968.54 that was allegedly used by Progressive to declare the vehicle a total loss for purposes of paying its insured a cash value for the vehicle and subsequently selling it to an auto rebuilding company with a clean title. There is also the question of the actual cost to repair the vehicle. Since an issue of fact exists as to whether the vehicle was a \u201ctotal loss\u201d for which a salvage title should have been obtained, summary judgment would not be appropriate on this issue. Nevertheless, as stated above, I do not believe that Ohio\u2019s CSPA applies to this action because the conduct occurred outside Ohio, and, therefore, I would affirm the grant of summary judgment on the CSPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>{\u00b6 37} With respect to the unjust-enrichment claim, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that this claim must fail because the vehicle was titled in accordance with Louisiana law. Again, I do not believe that this court can decide the issue of fact involving the cost of repair and whether the vehicle was a \u201ctotal loss.\u201d As was the case in <em>Gridley, </em>217 Ill.2d 158, 298 Ill.Dec. 499, 840 N.E.2d 269, I believe that this cause should have been dismissed on grounds of forum non conveniens in favor of a Louisiana forum.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\">. It appears from the record that the claim should have been made under Louisiana's CSPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
