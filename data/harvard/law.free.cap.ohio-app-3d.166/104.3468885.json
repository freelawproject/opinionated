Because we conclude that the trial court erred in its determinations, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, Elizabeth A. Avent, and appellee, Billy R. Avent Sr., were married in 1978 and executed a prenuptial agreement, which stated that the parties desired to keep each of their financial estates separate and that any property owned by them prior to or acquired after the marriage would remain their separate properties. Each waived any claims against the other arising \u201cby force of the contemplated marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">{\u00b6 3} Billy filed for divorce in December 2003. At the time of trial in December 2004, he was 86 years old, his wife was 81, and both were retired. The trial court found that the parties were unable to remember many important facts about their earned income over the years or their present assets. The following summarizes the court\u2019s factual findings or other undisputed facts presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">{\u00b6 4} Billy retired in 1983, after 43 years of employment with the same company. He received $141,274 as a lump-sum retirement distribution from that employment, which was placed in \u201cseparate IRA [Individual Retirement Accounts] accounts.\u201d His yearly income included $14,628 from Social Security plus $9,118 from his IRA, for a total of $23,746.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">{\u00b6 5} Elizabeth retired in 1986, after working for 11 years as a cafeteria worker. Her yearly income totaled $12,814, which included $461 per month from Social Security, $169 per month from School Employees Retirement System (\u201cSERS\u201d) and $4,000 to $5,000 per year in withdrawals from \u201cher present assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">{\u00b6 6} Billy\u2019s grandson, a financial consultant, testified regarding the present value of assets in Billy\u2019s name, which the court valued at $129,078. He stated that he had been handling his grandfather\u2019s finances since 1997. Elizabeth\u2019s assets were valued as follows. During the pendency of the divorce action, Elizabeth\u2019s assets were placed in two trusts: the Avent Irrevocable Trust and the Elizabeth A. Avent Living Trust. The Avent Irrevocable Trust consisted of Elizabeth\u2019s home and 278 bonds. Elizabeth\u2019s accountant said that the bonds had a cost basis of $99,175, with a future value of $245,852. The court stated that interest income on the bonds until maturity was projected to be $155,677. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>court also valued Elizabeth\u2019s marital portion of appreciation on her house at $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">{\u00b6 7} The court valued Elizabeth\u2019s living trust (\u201crevocable trust\u201d) at $188,049, which included cash gifts made to her daughter and various bank accounts that were all solely in Elizabeth\u2019s name. The court declared that the appreciation on the wife\u2019s house was marital, awarding her the $30,000 appreciation of that property and an additional $60,000 \u201cin consideration of her share of husband\u2019s separate pension, the fact that there will be no spousal support, and assets she claims and accountant deemed to be inherited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">{\u00b6 8} The court determined that all of Elizabeth\u2019s bank accounts, bonds, or other cash assets held in her own name were marital because she had failed to adequately trace her \u201cseparate property\u201d owned prior to the marriage to her present assets. The court stated that Billy had traced his property sufficiently, awarding him the $129,078 of assets in his name. In addition, the court ordered Elizabeth to transfer to Billy one-half of her bonds placed in the irrevocable trust and to pay Billy an additional $64,045, one-half of the remaining assets in Elizabeth\u2019s name ($188,089 minus $60,000 equals $128,089 divided by two).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">{\u00b6 9} Neither spouse was awarded spousal support, both spouses were ordered to pay their own attorney fees, and court costs were to be split equally between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">{\u00b6 10} Elizabeth now appeals from that decision, arguing the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cI. The Trial Court erred to the prejudice of the Appellant by requiring the tracing of separate assets that had not been found to have been commingled.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cII. The Court abused its discretion in finding that Appellant had failed to prove her financial accounts to be separate property by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cHI. The Court abused its discretion and committed prejudicial error in making a distributive award from Appellant\u2019s separate property without considering all of the factors set forth in R.C. 3105.171(F)(1) through (9).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">{\u00b6 14} In her first assignment of error, Elizabeth argues that the trial court erred in requiring her to trace assets that were never commingled with her husband\u2019s funds and that the appreciation of her home should have been deemed separate property. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">{\u00b6 15} In a divorce action, the domestic relations court is required to determine whether property is separate or marital and to divide both marital and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>separate property equitably. R.C. 3105.171(B). Marital property generally includes all property acquired by either party during the marriage as well as the appreciation of separate property due to the labor, monetary, or in-kind contributions of either party during the marriage. R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a)(i) and (iii). Marital property is to be divided equally in general, and each spouse is considered to have contributed equally to the acquisition of marital property. R.C. 3105.171(C)(1) and (2). However, marital property does not include separate property. R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(b). Under R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(v), separate property includes any real or personal property that is excluded by a valid antenuptial agreement. Thus, Ohio law specifically allows for property that would normally be considered marital to be excluded from a division of marital property by a valid antenuptial agreement. <em>Todd v. Todd </em>(May 4, 2000), 10th Disk, No. 99AP-659, 2000 WL 552311.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">{\u00b6 16} An antenuptial agreement is a contract entered into between a man and a woman in contemplation, and in consideration, of their future marriage whereby the property rights and economic interests of either the prospective wife or husband are determined and set forth in a written instrument. <em>Gross v. Gross </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 99, 102, 11 OBR 400, 464 N.E.2d 500. The law of contracts applies to the interpretation and application of antenuptial agreements. <em>Fletcher v. Fletcher </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 464, 467, 628 N.E.2d 1343. The interpretation of a contract that is clear and unambiguous is a question of law, and no issue of fact exists to be determined. <em>State ex rel. Parsons v. Fleming </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 509, 511, 628 N.E.2d 1377; <em>Davis v. Loopco Industries, </em>Inc (1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 64, 66, 609 N.E.2d 144. On appeal, questions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Wiltberger v. Davis </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 46, 51-52, 673 N.E.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">{\u00b6 17} In Ohio, antenuptial agreements are 'Valid and enforceable \u201c(1) if they have been entered into freely without fraud, duress, coercion, or overreaching; (2) if there was full disclosure, or full knowledge and understanding of the nature, value and extent of the prospective spouse\u2019s property; and (3) if the terms do not promote or encourage divorce or profiteering by divorce.\u201d <em>Gross, </em>11 Ohio St.3d 99, 11 OBR 400, 464 N.E.2d 500, paragraph two of the syllabus. See, also, <em>Fletcher, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 466, 628 N.E.2d 1343. If parties have freely entered into a prenuptial agreement, a court should not substitute its judgment and amend the contract. <em>Gross, </em>11 Ohio St.3d at 109, 11 OBR 400, 464 N.E.2d 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">{\u00b6 18} In the present case, the parties entered into a prenuptial agreement that clearly expressed, \u201c[I]t is mutually desired and agreed by the parties that the estate of each of the parties shall remain separate, as well after as previous to the solemnization\u201d of their marriage. The agreement states further that the husband\u2019s estate \u201cshall remain and be his separate property, subject entirely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>his individual control and use, <em>the same as if he were unmarried; </em>and that the second party [wife] shall not acquire <em>by force of the contemplated marriage </em>for herself, her heirs, assigns or creditors any interests <em>in his property </em>or estate, or right to the control thereof, and the second party shall and <em>does hereby waive, release, and relinquish, </em>and shall by these presents be barred from any and all claim or rights of dower, year\u2019s support, right to live in the mansion house, property exempt from administration, distributive share or intestate share of the other\u2019s estate, from any and all claims or rights as widow, heir, distributee, survivor, or next of kin, and <em>any and all other claims, to the property of the first party now owned or hereafter acquired.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">{\u00b6 19} In the following paragraph, the agreement sets forth the same language with reference to Elizabeth\u2019s estate and control, with Billy waiving all rights to any property owned or acquired by Elizabeth. In other words, the agreement indicates the parties\u2019 intent to keep separate not only the property owned at the time of the marriage, but also any increase in value or additional property each might separately acquire during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">{\u00b6 20} In this case, the record shows that the parties never commingled their funds in joint bank accounts and never owned real estate together. All bank accounts and stocks were maintained in each party\u2019s separate name prior to and after the marriage. Billy\u2019s retirement distribution was placed in his own separate account. Likewise, any funds or inheritance monies received by Elizabeth were placed in her own accounts. Since the antenuptial agreement specifically provided that each party waived any rights to each other\u2019s property acquired prior to or after the marriage, any funds or assets separately owned by the parties, which had never been commingled, remained their separate properties. No evidence was presented that any of Elizabeth\u2019s funds were ever commingled with or taken from Billy\u2019s funds. Therefore, Elizabeth\u2019s accounts, which had always been separately maintained, remained her own separate property, and no tracing was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">{\u00b6 21} In addition, although Billy testified that he had paid for certain expenses related to Elizabeth\u2019s home over the years, the antenuptial agreement specifically states that he agreed to waive any claim to property acquired after or arising \u201cby force of\u2019 the marriage, i.e., a claim for a contribution to the appreciation of the home where the parties resided. Moreover, there was nothing in the record to indicate the exact amounts of his alleged payments or other contributions, or that they significantly affected the appreciation of the property value beyond what would have naturally occurred. We also note that at the time of the marriage, Billy owned two homes that he no longer owned at the time of the divorce. Presumably, by virtue of his living in Elizabeth\u2019s home, he was able to sell or otherwise dispose of those properties to his advantage, with no accounting or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>credit to wife. Consequently, under the terms of the antenuptial agreement, any appreciation on Elizabeth\u2019s home was separate property. Therefore, under the facts of this case, we conclude that the trial court erred in failing to designate the assets owned by each party as their separate property, not subject to division as marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">{\u00b6 22} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken. In light of our disposition of the first assignment of error, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 23} In her third assignment of error, Elizabeth asserts that the trial court failed to properly consider the factors set forth in R.C. 3105.171(F), and erred in distributing her separate property to appellee. Again, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">{\u00b6 24} As we previously determined, the court erroneously ruled that Elizabeth\u2019s accounts were marital because she had not adequately traced the funds. In making the property division, the court then erroneously divided and awarded a portion of Elizabeth\u2019s assets to Billy. The court stated that Elizabeth had acted \u201ccontrary to Court Order\u201d by \u201cdiverting\u201d funds to the two trust accounts and to her daughter and by her failure to amend and update the initial asset list filed with her answer. Nothing in the record, however, demonstrates that Elizabeth, who relied on her daughter and financial consultants to advise her, attempted to hide or dissipate assets by placing them in trust. In addition, Elizabeth executed the trusts when no divorce proceedings were pending, on the advice of an attorney and financial consultant, and considering her age.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">{\u00b6 25} Furthermore, although noting that the frequent moving of Elizabeth\u2019s funds made it \u201cvery difficult to exactly trace the past and present assets,\u201d the court never made an actual finding of misconduct or dissipation of marital assets. In fact, the court recognized that both parties were elderly and had trouble remembering many financial details spanning their 25-year marriage. Thus, since appellant\u2019s assets were, in fact, her separate property and within her sole control, her decision to give away money or to place some of her money and property in trust was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">{\u00b6 26} The trial court further stated that it had considered the factors in R.C. 3105.171(F) and had awarded an inequitable distribution of \u201cmarital assets held by wife\u201d solely because she could not trace her assets. Nothing in the final judgment indicates that the court awarded these assets on the basis of any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>factor in R.C. 3105.171(F). Again, since we determined that the tracing of assets held solely in appellant\u2019s name was not required and there was no misconduct by appellant regarding her assets, the trial court erred in distributing a portion of Elizabeth\u2019s assets to husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">{\u00b6 27} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 28} Pursuant to App.R. 12(B), this court hereby renders the judgment that should have been rendered by the trial court and therefore modifies paragraphs two through seven of page seven of the trial court\u2019s divorce decree judgment entry as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cWHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c2. For the purpose of making a division of marital property, the period of time \u201cduring the marriage\u201d was from the date of the marriage through the day of the trial. The parties are bound by the terms of a valid antenuptial agreement which provided that each waived any claim or rights to the other\u2019s property owned prior to or acquired after the marriage. After considering that the parties at all times conducted their financial affairs separately and that no evidence of commingling of funds was presented, we conclude that, under the language of the antenuptial agreement, there is no marital property to divide.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c3. Wife shall keep, as her separate property, the real estate at 2332 Dana Street and any appreciation in its value. Wife shall further keep all assets, including bank accounts and stocks which are solely owned by her or in her name. Wife shall also keep her personal property to which the parties stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c4. Husband shall keep, as his separate property, all funds and accounts relating to his retirement distribution, and any other assets, including bank accounts, stocks, or other funds, which are solely owned by him or in his name. Husband shall also keep his personal property to which the parties stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c5. Pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement, neither shall pay spousal support to the other and the Court does not retain jurisdiction over the issue of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c6. Each party shall pay his/her outstanding debts, attorney fees and costs. After application of the initial filing fee(s), the parties shall equally pay the remaining court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cIT IS SO ORDERED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">{\u00b6 37} The judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, is reversed and modified as designated in this decision. Appellee is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Lucas County.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-6\">Handwork and Pietrykowski, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-10\">.
