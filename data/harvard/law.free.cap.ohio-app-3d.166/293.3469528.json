Gallagher, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b334-17\">{\u00b6 1} In July 2005, the Council of the City of Cleveland enacted and the mayor approved Cleveland Codified Ordinances 413.031, which is titled \u201cUse of Automated Cameras to Impose Civil Penalties upon Red Light and Speeding Violators.\u201d Cleveland Codified Ordinances 413.031(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-18\"><em>Civil enforcement system established. </em>The City of Cleveland hereby adopts a civil enforcement system for red light and speeding offenders photographed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>means of an \u201cautomated traffic enforcement camera system\u201d as defined in division (m). This civil enforcement system imposes monetary liability on the owner of a vehicle for failure of an operator to stop at a traffic signal displaying a steady red light indication or for the failure of an operator to comply with a speed limitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">{\u00b6 2} Under Cleveland Codified Ordinances 413.031, the city will mail a notice of liability to the owner of a vehicle photographed by the automated traffic enforcement system for red light or speeding violations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\"><em>Notices of liability. </em>Any ticket for an automated red light or speeding system violation under this section shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">(1) Be reviewed by a Cleveland police officer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">(2) Be forwarded by first-class mail or personal service to the vehicle\u2019s registered owner\u2019s address as given on the state\u2019s motor vehicle registration, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">(3) Clearly state the manner in which the violation may be appealed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Cleveland Codified Ordinances 413.031(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">{\u00b6 3} A party who receives a notice of liability may contest the ticket by filing a notice of appeal within 21 days from the date listed on the ticket. \u201cAppeals shall be heard by the Parking Violations Bureau through an administrative process established by the Clerk of the Cleveland Municipal Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">{\u00b6 4} Relators have named the city of Cleveland, the council, and the Parking Violations Bureau and Photo Safety Division as respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">{\u00b6 5} Relator Stuart Scott avers that he received two notices of liability for speeding violations. Relator Kathy Scheid avers that her husband received a notice of liability for speeding and that she notified the city that she had been driving the vehicle. Relator Clemente Kollin (whose affidavit reflects the name \u201cClement Kollin\u201d) avers that he received a notice of liability for speeding. Scott also avers that the parking violations bureau has scheduled a hearing on April 25, 2006. The other relators aver that they have requested appeal hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">{\u00b6 6} Relators challenge the use of automated cameras to impose civil penalties upon red light and speeding violators. They request that this court issue a writ of prohibition that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-15\">A. Permanently enjoins Respondents from conducting <em>any </em>hearings with respect to its Automated System or Ordinance through the parking violations bureau;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>B. Permanently enjoins Respondents from issuing any Notices of Liability with respect to its Automated System created by the Ordinance * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5N\">(Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">{\u00b6 7} Initially, we note that the averments in relators\u2019 complaint are not sufficient to establish that the council and the parking violations bureau are proper parties to this action. That is, relators have not averred facts that would demonstrate that the council or the parking violations bureau have the capacity to be sued. Cf. <em>Richardson v. Grady </em>(Dec. 18, 2000), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 77381 and 77403, 2000 WL 1847588 (plaintiff had not demonstrated that the \u201cCleveland Police Department\u201d was sui juris, citing <em>Cuyahoga Falls v. Robart </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 1, 6, 567 N.E.2d 987, for the proposition that \u201ca city council, absent statutory authority, is not <em>sui juris </em>\u201d). Rather, the real party in interest is the city. See R.C. 715.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">{\u00b6 8} The criteria for the issuance of a writ of prohibition are well established.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">In order to be entitled to a writ of prohibition, [relator] had to establish that (1) the [respondent] is about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power, (2) the exercise of such power is unauthorized by law, and (3) denial of the writ will cause injury to [relator] for which no other adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law exists. <em>State ex rel. White v. Junkin </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 335, 336, 686 N.E.2d 267, 268.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\"><em>State ex rel. Wright v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 184, 185, 718 N.E.2d 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>Wright, </em>supra, the Supreme Court affirmed this court\u2019s judgment in <em>State ex rel. Wright v. Registrar, Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(Apr. 29, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 76044, 1999 WL 258240, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">A two-part test must be employed by this Court in order to determine whether a writ of prohibition should be issued. <em>State ex rel. East Mfg. Corp. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 179[, 586 N.E.2d 105]; <em>Dayton Metro. Hous. Auth. v. Dayton Human Relations Council </em>(1992), 81 Ohio App.3d 436[, 611 N.E.2d 384]. Initially, we must determine whether the respondent patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed. The second step involves the determination of whether the relator possesses an adequate remedy at law. <em>State ex rel. Natalina Food Co. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 98[, 562 N.E.2d 1383],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">{\u00b6 10} Respondents do not contest that the civil hearing process established by Cleveland Codified Ordinances 413.031 involves an exercise of quasi-judicial power. Relators contend, however, that respondents are patently and unambiguously without jurisdiction to exercise that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Relators argue that Codified Ordinances 413.031 violates a variety of provisions in the Ohio Constitution requiring equal protection, due process, and confrontation of witnesses, and also violates the separation-of-powers doctrine. They assert that only the Cleveland Municipal Court has jurisdiction over speeding infractions in Cleveland. They also contend that R.C. 4521.04 permits a municipal corporation or township to create a parking violations bureau \u201cto handle all parking infractions,\u201d not moving violations such as speeding. Relators also argue that the city lacked the authority to change a criminal or traffic offense into a civil liability. Compare <em>State v. Rosa </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 556, 561, 716 N.E.2d 216 (an ordinance that \u201cchanged the classification of the offense of committing deceptive acts or practices in connection with consumer transactions from a civil violation to a criminal violation\u201d was held to be unconstitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">{\u00b6 12} Relators also assert that various procedures established by Codified Ordinances 413.031 are grounds for determining that respondents lack the authority to enforce speeding violations. Relators observe that the hearing officer, who presides over appeals arising from notices of liability issued for speeding violations, need not be a judge or magistrate and \u2014 as a consequence\u2014 the proceedings fail to comply with Traf.R. 14, Civ.R. 53, and Crim.R. 19. Relators also contend that regular mail service \u2014 which is an option under Codified Ordinances 413.031 \u2014 is inadequate to comply with Traf.R. 3. Finally, relators assert that Codified Ordinances 413.031(i) \u2014 which expressly prohibits assessing points \u2014 is contrary to law because R.C. 4510.036(B) and (C)(ll) require that a court hearing a traffic offense assess points.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">{\u00b6 13} Respondents correctly assert that legislation is presumed to be constitutional. <em>N. Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v. Parma </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 375, 377, 15 O.O.3d 450, 402 N.E.2d 519. They also emphasize that Codified Ordinances 413.031 clearly involves civil liability and administrative enforcement. On its face, Codified Ordinances 413.031 is not criminal in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">{\u00b6 14} Respondents also assert that Codified Ordinances 413.031 is a proper exercise of local authority. \u201cMunicipalities shall have authority to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general laws.\u201d Section 3, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution (Home Rule Amendment). \u201cThus, a municipality may regulate in an area such as traffic whenever its regulation is not in conflict with the general laws of the state.\u201d <em>Linndale v. State </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 52, 54, 706 N.E.2d 1227. Respondents contend that there is no conflict between Codified Ordinances 413.031 and R.C. Chapter 4521 (which governs local, noncriminal parking violations and, in R.C. 4521.04, authorizes the creation of a parking violations bureau) because R.C. Chapter 4521 is not a general law. Also, respondents argue that Codified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Ordinances 413.031 does not permit what R.C. Chapter 4521 prohibits or vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">{\u00b6 15} Respondents also observe that Codified Ordinances 413.031 authorizes the clerk\u2019s examiners to hear appeals from speeding violations. See, also, Codified Ordinances 459.03, which establishes the parking violations bureau. Respondents argue that the actions of the parking violations bureau through the photo safety division does not add to or subtract from the authorization under R.C. Chapter 4521 to hear parking infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">{\u00b6 16} Additionally, respondents refute relators\u2019 argument that the exclusion of points requires relief in prohibition. That is, respondents contend that R.C. 4510.036 (requiring the assessment of points) applies to courts. Furthermore, respondents observe that a municipality may provide for different penalties for an infraction than those set forth in state law without creating a conflict between local and state law. <em>Niles v. Howard </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 162, 165, 12 OBR 232, 466 N.E.2d 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\"> {\u00b6 17} The discussion above reflects that neither relators nor respondents have provided this court with clearly controlling authority regarding the issue presented in this case: whether a municipality is patently and unambiguously without jurisdiction to impose civil liability for speeding violations photographed by an automated traffic-enforcement camera system. \u201cProhibition should be used with great caution and not issue in a doubtful case.\u201d <em>Rivers v. Ramsey, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 87763, 2006-Ohio-1744, 2006 WL 890916, at \u00b64. Relators have failed to demonstrate that the city is patently and unambiguously without jurisdiction to issue notices of liability and to hear appeals with regard to speeding violations under Codified Ordinances 413.031.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">{\u00b6 18} It should be noted that we make no determination of the merits of relators\u2019 claims or of respondents\u2019 arguments. Rather, what we must conclude is that the lack of controlling authority preventing the city <em>from </em>proceeding under Codified Ordinances 413.031 makes granting relief in prohibition inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">{\u00b6 19} We also note that relators did not attempt to argue that they lack an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. Respondents state that a party who is dissatisfied with the outcome of an administrative appeal under Codified Ordinances 413.031 may prosecute an appeal in the court of common pleas under R.C. Chapter 2506. Relators have not refuted this argument. \u201cThe proposition that where a right of appeal exists there is an adequate remedy at law is too well established to require citation of authorities.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kendrick v. Masheter </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 232, 233, 27 O.O.2d 128, 199 N.E.2d 13. If parties prosecute their challenges to Codified Ordinances 413.031 through an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>administrative appeal, they will then have an opportunity to challenge the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">{\u00b6 20} Additionally, we note that the nature of the relief requested by relators is that of a prohibitory injunction. (See the quotation above from the ad damnum clause of the complaint in which relators request that this court issue a writ of prohibition that \u201cenjoins\u201d respondents.) Prohibition is not appropriate. Cf. <em>Tatman v. Fairfield Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 425, 2004-Ohio-3701, 811 N.E.2d 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">{\u00b6 21} Accordingly, we deny relators\u2019 application for an alternative writ and dismiss this action against all respondents sua sponte for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Relators to pay costs. The clerk is directed to serve upon the parties notice of this judgment and its date of entry upon the journal. Civ.R. 58(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Complaint dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-7\">McMonagle and Corrigan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
