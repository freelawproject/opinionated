Hayes, appeals from his conviction and sentence, following a bench trial, for having a weapon under disability. Hayes contends that his conviction is both against the manifest weight of the evidence and unsupported by sufficient evidence because the state did not adequately prove that the handgun found in his car was in his possession. Hayes also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>contends that his conviction is factually inconsistent with the trial court\u2019s verdict of acquittal on the companion charge of carrying a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that testimony concerning the circumstances under which the handgun was found, including its precise location and orientation under Hayes\u2019s car seat, constitute a sufficient factual basis for the trial court to conclude, as it did, that the handgun was possessed by Hayes. We also conclude that, as the trial court explained on the record, there is no factual inconsistency in its verdict, because the trial court based its acquittal of the companion charge of carrying a concealed weapon upon its conclusion that the state had failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the element of concealment. Furthermore, even if Hayes\u2019s conviction of having a weapon under disability were factually inconsistent with his acquittal of carrying a concealed weapon, that would not afford a basis for reversal. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">{\u00b6 3} In the early afternoon, in late June 2004, Dayton police officers were canvassing an area looking for suspects in a reported robbery. Hayes was driving a pickup truck in an alley in the area. There were three passengers, one in the front seat and two in the back seat. When the truck was stopped as a result of the actions of two different police vehicles, one a marked cruiser and the other unmarked, the passenger in the front seat got out and ran away. He was eventually captured with a gun in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">{\u00b6 4} Meanwhile, police officer John J. Beall removed Hayes from the truck. Officer Michael Baker, who went after the fleeing passenger, had earlier seen Hayes bend down \u201clike he was stuffing something under the seat.\u201d Upon his return to the truck, Baker and another officer removed the remaining two passengers from the back of the truck, and Baker secured one of these passengers in his cruiser. Upon returning to the truck after having secured the passenger, Baker saw a handgun under the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">{\u00b6 5} Hayes was arrested and charged by indictment with one count of having a weapon under a disability and one count of carrying a concealed weapon. Following a bench trial, Hayes was acquitted of carrying a concealed weapon, but convicted of having a weapon under a disability. He was sentenced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">{\u00b6 6} From his conviction and sentence, Hayes appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">{\u00b6 7} Hayes\u2019s first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe appellant\u2019s conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence and is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">{\u00b6 9} A conviction for having a weapon under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13, requires a finding that the offender \u201cacquirefd], ha[d], carried], or use[d] any firearm or dangerous ordnance\u201d while under certain defined disabilities. In this assignment of error, Hayes contends that the evidence in the record does not permit a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the handgun found under his seat was \u201chad\u201d or carried, i.e., possessed by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">{\u00b6 10} Baker testified that he found the gun, a Beretta, leaning against the transmission hump separating the driver\u2019s side of the truck floor from the passenger\u2019s side. The barrel of the gun was underneath the seat; \u201cthe handle was upwards. It was leaning against the hump.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">{\u00b6 11} The trial court, in its questioning of Baker, refined the placement of the gun as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe court: You\u2019ve described, if you have the weapon there, and you want to use the side of the witness stand, say that\u2019s the hump there and you\u2019re over this way where the Court is looking into the side of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe witness: This is the transmission hump right here?</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe court: Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe witness: This is the gun. It\u2019s laying like this.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe court: Now, this being a bench seat, what I\u2019m trying to get is you could see the handle sticking up, but the barrel part you could not see, is that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe witness: That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-14\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe court: And was it just laying against this hump, or was any part of it under the seat?</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe witness: I would say the seat would be right here. I could see the back of the handle of the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe court:. So you\u2019re saying part of the barrel was under the seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-17\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe witness: Yes. I would say three-fourths of this gun was underneath the seat. The seat was right here, and when I came out, because those doors open really wide, and when I came around the corner I looked down and saw this much \u2014 the back of the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-18\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe court: And the way you\u2019re describing it or holding it at this point is that the barrel of the gun it was partially under the seat pointed towards the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-19\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe witness: Towards the rear, yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe court: And not towards the front.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe witness: That is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">{\u00b6 26} When police first questioned Hayes about the gun recovered from under his .seat, he claimed that it belonged to his front-seat passenger. When it was pointed out to him that a gun was recovered from the front-seat passenger, Hayes had no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">{\u00b6 27} At trial, Hayes\u2019s attorney theorized that the gun recovered from under Hayes\u2019s seat had belonged to one of the back-seat passengers, who had put it there when the truck was stopped, after Hayes was removed from the front seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">{\u00b6 28} There was undisputed testimony that the front seat of the truck was a bench seat going all the way across the width of the cab. In other words, there was no break in the middle through which one of the back-seat passengers could have reached to place a handgun underneath the driver\u2019s front seat, with only one-quarter of the length of the weapon extending from the forward edge of the seat. Three of the police officers who were at the scene testified. Although each one may have had one or more periods of time when their attention was focused elsewhere, none of them noticed any movement by the back-seat passengers before they were removed from the truck. Under these circumstances, the trial court could conclude that in order to have placed the Beretta under the driver\u2019s seat in the place where it was found, one of the back-seat passengers would have had to have climbed all the way over onto the front seat and then back, which would have been noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">{\u00b6 29} Hayes\u2019s trial counsel argued that one of the back-seat passengers could have kicked the Beretta underneath the front seat into the position in which it was found. The trial court, in rejecting this theory, gave a compelling reason for its conclusion:</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThere\u2019s speculation that somebody could have kicked the weapon underneath. Well, if somebody would have done that, it would not have ended up in the position it did like this with the handle up and the barrel pointing at the back. You couldn\u2019t kick it into that position in the Court\u2019s view.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">{\u00b6 31} Obviously, we were not in the courtroom when the witness, Baker, demonstrated how the Beretta was oriented under the passenger seat, or later when the trial court evidently also physically demonstrated how the Beretta was oriented (\u201clike this with the handle up\u201d), but we conclude from the transcript of Baker\u2019s testimony and the context that the Beretta was found with its handle lying up against the rise of the transmission hump, so that the handle was not lying flat on the floor, but was rising upward at an angle caused by its lying against the transmission hump. We agree with the trial court that it is not reasonable to suppose that the gun could have wound up in this position if it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>been kicked underneath the front seat from the floor behind the front seat. Although the gun might have slid forward to a position, handle-first, extending a little beyond the edge of the front seat as a result of being shoved, or kicked, by the end of the barrel from behind the seat, it is difficult to see how it could have wound up with the handle propped up, leaning against the transmission hump.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">{\u00b6 32} We conclude that the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable finder of fact to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hayes placed the gun in the position in which it was found. Nor is this conclusion against the manifest weight of the evidence. Hayes\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">{\u00b6 33} Hayes\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe appellant\u2019s conviction for having weapons while under disability must be reversed since it is inconsistent with his acquittal for carrying a concealed weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">{\u00b6 35} To begin with, we agree with the state that a conviction on one count of an indictment may not be reversed upon the ground that it is inconsistent with an acquittal on another count. <em>State v. Brown, </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 147, 12 OBR 186, 465 N.E.2d 889; <em>State v. Washington </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 264, 710 N.E.2d 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">{\u00b6 36} Furthermore, because this was a bench trial, we have the benefit of the trial court\u2019s expressed reasoning for its acquittal on the count of carrying a concealed weapon:</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cBut in the Court\u2019s view on the element of concealing, there is a reasonable doubt that the weapon was in fact concealed as required by the definition, which says it\u2019s not concealed if it\u2019s readily observable by a person close enough to see it. Since both of these guys could see it standing outside of the vehicle, in the Court\u2019s view that\u2019s readily observable.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cSo the Court would find the defendant not guilty of having a concealed weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">{\u00b6 39} Hayes argues that he cannot logically have been found (1) to have possessed the weapon for purposes of the count of having a weapon under disability but (2) not to have possessed the weapon for the purposes of the count of carrying a concealed weapon. But this logical analysis ignores the fact that his acquittal by the trial court on the count of carrying a concealed weapon was not based upon any failure of proof on the element of possession, but was based, instead, upon a perceived failure of proof on the element of concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">{\u00b6 40} Hayes\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>rv</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">{\u00b6 41} Both of Hayes\u2019s assignments of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b837-7\">Grady, P.J., and Wolff, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
