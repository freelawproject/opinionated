Subsequently, her parents, Brenda Kay Sanders and William Bragg, divorced. After a shared parenting plan failed, William was designated W.K.M.\u2019s residential parent in October 2002. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>The domestic relations court also granted visitation to Linda Meyer, W.KM.\u2019s maternal grandmother, and her husband, Allen Meyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 3} William was arrested on April 15, 2003, for a criminal offense that had occurred prior to W.KM.\u2019s birth. William was convicted and has remained incarcerated since that date. It appears that Brenda, W.K.M.\u2019s mother, is also incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">{\u00b6 4} On June 23, 2003, a magistrate of the domestic relations court issued a decision granting legal custody of W.K.M. to Linda. The decision stated, inter alia, that \u201c[n]o child support will be ordered at this time as a result of both plaintiff (William) and defendant (Brenda) being incarcerated.\u201d The domestic relations court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision on the date it was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">{\u00b6 5} On June 6, 2005, Linda Meyer filed a petition in the probate court to adopt W.K.M. Linda noted that W.KM.\u2019s mother consented to the adoption, and she alleged that William\u2019s consent was not required because he had failed without justifiable cause to provide for the maintenance and support of W.K.M. for one year immediately preceding the filing of the adoption petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">{\u00b6 6} Following a hearing, the probate court found justifiable cause for William\u2019s failure to provide maintenance and support for W.K.M. and that his consent to her adoption is therefore required. Such an order is a final order. <em>In re Adoption of Greer </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 293, 638 N.E.2d 999. Linda filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">\n<em>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that appellee\u2019s failure to support his daughter was justified and therefore his consent was required in order for the appellants to adopt his daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">{\u00b6 8} The probate court may not grant a petition to adopt a minor child absent the consent of the child\u2019s parent. R.C. 3107.06(A). However, the consent of a parent is not required for adoption if the court finds that \u201cthe parent has failed without justifiable cause * * * to provide for the maintenance and support of the minor as required by law or judicial decree for a period of at least one year immediately preceding * * * the filing of the adoption petition\u201d R.C. 3107.07(A). The petitioner for adoption \u201chas the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, both (1) that the natural parent has failed to support the child for the requisite one-year period, and (2) that this failure was without justifiable cause.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Bovett </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 102, 515 N.E.2d 919, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>{\u00b6 9} It is undisputed that William did not provide maintenance or support for W.K.M. during the one-year period immediately preceding the petition for adoption. However, because the domestic relations court\u2019s June 23, 2003 order provided that \u201c[n]o child support will be ordered\u201d when temporary custody of W.K.M. was awarded to Linda, the probate court found that, being thus relieved of his duty of support, William had justifiable cause for his failure to provide maintenance or support. The court held that \u201c[t]he common law duty to support was incorporated in the [domestic relation court\u2019s] judicial decree and therefore the father complied with the order.\u201d We agree, based on our holding in <em>In re Adoption of Stephens </em>(Dec. 21, 2001), Montgomery App. No. 18956, 2001 WL 1636284.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Stephens, </em>the juvenile court entered an order granting legal custody to a child\u2019s paternal grandparents, and with respect to the child\u2019s mother stated that \u201cthere shall be no child support order at this time.\u201d Upon the grandparents\u2019 subsequent petition for adoption, the probate court found that the child\u2019s mother had failed, without justifiable cause, to provide support for the child. We reversed the probate court\u2019s decision, holding that the juvenile court\u2019s order relieving the mother of her support obligation superseded the mother\u2019s statutory duty of support. Thus, because the mother was not required by law or judicial decree to provide support for the child, her failure to provide maintenance and support was justified. Similarly, in the present case, the domestic relations court\u2019s order superseded William\u2019s statutory duty of support and justifies his failure to support for purposes of R.C. 3107.07(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">{\u00b6 11} Linda attempts to limit our application of <em>Stephens </em>by reference to <em>In re Placement for Adoption of C.E.T., </em>Montgomery App. No. 19566, 2003-Ohio-3783, 2003 WL 21658682. However, <em>C.E.T. </em>is distinguishable from <em>Stephens, </em>Montgomery App. No. 18956, 2001 WL 1636284, and the facts before us, because <em>C.E.T. </em>did not involve a court order that excused the objecting parent from any obligation to support her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">{\u00b6 12} The assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the probate court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b727-9\">Fain and Donovan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
