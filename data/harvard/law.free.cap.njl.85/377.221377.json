The horse died before the bailment terminated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\">The court, sitting without a jury, found the defendant guilty of negligence, \u201cthat the defendant agreed to return the horse in as good a condition as it was when bailed, as an inducement to the plaintiff\u201d to make the bailment, and that the value of the horse was $200. Judgment accordingly was rendered for the plaintiff. The defence is that there was no proof of misuse of the horse. The findings of the judge upon the disputed facts are conclusive here, when there is any evidence, as in this case, to support them.</p>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b418-6\">The judgment will be affirmed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-7\">For the appellant, <em>George 8.
