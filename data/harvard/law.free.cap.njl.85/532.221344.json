JOSEPHINE A. BERENDGE ET AL.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b572-5\">Submitted December 4, 1913</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AJb\">Decided March 4, 1914.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b572-6\">1. Where there is no proof of authority or agency, or of ratification by the party sought to be held liable, a purchase of goods entered into by written contract, in the name of the nominal principals, by a clerk in their employ, without their knowledge or consent, is not binding upon the principal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b572-7\">2. A finding of fact by the trial court without any testimony to support it, upon which liability is predicated, will be reviewed by this court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-8\">On appeal from Second District Court, of Newark.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b572-9\">Before Justices Gaeeison, Teen chard and Minturn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b572-10\">For the plaintiff, <em>Theodore McC. Marsh.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b572-11\">For the defendants, <em>Robert II. Cunningham.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b572-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b572-13\">Minturn, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af8\">The stipulated facts show that a contract for a supply of lead pencils was entered into by a clerk or bookkeeper, in the defendants\u2019 employ, without the defendants\u2019 knowledge, and the practical inquiry is whether upon the mere proof of that fact liability of these defendants may be predicated. It is only where there is some evidence to support the finding of the trial court, that this court will decline to consider the correctness of the finding; but where the finding of fact is unsupported by any evidence, it can furnish no basis for the liability predicated upon it. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Finn, </em>55 <em>Vroom </em>206.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">We think that fact presents the situation here. We find in the case no testimony or admission upon which the inference may rest, that the defendants or any one in authority for them, ordered the goods in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>We find no proof whatever of agency. The legal rule is that the agency must <em>be </em>antecedently given or <em>be </em>subsequently adopted. 2 <em>Kent Com. </em>784.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We find, however, in the case no testimony upon which, it may reasonably be inferred that the defendants ratified or adopted by act or conversation the contract which their bookkeeper entered into in their behalf, without their knowledge or consent. Without some evidence of that character the judgment appealed from is not legally sn-pported, and must be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
