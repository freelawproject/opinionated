L., p. </em>106), which, if still in force, entitles the prosecutor to the exemption claimed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">This question was before the Prerogative Court in the case of <em>In re Estate of Gopsill </em>(7 <em>Buch. </em>215), in which Vice Ordinary Walker (now'Chancellor) held that since the passage of the amendment to the Collateral Inheritance Tax act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>1906 (at <em>p. </em>432) the supplemental act of 1898 was no longer in force. We agree with the Mice- Ordinary that the act of 1898 has been eliminated not by its repeal but by its being superseded by later legislation covering the subject-matter. <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Co., </em>54 <em>Vroom </em>463.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The assessment and tax brought up by this writ are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
