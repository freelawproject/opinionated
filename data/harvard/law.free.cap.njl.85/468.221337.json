Also all the rights, privileges and interest by the said lessor under all contracts or other arrangements to operate or avail of trackage rights over any other lines of railroad, or rights covering the use of ferries, subject to all the terms and conditions pertaining to and governing in each case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The proposed demise is for the term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years from and including July 1st, 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Application was made to the board for approval of the proposed lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">On July 191h, 1913, the board filed its report withholding its approval, and entered an order to that effect and dismissing the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">We are of opinion that the application for <em>mandamus </em>must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The writ <em>o\u00ed'mandamus </em>will not issue except where the act to be done is purely ministerial, and the legal obligation to perform it is clear. <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>22 <em>Vroom </em>479; <em>Hugg </em>v. <em>Ivins, </em>30 <em>Id. </em>139; <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>Voorhees, </em>52 <em>Id. </em>26.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">In the circumstances of the present case, we think the function of the board in approving or disapproving of the lease was not simply ministerial, nor was the legal obligation to approve the lease clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">It is conceded that the authority to make the lease is to' be found in section 64 of the General Railroad act (3 <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>4248), which provides, among other things, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">\u201cAny railroad' company of this state may <em>lease its road, or any part thereof, to any other railroad company of this or any other slate, or' may take a lease of the road, or any part thereof, of any other railroad company of this or any other State, </em>or may unite and consolidate as well 'as merge its stock; property; franchises and road with those of any other company or Companies of this or any other state, or may do both, and after such lease or consolidation the company or companies so acquiring said stock, property, franchises and road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>may use and operate said road and their own road, and collect Jares and freights as provided in the case of companies organized under this act, but not in excess of the charges on the .line of any of the consolidated companies, and shall not exceed the rates limited by any special act incorporating <em>such </em>company,\u201d &amp;e.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Now, an examination of the lease in question seems to justify the following observations:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The proposed instrument, while adhering to the form of a lc-ase, does not merely create a leasehold estate. It involves the exercise of the power of sale. By \u201carticle third\u201d the lessor \u201cagrees to assign, transfer and deliver to the lessee all the cash and other assets, excluding real estate, road and equipment, and the securities owned by the lessor,\u201d as shown by a general balance sheet statement of June 30th, 1913. By \u201carticle eighth\u201d a right is conferred upen the lessee on any 30th day of June \u201cto purchase the motive power, rolling and floating stock, shop tools and machinery\u201d of the lessor. And by the same article it is provided that \u201csuch real and personal property of the lessor as shall not, in the opinion of the lessee, be necessary for the then present or prospective use of the lessor\u2019s railroads, or for the protection of the interests of the lessor therein, may, with the consent of the lessor (a majority of whose capital stock is owned by the lessee), and in accordance with the provisions of any mortgage or mori gages covering the same, he sold from time to time by the lessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The proposed instrument also involves an undertaking on the part of the lessor under \u201carticle sixth\u201d to deliver to the lessee bonds or capital stock, or both, of the lessor, \u201cas the lessee shall at the time elect and designate, in writing,\u201d in payment of improvements, betterments and additions, which shall he equal, at the par value thereof, to the cost of such improvements, betterments and additions. The article further provides that, when bonds are issued, they \u201cshall he secured by mortgage upon the railroads, property and franchises of the lessor when required by the lessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Moreover, the proposed instrument, though it involves the powers to sell and mortgage propertjr of the lessor, and to issue its capital stock and bonds from time to time in the\u201d future, in nowise recognizes the necessity of obtaining the. approval of the board with respect to the exercise of such powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Now, the Public Utility act <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1911, <em>p. </em>374), by section 18 <em>(h), </em>provides that no public utility shall, \u201cwithout' the approval of the board, sell, lease, mortgage or otherwise dispose of or encumber its property, franchises, privileges or rights, or any part thereof,\u201d except a sale, lease or other disposition in the ordinary course of business; and by section 18 <em>(e) </em>provides that no. public utility shall \u201chereafter issue any stocks, stock certificates, bonds or other evidence of indebtedness payable in more than one year from the date thereof until it shall have first obtained authority from the board for such proposed issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The foregoing considerations, among others, led the board to conclude that an unqualified approval of the proposed instrument would render the due administration of the Public Utility act impossible, or, at least, difficult, and hence it withheld its approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">It will serve no useful purpose to examine into the other reasons assigned by the board for withholding its approval. Our recitation of the statutory authority upon which the proposed instrument in the form of a lease rests, and of a few of the provisions of the instrument, and of the powers and duties conferred upon the board by the Public Utility act, are entirely sufficient to show that the function of the hoard, with respect to the approval or disapproval of the lease, involved the decision of questions of law and fact, and was not purely ministerial, and that the legal obligation to approve the proposed instrument was not clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">It is not necessary, nor wise, for us to determine on this application that our interpretation of the provisions of the proposed lease, and our application of the statute thereto, are demonstrably correct; they certainly are permissible. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>obtain <em>this </em>writ the relator must show that the opposite view is clearly the correct one, and that it has not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The position taken by tlie relator is that the hoard is confined to determining whether the conditions under which the statute authorizes a lease exist, and whether the statutory procedure has, in all respects, been followed, and that, if the statute is construed to vest broader powers in the board, it delegates legislative power in violation of the constitution. This position is based upon the mistaken assumption that the proposed instrument involves the exercise of the power to lease alone. The Public Utility act does not delegate to the hoard the determination of whether the leasing of the road of one company to another shall be sanctioned, without prescribing a general rule by which such board should he governed in reaching its determination. On the contrary, the legislature, by the Public Utility act, has attached to the exercise of privileges and powers granted by it the condition that, in the exercise of such privileges and powers, the determination of the board that the limitations and restrictions to which such privileges and powers are subject have not been exceeded, shall be first had. That it may lawfully do. And it is not only within the power, hut is also the duty of the hoard to require that the instrument by which such privileges and powers are proposed to be exercised shall be so framed as to put it beyond reasonable doubt that such limitations have not been exceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Our conclusion that the <em>mandamus </em>applied for must he denied is not to be taken as a concession that <em>mandamus </em>is the proper and complete remedy to obtain the relief sought. The distinction between <em>mandamus </em>and <em>certiorari </em>should not he overlooked. <em>Mandamus </em>issues to compel, and <em>certiorari </em>to review, otlicial or judicial action. The order of the board denying and dismissing the application is official action by it. <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>Voorhees, </em>52 <em>Vroom </em>26; <em>Newark </em>v. <em>Lewis, Commissioner, </em>53 <em>Id. </em>279; <em>affirmed, </em>54 <em>Id. </em>802. To grant the relator the relief sought without more, would be to compel the board to have outstanding two directly conflicting orders. In <em>Interstate Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Public Utility Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>missioners, </em>55 <em>Id. </em>184, <em>certiorari </em>was employed to review the order refusing the application for leave to issue bonds, and <em>mandamus </em>was applied for to compel approval of the issuance of the bonds. In <em>Leeds </em>v. <em>Atlantic City, </em>23 <em>Id. </em>332, an office was filled by <em>mandamus </em>after it had been vacated by <em>certiorari. </em>There is a place in our practice for a writ having this double function. Whether it can be worked out by allowing a rule to show, cause for a <em>mandamus </em>with the <em>allocatur </em>of the <em>certiorari, </em>or by permitting the <em>certiorari </em>to be turned into a rule for <em>mandamus, </em>may well be considered in a proper case which, for the reasons stated, this is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">But for the reasons indicated the application for the writ of <em>mandamus </em>will be denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
