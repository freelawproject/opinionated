The effect of this later enactment is to deprive borough councils of the power to impose license fees upon merchants whose places of business are located in other municipalities, but who deliver by wagon articles purchased at their respective places of business to customers residing within the limits of such boroughs.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-9\">On <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b61-10\">Before Gumhebe, Chtef Justice, and Justices Bergen and Kaxjscii.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-11\">Eor the prosecutor, <em>Gouli &amp; Smith.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-12\">For the respondents, <em>James I).

It is asserted on behalf of the borough that such power was conferred by section 28 of the general act relating to boroughs passed in 1897 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>284), which authorizes borough \u25a0 councils \u201cto license or , regulate all vehicles used in any business or. occupation for the purpose of soliciting orders or delivering goods within the limits of the borough.\u201d But this section of the Borough act, we think, has been superseded by the first section of \u201cAn act respecting licenses in cities, townships, incorporated towns, incorporated boroughs,\u201d passed April 28th, 1905. <em>Pamph. </em>L., <em>p. </em>360. That act provides \u201cThat it shall be lawful for the common council, board of aldermen, township cpmmittee, or other governing body of any city, township, incorporated town, incorporated borough, to make and establish ordinances for the following purposes, namely* to license and regulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>eartmen, porters, hacks, ears, omnibuses, stages, and all other carriages and vehicles used for the transportation of passengers, baggage, merchandise, and goods and chattels oE any kind, and the owners and drivers of vehicles and means of transportation * * * and to prohibit all persons and all vehicles unlicensed from acting, using or being used in said capacities, and for such uses and purposes.\u201d The second section of the act contains a repealer of all acts and parts of acts inconsistent therewith. As was said by this court in the case of <em>Cary </em>v. <em>North Plainfield, </em>20 <em>Vroom </em>110: \u201cThe inconvenience attendant upon the exercise by every municipality in the state of the power of excluding from its limits all unlicensed vehicles owned by merchants and engaged in transporting goods of said owners from their places of business to the residences of customers in other municipalities is manifest. Its legitimate operation would require the owners of such vehicles to obtain licenses, not only from the authorities of the place where their business had its headquarters, but also from every neighboring town, borough or other municipality in which their casual engagements might call them, or else to unload their vehicles at the border line.\u201d Assuming that the provisions of the Borough act which is appealed to on behalf of the defendants conferred such power, we think it plain that the purpose of the later enactment was to relieve merchants from the effect of a statutory provision so burdensome.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the ordinance which is at the foundation of this conviction, so far as it attempts to impose a license fee upon merchants wiiose places of business are located in other municipalities, and who deliver by wagon articles purchased at tlieir place of business to customers residing within the limits of the borough of Neptune, is <em>ultra vires </em>and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The conviction under review will be set aside and vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
