The declaration contained the common counts and the defendant filed a plea of the general issue. At the close of the case, after both sides had rested, the judge of the Circuit Court, to whom the cause had been referred for trial, directed a verdict for the defendant upon the ground, as he observed, that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was of such a loose character touching the alleged contract that the denial of the defendant and the testimony of a number of witnesses supporting him, made it seem to the court that if ever there was a ease which ought to be taken from the jury, it was the one on trial. We dissent from that view. There was testimony in the case tending to show the making of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>contract sued on and the defendant\u2019s liability thereunder. The question of contract: or no contract, and of the extent of the defendant\u2019s liability, if lie be liable, are jury questions; therefore, the cause should have been submitted to the jury. There must be a reversal and a <em>venire de novo.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-5\">For the appellant, <em>Edward C.

For this reason the rule to show cause must be made absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\"><em>For affirm,anee </em>\u2014 None.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 The Chancellor, Chiee Justice, Garrison, Swayze, Trenckard, Parker, K&amp;lisoit, Bogert, Vredenburgh, Congdon, White, Terhune, Heeeen-HEISTER, JJ. 13.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
