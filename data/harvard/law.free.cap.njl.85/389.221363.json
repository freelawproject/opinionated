GAVINO SICILIANO, APPELLANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b429-7\">Submitted July 7, 1913</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A0L\">Decided November 17, 1913.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-8\">On appeal from the Supreme Court, in which the following <em>per curiam </em>was filed:</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-9\">The plaintiff in error was found guilty upon an indictment charging him with the crime of keeping a disorderly house, the disorder consisting solely in the habitual selling, or permitting to be sold on his premises, intoxicating liquor contrary to law. There was a motion to quash the indictment on the ground of duplicity. The motion was refused, and the sole error assigned is based upon this refusal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-10\">The judgment should be affirmed. In the first place, a motion to quash an indictment is addressed to the discretion of the court, and is not reviewable on strict writ or error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hageman, </em>1 <em>Gr. </em>314; <em>Proctor </em>v. State, 26 <em>Vroom </em>472. In the second placo, the assertion that the indictment is faulty for duplicity is not justified by the fact. It is drawn in conformity with the seventy-fourth section of the Criminal Procedure act of 1898, and is similar in form to that which received the approval of this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wahle, </em>53 <em>Vroom </em>184.</p>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b429-11\">The judgment under review will be affirmed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-12\">For the respondent, <em>John S. </em>Applegate, <em>Jr.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-13\">For the appellant, <em>TVilbur A.
