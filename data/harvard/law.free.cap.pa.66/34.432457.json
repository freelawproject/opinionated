The suit was instituted before a justice of the peace for the recovery of assessments made on two notes given, for the premium on two different policies of insurance, issued by the plaintiffs to the defendant.

Assessment, December 14th 1865, on one note $7.68, and on the other $32.40.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-12\">The defendants gave in evidence the assignment of the plaintiffs for the benefit of creditors, in the usual for'm, dated February 8th 1864 \u2014 it recited that the company, \u201c owing to sundry losses and misfortunes, is unable to discharge her just debts, and is willing to assign all her property for the benefit of her creditors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-13\">They also gave in evidence, under objection and exception, a statement of the condition of the company on the 1st of April 1863, by which it appeared that at that date their assets were $53,923.51, and their liabilities $40,826.38.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-14\">Judge Woods charged:\u2014 * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-15\">\u201c The principal matter of defence, however, is that these assessments were unnecessary and illegal, the company not having sustained any losses. This is a question of more difficulty than the other. The premium-notes are given so as to form a fund to draw from when necessary for the payment of losses, and can only be used for this purpose and to pay current expenses of the corporation. To attempt to use or collect them for any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>would be illegal and wrong. When an assessment is laid it is prim\u00e1, facie supposed to be right, but the laying of it is not conclusive. [The defendants in this case allege that the company had sufficient assets to pay all its legal and just liabilities without calling for the amounts now in suit, and that these additional ones are laid for the personal profit of the parties managing this corporation. If this be true, it would be an available defence to this action.] As we said before, if there are no losses or debts of the company more than they need funds on hand to meet, they would not be justifiable on assessment. The defendants in order to sustain their allegation have given in evidence a statement of the affairs of the company, made in April 1863 by its officers. This would be evidence to show the situation of the company at that time. This is their own statement, and they have not attempted to show a mistake in it, or that it was not correct. If this paper is correct, you will see how the affairs of this company stood. The plaintiffs say there may have been losses after that. This is true, and if any losses were sustained after that, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover in this suit. The plaintiffs knew who were insured, and if any losses were sustained they could have shown them by their books or otherwise if they had seen fit to do so. We then say to you that if you are satisfied from the evidence that the plaintiffs had sufficient funds on hand to pay all their liabilities and losses without these assessments, then they had no right to lay them, and they cannot recover.\" But if you are not so satisfied from the testimony in the case, the plaintiffs have a right to your verdict for the amount claimed by them in this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">The verdict was for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-6\">The plaintiffs took a writ of error, and assigned for error the admission of the evidence objected to and the part of the charge in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-7\"><em>A. </em>Reed, for plaintiffs in error. \u2014 The</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8\">assignment was the declaration of every member of the company that there had been losses; it being the act of all, and therefore evidence against defendants: Diehl <em>v. </em>Adams Co. M. Ins. Co., 8 P. F. Smith 443. The statement of 1863 was not evidence of the condition of the company when the assessments were made. The company was bound to assess enough to pay losses : Rhinehart <em>v. </em>Allegheny M. Ins. Co., 1 Barr 359; Coston <em>v. </em>Same, Id. 322.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-8\"><em>Uttley, Woods </em>and <em>Elder, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b36-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered, July 7th 1870, by</p>\n<author id=\"b36-10\">Sharswood, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajb\">This was an action commenced originally before a justice of the peace to recover the amount of two assessments made on the defendants, who were members of the company plaintiffs, on their premium-notes. These notes promised to pay the sums mentioned \u201c in such portions and at such times as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>directors of said company may agreeably to their act of incorporation require.\u201d By the act of incorporation passed April 12th 1855, Pamph. L. of 1856, p. 648, it is provided that the premium-notes \u201c shall be paid at such time or times, and in such sum or sums, as the corporation shall from time to time require.\u201d By the ninth section it is declared \u201c that every member of said company shall be bound to pay for losses and such necessary expenses as aforesaid accruing in and to said company, in proportion to the amount of his deposit-note; and suits at law may be maintained by said corporation against any of its members for the collection of said deposit-notes or any assessment thereon,\u201d and by the tenth section \u201c whenever an assessment is made on any premium-note give?! to this company in consideration for any policy of insurance issued byj said company, and an action is brought for the recovery of such assessments, the certificate of the secretary, specifying the assessment and the amount due on such note by means thereof, shall be taken and received as prima, facie evidence thereof in all courts of this Commonwealth.\u201d\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">By the certificates of the secretary of the company, which were given in evidence by the plaintiffs, it appeared that the assessments now sued for were made respectively on September 29th 1865 and December 14th 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The defendants offered in evidence a statement of the assets and liabilities of the company, dated April 1st 1863, made out and sent to their members as it would seem on the occasion of some former assessment. This statement was not offered to be followed, nor was it followed, by any other evidence going to show the condition of the company at the time the assessments in suit were made. It had no tendency by itself to rebut the prima facies of the assessments. Not only was there no such evidence, but the assignment before produced by the defendants, dated February 8th 1864, recites that \u201c The West Branch Insurance Company, owing to sundry losses and misfortunes, is unable to discharge her just debts.\u201d We think, therefore, that the learned judge below fell into an error in admitting the statement of April 1st 1863, and in charging the jury as complained of in the second assignment \u2014 \u201c The defendant in this case alleges that the company had sufficient assets to pay all its legal and just liabilities without calling for the amounts now in suit, and that these additional ones are laid for the personal profit of the parties managing this., corporation. If this be true, it would be an available defence to this action.\u201d We think there was no evidence in the cause to rebute the prima facies of the secretary\u2019s certificate, and the jury should have been instructed to find a verdict for the plaintiff, for the amount of the assessments sued for.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
