The case was removed into the Court of Common Pleas by appeal to February Term 1869.

L. 530, and the 13th section of the Act of March 21st 1806, 4 Sm. L. 332. Nor can a promise by the overseers of one township to another divest the jurisdiction. If the township was not legally liable for the maintenance of the pauper, the promise of the overseers could not impose that responsibility upon it: Berks County <em>v. </em>Pile, 6 Harris 493. Nor can consent give jurisdiction. There was no error therefore in the charge of the learned judge below directing a verdict for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
