The plaintiff gave in evidence two policies from the defendants to him; one; No. 37,775, dated July 29th 1854, insuring $600, viz., on \u201chousehold furniture\u201d $367 and\u00f3n \u201cgroceries\u201d $233. The other, No. 41,140, dated May 1st 1855, insuring $600 on a frame dwelling-house in Duncansville, near Altoona. One of the conditions of the insurance was, that in case of fire \u201c the insured shall forthwith give notice thereof to the secretary, and within thirty days' after said loss shall deliver to the secretary a' particular account of such loss or damage, signed by his or her or their own band or hands, or by their guardian, attorney or agent.\u201d He gave evidence also of the fire and of the property lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-8\">James McCloskey testified: \u201cJohn Shoemaker was acting as agent for the insurance company; he was present the day after the fire; McClay Hall was with him; he is a lawyer; they were taking testimony concerning the fire; there was a number examined as witnesses; McClay Hall acted as counsel on behalf of the company; he took down testimony, all that was given; Mr. Beatty was examined, I think he was examined in regard to his losses; after they left the tavern Mr. Beatty was complaining that he did not know how to proceed; Mr. Beatty said he would go down and employ Mr. Blair to carry on the matter and write out the notice; Mr. Shoemaker replied to him that he had met with a great loss, and he was going to write to them and notify the company immediately; I think Mr. Hall said to him, You will have thirty days to go and come on, anyhow, he need not do it until Mr. Shoemaker heard from them; Mr. Shoemaker said, I don\u2019t think you will have any trouble with it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqj\">Thomas Hollan testified: \u201c I was present at the arbitration of the case; Mr. Shoemaker was represented as the agent, at the arbitration; they had received some anonymous letters; one was produced; they said they couldn\u2019t find the other one; the charge was that Mr. Beatty had fired the building himself \u2014 that there was foul play; there was no other objection made at that time than that.\u201d * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-10\">The plaintiff proved the handwriting of Shoemaker, and that he was postmaster at Altoona.

John Shoemaker testified : \u201c I was agent for Lycoming Insurance Company at time of fire; I resided at Altoona; I was agent to take applications and make surveys; that was all my authority at that time; I also acted as receiver; Joshua Bowman was secretary of company then, and resided at Muncy; I had no authority to act in any other way than I have stated; I had no authority to receive notice of loss ; I -was in the employ of the company when the case was tried before arbitrators at Altoona; L. W. Hall was the attorney of the company; the defence made was on the ground of fraud and want of notice agreeable to contract, and particular statement of loss not having been furnished; no other grounds of defence that I remember; * * * I made an examination next day after the fire; we looked at the place and examined Mr. Beatty and some few others; I had heard in reference to it some dissatisfaction expressed as to, the origin of the fire; I also received an anonymous letter, saying Mr. Beatty should not be paid for his loss, and to satisfy the members of the company an investigation should be made; Mr. Beatty requested me to come up and look at the ruins; I thought over the matter, and thought it best to get McClay Hall to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>with, me to make the investigation, which we did; hut it was not done by direction of the company or with their knowledge; it was at my own instance; I communicated to the company that I had investigated the matter; Mr. Beatty did not request me to give notice to the company; he said he would employ Mr. Cress-well ; I think a day or two after I told him it was necessary for him to give notice; he didn\u2019t say anything; the company, after they received notice from Mr. Beatty, wrote to me to resist the claim, and authorized me to employ counsel on the ground that I stated before, of fraud and want of notice, and want of particular statement, as required by the conditions of the policy; I notified Mr. Beatty they wouldn\u2019t pay him, and after that he brought suit; I received that notice as postmaster at Altoona; I compared it and signed the certificate, not as agent \u2014 that was given at Altoona in the office; after they received this notice a few days, they instructed me to resist the claim; I told Beatty they would not pay him: * * * the testimony of Beatty and McCauley was written down by Mr. Hall; he was at that time in the office of his brother, L. W. Hall, Esq.; Mr. Hall swore them and took the notes of testimony ; I sent the notes of testimony to Mr. Bowman ; we examined them about the origin of the fire, not particularly about the loss; * * * I was agent when Beatty brought the paper to me; I judged it to have been written by Mr. Cresswell; I put it in the post-office; they merely replied that they had received the notice and to resist the claim; I told Beatty, after I received that letter, that they would not pay him; * * * I think Beatty did say that he could not tell the amount of groceries; he did not hesitate about giving me an account of his loss.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-6\">The defendants gave in evidence the deposition of Joshua Bowman, their secretary, of which the following is an extract:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-7\">\u201c I am familiar with the claim of the plaintiff in this case. John Shoemaker was not an agent of this company at the time of plaintiff\u2019s loss for any other purpose than to take applications; as such an agent he had no authority to receive or accept notices of loss in this or any other case; he had no general or special authority from the company or executive committee to adjust plaintiff\u2019s loss, or do any other act with reference thereto; whatever he did was without the authority or knowledge of the company; the company never received a particular account of plaintiff\u2019s loss or damage, as required by his policy, the policy requiring notice to be given forthwith; the company never did anything looking to a recognition of Beatty\u2019s claim against the company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-8\">The defendants\u2019 points were :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-9\">1.

The plaintiff\u2019s account of his loss in his notice, dated Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>tember 20th 1868, is not such a particular account of his loss or damage as the terms of the policy require of him, and no particular account of his loss or damage having been delivered to the secretary within thirty days of the fire, he cannot recover on his policy, No. 37,775.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-5\">3.

There is no evidence to be submitted to the jury of a waiver of the requirements of the policy to give a \u201c particular account of the plaintiff\u2019s loss or damage\u201d within thirty days after the fire, and the plaintiff cannot recover on policy No. 37,775.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-7\">Judge Taylor, in his charge, said:\u2014 * * * \u201c Upon these general facts, the first question which meets us, is, was there a compliance with the condition appended to each policy, to furnish forthwith to the secretary of the company, notice of the fire; and, also, within thirty days afterward the particular statement stipulated in the seventh condition. Here the formal notice, in the handwriting of Mr. Cresswell, forwarded for Mr. Beatty by Mr. Shoemaker, was not sent for twenty days, and we feel fully warranted in saying was not a compliance with the stipulation \u2018forthwith\u2019 to give notice of the fire to the secretary. [But we think the affidavit of Mr. Beatty, as to the origin and circumstances of the fire, sworn to and signed by him, and forwarded by Mr. Shoemaker to the secretary two days afterwards, was a sufficient notice of the fire, and a substantial compliance with that part of the condition. It stated as a fact the occurrence of the fire, was signed by the insured, and conveyed with his signature to it, to the secretary, within two or three days ; and no matter by whom or what agency or authority sent or conveyed, it was, in his possession, notice to the company of the fact communicated, on a reasonable construction of the stipulation.] [And we are also of opinion that this affidavit, and the brief formal notice drawn by Mr. Cresswell, and forwarded for Mr. Beatty, twenty days after the fire, conveyed together a sufficiently \u2018particular statement\u2019 of the loss of the building, and was a substantial and sufficient compliance with that stipulation in the condition to the policy insuring the building; though they did not, viewed separately or together, convey such a statement of the loss of the goods_insured by the other policy.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-8\">[ \u201c It is our opinion, therefore, that if you find the facts as we have stated them, there may be, as it respects this question, a recovery by the plaintiff on policy No. 41,l40, for the loss of the building; but not on the other, No. 37,775, for the loss of the goods insured by it, unless there was a waiver by the defendant of the stipulation requiring a particular account or statement of the loss to be furnished to the secretary within thirty days], \u2014 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>evidence from which a jury might he allowed to infer or find such waiver ; and that presents the next question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-2\">SUPREME COURT <em>\u00a3Warrislurg </em>[Beatty <em>v. </em>Lycoming Oo. Mutual Ins. Co.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-6\">\u201cWas there a waiver by the defendant ? The plaintiff alleges there was, as it respects both policies; while the defendant denies that there was as it respects either of them. The only evidence of it is, in what is shown to have been done by Mr. Shoemaker immediately after the fire, and in the correspondence which followed between him and the secretary of the company. Mr. Shoemaker was the local agent of the company residing at Altoona, a few miles from the insured property. It is alleged, and this appears from the evidence to be the fact, that his authority as such agent, was only to take surveys to be submitted to the company for their action, and collect or receive assessments upon policies. If so, it did not include authority to waive any condition or stipulation in a policy. The agent could only bind his principal either directly, by express agreement, or by his acts or conduct, when acting within the scope of his authority. If not authorized to waive directly, by his agreement to do so, he could not do it indirectly; or, in other words, a waiver could not .be inferred from his unauthorized act or conduct, or from what he did upon assumed authority. The stream cannot rise above its source.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-7\">\u201c If therefore you find that Mr. Shoemaker was only a local agent and clothed only with authority to make surveys and receive assessments, what he did upon his own authority the day after the fire, is not, we instruct you, evidence from which a waiver could be inferred. Nor do we think the letters of the secretary to Mr. Shoemaker dated 17th September, instructing him to employ counsel to resist the claim, and stating to him, as a reason, that they believed there had been \u2018foul play,\u2019 should be submitted to your consideration as evidence from which a waiver may be inferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-8\">\u201c The defendant alleges, also, as a further reason why there should be no recovery for the groceries destroyed, that they were not burnt in the house in which they were insured. If they were not, but in any other building, there could not, for that reason, we' say to you, be any recovery for their loss. Whether they were, or were not, is a question of fact to be determined by you from all the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-9\">\u201c It remains only to answer the points made and submitted in writing by the defendant\u2019s counsel.

Under the charge of the learned judge below he recovered a verdict upon the policy on the dwelling-house, but the jury gave him nothing for his household furniture and groceries. Both parties have sued out\u2019 writs of error to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-8\">There are several assignments of error, hut all may be disposed of by the resolution of three questions, arising upon the application of an article or condition of each policy requiring that in the case of a loss the insured shall forthwith give notice thereof to the secretary, and within thirty days of the fire a particular account of such loss or damage signed, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-9\">The three errors assigned by the insurance company relate to the first question. The learned judge instructed the jury that there was sufficient evidence of notice forthwith given by the assured of the occurrence of the' fire, to fulfil the requirement of the policies in that respect. It appears that the fire occurred August 31st 1858, and that the morning after, the local agent of the company, in company with counsel, visited the premises and made an examination of the circumstances attending it. Daniel Beatty, the insured, was himself examined as a witness under oath, his testimony or statement reduced to writing and signed by him. It was forwarded by the agent to the secretary of the insurance company on the following day, and was received by him. We think the- learned judge was perfectly right in holding this a sufficient notice of the loss within the terms of the policy. It was held in The West Branch Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Helfenstein, 4 Wright 289, in a case in which the policy contained a condition expressed in the same words as this, that a written notice to the secretary from the local agent upon information conveyed to him by the assured is sufficient. There is nothing to prevent the assured from constituting the agent of the company his attorney to give the notice, and if he does give the notice accordingly, the company cannot object without a rule or condition prohibiting the agent from being employed for such purpose. But this case is stronger than that. The statement of the fact and circumstances of the fire was signed by the assured himself, and transmitted through the local agent to the secretary of the company. How it reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the proper destination is entirely immaterial, provided it was forwarded in due and reasonable time, which in this instance is not denied. This disposes of the writ of error of the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">The second question which is raised by the first assignment of error of the plaintiff below is, whether there was any evidence of such a particular statement of the loss under the policy upon household furniture and groceries as was required by its terms. The learned judge instructed the jury that there was not. The plaintiff maintains that the sufficiency o'f the statement was for the jury, upon the authority of The Franklin Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Updegraff, 7 Wright 850. The report of that case does not furnish us with the statement. It is said in the charge of the court below to have been general, not particular; that it did not specify the different articles consumed. We must assume, however, that some information was given of the character and extent of the loss. It was then for the jury to say whether it was as particular as it should have been. But in this case there was no statement at all. The paper given in evidence as such is a mere reiteration of the description in the policy, namely: \u201cHousehold furniture, $367 ; groceries, $233, making together the sum of $600, were also lost and destroyed by fire aforesaid, the whole property of undersigned in the house at the time being destroyed, with the exception only of a few articles of household furniture.\u201d It is certainly not necessary in every case to report all the items in detail which constitute the loss. It may be entirely out of the power of the assured to do so. His books and papers may have been destroyed by the fire. But every person assured must be presumed to know enough to be able to remember some particulars, or to give a description if it do not descend to details of the different kinds and value of the articles. There are few men who, with assistance of the members of their family, could not give some description of their household furniture. In The Lycoming County Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Updegraff, 4 Wright 311, an instruction to the jury that a statement of this character was not such a particular account of the loss as was required by the,policy, was approved and affirmed by this court. This assignment of error, therefore, is not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">The only remaining question which is raised by the plaintiffs\u2019 second assignment is, whether there was any evidence of waiver by the company of the condition requiring a particular statement. The learned judge held that there was not, and we think rightly. It was required to be within thirty days after the fire. Now to constitute a waiver there should be shown some official act or declaration by the company during the currency of the time, dispensing with it; something from which the assured might reasonably infer that the underwriters did not mean to insist upon it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Ah is remarked by the present .Chief Justice in Diehl <em>v. </em>Adams County Insurance Company, 8 P. E. Smith 452, \u201cthis never occurs unless intended or where the act relied on ought in equity to estop the party from denying it.\u201d Mere silence is not enough. After the thirty days had expired without any statement, nothing but the express agreement of the company could renew or revivify the contract. Had a statement been furnished, within the time it might have been the duty of the insurers to notify the assured of any merely formal defect so that it might be remedied. If the paper dated September 20th 1858, was to be regarded as a statement and not a mere notice of the loss, the defects of it were substantial, not formal merely. The case of The Inland Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Stauffer, 9 Casey 397, was where a notice' of loss was given to a director and not to the secretary. A few days after-wards the president of the company and another director canm out to view the ruins, meeting there committees from other insurance companies and avowing that they came on the business of the insurers. These facts it was held might be submitted with others to the jury as evidence of a waiver of a strict and formal compliance with the condition. That case is in none of its circumstances parallel with this. The second assignment of error of the plaintiff is therefore not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
