Dunn (a practising physician and married man), is a good, true, faithful and honest citizen of Pennsylvania, and from the time of his nativity hitherto hath been held, esteemed and reputed of good name, &amp;c., and from drunkenness, adultery and all other acts of a degrading character free, &amp;c. Nevertheless the aforesaid Lester E. Klumph, not being ignorant of the premises, but maliciously intending the said James L. Dunn of his good name, &amp;e., to deprive, and also the said James L. Dunn unto danger of the laws against such offences made, to bring, on or about the-day of June 1865, at the county aforesaid, these false, feigned and scandalous words following of and concerning said James L. Dunn, in presence and hearing of divers citizens of said Commonwealth, maliciously, falsely and unjustly did say, speak and publish, to wit: \u2018 That Dr. Dunn is \u25a0----. He lay drunk all the time he was in the army; had a negro wench for his waiter and slept with her every night (meaning thereby that he committed adultery with said negro wench), and had one of his own townsmen put in the guard-house for speaking to her. This he could prove.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-13\">The case was tried January 3d 1868 before Johnson, P. J. The plaintiff gave evidence, by a number of witnesses, that in June 1866, at a store, in the presence of a number of bystanders, the plaintiff not being present, the defendant used the words laid in the declaration, accompanied with other gross and profane expressions; also that the plaintiff had been a surgeon in the army, and continued so during all the war of the rebellion. F. A. Temple, a witness for plaintiff, on cross-examination said that he \u201c took it for granted that the conversation was about Sherman\u2019s march to the sea-coast.\u201d The plaintiff gave evidence also that he had lived in Conneautville ten years; had four children, of whom three were daughters; he was a physician.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-14\">The defendant gave evidence that in his declarations he had said that the conduct of the defendant of w'hich he spoke.was \u201cwhile he was with Sherman at Atlanta.\u201d He gave evidence also that the words were spoken in an excited altercation which he had had with Temple, one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, in which Temple mentioned the plaintiff as authority to establish something which witness had stated, and that defendant said that he had been told what he stated by a soldier.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-15\">The defendant\u2019s points and the judge\u2019s answers were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\u201c 1.

That if the evidence had shown that the crime alluded to had been charged to have been committed in a particular place, and it had been proven that the alleged offence was not a crime indictable as such at that place, we think the charge would not, <em>per se, </em>be actionable here where uttered; but this question does not legitimately arise, because no venue is given, either in the <em>narr. </em>or in the evidence, to the crime imputed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-9\">The judge said in his charge:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-10\">* * * \u201c This declaration does not allege the plaintiff\u2019s professional character as inducement, nor charge that the damage resulted to it.

It is his character as a man that is assailed, and in that capacity he has brought suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-11\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $700.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-12\">The defendant took a writ of error, and assigned for error the answers to his points and that part of the charge given above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-13\"><em>J.

Words to be actionable need not charge an indictable offence: Beck <em>v. </em>Stitzel, 9 Harris 522.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b143-15\">The opinion of the court was delivered, January 3d 1871, by</p>\n<author id=\"b143-16\">Shaeswoob, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZx\">\u2014 It is not necessary that all the words laid in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the declaration should be actionable. It is sufficient if some of them are. The court below, therefore, were not required either to affirm or deny the defendant\u2019s first point as presented: \u201c that all the words charged were not actionable.\u201d They answered correctly that the words laid were actionable without saying whether all were. It is true that a general judgment in slander, where some of the counts set out words which are not actionable, is erroneous; but <em>non sequitur </em>that a count in which non-actionable words are laid with those which are actionable is therefore bad. All the words spoken at the time may properly be stated and given in evidence; for they explain and show the <em>animus </em>of the principal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The court below may have erred in their answer to the defendant\u2019s second point, in saying that the question whether the words would be actionable if the offence was charged to have been' committed in another state without showing that it would be criminal there, did not arise, because no venue was given either in the <em>narr, </em>or in the evidence to the crime imputed: and also in the charge that the evidence did not show where the offence was stated to have been committed. These form the second and third errors assigned. It must be conceded that there was evidence from which the jury might legitimately have inferred that the conversation to which the defendant\u2019s witnesses had testified was the same conversation as that referred to by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, and that taking the whole together the defendant meant to confine his accusation to what had occurred in the South while the plaintiff was with Sherman at Atlanta, or from Atlanta to Savannah. Even Temple, the witness of the plaintiff, -testified on his cross-examination that he took it for granted that the conversation was about Sherman\u2019s march to the sea-coast. If this was a material question in the cause it was for the jury to decide, and it was error in the court to withhold it from them. But if it was immaterial it did the defendant no injury. The court, as often happens, gave a wrong reason for a right decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The case of Barclay <em>v. </em>Thompson, 2 Penna. R. 148, decides that an action will not lie for words spoken in another state when the offence charged is not indictable in that state, although it may be indictable here. To the same effect are Stout <em>v. </em>Wood, 1 Blackford 71; Offut <em>v. </em>Earlywine, 4 Id. 460; Linville <em>v. </em>Earlywine, Id. 469; Langdon <em>v. </em>Young, 33 Vt. 136. The reason is a very plain one. The defendant committed no legal wrong where the words were spoken. No action lay there, and therefore not in any other state in which the defendant might afterwards be found and sued. In this case, however, the words were spoken in this state. It has often been held that where the words impute a common-law offence to have been committed in another state it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>need not be affirmatively proved that such offence is indictable there. The presumption is, that the common law of a sister state is similar to our own, and in one case it is intimated, though not decided, that if the offence charged derives its quality as a crime from the statute alone, the rule would be otherwise: Johnson <em>v. </em>Dickens, 25 Miss. 580; Van Ankin <em>v. </em>Westfall, 14 Johns. 233; Poe <em>v. </em>Green, 3 Sneed 664; Montgomery <em>v. </em>Dealey, 3 Wisc. 709. But after a careful search, I find no case which directly holds that words charging an offence of moral turpitude, and indictable by the statute law of the country where they are uttered, are not actionable <em>per se, </em>because they state the offence to have been committed in another country. The opinions in some of the cases cited seem to rely upon the liability of the defendant to extradition under the Constitution of the United States, or treaties with foreign states. But that surely is not the true <em>ratio decidendi. </em>Nothing seems to be better settled than that liability to prosecution or punishment is not the criterion. Both ancient and modern cases agree in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In Carpenter <em>v. </em>Tarrant, Ridg. temp. Hardw. 339, the words were : \u201c Robert Carpenter was in Winchester gaol and tried for his life and would have been hanged had it not been for Leggat,for breaking open the granary of Farmer A. and stealing his bacon.\u201d Here the words necessarily imported that the plaintiff had been tried and acquitted, and therefore could never be convicted of the same offence. In Gainford <em>v. </em>Tuke, Cro. Jac. 536, the words were : \u201c Thou wast in Launceston gaol for coining.\u201d The plaintiff replied: \u201cIf I was there, I answered it well.\u201d \u201cYea,\u201d said the defendant, \u201cyou were burnt in the hand for it.\u201d Here the words clearly meant that the plaintiff had been tried, convicted, pleaded his clergy and been burnt in the hand, and of course could not be again punished for the same offence. So in Baston <em>v. </em>Tatham, Cro. Jac. 622, it was held to be no defence to prove that the offence charged was within the terms of a general pardon, for the court remarked that although the pardon might discharge of punishment, yet the scandal of the offence remained. It may be said that in these cases there was liability to indictment oh the charge, though the plaintiff by pleading could prevent conviction and punishment. It is to be remarked, however, that in all of them the slander carried its antidote with it as far as risk of indictment was concerned. They are distinguishable in this respect from that class of decisions where the <em>corpus delicto </em>is shown never to have existed; as where the words were \u201c you have killed Bob Waters; you have poisoned him, and I can prove it,\u201d and it appeared by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses that at the time when the words were spoken, Bob Waters was alive in a distant part of the country: Eckart <em>v. </em>Wilson, 10 S. &amp; R. 44; Deford <em>v. </em>Miller, 3 Penna. R. 103; Colbert <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 3 Grant 181. There are 16 P. F. Smith \u2014 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>other cases, however, in which there could be no pretence of risk of prosecution. In Fowler <em>v. </em>Dowdney, 2 Moo. &amp; R. 119, Lord Denman ruled those words to be actionable : \u201c He is a returned convict,\u201d as importing that the punishment had been suffered, but the infamy remained. There was here no charge that the plaintiff had been guilty of any particular offence, so that it could not be said that he ran any risk in consequence of the slander of being subjected to another prosecution. Such was the determination of this court in Smith <em>v. </em>Stewart, 5 Barr 372, in which the words were \u201c that man was in the penitentiary of Ohio.\u201d Here there was neither liability to punishment nor prosecution growing out of the charge, which was that the plaintiff had committed some crime for which he had already been punished in the penitentiary; yet the words were held to be actionable <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">IVhat then is the, criterion ? Mr. Starkie, after an elaborate review of the cases, comes to the conclusion that as it is necessary to have some clear and certain rule by which the line of demarcation between actionable and non-actionable words can be drawn, none could be adopted more convenient than that which refers the question to the criminal law, and confirms the action to imputations of offences of moral turpitude, punishable in the temporal courts: 1 Starkie on Slander 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">But to what law are the courts to refer to ascertain whether the offence charged is of this character ? Upon every principle of reason and policy the answer seems to be the law of the country where the words are spoken. That law is the exponent of the moral sense of that community \u2014 of the estimation in which they hold offences against the moral law, and words which accuse a man of any crime, condemned and subjected to infamous punishment by that law, expose him in that community to obloquy and contempt. The moral character of the act canpot be affected by the place where it is committed. What matters it to those to whom the words are addressed, or in whose hearing they are spoken, that the crime is charged to have been committed in a state or country where such actions are not subject to punishment ? Even if they arc to be presumed to know that the act was not a crime punishable by the law of the country where it was alleged to have been committed, would it any the less injure the moral character and standing of the party charged ? Is it possible that a man living in Pennsylvania can be accused of having committed the crime <em>inter Ohristianos non nominandum </em>upon some uninhabited coast or island where there is no government and no law, or among some barbarous people where such practices may be, as they have been, tolerated ? Is such a plaintiff to be turned out of court unless he can prove some special damage ? This may be an extreme case, but nevertheless it tests the principle. If the criminal code laid its heavy hand upon such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>calumniators, there might be some good reason for requiring special damage to be shown in all actions of slander, but we know that it does not, and unless the lash is placed in the hands of the injured party they must go \u201c unwhipped of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">If the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses was to be believed, the defendant below charged him in a public store, in the presence of many persons, in the grossest terms with open and continued criminal connection with a negro wench, and asserted with an oath that he could prove it. By the law of Pennsylvania, from 1705 to the present time, adultery has always been ah indictable offence, and of its moral turpitude there can be no question. The plaintiff was a married man \u2014 the defendant knew him to be so, and meant to charge him with this offence, and in language which was designed to convey his own sense of its detestable character, especially no doubt in view of the race and color of the party who was alleged to have been a partaker in the crime. We are of the opinion that the words were actionable <em>per se, </em>whether they were limited to the state of Georgia or were general; and that the plaintiff in error has no just ground of complaint with the answer and charge of the court below in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The 4th error assigned remains to be noticed. It is true, as decided in Chubb <em>v. </em>Gsell, 10 Casey 115, that in an action of slander the plaintiff cannot introduce evidence as to his good character until it has been attacked by the defendant; for until then the law presumes it to be good, and the defendant admits it. Surely the jury may weigh the fact that the character and standing of the plaintiff is unimpeached in estimating the damages. But the court told the jury that they might also take into consideration that the plaintiff was a practising physiciaii, although the declaration did not allege his professional character as an inducement, nor charge that the damage resulted to it. The position in life and the family of the plaintiff are always important circumstances as bearing upon the question of damages, and have always been held to be admissible in evidence for that purpose : Beehler <em>v. </em>Steever, 2 Whart. 313. It was not necessary that they should be specially laid as the ground of recovery in the declaration. Evidence of these particulars was given without objection, and it would have been error to have instructed the jury that they ought to disregard them.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
