He prayed for a mandamus commanding the respondent to issue a commission to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-15\">The certificate of election was as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-16\">\u201c To the Hon. J. P. Wickersham,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-17\">Superintendent of Common Schools:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-18\">Sir: \u2014 The undersigned, president and secretaries of the convention of school directors of Cumberland county, convened according to law on Tuesday the 4th day of May 1869, do hereby certify that George Swartz, whose address is Boiling Springs, was declared elected <em>vivd voce </em>by a majority of the members voting as county superintendent until the first Tuesday in May one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two. They further certify that the amount of compensation for said superintendent was fixed by said convention at one thousand dollars ($1000) per annum, and that the whole number of directors was 112, of whom 56 voted for said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Swartz, and that D. E. Kast, whose address is Mechaniesburg, received 55 votes, one member refusing to vote at all on the last ballot. Dated at Carlisle this fourth day of May, a. d. 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">John C.

Swartz, 55 for D. E. Kast, and one director, although known to be present, refused to vote, not desiring the election of either of these gentlemen. The president of the convention then declared Mr. Swartz elected, but when objections to his decision were made and the law relating to the election of county superintendents was read, he refused to decide the question, stating that the matter would be left in the hands of the state superintendent, and the convention adjourned.\u201d After setting out other matters the respondent averred that the certificate was not such as the law requires, and therefore he had declined to issue a commission to him. He further set out that after declining to issue a commission to Swartz, he appointed William A. Lindsay county superintendent of Cumberland county, which position he had continued to occupy. He also suggested that inasmuch as Lindsay was occupying the office, the proceeding should be quo warranto against him instead of mandamus against the respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-11\">The relator demurred to the answer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-12\"><em>S.

Conceding that a mandamus lies, we think that upon the facts admitted by the demurrer he has no title to a commission as county superintendent of Cumberland county.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">It is undoubtedly necessary before the state superintendent can be required to issue a commission to any person as a county superintendent, that the president and secretary of the triennial convention of directors of the county should certify to him the name and post-office address of the person elected: Act of May 8th 1864, \u00a7 40, Pamph L. 626. Was there such a certificate in this case ? The document which was transmitted as such certifies that \u201c George Swartz, whose address is Boiling Springs, was declared elected <em>vivd voce </em>by a majority of the members voting.\u201d \u2014and it then proceeds to declare \u201c that the whole number of directors was 112, of whom 56 voted for said Swartz, and that I). E. Kast, whose address is Mechanicsburg, received 55 votes, one member refusing to vote at all on the last ballot.\u201d In other words it certifies that 112 directors were present, of whom the relator received 56 votes and was thereupon declared elected. Such were the facts as set forth in the answer of the defendant and admitted by the demurrer, except that although the president of the convention at first declared that the relator was elected, yet upon objection being made he withdrew that decision, and the convention adjourned without any declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The thirty-ninth section of the act expressly provides that the selection shall be <em>uvivd voce </em>by a majority of the whole number of directors present.\u201d It is urged that the director refusing to vote was virtually absent. He might perhaps have withdrawn, but he did not do so. He remained, and being present, was entitled to be counted. It matters not what he supposed to be the effect of his action. The legal intendment was that he voted for neither or for the minority candidate. It would be dangerous to fritter away the express provision of the statute by construing an actual presence into a virtual absence. It is a sound canon of interpretation <em>quoties in verbis nulla est ambiguitas, ibi nulla ex-positio contra verba fienda est: </em>and hence the general rule <em>a verbis legis non est recedendum. </em>\u201cNothing,\u201d said Lord Denman, \u201cis more unfortunate than a disturbance of the plain language of the legislature by the attempt to use equivalent terms:\u201d Everard <em>v. </em>Poppleton, 5 Q. B. 184. The certificate then was a nullity: it was <em>sbfelo de se. </em>Suppose it had set forth on its face that A. had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>a majority of the votes of the directors present, but that 33. was elected: would the state superintendent be bound to receive such a certificate and issue a commission to 33. ? Certainly not. But this is a case within the same reason, where the paper shows upon its face that there was no election at all, and does not assume to certify that the relator was elected, but merely that he was declared elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
