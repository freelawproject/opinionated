There was no appeal from the decree of confirmation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-11\">The administrator c. t. a., February 13th 1869, filed a final administration account, which'showed in his hands abalance of $21,592.18, the proceeds of real estate in Pennsylvania. It was referred to H. B. Swarr, Esq., as auditor for distribution. Before him the Commonwealth claimed that the fund was subject to collateral inheritance tax, which was resisted by Corinna Omohundro and her chidren, she claiming to have been the wife of the decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The following was the evidence on this point. \u2014 William Car-, penter testified that in 1857 the decedent introduced Corinna to witness as his wife, having with them at the time two children, who he said were their children; he also introduced Mrs. Cheat-ham to witness as his wife\u2019s sister.

The fact of marriage is contradicted by the will and by all the circumstances. Corinna and her children both claim under this will the property which is sought to be taxed as a collateral inheritance. Nowhere in the will is she denominated his wife, or is it intimated that she sustained such a relation to him, while he expressly calls her his \u201c woman,\u201d and emancipates her and her children from all manner of servitude. At one place the will speaks of her as a \u201c kind and faithful woman to him,\u201d and at the same as an \u201c affectionate <em>mother </em>to the children\u201d whom he acknowledges as his, presenting her relations to himself and the children in strong contrast. He uses similar language in respect to another female slave whom he emancipates \u2014 \u201c his <em>woman </em>Agnes, and her two children, Virginia and Waverly.\u201d He stamps upon his will still more clearly his meaning and intent in its final paragraph when he says, \u201cIn conclusion I declare my <em>sole </em>purpose in making this my last will is to give my whole estate of whatever it may consist <em>(except Agnes and her </em>children) to Corinna and <em>her </em>children in the manner specified in it.\u201d It is evident that he knew that Corinna and her children sustained no legal relation to him, which could entitle them to his estate without a will; and the exception of Agnes and her children out of his property exhibits the relation of servitude she sustained to him, a relation existing and described in the same language on part of Corinna.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">' Independently of the will the circumstances repel a presumption of marriage. Silas Omohundro lived in a slave state, Corinna was his slave, and three of his children were born as early as 1857. There is no probability, owing to this relation, of a prior emancipation and actual marriage, while not a word of proof has been given of their cohabitation as husband and wife in Virginia. The proof should come from Virginia, and not from Pennsylvania, where Corinna came merely on a visit twice in his company. That he should call her his wife in this state is not strange. He could not indulge in the practice of concubinage with her in this state, as he had done in Virginia, without subjecting himself to reproach, and perhaps to banishment. The evidence of marriage relied on by the auditor was very weak, and was overborne by the will and the nature of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court is therefore reversed, and it is decreed that the Commonwealth is entitled to the collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>inheritance tax, to be levied and collected of the estate of the testator, found within this state, according to law; and the record is ordered to be remitted to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Lancaster county to carry this decree into effect, the costs to be paid out of the estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
