They reported that they commenced at a line of petitioner\u2019s land, and ran by various courses and distances \u201c to towing-path of the French Creek feeder, and up said towing-path to canal bridge near the residence of D. P. Smith.\u201d They reported that a private road was <em>\u201c </em>necessary to furnish access to the owner, D. W. Canfield, to a lot isolated from his other property, and from any other public highway except French creek. The viewers further report that in their opinion this route, being mostly on the bank of French <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>creek, will do less injury to private property than hy any other direction, and recommend that the road he opened 25 feet wide.

If the adjournment leave a reasonable time for exceptions before the following term, we cannot say that the requirement of the road law is disobeyed. The cases in 8 Casey 282, 12 Casey 87, and 1 Wright 255, are all instances of confirmations out of time at a subsequent term, with an order to reach back <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to the proper term. This is in violation of the act requiring the report to be returned at the next term, and after confirmation to lie over until the following term before it can be recorded. But in the present case the report came in in due time, and the only irregularity alleged is that the court did not confirm it nisi until an adjourned court. There being ample time intervening between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the confirmation nisi and the following term, we cannot say there was error. To give the law such a rigid interpretation would cause a great many reports to fall, and add largely to the expense of road proceedings. The case before us is very different from that supposed by Justice Church in 8 Casey 284, to wit, confirmation on tbe last day of a term where tbe end of one term is tbe beginning of another, as in Allegheny county, and no time would intervene therefore between tbe confirmation and tbe following term for exceptions. That would be unreasonable, and against the intention of the legislature, which was to allow a reason-able time to make objections against tbe road.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Tbe report as to tbe grading is substantially that none is necessary. The report evidently means that some filling or excavation only is necessary to get upon tbe bridge at tbe <em>terminus </em>of the road. This is not tbe grading meant in tbe act, and tbe viewers and tbe court must have been satisfied that tbe connection between tbe <em>terminus </em>of tbe road and tbe bridge could be conveniently made.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Proceedings affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
