Ewing and Sarah his wife in her right, against Alexander B. Thompson, administrator, &amp;c., of Daniel Morgan, deceased. The declaration alleged a special contract between Mrs. Ewing and the decedent in his lifetime, that if she would keep house for him and nurse him during his life, he would leave her the farm on which he lived, and averred performance on her part; the breach was that he did not leave her his farm. The declaration did not contain the common counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-14\">On the trial, June 2d 1869, before Kirkpatrick, J., the plaintiffs made the following offers of evidence:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-15\">1. To prove that Daniel Morgan in his lifetime made a contract with plaintiff Sarah Ewing, by which he stipulated and agreed that if said Sarah would come to his house and live with him, nurse him, care for him during his lifetime, as a compensation for her services he would give her the farm on which he then resided, and that in pursuance of said contract, with the assent of her husband, they, Ewing and wife, moved to the house and farm of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Morgan, nursed, cared for him and provided for him during his lifetime, and in all things fulfilled and performed the contract on their part up to the time of his, Morgan\u2019s, death: <em>for the purpose of shoioing the value of the contract and consideration thereof on which the services were rendered by plaintiff.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\"><em>2. </em>To prove the contract under which-plaintiff entered into the service of Daniel Morgan, deceased, and the services rendered under that contract, the situation of plaintiff at the time of the making of the contract; the sacrifices she made to fulfil the same: for the purpose of enabling the jury to ascertain the value of plaintiff\u2019s services to Daniel Morgan, deceased, and the damage sustained by the plaintiff, by the non-fulfilment of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\">3.

A state with three millions and. a half inhabitants, with railroads connecting her most distant points, and a common school system pervading the whole Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>wealtb, is certainly prepared to require that all contracts for the sale of land shall be in writing, In allowing actions for damages, on verbal contracts, for the sale of lands, we differ not only with the law of England, but I believe with the law of every other state in the Union. A policy thus universal must be right, and we thought so for one y\u00e9ar.</p>\n<p id=\"AmR\">By our law such an action may be sustained, but the measure of damages is the actual consideration passing between the parties. If the consideration were services rendered, they are to be compensated according to their value \u2014 if moneys, received, they are to be returned with interest. But the value of the bargain is not the measure: McNair <em>v. </em>Compton, 11 Casey 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">This question was the subject of so thorough and exhaustive an examination, by Woodward, J., in his opinion in Malaun\u2019s Administrator <em>v. </em>Ammon, reported in 1 Grant\u2019s Cases 123, and also in 10 Casey 423, the principles of which were adopted by the Supreme Court in Hertzog <em>v. </em>Hertzog\u2019s Administrator, 10 Casey 418, that it is unnecessary to enter into them. This case was followed by Dumars <em>v. </em>Miller, 10 Casey 319 ; Graham <em>v. </em>Graham\u2019s Executors, Id. 475, Strong, J., delivering the opinion, and McNair <em>v. </em>Compton, 11 Casey 23, and is the settled law of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">It was therefore open to the plaintiffs to prove the contract between Daniel Morgan and Sarah Ewing, and of course all its terms. The value of the land was irrelevant, as it did not enter into the question of damges, the measure of damages being the value of the services rendered by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The court were therefore clearly in error in rejecting the 3d offer to prove the contract between the parties. The proof of the contract cannot in any manner affect the measure of damages, which is settled by the law of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">The plaintiff should not have been nonsuited.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
