When the party'upon whom is charged the exercise of undue influence derives an inconsiderable or no benefit from the will, there must be evidence of such direct influence used at its making as to destroy the free agency of the testator.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-9\">2. Where the party charged is a stranger, having no claims from relation-, ship and derives very considerable benefit, such direct proof is not required.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-10\">3. General evidence of power exercised over the testator, especially if of comparatively weak mind, though not enough to destroy testamentary capacity, will be enough to raise a presumption, which must be overcome before the will can be established.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-11\">4. This is particularly so where the party benefited stands in a confidential relation to the testator.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-12\">5. Where a considerable portion of the estate of a testator whose mental faculties are impaired though not destroyed, be given to one standing in such relation, proof of the formal execution of the will in the presence of two witnesses is not enough; the presumption must be rebutted by some evidence that the disposition was the exercise of the testator\u2019s free will.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b283-13\">6. In this case a considerable part of the testator\u2019s estate was left to a scrivener who drew the will and his relatives, none being relatives of the testator, who was not mentally incapable, the question of undue influence was properly left to the jury.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b283-14\">October 26th 1870.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOf\">Before Thompson, O.

A great number of witnesses testified to his capacity until about three weeks before his death, he having a short time previously received a hurt by a severe blow on his head. There was evidence also of some difficulty with his second wife, which resulted in a complaint against him by her before a magistrate, and in his being subjected to discipline in his church; it was finally amicably adjusted. The testator was about seventy-two years old at his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-14\">David Longenecker, one of the executors and plaintiffs, having on the 31st of October 1868 <em>released and declined to receive </em>\u201c any and all legacies and devises given to\u201d him under the will, and having released the estate \u201c from all claims and demands for ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>on account of the same,\u201d testified on the trial for the plaintiff: \u201c I knew John Boyd for nineteen years. He often came to count interest, wrote letters; leases; came frequently to me, I was a justice of the peace. I wrote the will in dispute ; he came to me to get me to write it. He wanted a change in the will I had written before, the change he wanted I made as stated in the will in dispute. He wanted Coldsmith and Paul to be his witnesses; they were his tenants ; he sent Coldsmith to hunt Paul, could not get him, he said my son Jacob O. would do for a witness, he called Jake up, Boyd signed it then the witnesses. I had read the will to him, he said nothing; told me to take care of the will; the condition of his mind was good that day. His capacity to do business was good, could tell me in short terms what he wanted to have done. A will of 25th February 1867, was shown to witness. This was his will of that date. I never knew of William Wagner the legatee in the will until he named him; said he lived in Baltimore, did not know one of the Wagner girls named; said he took John when he was a poor boy; had raised him and would help him. he said Paul was a punctual tenant and he would mind him. I did not know Margaret Shupe, she had kept house for him ; said Mrs. Mosely had kept house for him after his first wife died. Hester Sykes was a girl he had raised. Boyd Sykes was his namesake and he wanted to remember him. He said he always wanted to remember my son Jake; was frequently at the shop with him; lent him his gold watch for three months, assigned no reason for giving the other son a legacy; said nothing about James; they were to get in. Boyd died 8th or 9th January 1868. His first wife died in June 1864. He married second wife in February 1865.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A88\">Being cross-examined, he said : \u201c I wrote three wills in 1867; one before in January 1863 which he destroyed; he left it principally to his first wife and Hester Ann Sykes; she died in June 1864; second will on 25th February 1867. Dick and myself were executors. David H. Pollock and myself were witnesses in the first will. We were residuary legatees. Coldsmith and Paul were witnesses. Coldsmith is a brother-in-law ; Paul no relation, lives in West Newton ; the child was then born gets the same as in this; if she died, twenty legatees. The February will was written in my office, no one present, signed in my shop. He estimated his estate at $30,000 at that time. I did not take an account of his estate. He came to me and wanted to make an account of his estate; it was then $32,000; saw. his notes, told me of his judgments and bank stocks; the real estate was counted in; this was in 1862, before I wrote the first will; don\u2019t mind the valuation. He took the calculation ; said he had it at home, could not find it; made a second calculation, could not get as much; at that time it was $30,000; brought his notes, told me of the certificates of the bank stock, told me of $1000 of oil stock that was lost; it did not bother me, it was not my business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u201c He wanted 20 to be conditional legatees; I set the will as he wanted it. I counted it first and asked if that would do ? I wanted him to give Hester Ann Sykes more, when he set himself then. I would not pretend to control him. He gave her what he allowed would allow her $50 more. I suggested that to him ; I told him she would make trouble. Said nothing against his wife. I told him I would write it down if .said so, if not I would not do it; said he did not like Mr. Hunter, gave no reason ; said nothing of Cowan. I k'ept the wills; told me I should keep them; I wanted him to keep the wills, he said I should keep them ; he complained of the February will about one week before the will in dispute is written; took no- account of his estate. Coldsmith and Longeneeker were witnesses, it is the will we are trying now. Twenty conditional legatees were- to get the child\u2019s share; if it lived he wanted the child to get it; good many of my relations, not ten, perhaps seven or eight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">\u201c I never went to his house with pen, ink and papers-to get the items of the will of 30th Sept. 1867. I never went to Boyd\u2019s house to solicit him to write this will; never went there to write a will and the old man avoid me. I wrote three wills in 1867. He came to me to have me make an estimate. He had a store-house, dwelling-house, mansion-house and out-lot.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">The will in controversy, and that of February, were signed at Longenecker\u2019s office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-8\">The will of February 1867, was as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-9\">* * * \u201c Also I direct that a fair valuation or appraisement be made by three judicious neighbors, of all my estate including,my household and kitchen furniture and after being signed with their names that a copy of the same be given to each of my Executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-10\">\u201cNext I hereby bequeath to my beloved wife, Jennie C.

The evidence of the defendant was quite uniform that he had not capacity to dictate or comprehend such a will as that in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-15\">There'was evidence also that the testator confided greatly in David Longenecker, referred to him for advice about his business, and that Longenecker did his writing for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-16\">During the trial the plaintiff offered a letter from Dr. J.

Fraud is not to be presumed, nor can it be established by slight circumstances. Positive evidence, however, is not required, and circumstantial evidence is sufficient if it make out the facts to the satisfaction of the jury. We think further that there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>circumstances in this case from which the jury may infer the fact of undue influence, hut whether they ar^e so qualified by other evidence in the cause as to destroy their effect or impair it, or render it doubtful, is for the jury. It is not a case in the chancery side of the court, in which the court are required to pass upon the facts or sufficiency of the proof. \"With this explanation we answer this latter part of the point in the negative.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">Amongst other things the court charged :\u2014 * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\">, \u201c Such is the infinite diversity in the minds and conditions of men, both those in a sound state and those in an unsound condition, that it is extremely difficult to define and classify their characteristics. And if difficult, in the case of intelligent men, how much more so must it be in the case of those unfortunate beings upon whom the hand of Providence has been sorely laid, and who have not discernment to conceive or describe their wandering and delusive fancies. [This subject, therefore, as it baffles the establishment of any rule, is wisely left by our laws to the sound judgment and practical good sense of a jury.] Still amidst the multitude of attempted distinctions and definitions by medical writers, there are some features or phases that it may be well to suggest for the aid and consideration of the jury in their deliberations on this intricate and interesting subject.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-8\">After mentioning the different kinds of insanity, and what would be evidence of its existence, and commenting on the evidence in this case in reference to it, the judge proceeded:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-9\">* * * \u201cIn making a will by an aged and infirm man, whose body and mind have been impaired by disease, great care and caution should be observed in guarding him from imposition. Although his mind should be of sufficient soundness, if left free to work out its own designs, uninfluenced by improper means and unprejudiced by any fraud or deceit, yet if weak and feeble and worked upon by any cunning devices to warp it from its own deliberate purpose, and pervert it to the benefit of others, it would not be his will. The law does not condemn fair persuasions to make a will, provided the will of the testator is left uncontrolled, and the persuasion may be such as to induce the making of the will in his own favor, provided the mind and will of the testator is left free, but no falsehood or undue persuasion will be countenanced or tolerated by the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-10\">[\u201c The prominent facts relied on are his expressed disposition to Mr. Plumer to leave his property to his wife and child.

Upon that subject in all its aspects, as presented by the evidence, the learned judge delivered to the jury an able and lucid charge, explaining to them, clearly, what was the legal standard of testamentary capacity. To the charge in regard to that question no error has been assigned, except to a single paragraph, extracted from the body of it, and by which it is supposed, contrary to the whole tenor of his instructions, that the jury were told that there were no legal rules, but that it was committed entirely to their discretion. We must read the passage in connection with what preceded and followed, and so interpreted, it could not have been misunderstood. All that the learned judge meant to observe was that, as there was an infinite diversity in the minds of men, both in a sound and an unsound state, it was not possible for the law to draw any marked line, so as to say, on this side is sanity, on that insanity; that certain actions are the acts of a man incompetent to make a will, because the same actions may evince such incompetency in one man, but fall far short of it in another. Eccentricity is not insanity or mental incompetency, nor always even evidence of it. A man may all his life have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>strange and unusual, and even ridiculous ways, from habitual indulgence in mere absence of thought \u2014 in reveries or daydreams \u2014 he may dodge his acquaintances \u2014 behave as though he saw things having no existence but in his imagination, and yet thereby evince no want of testamentary capacity. But if, after having attained mature life without exhibiting any such eccentricities, his character afterwards undergoes a change, it may well induce a belief that it is the result of some morbid condition of his intellectual faculties, especially when connected with any lesion or derangement of the physical organism. We see no error, therefore, in this part of the charge, which is the subject of the 3d assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The most important question in the cause is, whether there was any evidence of undue influence exercised over the mind of the testator in the making of the will in question, which justified the court in submitting to the jury to find a verdict \u00e1gainst its validity on that ground alone. This is raised by the 1st and 3d assignments of error, which may therefore be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Undue influence is very nearly allied to fraud, yet it may be true that they are not identical, so that while undue influence comprehends fraud \u2014 fraud by no means embraces every species of undue influence: Redfield on Wills 510, n. A person, for a very disinterested purpose, and because he sincerely believes that it is the duty of a testator to make a will of a particular character, may carry his persuasion and influence beyond that point which is legitimate. Yet it would hardly deserve so harsh a name as fraud. But where the end and purpose of the influence is the benefit of the party employing it, it is not easy to distinguish and save it from that imputation. Hence, when the party upon whom <em>rests the </em>charge, derives none, or a very inconsiderable benefit from the will, there must undoubtedly be evidence of direct influence exerted at the time of making the will; such as in effect to destroy the free agency of the testator: Eckert <em>v. </em>Flowry, 7 Wright 46. But where, being an entire stranger \u2014 having no claims from lawful relationship \u2014 he derives a very considerable benefit from the act, such direct proof ought not to be, and is not required. Such was the case of Dean <em>v. </em>Negley, 5 Id. 312. General evidence of power exercised over the testator, especially if he be of comparatively weak mind from age or bodily infirmity, though not to such an extent as to destroy testamentary capacity, will be enough to raise a presumption, which ought to be met and overcome before such a will can be established. Particularly ought this to be the rule when the party to be benefited stands in a confidential relation to the testator. \u201c Where the party,\u201d says Mr. Redfield, <em>\u201c </em>to be benefited by the will has a controlling agency in procuring its formal execution, it is universally regarded as a very suspicious circumstance, and one requiring the fullest exp\u00eda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>hation. Thus, where a will was written by an attorney or solicitor, who is to be benefited by its provisions, it was considered that this circumstance should excite stricter scrutiny, and required clearer proof of capacity, and the free exercise of voluntary choice:\u201d Redfield on Wills 515, citing Duffield <em>v. </em>Robeson, 2 Harring. 384. Undoubtedly if the counsel of an old man whose mental faculties are impaired, though not destroyed by advanced age, should draw for him a will giving to himself the bulk of his estate, or a very considerable part of it, it would not be enough to show the formal execution of the paper, in the presence of two subscribing witnesses called in for the purpose. He must go further, and rebut the presumption by some evidence that the disposition made was the exercise of the free will of the testator. \u201c The existence of that fiduciary relation,\u201d says Mr. Redfield, \u201cdoes not annul the testamentary act in favor of the attorney by his client; but such fact calls for watchfulness, lest some improper influence may have been exercised. There should be very clear evidence of mental capacity and proof independent of the <em>factum </em>that the mind free and unbiassed .accompanied the act:\u201d Redfield on Wills 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Let us see, then, if there was any evidence in this case which raised this presumption and shifted the <em>onus. </em>If there was, it was a question for the jury; and however slight and in themselves insufficient in an ordinary case the circumstances mentioned by the learned judge would have been, there was no error on his part in calling the attention of the jury to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">John Boyd was a man upwards of seventy years of age,\u2014 infirm of body, and certainly not of a strong mind, \u2014 exceedingly illiterate \u2014 able to write his name, perhaps to read, but not much more \u2014 during the latter years of his life showing, to say the least, indications of folly or eccentricity. David Longenecker was not indeed a lawyer, but he was or had been a justice of the peace, and was his adviser in business matters. He acted as the scrivener in drawing this will, two prior ones, and one subsequent. Not to refer to smaller legacies to different members of his family and relatives, it gave a very considerable benefit to him personally. As appears by the instrument itself, and by David Longenecker\u2019s own testimony, John Boyd estimated his estate at thirty thousand dollars. , Besides the mansion-house, lot, stabling, and the dowry of the saddler-shop devised to his wife for her life, and after her decease to be sold and converted into money, he gave to her all the benefits of the Act of Assembly, with fifty dollars additional as her portion. What the value of the real estate was does not appear, but it will be near enough for the sake of the argument to consider this as a bequest to her of ten thousand dollars absolutely. Then he gives ten thousand dollars to his only child, Maggie, with a limitation over in case of her death before twenty-one and marriage, to some twenty persons, among them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Longenecker and two of his sons. Then follow several legacies\u2014 one of them to a son of Longenecker \u2014 amounting, in all, to seventeen hundred dollars; leaving as the residue of his estate, according to his estimate, eight thousand three hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">This would be considerably increased by the conversion of his real estate into money after the death of his wife \u2014 to what- probable extent does not appear. Then follows: <em>\u201c </em>And the balance that may remain I bequeath equally to my executors, and any surplus remaining may remain equally in their hands;\u201d and immediately afterwards, as to the money produced by the sale of the real estate: \u201c the proceeds may remain equally in the hands of my executors for divers good causes, either sold or unsold, as they-,\u201d and here there is a break, leaving the sentence unfinished. David Longenecker and John Boyd, Jr., are then named the executors. Now, is it at all probable, after all this string of .legacies, conditional and absolute, that John Boyd, being a man not apt at figures, \u2014 doing all his counting in his head, \u2014 would know how much of his estate this balance would probably be ? David Longenecker, in his testimony, does not say that he explained it to him; that he placed before him a calculation showing what the residue thus given to the executors would probably be. In the relation in which he stood it was incumbent upon him to have done this, and, if he had been wise, to call in a disinterested person to witness the fact of his having done so. I consider the following clause also as calculated to strengthen the presumption that John Boyd had no idea what amount of his estate he was thus giving to his executors: \u201c I have estimated my whole estate at thirty thousand dollars, but should a depreciation occur on bonds, judgments, notes, bank-stock or real estate, that it don\u2019t amount to my estimation, from any cause whatever, then I direct a proportionate reduction on every devise I have made, and a <em>pro rata </em>divide in the same proportion to every legatee; and if my estate comes to my estimate or exceeds-\u201d Here there is another break, and an unfinished sentence. It is clear that the penman intended that the bequest to the wife and child, all the other legacies, and also the residuary bequest, should abate in proportion if the estate fell short of thirty thousand dollars. Is it likely that if John Boyd had supposed that this residue would be one-third part, and including the proceeds of his real estate after his wife\u2019s death, perhaps much more than a third of all his property, that he would not have left the depreciation to fall on that alone ? But that is not all. There was in evidence a previous will of John Boyd, dated February 25th 1867, also drawn by David Longenecker, and of which he and James A. Dick were named as executors, which shows clearly to my apprehension that he did not consider that this residue would be more than a reasonable compensation to his executors for their trouble. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>frame of the will is very much the same as the present, and the amount of the residue, except as to the real estate, does not differ materially. It provides, \u201c the balance that may. remain of my estate I will and bequeath equally to my two executors, to be at their control in settlement of my estate and court charges, and for all claims that may justly be paid. I direct that my executors shall be well paid for carrying out my devises, and also attorneys, one or more, under them.\u201d \u201cAnd lastly, I direct, as before I have directed, that after the legacies are distributed and subject to depreciation and loss, that the remaining balance shall descend to James A. Dick and David Longenecker, my executors, for the expenses, purposes, aforesaid.\u201d In this connection, the conversation detailed by John C. Plumer, in November 1867, was very significant: \u201c He came to me in November 1867, and wanted me to write his will. He said it would be short; that he had a will in Betsy\u2019s time, in which there was considerable settlement; said he had an heir now, little Maggie, and a wife; they should have it, except two outsiders, and he named them, \u2014 John Blackburn and Jerry Boyd.\u201d On a subsequent day there was another conversation upon the same subject. \u201c Came across wbat be bad said before, that-his wife and Maggie were to have the greater part of his estate, and two outsiders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u201c It i's always,\u201d remarks Mr. Redfield, \u201cthe proper inquiry, in regard to undue influence, whether it operated as part of the transaction in making the will in question. And as that is an act always ambulatory, during the life of the testator, his conduct after its execution is entitled to some weight in determining its validity:\u201d Redfield on Wills 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">On the whole, we have arrived at the conclusion that there were circumstances in evidence in this case which raised the presumption that David Longenecker had taken advantage of the confidential position he occupied as legal adviser and scrivener, to secure substantial benefits to himself and his family, and that it threw upon the plaintiff in the issue the <em>onus </em>of showing that the provisions of the will were fully explained to and understood by the testator, and fully assented to by him. This, as we have said, necessarily made it a question for the jury, and justified the learned judge in submitting it to them in the manner he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">In regard to the 4th assignment of error, it is enough to say that it is not according to Rule 8, 6 Harris 578, and therefore is to be holden for none.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
