We affirm.-</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-17\">Morris originally brought suit in Georgia state court. On April 20, 1992, after beginning the trial, Morris announced in court that he intended to dismiss his case. Although this announcement ended the trial, Morris did not file a written dismissal with the state court until April 27,1992. Morris refiled his claim in federal district court in July 1992; however, service of process was not obtained on Har\u00e9n until October 27, 1992. The district court dismissed the case <em>sua sponte </em>for lack of jurisdiction, finding that Har\u00e9n was not timely served within the period prescribed by Georgia law. Morris makes several challenges to the district court\u2019s judgment, each of which we reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-19\">Morris first argues that the district court misconstrued the applicable statute governing the time period for renewing suits that have been discontinued or dismissed. Georgia\u2019s statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-20\">When any case has been commenced in either a state or federal court within the applicable statute of limitations and the plaintiff <em>discontinues or dismisses </em>the same, it may be recommenced in a court of this state or, if permitted by the federal rules of civil procedure, <em>in a federal court either within the applicable period of limitations or within sue months after the discontinuance or dismissal, whichever is later.. . .</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-21\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-2-61(a) (Supp.1994) (emphasis added). Morris contends that April 27,1992, is the date that begins the six-month period because that is the date the written dismissal was filed; Har\u00e9n asserts that the relevant date is April 20, the date Morris ended the trial by announcing his intention to discontin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>ue prosecution of the case. We review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"Amc\">We disagree with Morris\u2019s argument that the term \u201cdiscontinuance\u201d has no independent meaning in the statute and his assertion that we should therefore look only to the date of the filing of the written dismissal. Because section 9-2-61(a) expressly provides for the \u201cdiscontinuance <em>or </em>dismissal\u201d (emphasis added) of a case, Morris\u2019s construction would ignore the plain meaning of the statute and read out one of the statutory terms. <em>United States v. Myers, </em>972 F.2d 1566, 1572 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201cCourts should give statutory language its ordinary, usual, and plain meaning.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1813, 123 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993); <em>Butterworth v. Butterworth, </em>227 Ga. 301, 180 S.E.2d 549, 552 (1971) (\u201c[A]ll the words of the legislature, however numerous, ought to be preserved.\u201d (citation omitted)). Thus, we hold that discontinuance and dismissal refer to two different occurrences and that Har\u00e9n discontinued his case on April 20, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">Morris argues that even if we hold that he discontinued his suit on April 20, he is entitled under section 9-2-61(a) to use the date of dismissal to start the six-month period because it is the \u201clater\u201d date. Under his interpretation, the time period expires upon one of three dates, \u201cwhichever is later\u201d: (1) the expiration of the statute of limitations; (2) six months from the date of discontinuance; or (3) six months from the date of dismissal. Such a construction is contrary to the plain language of the statute. The plain meaning of the term \u201ceither\u201d is a reference to <em>two </em>choices. <em>See </em>Random House Unabridged Dictionary 625 (2d ed. 1993). Thus, the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cwhichever is later\u201d refers to the later date of two dates: (1) the end of the statute of limitations; or (2) six months after the date of discontinuance or dismissal. We also agree with the district court that, where, as here, the discontinuance of a case precedes the filing of the written dismissal, the six-month period begins to run on the earlier date of discontinuance. Otherwise, the potential for abuse or manipulation of the statutory time period would exist. Therefore, we hold that the relevant date in this case to begin running the six-month period under section 9-2-61(a) is April 20, 1992, the date Morris discontinued his lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">Next, Morris argues that the district court abused its discretion in finding that he did not exercise due diligence in serving process. In this case, Morris timely filed his complaint with the district court within the six-month period of section 9-2-61(a), but did not serve Har\u00e9n within that period. Under Georgia law, service that is perfected after the statute of limitations has run and more than five days after the complaint was filed will relate back to the date of filing only if the plaintiff \u201cdiligently attempted to perfect service.\u201d <em>Cambridge Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. City of Claxton, </em>720 F.2d 1230, 1233 (11th Cir.1983). For the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the untimely service was the result of Morris\u2019s failure to use due diligence in serving Har\u00e9n within the statutory time period. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 1233-34; <em>Walker v. Hoover, </em>191 Ga.App. 859, 383 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-14\">We also reject Morris\u2019s assertion that the district court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing was an abuse of discretion or denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-15\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
