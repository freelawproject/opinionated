The notice of the appeal in question, and the undertaking referred to in the opinion, were filed on the 31st of August, 1887. After discovering the defect in the undertaking, on the 9th of November, 1887, the appellant executed another undertaking on the appeal from the order refusing a new trial, and after its approval by one of the justices of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>supreme court, he filed the same in that court.

The right of the appellant to file such undertaking, under a statute almost identical with section 954, was upheld in the case of <em>Bomheimer </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>38 Cal. 671.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-7\"><em>L.

The undertaking only states that an appeal from the judgment has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">The motion to dismiss the appeal from the order is made on the ground that the appeal is not recited in the undertaking on appeal, and therefore the undertaking is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">In our judgment the undertaking is insufficient. Though we have held that but one undertaking on appeal is required when the appeal is from the judgment and an order denying a new trial, we cannot hold the undertaking on appeal from the order is sufficient, when no statement that such appeal has been taken is made in the undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">The act of 1861, referred to by defendant, is not in force since the adoption of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">The appeal from the order denying a new trial must be dismissed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
