The court overruled the contest, and decreed a partial distribution to Eugenie Couturier, one of the devisees named in the will. The contestants thereupon appealed. The further facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-9\"><em>Stanly, Stoney &amp; Hayes, </em>for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-10\">The court had no jurisdiction to decree a partial distribution upon the petition of the executor.

At any time after the lapse of four months from the issuing of letters testamentary or of administration, <em>any heir, devisee, or legatee </em>may present his petition to the court for the legacy or share of the estate to which he is entitled, to be given to him upon his giving bonds, with security, for the payment of his proportion of the debts of the estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">And the next section provides that \u201cnotice of the application must be given <em>to the executor or administrator \u25a0personally, </em>and to all persons interested,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">These sections are the only ones authorizing partial distribution to be made. It seems to us that they do not contemplate a petition by the executor, to whom it is of no concern whether an heir, devisee, or legatee, gets paid in advance, or not. There being no authority in the statute for the proceedings taken in the court below, it was unauthorized, and should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">We think this point arises upon the record whether the decree of partial distribution is to be considered as a judgment or as an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">We therefore advise that the decree appealed from be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Belcher, C. C., and Foote, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The Court.\u2014 For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the decree appealed from is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
