The words of that section pertinent to the matter in hand are: \u201cAn appeal may be taken to the supreme court from a superior court in the following cases: .... 3. From a judgment or order granting or refusing a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>trial, .... or against or in favor of directing the partition, sale, or conveyance of real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">If the word \u201c conveyance,\u201d as above used, can be held to include \u201c mortgage,\u201d then undoubtedly the right of appeal existed from the order made in the premises, and the petition filed herein must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">It is true that it is a well-settled rule of this court that a mortgage <em>\u201c </em>is merely a lien upon, and passes no estate or interest in, the mortgaged premises, except for purposes of taxation.\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>S. C. Mining Ass\u2019n, </em>66 Cal. 201, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">But that was intended merely to define the nature of the interest which passed to the premises included in the mortgage. It did not declare what the legislative intent was in using the word \u201c conveyance \u201d in section 963, <em>supra, </em>as affecting the right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Section 1215 of the Civil Code, which is a part of the article treating of the recording of written instruments, is as follows: \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">\u201c The term \u2018 conveyance,\u2019 as used in sections 1213 and 1214, embraces every instrument in writing by which any estate or interest in real property is created, aliened, mortgaged, or encumbered, or by which the title to any real property may be affected, except wills.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">In <em>Hassey </em>v. <em>Wilkes, </em>55 Cal. 528, the word \u201c conveyance,\u201d as used in sections 1213 and 1215 of the Civil Code, is held to embrace mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">From this it will be perceived that the word <em>\u201c </em>conveyance \u201d has been used by the legislature in a sense which would include the term \u201c mortgage.\u201d And considering that much importance must necessarily be attached to such an order as that which authorizes the \u201c mortgaging \u201d of a decedent\u2019s land by his executor, it would appear that when the legislature placed the word \u201c conveyance \u201d in section 963 <em>supra, </em>it must have intended it to be taken in a broad and comprehensive sense, similar to that given to it in the sections of the Civil Code, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Since the right of appeal existed from, the order under consideration, it follows that the writ of <em>certiorari </em>cannot be invoked. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1068; Hayne on New Trial and Appeal, sec. 302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">For these reasons, the writ prayed for should be denied, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Belcher, C. C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Hayne, 0., took no part in this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u2022 The Court. \u2014 For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the writ is denied and the petition dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
