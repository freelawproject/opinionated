The plaintiff claims title thereto as the daughter and heir at law of Apolonio Dominguez, deceased, who acquired title to the premises by mesne conveyances from Nemesio Dominguez, one of the grantees of the Mexican grant known as <em>\u201c </em>Las V\u00edrgenes,\u201d dated on the 1st of October, 1834. The defendants are American citizens, in possession of a part of the land claimed, and plead title in the United States. The trial court held that the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in interest had acquired a perfect title under the Mexican law before the acquisition of California by the United States, and that the failure to present the grant for confirmation to the board of land commissioners did not invalidate or otherwise affect her title. The questions presented by the case are the same as those decided in the case of <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Poyoreno, ante, </em>p. 448, with the exception that in the present case the juridical possession of the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>included in the grant was given prior to the approval of the grant by the departmental assembly. Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, from which, and from an order refusing a new trial, the defendants appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-5\"><em>H.

(Act of Congress of March 3, 1851; <em>Fremont </em>v. <em>United States, </em>17 How. 553; <em>Fossatts </em>v. <em>United States, </em>21 How. 447; <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Sanger, </em>92 U.

The approval by the departmental assembly after the giving of juridical possession was sufficient to invalidate the grant. (Regulations of 1828, sec. 8.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-7\"><em>Howard &amp; Robarts, </em>and <em>A. L. Rhodes, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-8\">The law of August 18, 1824, and the regulations of November, 1828, are the only laws of Mexico on the subject of granting lands in the department of the Californias. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Workman, </em>1 Wall. 762.) The law of 1824 does not prescribe or provide for any juridical possession; then only to the regulations of 1828 can we look for the authority to require such to be given. Under these regulations it was immaterial to the validity of the grant that juridical possession was given prior to the approval of the departmental assembly, or its predecessor, the territorial deputation. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>18 How. 563; <em>Fremont </em>v. <em>United States, </em>17 How. 561; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vaca, </em>18 How. 556; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moreno, </em>1 Wall. 400; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>1 Hoff.
