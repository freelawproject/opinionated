By tacking these two authorities at Talladega, Deaton can operate between Atlanta, Georgia, and points in Mississippi. Deaton also holds authority to transport numerous specific commodities from, to and between points in several southeastern states and Memphis, Tennessee, where it maintains terminal facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Lavendar holds three certificates of public convenience and necessity to operate as a motor common carrier of general commodities over regular routes, insofar as pertinent here, between Memphis, Tennessee, and Savage, Mississippi, over U. S. Highway 61, Tennessee Highway 14A and Mississippi Highway 301, serving the intermediate and off-route points of Eudora and Arkabutla, Mississippi, and the off-route points of Banks, Prichard and Nesbit, Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Deaton sought authority to buy, and Lavendar to sell, the operating authority between Memphis and Savage. Acquisition of this authority would permit Deaton, by tacking to its existing authorities, to transport general commodities in single-line service between Memphis and Atlanta and between Memphis and the Birmingham area, in competition with the twelve motor carriers who appeared as protestants in the proceedings before the Commission, six of whom are plaintiffs here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">$ # SfS * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">Since the latter part of 1959 in order to gain entry into Memphis, an important gateway for general commodity shipments, Deaton interlined with Lavendar at Nesbit, Mississippi. With this joint-line service Lavendar utilized his own tractors and drivers between Memphis and Nesbit and such interlined shipments moved over U. S. Highway 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-15\">This severe capsulation of the underlying facts serves as a backdrop for the restricted contentions of counsel for plaintiffs in oral argument, to which we now turn and respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-16\">1. It is insisted that the failure of the Commission to follow, distinguish or discuss two prior proceedings involving applications of Deaton to purchase operating rights of other carriers to gain single-line general commodity access to Memphis <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> resulted in findings and conclusions which were arbitrary and capricious and constituted an abuse of discretion within the contemplation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009 (e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>To discuss the dissimilarities between the records in Capital and Magnolia and the record of the proceedings now under review in search of a distinction would unduly extend this opinion. It is neither the duty nor the right of this court \u201c * * * to enquire into the soundness of the Commission\u2019s reasoning, the wisdom of its decisions, <em>or the consistency of its conclusion with those reached in similar cases.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied, Georgia Public Service Commission v. United States, 283 U.S. 765, 775, <em>51 </em>S.Ct. 619, 623, 75 L.Ed. 1397 (1931).) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">2. It is insisted that by according controlling weight to prior interline activities of vendor and vendee the Commission was guilty of arbitrary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">As this court observed in American Trucking Ass\u2019ns v. United States, 101 F.Supp. 710, 725 (N.D.Ala.1951): \u201cIt is the task of the Commission and not of the courts to pass upon the weight and credibility of the evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">3. It is next insisted that approval by the Commission of the instant transaction which would result in a completely new service, radically different from any contemplated in the original grants of authority, without any evidence of or finding as to public convenience and necessity was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">In reviewing an order of the Commission authorizing the consolidation of several motor carriers under Section 5(2) of the Act, the Supreme Court in McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, 321 U.S. 67, 87, 64 S.Ct. 370, 381, 88 L. Ed. 544 (1944) observed: \u201cIf the Commission did not exceed the statutory limits within which Congress confined its discretion and its findings are adequate and supported by evidence, it is not our function to upset its order.\u201d Contrary to the views which plaintiffs urge upon this court, the Commission expressly found that a new service would not emerge from Deaton\u2019s acquisition of Lavendar\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>This dispositive finding of fact is supported by substantial evidence in the record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">4. It was further insisted that in converting the regular-route authority being purchased into irregular-route authority without notice to Deaton\u2019s competitors who will obviously be affected thereby and without a showing that such action is warranted in the public interest, the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">L7] This contention stems from the Commission\u2019s requirement of a modification of vendor\u2019s certificate, as a condition precedent to the consummation of the transaction, by re-describing Lavendar\u2019s authority in irregular-route terms. The source of its power to do so is to be found in the statute. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5(2) (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>As the Supreme Court has pointed out, at the time of approval of a section 5(2) application, the Commission has the power to impose any condition on the certificate to be issued to the vendee which the \u201cCommission reasonably deems * * * useful in protecting competition, or for other statutory purposes * * United States v. Rock Island Company, 340 U.S. 419, 431, 71 S.Ct. 382, 389, 95 L.Ed. 391 (1951). Undeniably, the Commission has authority to classify common carrier service as regular and irregular route, and these distinctions are appropriate and recognized under well settled principles of transportation law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">5. Cogently advanced in brief and on oral argument is plaintiff\u2019s contention that, by failing to note that this transaction is a classic example of trafficking in operating rights, which it has in the past refused to approve and condone, the Commission\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">It is clear that Lavendar\u2019s certificate was not dormant. There is no evidence in the record that Deaton influenced Lavendar\u2019s acquisition of such certificate or his decision to grant an option to Deaton for its purchase. We are persuaded that no legitimate inference may be drawn from the evidence in this record that the existence of such option in some manner tainted the interline operations of Deaton and Lavendar.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">6. Finally, it is urged that the refusal of the Commission to restrict the operating rights to be acquired by Deaton to preclude transportation operations between Nesbit, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, over U. S. Highway 51, in view of the fact that such operations were unauthorized under Lavendar\u2019s Sub-N'o. 3 certificate, was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">The short answer to this contention is that the Commission found that such operations were in fact authorized.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here we have an interpretation placed by the Commission upon a certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>cate of its own creation. On this record we are bound by that interpretation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Having canvassed the \u201cwhole record\u201d .in obedience to the command of the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we are of the opinion that the order of the Commission rests upon adequate findings<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">The order of the Commission is affirmed. An appropriate judgment will be prepared and entered dismissing the complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-22\">.

In rejecting the various contentions of Protestants that it was being requested to sanction the acquisition by Deaton of a certificate held by Lavendar merely for the purpose of speculative barter and sale, the Commission had before it evidence that the certificate in question was issued to Lavendar June 12, 1959; that such certificate did not authorize Lavendar to serve Hernando, Mississippi, the point in which he was primarily interested; that although Lavendar has always intended to operate, and has operated under the authority of his certificate to the extent traffic has been available, he quickly concluded that he could not conduct a profitable operation thereunder and on August 3, 1959, he granted Deaton an option to purchase such certificate; that such option did not threaten the independent existence of Lavendar, but, to the contrary, it assured continuation of interline service with Deaton resulting in movement of substantial traffic to the mutual benefit of the participating carriers and the shipping public, and that Deaton had nothing to do with Lavendar\u2019s acquisition of such certificate nor his decision to offer it for sale to Deaton.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b343-15\">.
