This court previously affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment in this case. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>31 Conn. App. 925, 626 A.2d 2, remanded for reconsideration, 227 Conn. 916, 632 A.2d 695 (1993). In light of <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc., </em>supra, we now reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In this case, Michael Robinson, the plaintiff, was employed by Southern New England Telephone (SNET) until discharged in 1988. Robinson filed a grievance under his union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement claiming that SNET discharged him without just cause. Robinson\u2019s grievance was submitted for arbitration. After a hearing, the arbitration panel concluded that Robinson had been discharged for just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Robinson then filed suit in the Superior Court, claiming that he had been discharged in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 Sl-Slq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> SNET moved for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>judgment asserting that Robinson\u2019s claims had been fully adjudicated by arbitration and were, therefore, precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of SNET and this court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Generally, factual determinations made in final and binding arbitration proceedings are entitled to preclusive effect under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Id., 483. Our Supreme Court ruled in <em>Genovese, </em>however, that arbitration has no effect on an employee\u2019s ability to file suit on an independent statutory claim. Id., 484. Thus, even if an employee loses an arbitration proceeding, that employee is not precluded from pursuing his statutory rights in the Superior Court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Thus, it is clear that in the present case the trial court improperly granted summary judgment on the ground of collateral estoppel. The fact that Robinson\u2019s discharge was fully litigated before the arbitration panel has no effect on his suit. Submission of a claim to arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement does not preclude, by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, a statutory cause of action in the Superior Court. Id., 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-51q provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny employer . . who subjects any employee to . . . discharge on account of the exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>cise by such employee of rights guaranteed by the first amendment to the United States Constitution . . . provided such activity does not substantially or materially interfere with the employee\u2019s bona fide job performance or the working relationship between the employee and employer, shall be liable to such employee for damages . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
