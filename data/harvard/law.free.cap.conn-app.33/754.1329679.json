On July 20,1989, the plaintiff, Richard Carbone, was walking on a sidewalk under the control of the city of New Britain when he was caused to fall on a defective sidewalk. As a result of the fall, the plaintiff suffered serious injuries including a herniated disc and paresthesia<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in his legs. The plaintiff commenced an action, under \u00a7 13a-149, alleging that the city had breached its statutory duty to maintain the sidewalk in a safe condition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He further alleged that the city\u2019s breach of such duty caused the injuries sustained in the fall, and that he was exercising due care at that time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>After a trial, the jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $944,000. The city filed a motion to set aside the verdict claiming that the trial court\u2019s instruction as to contributory negligence was improper. The trial court denied the motion and the city appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The sole issue on the city\u2019s appeal is whether the trial court improperly charged the jury as to contributory negligence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The city complains that the trial court, in three separate portions of the charge, improperly charged as to the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proving freedom from contributory negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The gist of the city\u2019s argument is that the jury was inappropriately instructed when the trial court charged that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent if he had <em>substantially </em>or <em>materially </em>contributed to his injuries. The city contends, instead, that freedom from contributory negligence in the context of a defective highway action demands a showing of freedom from negligence that contributed <em>in any way </em>to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. At trial, the city submitted a request to charge the jury on the issue of contributory negligence in accordance with case law set out in <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transpor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number><em>tation, </em>209 Conn. 310, 321, 551 A.2d 704 (1988).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court declined to apply <em>Williamson </em>stating that the language used in <em>Williamsm </em>relating to contributory negligence was applicable only to third party negligence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant took exception to the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Our standard of review concerning claims of instructional error is well settled. \u201c[J]ury instructions must be read as a whole and . . . are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jurors in guiding them to a proper verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error. . . .\u201d (Citations omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>ted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 446, 475, 569 A.2d 10 (1990); see also <em>Lemonious </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>27 Conn. 734, 739-41, 609 A.2d 254, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 915, 614 A.2d 823 (1992). \u201cA court\u2019s instructions must be adapted to the issues and not mislead the jury but reasonably guide it in reaching a verdict. <em>Lemonious </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra [740].\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>28 Conn. App. 449, 456, 612 A.2d 114 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Our review of the charge in its entirety leads us to conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction was an accurate statement of the law as to whether the sidewalk defect was the sole proximate cause 'of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Pursuant to \u00a7 13a-149, the plaintiff was required to prove, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, the following to establish liability: \u201c \u2018(1) that the [sidewalk] was defective as claimed; (2) that the defendant actually knew of the particular defect or that, in the exercise of its supervision of highways in the city, it should have known of that defect; (3) that the defendant, having actual or constructive knowledge of this defect, failed to remedy it having had a reasonable time, under all the circumstances, to do so; and (4) that the defect must have been the sole proximate cause of the injuries and damages claimed, which means that the plaintiff must prove freedom from contributory negligence.\u2019 <em>Lukas </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>184 Conn. 205, 207, 439 A.2d 949 (1981).\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 452-53. Our Supreme Court has held that \u201c[a] defendant town is liable only if the defect is demonstrated to be the <em>sole </em>proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 316, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990). It opined that \u201cwhen \u2018the Superior Court finds that the wrongful act of the plaintiff\u2019s driver [or the plaintiff himself] is <em>a </em>proximate cause of her injury, it finds a fact inconsistent with the liability of the town . . . .\u2019 <em>[Bartram </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>71 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Conn. 686, 696, 43 A. 143 (1899)].\u201d Id.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The inquiry then becomes whether the plaintiffs conduct amounts to <em>a </em>proximate cause of his injuries, and if so, the city\u2019s liability will not exist. Our case law makes clear that \u201c \u2018[pjroximate cause is ... an act or failure to act which is a substantial factor in producing a result.\u2019 <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Officers Club of Connecticut, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 341, 349, 493 A.2d 184 (1985).\u201d <em>Blancato </em>v. <em>Randino, </em>30 Conn. App. 810, 813, 622 A.2d 1032 (1993).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The trial court properly instructed the jury as to this essential element of statutory liability. The charge gave an accurate recitation of the law as to proximate cause. It stated that proximate cause \u201crefers to a cause which was a substantial factor in causing the accident, and resulting injuries in question.\u201d The trial court explained that the city\u2019s conduct must be the <em>sole </em>proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct must not have substantially contributed to his injuries, i.e., not be <em>a </em>proximate cause of his injuries. The trial court, in its charge, stated: \u201cThe city is liable where its conduct is the sole proximate cause of the fall. But if you find that fault on the part of the plaintiff was a proximate cause, or substantial factor in caus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>ing his fall, that which we call contributory negligence, the city would not be liable.\"<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Read in its entirety, the court\u2019s charge to the jury set forth the legal requirements of contributory negligence in the context of a municipal sidewalk defect action, and did not mislead the jury. We conclude that the jury was properly guided by the court\u2019s instructions in reaching its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\"> Lilly B. Sarkizi, Edi Sarkizi, Nili Sarkizi and Elvart Esdkondarian, and the city of New Britain were named as defendants. The individual defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on January 16,1991, which the trial court granted. On October 20,1992, the plaintiff filed a substitute complaint withdrawing the allegations against the individual defendants, but retaining the allegations against the city of New Britain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person injured in person or property by means of a defective road or bridge may recover damages from the party bound to keep it in repair.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-10\"> Paresthesia is defined as \u201ca sensation of pricking, tingling, or creeping on the skin that has no objective cause.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b783-11\"> \u201cThe statute [General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149] includes injuries caused by defective public sidewalks over which a municipality has assumed control. <em>Angelillo </em>v. <em>Meriden, </em>136 Conn. 553, 556, 72 A.2d 654 (1950).\u201d <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>183 Conn. 473, 475 n.1, 439 A.2d 421 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\"> The plaintiffs brief also claims that the city\u2019s failure to certify the jury charge pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4013 did not provide this court with an adequate record upon which to afford review, and thus this appeal should be dismissed. On May 5, 1993, the plaintiff filed a motion to strike the November 25,1992 transcript of the jury charge on the same ground. After the plaintiff filed his brief for this appeal, this court denied that motion and ordered, sua sponte, that the city be permitted to file a late certificate. Having already ruled, we will not consider the plaintiff\u2019s briefed issue regarding certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b784-11\"> The challenged portions of the charge are as follows: \u201c[Y]ou must . . . determine whether any fault on the part of the plaintiff substantially contributed to any injuries that he may have sustained.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-12\">\u2018 \u2018If the plaintiff was guilty of negligence which contributed substantially in bringing about his injuries, he cannot recover . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-13\">\u201cThat is, that the plaintiff was free from contributory negligence, the plaintiff did not materially contribute to his cause or injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b785-6\"> In <em>Williamson, </em>our Supreme Court held that the following instruction by the trial court on third party negligence was a correct statement of the law: \u201c \u2018If there has been an injury caused by a defect in the highway, and all other elements have been proven, the plaintiff may still not recover unless she shows that there is no negligence, carelessness or inattention by herself or a third person which contributed to such injury. That is to say that even if the road were defective, if there is any negligence by the [plaintiff], even one percent, she may not recover. Likewise, if a third person was careless, and that carelessness caused in any way the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, she is not entitled to recover, which likewise, if a third person were careless, negligent, and that caused in any way the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, she is not entitled to recover.\u2019 . . . See <em>Bartram </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>71 Conn. 686, 690, 43 A. 143 (1899).\u201d <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>209 Conn. 310, 321, 551 A.2d 704 (1988). Although our Supreme Court approved the above language as it related to third party negligence, which is no different from a plaintiff\u2019s negligence, the <em>Williamson </em>court, by doing so, did not mandate the use of this exact language. Here, the trial court\u2019s charge was equally accurate. \u201cWhile the instructions need not be exhaustive, perfect or technically accurate, they must be correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Channer, </em>28 Conn. App. 161, 172, 612 A.2d 95, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 921, 614 A.2d 826 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b785-7\"> While it is not necessary to rule on the trial court\u2019s proposition that the language in <em>Williamson </em>prescribed a different standard for third party negligence in municipal highway actions, we note that our Supreme Court has held that the sole proximate cause standard for liability under the municipal highway liability statute applies to wrongful acts of both plaintiffs and third parties alike. <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 316, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b787-6\"> See <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Liimatainen, </em>153 Conn. 163, 165 n.2, 215 A.2d 406 (1965), which states: \u201cContributory negligence ... is available as a defense whenever any negligence on the part of the plaintiff is <em>a </em>proximate cause of his injuries.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also <em>Bartram </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>71 Conn. 686, 690, 43 A. 143 (1899) in which the court addresses the contributory negligence issue as follows: \u201cIf the negligence of himself or of a third person is also a proximate cause, he cannot say with truth that he was injured by the defect <em>. . . </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b787-7\"> The language in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>28 Conn. App. 449, 457, 612 A.2d 114 (1992), stating that \u201cit is settled that the substantial factor test is not the proper method of analysis for establishing causation under the statute [General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149],\u201d is not inconsistent with this opinion. The <em>Sullivan </em>court was addressing causation as it related to the defendant\u2019s misconduct. In that context, the substantial factor test is not the appropriate test because the action is not one of negligence, but one for breach of a statutory duty on the part of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b788-13\"> The trial court also instructed the jury that it must not focus myopically on any one part of the charge. \u201cI instruct you not to single out any sentence, or any individual point, or instruction in this charge, and ignore others.
