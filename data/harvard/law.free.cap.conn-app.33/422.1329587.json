Associates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Packtor was injured in a fall on September 13,1987, while climbing the second floor stairway, described as a \u201cship\u2019s ladder,\u201d in the Stop &amp; Shop store at 255 East Main Street, Clinton, where he was employed. J.M.H. Associates owned the building and leased it to Stop &amp; Shop. In an action returnable August 21,1990, Pack-tor brought suit for damages against the owner of the building and the contractor who had constructed the stairway. Stop &amp; Shop filed a motion to intervene pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for reimburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>ment of workers\u2019 compensation payments made to its employee, Packtor, for injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment. It is uncontested that the intervention occurred within thirty days of notice as required by \u00a7 31-293. The motion was granted and Stop &amp; Shop filed an intervening complaint on October 9, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">On December 2, 1991, J.M.H. Associates filed a motion for summary judgment as to the third and fourth counts of Packtor\u2019s complaint. J.M.H. Associates challenged Packtor\u2019s third count, which sounded in common law negligence, as time-barred by the two year limitation period of General Statutes \u00a7 52-584. Packtor\u2019s fourth count alleging a statutory cause of action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-389<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>29-391<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was challenged because the injury alleged was not the type of injury that the statutes were intended to prevent. In a memorandum of decision filed April 23, 1992, the trial court, <em>Pellegrino, J., </em>granted the summary judgment on both counts. Packtor now appeals challenging that decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>On May 29,1992, J.M.H. Associates filed a separate motion for summary judgment as to Stop &amp; Shop. The motion was granted by the trial court, <em>Maiocco, J., </em>in a memorandum filed on January 5,1993. The trial court ruled that because Packtor\u2019s claim was barred by the statute of limitations, Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s derivative right to reimbursement was likewise time-barred. Stop &amp; Shop appeals challenging that decision. We will deal with the claims of the plaintiff and the intervening plaintiff separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Packtor claims only that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment after concluding that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-389 and 29-391 did not apply to the facts and circumstances of this case. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The fourth count of Packtor\u2019s complaint alleged that, as a result of the failure of the defendants to provide a suitable interior stairway as mandated by \u00a7 29-389, Packtor was injured and entitled to damages pursuant to \u00a7 29-391. The undisputed facts are that access to the second floor of the building was possible only by the stairway in question, that Packtor was ascending that stairway in the normal course of his duties when injured, and that there was no fire or other emergency at the time. We agree with the trial court that the meaning of \u00a7 29-389 is plain and unambiguous. Both \u00a7\u00a7 29-389 and 29-391 are primarily concerned with emergency stairways and unobstructed escape routes from buildings, and injuries resulting from egress or \u201cescape from such a building in case of <em>fire or other </em>emergency.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 29-389. We note further that these statutes are found in Chapter 541 entitled \u201cBuilding, Fire and Demolition Codes. Fire Marshals and Fire Hazards. Safety of Public and Other Structures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u201cStatutes are to be applied as their words direct. <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 141, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986).\u201d <em>River Dock &amp; Pile, Inc. </em>v. <em>O &amp; G Industries, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 787, 805, 595 A.2d 839 (1991). \u201c \u2018When language used in a statute is clear and unambiguous, its meaning is not subject to modification or construction. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 40, 63, 578 A.2d 1054 (1990). \u201cThe objective of statutory construction is to give effect to the intended purpose of the legislature. . . . It is axiomatic that, where the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, construction of the statute by reference to its history and purpose is unnecessary.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 225, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992), quoting <em>Elections Review Committee of the Eighth Utilities District </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>219 Conn. 685, 692, 595 A.2d 313 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We conclude that in accordance with the plain language of \u00a7 29-389 the trial court properly rendered summary judgment for the defendant as no factual predicate existed to sustain a statutory cause of action under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Stop &amp; Shop first alleges that the trial court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> improperly applied to its claims the two year limitation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-584<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rather than the three year general tort statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 52-577.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Stop &amp; Shop claims that it has an employer\u2019s statutory cause of action, which survives the trial court\u2019s ruling barring the employee\u2019s remedy for a procedural deficiency. Further, it argues that its statutory cause of action is governed by the limitation in \u00a7 52-577, which applies to actions founded on a tort.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Stop &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Shop argues that since Packtor was injured on September 13, 1987, and the intervening complaint is dated August 22, 1990, such intervention was within the three year limitation and, therefore, is not time-barred. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 specifically grants an employer who has paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an employee the right to join as a party plaintiff in the employee\u2019s action against a third party tortfeasor. <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 533, 536, 582 A.2d 1174 (1990). It is an independent derivative action. <em>Ricard </em>v. <em>Stanadyne, Inc., </em>181 Conn. 321, 323, 435 A.2d 352 (1980). It is a statutory and substantive right to reimbursement that is \u201cin effect one of subrogation to the right of the injured employee to recover for the tort committed against him.\u201d <em>Stavola </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>136 Conn. 670, 677, 73 A.2d 831 (1950).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> An employer who has paid, or by award has become obligated to pay, compensation may also sue the third party in his own name directly for reimbursement. If either the employer or the employee sues the third party, the other is entitled to notice and an opportunity to join in the action. <em>Enquist </em>v. <em>General Datacom, </em>218 Conn. 19, 23, 587 A.2d 1029 (1991). An employer\u2019s \u201csole means to assert any right against the plaintiff\u2019s third party recovery [is] by way of the procedure set forth in \u00a7 31-293.\u201d <em>Skitromo </em>v. <em>Meriden Yellow Cab Co., </em>204 Conn. 485, 489, 528 A.2d 826 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We agree with Stop &amp; Shop that \u201cit would be inequitable to bar an intervention action by an employer <em>for no other reason </em>than that the <em>employee </em>failed to file his or her action within the applicable period of limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>tion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We do not bar the employer on that ground.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The issue we must determine is whether the employer\u2019s action is itself timely filed. In order to decide that question, we must first determine which statute of limitations governs the rights of an employer seeking to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits from a third party tortfeasor. Since an intervening employer\u2019s statutory right to reimbursement depends on the liability of the third party to the employee, the statute of limitations applicable to the employer\u2019s right of action must be the same as that governing the employee\u2019s underlying action against the tortfeasor. See 101 C.J.S., Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 1014 (b) (1958); 82 Am. Jur. 2d, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 460 (1992); annot., 41 A.L.R.2d 1044, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">An employer has no cause of action unless the employee has a cause of action. <em>Stavola </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>supra, 678. It may be argued that the employee in this case did have a valid cause of action, but that it was barred merely by a procedural failure on the employee\u2019s part. The action is not barred, however, by the employee\u2019s procedural failure but by the failure of the employer to bring suit in a timely manner. If the employer had initiated the action, it would not be prosecuting its own action, but the action of the employee. Therefore, it would be illogical to grant greater rights to an employer whose rights are derivative, than to the employee from whom those derivative rights flow.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>In this case, the employee\u2019s cause of action is limited by the personal injury statute of limitations found in General Statutes \u00a7 52-584. Packtor\u2019s injury occurred on September 13, 1987. Stop &amp; Shop did not initiate any action until it filed a motion to intervene on August 27, 1990, well beyond the two year statute of limitations. Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s derivative right to reimbursement was, therefore, time-barred pursuant to \u00a7 52-584.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Stop &amp; Shop also argues that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-389 and 29-391 are applicable to the injury sustained by Packtor, that the defendants failed to provide two suitable remote means of egress, that the statutes are not limited to injuries sustained in fires or other emergencies, and that they do not require a person to be exiting a building when injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">For the reasons stated in part I of this decision, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-11\"> Packtor has appealed from the summary judgment rendered against him and Stop &amp; Shop Companies. Stop &amp; Shop has appealed only from the summary judgment rendered against it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\"> The defendants in the substituted complaint filed January 7,1991, are Seppala &amp; AHO Construction Company, Inc., the general contractor that constructed the premises, and J.M.H. Associates. Judgment was rendered, pursuant to a stipulation filed August 13,1992, against the defendant Seppala &amp; AHO Construction Co. in the amount of $238,120.24, reduced by compensation benefits paid to the plaintiff in the amount of $214,120.24. The sole defendant on appeal is J.M.H. Associates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) When any injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter has been sustained under circumstances creating in a third person other than the employer a legal liability to pay damages for the injury, the injured employee may claim compensation under the provisions of this chapter, but the payment or award of compensation shall not affect the claim or right of action of the injured employee against the third person, but the injured employee may proceed at law against the third person to recover damages for the injury; and any employer having paid, or having become obligated to pay, compensation trader the provisions of this chapter may bring an action against the third person to recover any amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to the injured employee. If either the employee or the employer brings an action against the third person, he shall immediately notify the other, in writing, by personal presentation or by registered or certified mail, of the action and of the name of the court to which the writ is returnable, and the other may join as a party plaintiff in the action within thirty days after such notification, and, if the other fails to join as a party plaintiff, his right of action against the third person shall abate. In any case in which an employee brings an action against a third party in accordance with the provisions of this section, and the employer is a party defendant in the action, the employer may join as a party plaintiff in the action. The bringing of any action against an employer shall not constitute notice to the employer within the mean-</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>ing of this section. If the employer and the employee join as parties plaintiff in the action and any damages are recovered, the damages shall be so apportioned that the claim of the employer, as defined in this section, shall take precedence over that of the injured employee in the proceeds of the recovery, after the deduction of reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred by the employee in effecting the recovery. The rendition of a judgment in favor of the employee or the employer against the third party shall not terminate the employer\u2019s obligation to make further compensation which the commissioner thereafter deems payable to the injured employee. If the damages, after deducting the employee\u2019s expenses as provided in this subsection, are more than sufficient to reimburse the employer, damages shall be assessed in his favor in a sum sufficient to reimburse him for his claim, and the excess shall be assessed in favor of the injured employee. No compromise with the third person by either the employer or the employee shall be binding upon or affect the rights of the other, unless assented to by him. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">This section was recently amended by Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 7, but the amendment does not affect the issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-389 provides in pertinent part: \u201cstairways and fire ESCAPES on certain buildings.

Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s brief refers to Judge Pellegrino\u2019s April 23, 1993 memorandum of decision. This seems to have been done in error since it was Judge Maiocco\u2019s January 5, 1993 decision that directly decided the summary judgment against Stop &amp; Shop and it is from that decision that they appeal. We conclude, however, that because Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s legal argument addresses its own and not the plaintiff Pack-tor\u2019s claims, there is no issue of standing.
