The dispositive issue is whether the defendant can properly appeal from the trial court's order granting the plaintiff's motion to terminate the stay. We conclude that Practice Book \u00a7 4049<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires that the amended appeal be dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. The trial court dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage on October 19, 1993, and ordered the defendant to vacate the family residence within forty-five days. On November 5,1993, the defendant filed an appeal, asserting that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiff possession of the family residence. The filing of the appeal stayed the execution of the order requiring her to vacate the residence. Practice Book \u00a7 4046.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 6, 1993, the plaintiff filed a motion to terminate the stay pursuant to \u00a7 4046. After a hearing, the trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion on December 21, 1993, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>ordered termination of the stay on December 30,1993, at 5 p.m. In response, the defendant filed a motion for review of the order with this court. This court granted review but denied the relief requested on February 16, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The defendant filed an amended appeal on January 10,1994, claiming that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiffs motion to terminate the stay. On January 20,1994, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the amended appeal, arguing that a party cannot directly appeal from an order regarding a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">\u201cIssues regarding a stay of execution cannot be raised on direct appeal. \u2018The sole remedy of any party desiring . . . [review of] ... an order concerning a stay of execution shall be by motion for review under [Practice Book] Sec. 4053.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scarsdale National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Schmitz, </em>24 Conn. App. 230, 233 n.5, 587 A.2d 164 (1991), quoting Practice Book \u00a7 4049; see also <em>Mulholland </em>v. <em>Mulholland, </em>31 Conn. App. 214, 219 n.4, 624 A.2d 379, cert. granted, 227 Conn. 905, 632 A.2d 693 (1993); <em>In re Clifton B., </em>15 Conn. App. 367, 368 n.1, 544 A.2d 666 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Because Practice Book \u00a7 4049 provides that the defendant\u2019s sole remedy for review of a stay order is by way of a motion for review under Practice Book \u00a7 4053,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant cannot properly raise this claim by way of a direct appeal or amended appeal. In the present case, this court has already considered whether the trial court improperly granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to terminate the stay when we considered the defendant\u2019s motion for review under \u00a7 4053.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. Holloway, 22 Conn. App. 265, 577 A.2d 1064, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 819, 576 A.2d 547 (1990), we declined to consider a claim that the trial court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for articulation on the basis that the defendant\u2019s argument had already been reviewed by this court in connection with the defendant\u2019s motion for review filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4054.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We compared Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4049 and 4054, and concluded that \u201c[t]o hold otherwise would mean that a defendant, having unsuccessfully sought review by this court of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for articulation, could thereafter present the same issue to this court on the merits of the appeal. We would then be providing two appellate reviews of the same issue.\u201d Id., 275. In this case, if we permitted the defendant to raise this issue again in her amended appeal, we would \u201cbe providing two appellate reviews of the same issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss the defendant's amended appeal is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4049 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe sole remedy of any party desiring the court to review an order concerning a stay of execution shall be by motion for review under Sec. 4053. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b868-10\"> The defendant\u2019s amended appeal and the plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss relate only to the termination of the stay.
