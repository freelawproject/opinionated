Since we conclude that we cannot afford practical relief to the department, we dismiss the case as moot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The following facts were found by the trial court. Mary Landino was a resident of the town of Hamden but lived at Barbara\u2019s Rest Home in East Hampton. On November 20,1990, Landino was admitted to the plaintiff hospital. At that time, Landino was receiving supplemental social security benefits (SSI) of $386 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>month. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq. She also was a title XIX Medicaid recipient. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.; General Statutes \u00a7 17-134a et seq. She was discharged on December 10,1990. The hospital bill was $7964.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The hospital applied to have the bill paid by Medicaid. Medicaid denied the application because it concluded that Landino\u2019s hospitalization was not medically necessary. On November 20,1990, the hospital applied for GAMA from East Hampton to cover the bill. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 17-272 et seq. On February 1,1991, East Hampton forwarded the application to Hamden. See General Statutes \u00a7 17-273 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 8, 1991, Hamden denied the plaintiff\u2019s application because the services were eligible for payment under title XIX and were not eligible for payment by Hamden as GAMA. Hamden stated, in its denial, that services deemed \u201cineligible [sic]\u201d for payment by title XIX were Ineligible for payment as GAMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The plaintiff then requested that the dispute be referred to the commissioner of income maintenance or the commissioner\u2019s representative pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-292 (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The commissioner\u2019s repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>sentative found that the hospital was not entitled to payment from Hamden because the patient did not appeal the initial denial of her Medicaid application pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 17-274 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">On April 3, 1992, the plaintiff appealed the department\u2019s decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On November 4,1992, the trial court sustained the appeal and reversed the department\u2019s decision. The trial court found that \u00a7 17-274; see footnote 5; did not require the applicant to appeal the denial of Medicaid benefits to be eligible for GAMA benefits but required only that the patient apply for the benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">On November 20, 1992, the department appealed from the trial court\u2019s decision. The town did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u201cMootness applies to situations where events have occurred during the pendency of an appeal that make an appellate court incapable of granting practical relief through a disposition on the merits. . . . The standards governing mootness are well established. Because this court has no jurisdiction to render advisory opinions, no appeal can be decided on its merits in the absence of an actual controversy for which judicial relief can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>be granted.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Papagorgiou </em>v. <em>Anastopoulous, </em>29 Conn. App. 142, 146, 613 A.2d 853, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 919, 618 A.2d 527 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"AiT\">We are incapable of granting practical relief to the department by deciding the merits of this case. The judgment caused the town to be aggrieved since it required the town to certify the eligibility of Landino for GAMA. General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 17-292g.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The town, if it desired to contest the judgment, could have appealed to this court within twenty days of the judgment. Practice Book \u00a7 4009.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In a case with multiple parties, the appeal by only one party does not stay the liability of the nonappealing parties. <em>Gruber </em>v. <em>Friedman, </em>104 Conn. 107, 112, 132 A. 395 (1926); <em>Donnarumma </em>v. <em>Korkin, </em>97 Conn. 223, 224, 116 A. 178 (1922). Therefore, since the town did not appeal, it is bound by the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>After the town certifies the eligibility of Landino in accordance with the judgment, the commissioner of income maintenance will be obligated to pay directly to the hospital the cost of treatment provided to the patient. General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 17-292g. We cannot change the commissioner\u2019s statutory liability to the hospital generated by the certification of the patient\u2019s eligibility. Any disagreement by the commissioner to the certification by the town does not involve the hospital. That dispute is between the commissioner and the town because the commissioner\u2019s liability is derivative from the town\u2019s liability. Id. Thus, we can afford no practical relief to the commissioner and the case is therefore moot. See <em>Papagorgiou </em>v. <em>Anastopoulous, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\"> The defendants are the town of Hamden and the Connecticut department of income maintenance. Only the department of income maintenance appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\"> Since we conclude that this court lacks jurisdiction to hear the merits of the appeal, we do not reach the issues on appeal raised in the defendant\u2019s brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17-273 (b) provides: \u201cOn and after April 1,1984, no town shall refuse to accept an application for general assistance or general assistance medical benefits because a person is deemed not to be a resident.
