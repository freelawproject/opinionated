We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim and reverse the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the trial court. Because this is dispositive of the appeal, we need not address the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The jury could have reasonably found the following facts. On September 29,1984, at approximately 3 a.m., the defendant, James Leroy, was involved in a two vehicle collision with Leslie Daniel in Enfield. The defendant\u2019s car was traveling east and Daniel\u2019s car was heading west on Shaker Road when the two cars collided. The area where the impact occurred was rural, dark and badly lit, with curves and hills. Ralph Adamczyk was the only eyewitness to the accident. He was traveling behind Daniel\u2019s car and observed both headlights of the defendant\u2019s oncoming car as it came around a corner. As the defendant\u2019s car approached, the driver\u2019s side headlight disappeared twice from Adamczyk\u2019s view. Both cars swerved to avoid a collision. Adamczyk spoke with and observed the defendant after the collision and did not consider him to be intoxicated. At the accident scene, police officers noted the smell of alcohol on the defendant, and the defendant had difficulty maintaining his balance and exhibited slurred speech. The defendant was unable to perform two field sobriety tests satisfactorily. The defendant\u2019s breath test yielded a blood alcohol reading of 0.215 of 1 percent, revealing that he had consumed between ten to thirteen beers.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">As a result of the accident, Daniel suffered serious injuries. She was unconscious from the time of the accident until October 19,1984, and remained hospitalized until late November, 1984. Upon release from the hospital, Daniel\u2019s speech and memory were impaired, she could not walk or use her left arm, and her vision was limited. She received more than seven months of physical, occupational and educational rehabilitation therapy. Daniel\u2019s speech is no longer impaired and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>has relearned to read and write, but has not regained all of her memory. Daniel cannot walk or use her left arm or hand, and has impaired vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We first turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly instructed the jury as to proximate cause. The defendant concedes that this claim is unpreserved. He seeks review of this claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). In <em>Golding, </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of error if all of the following conditions are met: \u201c(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">We find the defendant\u2019s claim reviewable. In examining the first criterion of <em>Golding, </em>we note that it was designed to avoid remands for the purpose of supplementing the record. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>223 Conn. 674, 613 A.2d 788 (1992). \u201c \u2018If the facts revealed by the record are insufficient, unclear or ambiguous as to whether a constitutional violation has occurred, we will not attempt to supplement or reconstruct the record, or to make factual determinations, in order to decide the defendant\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>29 Conn. App. 724, 732, 618 A.2d 50 (1992), cert. denied, 225 Conn. 902, 421 A.2d 285 (1993), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240. Our review of the record indicates that the facts are sufficiently clear and unambiguous for this court to determine whether a constitutional violation has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>The second prong of <em>Golding </em>is also satisfied. \u201cAn accused has a fundamental right, protected by the due process clauses of the federal and Connecticut constitutions, to be acquitted unless proven guilty of each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 363, 521 A.2d 150 (1987). Improper jury instructions on an essential element of the crime charged, in this case proximate cause, implicates a fundamental constitutional right. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>176 Conn. 451, 460, 408 A.2d 232 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kwaak, </em>21 Conn. App. 138, 572 A.2d 1015, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 811, 576 A.2d 540 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Next, we must consider whether the defendant met his burden as to the third requirement of <em>Golding. </em>We must inquire whether the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and, if so, whether it clearly has deprived the defendant of a fair trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The defendant claims that the jury instructions were inaccurate as to whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was the proximate cause of the victim\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, he argues that the trial court instructed the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>that if the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201ca substantial factor\u201d in bringing about the victim\u2019s injuries, his conduct was the proximate cause of those injuries. The defendant maintains that his actions would be the proximate cause of the victim\u2019s injuries only if a jury found that his conduct was \u201cthe predominating cause or the substantial factor\u201d in producing the victim\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The state relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>194 Conn. 119, 125, 479 A.2d 226 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1190, 105 S. Ct. 963, 83 L. Ed. 2d 968 (1985), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomassi, </em>137 Conn. 113, 118, 75 A.2d 67 (1950), for the proposition that because the defendant\u2019s intoxication contributed to the injuries, liability arises. The issue before the <em>Jacobs </em>and <em>Tomassi </em>courts was not causation and the effect of concurrent events. Rather, both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>courts spoke to the effect of negligent medical care as to the issue of causation. Thus, the case at bar is distinguished from those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Our review of the charge in its entirety indicates that the trial court\u2019s instructions were not a correct statement of the law on the issue of proximate causation. \u201cWhile the instructions need not be exhaustive, perfect or technically accurate, they must be correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Channer, </em>28 Conn. App. 161, 172, 612 A.2d 95, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 921, 614 A.2d 826 (1992). \u201c \u2018Proximate cause\u2019 in the criminal law does not necessarily mean the last act of cause, or the act in point of time nearest to [the result]. The concept of proximate cause incorporates the notion that an accused may be charged with a criminal offense even though his acts were not the immediate cause of [the result]. <em>An act or omission to act is the proximate cause . . . when it substantially and materially contributes, in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by an efficient, intervening cause, to the [result]. It is the cause without which the [result] would not have occurred and the predominating cause, the substantial factor, from which [the result]follows as a natural, direct and immediate consequence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spates, </em>176 Conn. 227, 233-34, 405 A.2d 656 (1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 922, 99 S. Ct. 1248, 59 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kwaak, </em>21 Conn. App. 138, 145-46, 572 A.2d 1015, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 811, 576 A.2d 540 (1990).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The charge did not inform the jury that the element of proximate cause is established if the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>actions were \u201cthe predominating cause, or the substantial factor\u201d of the injuries sustained by the victim. Instead, the trial court repeatedly used the phrase \u201ca substantial factor,\u201d language that the jury could reasonably interpret as permitting a guilty verdict simply if the defendant\u2019s conduct was one of the many factors that caused the injuries. Connecticut law requires for a conviction, however, that a jury find beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cthe predominating cause, or the substantial factor\u201d of the injuries, not one of many factors. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Spates, </em>supra, 234. It is not crucial for jury instructions to include the exact language offered in <em>Spates, </em>but words that communicate the meaning presented in <em>Spates </em>are crucial. Here, the instructions did not include supplemental language correcting the possibility of misinterpretation presented by the \u201ca substantial factor\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u201c[T]he failure to instruct the jury adequately on each essential element of the crime charged may have resulted in a violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights implicating the fairness of his trial . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>216 Conn. 367, 383, 579 A.2d 1066 (1990). \u201cIt is, of course, constitutionally axiomatic that the jury be instructed on the essential elements of a crime charged.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>206 Conn. 685, 708, 539 A.2d 561 (1988). The trial court gave instructions that were not correct in law on the issue of causation, thus, we conclude that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">This does not end our inquiry. We must inquire as to whether the constitutional violation clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra. \u201cIn reviewing a constitutionally based challenge to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, we must examine the charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Snook, </em>210 Conn. 244, 275-76, 555 A.2d 390, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 924, 109 S. Ct. 3258, 106 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>209 Conn. 332, 338, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Oler, </em>24 Conn. App. 347, 358, 588 A.2d 1080, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 909, 593 A.2d 134, cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 319, 116 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991). \u201cThe charge is not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>23 Conn. App. 160, 164, 580 A.2d 520 (1990), cert. denied, 216 Conn. 831, 583 A.2d 130, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 981, 111 S. Ct. 1635, 113 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1991).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>26 Conn. App. 259, 269, 600 A.2d 1364 (1991), cert. denied, 221 Conn. 911, 602 A.2d 10 (1992). An error in the charge requires reversal only if, in the context of the whole instruction, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>209 Conn. 322, 338, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><em>Spates </em>requires that an accused\u2019s conduct be <em>the </em>predominating cause or <em>the </em>substantial factor of the resulting injuries and that this element be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Spates, </em>supra, 234. As we stated, it is possible that an accused\u2019s conduct may be <em>a </em>substantial factor in resulting injuries, but not the predominating cause or <em>the </em>substantial factor. A jury, faced with these instructions, could reasonably convict without finding that the actions were the predominating cause or the substantial factor. Because the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury did not provide a substantively accurate statement of the law on the essential element of causation, an issue strongly contested at trial, it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled in rendering the verdict. The trial court\u2019s failure to give an accurate statement of the law as to proximate cause in its charge, a clear constitutional violation, misled the jury and deprived the defendant of a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>The fourth criterion of <em>Golding </em>requires a two-step inquiry. First, we must determine if the alleged constitutional violation is subject to harmless error analysis. If the claimed error is subject to harmless error analysis, we then determine if the state has met its burden of proving that the error was harmless. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Certain constitutional violations are subject to harmless error analysis<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and do not require automatic reversal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cohane, </em>193 Conn. 474, 484-85, 479 A.2d 763, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 990, 105 S. Ct. 397, 83 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1984). Jury instructions containing misstatements of law as to an essential element of the offense charged are properly subject to harmless error analysis. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>226 Conn. 237, 627 A.2d 877 (1993) (error in instruction as to essential element of crime subject to harmless error analysis); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rouleau, </em>204 Conn. 240, 528 A.2d 343 (1987) (jury instruction containing misstatement of law on burden of proving defense of duress constituted harmful error); <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 437, 493 A.2d 865 (1985) (harmless error analysis applied to misstatement of essential element of crime in jury charge); see also <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>481 U.S. 497, 107 S. Ct. 1918, 95 L. Ed. 2d 439 (1987) (harmless error inquiry applicable to jury instruction misstating element of offense); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 106 S. Ct. 3101, 92 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1986) (incorrect instruction on element of malice, harmless error inquiry appropriate). \u201cIn such circumstances we require the state to prove the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cohane, </em>supra, 485. \u201cAn erroneous instruction, even of constitutional dimension, is harmless if, viewed in the context of the charge as a whole, there is no rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>sonable possibility that the jury was misled.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kwaak, </em>supra, 160-61. We have already determined that a jury instruction that does not impart an accurate statement of the law as to proximate cause has the reasonable possibility of misleading a jury in rendering a verdict. The state has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneous charge was not misleading and thus harmless. We therefore conclude that the court\u2019s instruction on proximate cause was constitutionally flawed and misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60d (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle when, while operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both, he causes serious physical injury to another person as a consequence of the effect of such liquor or drug.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\"> Whereas the first two conditions of <em>Golding </em>are determinations of whether a defendant\u2019s claim will be reviewed, the third prong constitutes a review of the merits. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>222 Conn. 591, 603, 610 A.2d 1177 (1992) (\u201c[hjaving surmounted the threshold requirements for review . . . the plaintiff is entitled to a determination of the merits of his claim under the third criterion\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\"> In the portion of the charge to the jury relating to proximate causation the trial court stated as follows: \u201cNow, as I previously instructed, the state must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged intoxication of the defendant caused the serious injury of another person. Therefore, if you find intoxication but also find that it was not <em>a substantial factor </em>in causing the alleged injuries of the victim, then the intoxication was a condition surrounding the injury, not a cause of it, and you must return a finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">\u201cFor the defendant to be found guilty, the state must establish beyond a reasonable doubt a cause or a relation between the accident caused by the defendant being intoxicated, and the injury it claims resulted from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>This causal connection must rest upon more than surmise, speculation or conjecture. You, as triers of the facts, are not to be concerned with possibilities but only with reasonable probabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u201cIn consideration of the causes of this accident and the result, you should keep in mind that all collisions that occur on the highways are not necessarily caused by the fault of some person. Accidents may happen when neither party is at fault. An accident which could not be prevented by the exercise of reasonable care and prudence is called an unavoidable accident, and if you believe from the evidence that this occurrence was of such a character, the defendant is entitled to a verdict of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u201cAs I have said, the state must prove that the defendant\u2019s intoxication proximately caused serious physical injury to Leslie Daniel. Proximately caused is a direct cause. It\u2019s an act or a failure to act, followed in its natural consequence by a result, without the intervention of any other superseding cause. Whether the sequence of events is unbroken by any intervening cause, an act or a failure to act is a proximate cause of the result. Proximate cause, thus, is an act or a failure to act which is <em>a substantial factor </em>in producing the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">\u201cNow, the intoxication of the defendant need not be the sole proximate cause of the injuries. All that is required is that the intoxication of the defendant, if you find that he was intoxicated, be <em>a substantial factor </em>in bringing about the injuries to Leslie Daniel. Now, if you find that the defendant\u2019s intoxication \u2014 if you find intoxication, but if you find that such intoxication . . . was <em>a substantial factor, </em>then the state has met its burden in this element.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\"> In its argument and brief, the state misstates the <em>Spates </em>definition of proximate cause. It omits \u201cthe predominating cause, or the substantial factor\u201d language. That dereliction significantly changes the reasoning of <em>Spates </em>as to the import of proximate cause. To determine the proximate cause of injury or death for conviction, in cases involving cumulative causes, a fact finder is required to find \u201cthe predominating cause, or the substantial factor.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spates, </em>176 Conn. 227, 234, 405 A.2d 656 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b267-6\"> <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24, 87 S.
