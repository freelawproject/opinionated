On December 21,1991, at approximately 12:20 p.m., Julius Levine was watching television in his living room when the defendant knocked on his door. Levine had been acquainted with the defendant for fifteen years through a mutual friend. Levine allowed the defendant to join him. In Levine\u2019s living room was a Christmas tree with several gifts beneath it. At about 1:30 p.m., Janice Levine, Julius\u2019 wife, returned from shopping. She had purchased a set of crystal dishes and a pair of men\u2019s white Nike sneakers, which she placed with the other gifts under the tree. She also purchased a pair of boys\u2019 white Fila sneakers for their son. The son told the defendant how much he liked his new sneakers. While the defendant was at the Levine\u2019s, he helped Levine move some chairs to the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The Levines prepared for a Christmas party while the defendant cut their son\u2019s hair downstairs. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>approximately 6:45 p.m., the defendant left the Levines\u2019 house. The Levines left for their scheduled party at 7:30 p.m. and took their children to a neighbor\u2019s house. Upon their return at 10:30 p.m., the Levines discovered the backdoor open, the basement window kicked in, and the presents and other items missing. Gift wrappings were found in the Levines\u2019 backyard in a trash bag. The missing items included a VCR, sweaters, pants, two sterling bracelets, boots, the sneakers, the set of dishes, Barbie dolls, doll accessories, and many other articles. The value of the missing merchandise was $2100.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">That same evening, the defendant visited a friend, Shelly Brown, whose house was within walking distance of the Levines\u2019. The defendant showed Brown two children\u2019s sterling bracelets, which he claimed he had purchased. The defendant left Brown\u2019s house and returned with two shopping bags of items that included clothing, baby doll accessories, a set of crystal dishes, a pair of men\u2019s Nike sneakers and a pair of boys\u2019 Fila sneakers. Brown bought the set of crystal dishes from the defendant for $10.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">On December 22, 1991, Edward Hill visited Brown\u2019s house and took the set of dishes from her. Hill returned the dishes to the Levines who acknowledged that the set was the one that Janice Levine had purchased the day before. Brown was visited by the police and Levine; she gave a signed statement as to the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s visit and sale to her of the dish set.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury concerning larceny in the third degree as to the element of value diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof, thereby violating his due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>rights. The defendant concedes that this claim was not preserved at trial. He seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). In <em>Golding, </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of error if all of the following conditions are met: \u201c(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40. \u201cAlthough we generally do not consider a claim regarding the giving of an improper instruction or the failure to give a proper instruction unless the claim is properly preserved at trial . . . [t]his court has consistently held that a claim that the judge improperly instructed the jury on an element of an offense is appealable even if not raised at trial.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 308, 630 A.2d 593 (1993). Because this defendant\u2019s claim concerns the value of property acquired by the defendant, an essential element of the crime of larceny in the third degree, he has satisfied the second prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third criterion of <em>Golding </em>because the alleged constitutional violation does not clearly exist. The defendant argues that the jury instruction required the state to prove only that the value of the goods taken from the Levines exceeded $1000 instead of requiring the state to prove that the value of the goods taken by the defendant exceeded $1000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state\u2019s contention is that the information, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>which provided a clear and accurate recitation of the offense of larceny in the third degree, was incorporated into the jury instruction, and, therefore, there was no reasonable possibility that the challenged portion of the charge diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">\u201cIn reviewing a constitutionally based challenge to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, we must examine the charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the challenged instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Snook, </em>210 Conn. 244, 275-76, 555 A.2d 390, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 924, 109 S. Ct. 3258, 106 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>209 Conn. 332, 338, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ober, </em>24 Conn. App. 347, 358, 588 A.2d 1080, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 909, 593 A.2d 134, cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 319, 116 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991). \u201cThe charge is not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>23 Conn. App. 160, 164, 580 A.2d 520 (1990), cert. denied, 216 Conn. 831, 583 A.2d 130, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 981, 111 S. Ct. 1635, 113 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1991).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>26 Conn. App. 259, 269, 600 A.2d 1364 (1991), cert. denied, 221 Conn. 911, 602 A.2d 10 (1992). An error in the charge requires reversal only if, in the context of the whole instruction, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>209 Conn. 322, 338, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The jury was adequately instructed on the crime of larceny in the third degree and there is no reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>possibility that the jury was misled by the charge. Our review of the charge in its entirety indicates that the trial court, which did make a misstatement as to value,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did in fact incorporate the information into the jury charge. Prior to delivering the challenged instruction, the trial court read the information to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court also charged the jury on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-124 (a) (2), larceny in the third degree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 132, 151, 531 A.2d 125 (1987) (jury instruction not misleading where court read information and relevant part of statute before charge was given). The claim of error the defendant is asserting is an attempt to isolate a small portion of the charge. <em>See State v. Giannotti, </em>7 Conn. App. 701, 707, 510 A.2d 451, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 804, 513 A.2d 700 (1986). Upon review of the entire charge, it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict. Therefore, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that a constitutional violation clearly exists as required by <em>Golding </em>for unpreserved claims, and we will not review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s consideration at his posttrial sentencing of the defendant\u2019s insis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>tence of innocence and his refusal to assume responsibility violated his constitutional rights to due process, a fair trial, his right against self-incrimination, and his statutory right to appeal. He asserts that the trial court penalized him at sentencing because he continued to maintain his innocence. This claim was also unpreserved and the defendant seeks review under <em>Golding </em>and <em>Evans. </em>We conclude that the defendant has not satisfied the third prong of <em>Golding </em>in that he has not established the existence of a clear constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">\u201c \u2018A sentencing judge has very broad discretion in imposing any sentence within the statutory limits ....\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Huey </em>199 Conn. 121, 126, 505 A.2d 1242 (1986). In exercising that discretion, a judge may \u201cconsider a wide variety of information\u201d sufficiently reliable without offending the principles of due process. Id., 127.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Huey, </em>as in the present case, the defendant did not assert his privilege against self-incrimination, but instead, with legal representation, voluntarily responded to the court\u2019s offer to address the court. The <em>Huey </em>court held that the privilege against self-incrimination, under such circumstances, is not self-executing and a defendant wanting to assert his fifth amendment right must assert it in a timely fashion. Id., 129. No attempt was made by the sentencing judge to force the defendant to admit guilt; he was merely given the opportunity to present his version of the incident. This is a perfectly acceptable practice in sentence hearings and the judge has the discretion to believe the defendant\u2019s version or not. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Our Supreme Court, in Huey, held that the trial court\u2019s consideration of a defendant\u2019s denial of guilt at a sentence hearing was an acceptable factor for a sentencing judge to consider when formulating a just sentence because it is indicative of a defendant\u2019s rehabilitative potential. Id.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court\u2019s position in <em>Huey </em>is consistent with the decisions of other jurisdictions that have considered identical claims of error. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>589 F.2d 1117 (1st Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 958, 99 S. Ct. 1499, 59 L. Ed. 2d 771 (1979), the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the sentencing court\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s failure to recant is acceptable in determining an individual\u2019s potential for rehabilitation. Id., 1138. The <em>Miller </em>court differentiated this practice from the unacceptable practice of punishing a defendant for maintaining his innocence. Id. Likewise, several other jurisdictions, both federal and state, recognize that a continued protestation of innocence and lack of remorse indicate to the sentencing judge the individual\u2019s prospect for rehabilitation. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>903 F.2d 1084, 1090-91 (7th Cir. 1990); <em>People </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>113 Ill. 2d 516, 531-32, 499 N.E.2d 422 (1986); <em>People </em>v. <em>Wesley, </em>428 Mich. 708, 714-15, 411 N.W.2d 159, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 967, 108 S. Ct. 459, 98 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In the present case, the sentencing judge properly-related the defendant\u2019s refusal to admit responsibility and claims of innocence to the likelihood of his rehabilitation, rather than imposing a harsher punishment for his recalcitrant nature. Given the broad discretionary powers of sentencing judges, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Huey, </em>and similar rulings in other jurisdictions, we conclude that the defendant has not satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>He cannot prevail on this unpreserved claim because it is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of testimony on cross-examination violated his constitutional rights to confrontation and to present a defense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The trial court did not allow the defendant to elicit testimony from Levine on cross-examination as to whether Levine suffered from drug addiction or whether he and his wife were experiencing financial difficulties. The defendant contends that such testimony would have demonstrated the victims\u2019 motive for reporting a false theft claim in order to collect insurance money. The defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">It is undisputed that the defendant has a right to confront and to cross-examine witnesses against him for the purpose of exposing prejudice, bias or motive. U.S. Const., amends. VI, XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; <em>State </em>v. <em>James L., </em>26 Conn. App. 81, 83, 598 A.2d 663 (1991). Neither the state nor the federal constitution, however, \u201crequires that the defendant be permitted to present every piece of evidence he wishes.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James L., </em>supra. \u201cIf the proffered evidence is not relevant, the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation is not affected and the evidence should be excluded.\u201d Id., citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 376, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988). In determining the scope of cross-examination, the trial court is granted broad discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>227 Conn. 417, 431, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>During cross-examination of Levine, the defendant posed questions to the state\u2019s witness and the state objected to each question.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court sustained each objection, and the proffered testimony was excluded. The defendant took exceptions, but the defendant failed to present an offer of proof as to Levine\u2019s alleged motive to fabricate a theft claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In order to evaluate any claim of error, this court must be furnished with \u201can adequate record on which to review the rulings of the trial court . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James L., </em>supra, 86. It is the appellant\u2019s burden to create an adequate appellate record to support his claim. Id., 84. The defendant has failed to meet this burden. \u201cIf he wanted to provide this court with an adequate appellate record, he should have presented an offer of proof. An offer of proof, properly presented, serves three purposes. First, it should inform the court of the legal theory under which the offered evidence is admissible. Second, it should inform the trial judge of the specific nature of the offered evidence so the court can judge its admissibility. Third, it thereby creates a record adequate for appellate review.\u201d (Inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>nal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 84-85. The defendant did not make an offer of proof corroborating his theory that the Levines\u2019 ulterior motive in claiming theft was to commit insurance fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">\u201c \u2018The significant gap in the record . . . limits our review and presents obstacles to reviewing the defendant\u2019s claim of error on this appeal. ... In the absence of an appropriate offer of proof, this court cannot speculate as to what line of questioning defense counsel intended to follow. A claim on appeal cannot be based on an assumption that the trial court acted improperly. . . . Without an adequate record on which to review the rulings of the trial court, this court must assume that the trial court acted properly. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 85-86. Thus, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation and to present a defense were not abrogated.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury regarding its duty violated his constitutional rights because it was unfairly slanted in favor of conviction. This claim is based on the following language: \u201cIf the Court has expressed or intimated any opinion as to the facts, you are not bound by that opinion. What the verdict shall be is your sole and exclusive duty and responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">\u201cThe defendant justly relies upon you to carefully consider his claims, to carefully consider all of the evidence and find him not guilty if the facts and the law require such a verdict. He rightfully expects fair and just treatment at your hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">\u201cThe state of Connecticut and its people, on the other hand, look to you as sworn officers of the court to deal fairly, firmly, honestly and justly as strong minded persons with the interests of the state in your hands as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>an arm of this court to aid in upholding the law of the land and to render a verdict of guilty if the facts and the law require such a verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The defendant argues that the charge given implied that if the jurors \u201cas sworn officers of the court\u201d with duties of \u201cstrong minded persons\u201d vote to acquit, they would be evading their responsibilities. He claims that that implication violates his rights to due process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This claim was not preserved at trial; therefore, the defendant seeks review under the <em>Golding </em>doctrine and, alternatively, the plain error rule.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction did not constitute a violation of constitutional dimension or plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 630 A.2d 990 (1993), addressed the defendants\u2019 unpreserved claim that the trial court\u2019s charge was unfairly slanted toward conviction with virtually identical instructions as those complained of in this case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The <em>Walton </em>court made clear \u201cthat jurors are no less \u2018officers of the court\u2019 and act no less as an \u2018arm of the court\u2019 if they vote to acquit rather than to convict\u201d; id., 63; the court expressed the preference that a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>court omit such language or be as laudatory toward acquittal as toward conviction. The court concluded that the defendant\u2019s claim failed to meet the second requirement of <em>Golding, </em>i.e., that \u201cthe claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239. Under the circumstances of the <em>Walton </em>case, the court concluded that the defendants had clothed a nonconstitutional claim in constitutional garb. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 64.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The same claims and arguments presented in this case were made and resolved in <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim does not rise to the level of constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim does not constitute plain error. Plain error review \u201cis reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Budlong </em>v. <em>Nadeau, </em>30 Conn. App. 61, 66, 619 A.2d 4 (1993). Our review indicates that the instructions were appropriately evenhanded. The trial court informed the jurors of their duties as fact finders, a job not permitting them \u201cto resort to guesswork, conjecture or suspicion.\u201d The charge instructed the jury \u201cto carefully consider all of the evidence and find [the defendant] not guilty if the facts and the law require such a verdict.\u201d We are not persuaded that the challenged language comprises an error so apparent as to affect the fairness and integrity of the proceedings. We will not review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-124 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of larceny in the third degree when he commits a larceny as defined in section 53a-119 and . . .
