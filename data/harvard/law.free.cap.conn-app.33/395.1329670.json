The plaintiff asserts on appeal that the trial court improperly (1) ignored the parties\u2019 stipulated modification of the wage execution and (2) vacated the execution on a motion to modify. We agree with the plaintiff and reverse the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">On March 26,1991, the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $4386.07. In accordance with a stipulation of the parties, the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $130 monthly. The defendant made payments through November, 1991, skipped the December payment, made the January, 1992 payment and a partial payment the following April. She made no subsequent payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">In August, 1992, the plaintiff obtained a wage execution and served the defendant\u2019s employer, who established that $151.95 biweekly or $79.98 weekly would be withheld from the defendant\u2019s pay pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-361a. The defendant moved to modify the wage execution to $30 per week. The trial court scheduled a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for September 21, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Prior to the hearing, the parties signed a stipulation modifying the execution to $30 per week and submitted it to the court. Through a clerical error, however, the court inadvertently recorded the stipulation as modifying the order to $35 per week. At the hearing on her motion to modify, held to correct the order entered in error, the defendant ignored the parties\u2019 stipulation and asked the court to vacate the execution entirely. After hearing argument by the plaintiff and the defendant, but without taking any evidence, the court vacated the execution and ordered the defendant to pay directly to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel $30 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court failed to satisfy the statute authorizing modification of wage executions. General Statutes \u00a7 52-361a (h), entitled \u201cModification,\u201d provides: \u201cEither party may apply at any time to the court which issued the wage execution for a modification of the execution. After notice and hearing or pursuant to a stipulation, the court may make such modification of the execution as is reasonable.\u201d Although the court had before it the parties\u2019 stipulation, the court did not modify the execution \u201cpur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>suant to [the] stipulation.\u201d Although stipulations are not binding, they ordinarily should be adopted by the court. <em>Central Connecticut Teachers Federal Credit Union </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>27 Conn. App. 435, 438, 606 A.2d 729 (1992). Where stipulations are not adopted, the court should provide the parties an opportunity to present evidence, and state for the record the reason for its disapproval of the stipulation. Id. Neither procedure was followed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The record also reveals that the court heard argument but did not take evidence or sworn testimony. The court had before it a motion to modify, the granting of which, under \u00a7 52-361a (h), was a discretionary act to be based on reasonableness. This requires findings based on evidence. See <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>22 Conn. App. 260, 263-64, 576 A.2d 1313, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 813, 580 A.2d 58 (1990). Since no evidence was presented and the stipulation was not accepted, the trial court failed to comply with \u00a7 52-36la (h). A new hearing is required. An issue that may arise on rehearing is whether the power to modify a wage execution includes the power to vacate the execution. We hold that the trial court cannot vacate a wage execution on a motion to modify. The statutory scheme of postjudgment remedies set forth in chapter 906 of the General Statutes balances the equities between judgment creditors and judgment debtors. Thus, although the issuance of a wage execution is mandatory; General Statutes \u00a7 52-361a (b); executions are limited in number and amount.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 52-361a (f). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>This equitable balance ensures satisfaction of the judgment while permitting the debtor to use residual earnings \u201c \u2018for the support of himself and his family or for any other proper purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sienkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sienkiewicz, </em>178 Conn. 675, 679, 425 A.2d 116 (1979), quoting <em>General Tires, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Aircraft Corp., </em>143 Conn. 191, 196, 120 A.2d 426 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Under chapter 906, when a judgment is rendered against a natural person, either the judgment creditor or the judgment debtor may move for an order of instalment payments. General Statutes \u00a7 52-356d (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a hearing and in consideration of the judgment debtor\u2019s financial circumstances, the court may order instalment payments reasonably calculated to satisfy the judgment. General Statutes \u00a7 52-356d (a). If the judgment debtor fails to comply with the ordered instalment payments, the judgment creditor may apply for a wage execution. General Statutes \u00a7 52-361a (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On application by a judgment creditor, issuance of a wage execution is mandatory. General Statutes \u00a7 52-361a (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the judgment debtor fails to claim an exemption during an automatic twenty day stay, the execution goes into effect. General Statutes \u00a7 52-361a (d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Only one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>execution can be satisfied at any one time; priority of executions is determined by the order of their presentation to the employer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 52-361a (f). Finally, either party may ask the court to modify the execution. General Statutes \u00a7 52-361a (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Modification has been defined as \u201c[a] change; an alteration or amendment which introduces new elements into the details or cancels some of them, but leaves the general purpose and effect of the subject-matter intact.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) p. 1004. Conversely, to vacate is to \u201cannul; to set aside; to cancel or rescind. . . .\u201d Id. The statutory scheme of post judgment remedies envisions modification based on the judgment debtor\u2019s financial circumstances. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-36la (h) (permitting reasonable modification). Nothing in the statutes, however, permits canceling or rescinding a wage execution. Modification under the statute clearly means to increase or decrease in light of the judgment debtor\u2019s financial circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Moreover, permitting a trial court to vacate an execution on a motion to modify would inequitably disturb the priority of wage executions. Because only one execution may be satisfied at a time, and because priority is determined by presentation to the employer, a judgment debtor could have a wage execution vacated in response to a motion to modify, thereby sending the judgment creditor to the end of the line. It would be unfair for a judgment creditor to have its wage execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>tion vacated and then have wage executions of other judgment creditors take priority over its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Finally, the power to vacate a wage execution in response to a motion to modify would be the discretionary power to cancel the issuance of an execution. Issuing a wage execution, however, is not discretionary, it is mandatory. General Statutes \u00a7 52-361a (b). Including the power to vacate within the power to modify would defeat the mandatory nature of \u00a7 52-361a (b). Therefore, we hold that the power to modify pursuant to \u00a7 52-36la (h) does not include the power to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The order of the trial court is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-5\"> The amount subject to levy is limited to the lesser of 25 percent of disposable earnings or the excess of forty times the federal minimum hourly wage; only one execution can be satisfied at a time.
