Chapman, appeals from the judgment of conviction of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (l),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> risk of injury to a child in vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>lation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (1) (A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) denied his motion for change of venue, (2) refused to question the jurors about possible exposure to trial publicity, and (3) altered his sentence after execution. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The defendant, a resident of Ledyard, was accused of sexually assaulting a twelve year old girl on numerous occasions in 1987. He was tried before a jury in July, 1992. At the time of trial, the defendant was free on bond pending his appeal of an earlier unrelated rape conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant requested a transfer of the prosecution<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> claiming that pretrial publicity about his prior rape conviction made a fair trial impossible. The trial court denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">During the trial, two local newspapers published a total of eight articles about the proceedings. The defendant moved for mistrial and repeatedly sought to have the court ask the jurors about possible exposure to the publicity. The court asked the jurors whether they had seen the news coverage. None had. The motion for mistrial and all subsequent requests to poll the jury were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The defendant was convicted on all charges and sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, execution suspended after sixteen years. After a lengthy appeal bond hearing, the court stated that the sentence imposed was to be served consecutive to any prior sentence. This appeal resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for change of venue. He claims that publicity about the trial and his previous conviction deprived him of his right to a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">In requesting a change of venue, the movant must demonstrate that a fair and impartial trial is not otherwise possible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>211 Conn. 215, 224, 558 A.2d 669 (1989). A transfer is necessary if, in the discretion of the trial court, the location of the pending case precludes a fair and impartial trial. Practice Book \u00a7 835;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>supra, 224-25. On appeal, the \u201c \u2018grave constitutional implications attending\u2019 \u201d motions for transfer require that appellate tribunals independently evaluate the circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>209 Conn. 564, 568, 552 A.2d 805 (1989), quoting <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 333, 362-63, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600 (1966). Our review of the record convinces us that publicity did not deprive the defendant of a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">For a conviction to be reversed on the ground of prejudicial publicity, the defendant must prove actual juror prejudice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>supra, 225. Actual prejudice, however, need not be shown \u201cin extreme cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>cumstances where there has been inherently prejudicial publicity such as to make the possibility of prejudice highly likely or almost unavoidable. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 686, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979). In the present case, the defendant has failed to show either \u201cinherently prejudicial\u201d publicity or actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">No mathematical formula defines \u201cinherently prejudicial\u201d publicity. Courts have presumed prejudice and overturned convictions where the attendant publicity created a \u201ccircus atmosphere.\u201d See <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>supra, 356-57 (live television broadcast of three day, pretrial examination of defendant, unassisted by counsel); <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 550-51, 85 S. Ct. 1628, 14 L. Ed. 2d 543 (1966) (intrusive television presence in courtroom); <em>Rideau </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723, 724, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1963) (repeated television broadcast of defendant\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d). The defendant has failed to persuade us, however, \u201cthat the news coverage created a \u2018trial atmosphere . . . utterly corrupted by press coverage.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>supra, 570, quoting <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 798, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The publicity regarding this case was not extensive. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>supra. The defendant focuses on eight articles in two local newspapers that referred to the defendant\u2019s earlier conviction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He maintains that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>his prior conviction could not have been admitted at trial without severe limitations on its use, and therefore, its publication was inherently prejudicial. The stories, however, were neither inflammatory nor inaccurate. Id. They were \u201cstraight news stories rather than invidious articles [that] would tend to arouse ill will and vindictiveness.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>supra, 227; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>supra, 570. The reports were free from sensationalism, accurate and largely factual. Therefore, these facts fail to rise to the level of inherent prejudice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>supra, 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The defendant has also failed to demonstrate actual jury prejudice. In evaluating this claim, \u201cwe examine the record to determine whether the method of jury selection or the characteristics of the jurors selected deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial.\u201d Id., 225-26. Our review reveals no such deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The court excused all venirepersons who remembered any of the pretrial publicity. None of the selected jurors recalled that the defendant or his farm had been in the news. The jury was impanelled in two days and the defendant used only seven of his nine peremptory challenges. The record contains no evidence of juror prejudice. Further, the defendant presents no evidence that the jury even saw, let alone was tainted by, midtrial publicity. We conclude, therefore, that there was no actual juror prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The defendant has failed to demonstrate inherently prejudicial publicity or actual jury prejudice. Thus, the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for change of venue was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly refused to question the jurors during the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>of the trial about possible exposure to trial publicity. Our review of the record convinces us that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">During the trial, the defendant raised the issue of possible juror prejudice from newspaper articles. The court, on one occasion, polled the jury about exposure to publicity. None of the jurors reported any exposure. The defendant\u2019s subsequent requests to poll the jury, after additional publicity, were denied. The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s denial was an abuse of discretion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u201c[A] defendant's right to a jury trial guarantees him that it will be conducted fairly by a panel of impartial jurors; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>197 Conn. 60, 64, 495 A.2d 1050 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Migliaro, </em>28 Conn. App. 388, 395, 611 A.2d 422 (1992); and that the jury will decide the case solely on the basis of the evidence and arguments presented before it ... . <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>210 Conn. 315, 325, 554 A.2d 1080 (1989). <em>Where it appears </em>during the course of a trial that the jury panel may have been exposed to prejudicial extrinsic evidence, the trial court must conduct . . . an investigation to determine whether jury misconduct occurred. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Migliaro, </em>supra, 396. There is no magic formula that the trial court must follow in conducting this inquiry. Rather, it must use <em>whatever inquisitorial tools are necessary and appropriate </em>to determine whether there was a reasonable possibility of prejudice.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>31 Conn. App. 178, 194, 623 A.2d 1052, cert. granted on other grounds, 226 Conn. 912, 628 A.2d 985 (1993). The trial judge is best situated and uniquely qualified to appraise possible juror misconduct. Id., 195. Thus, the trial court\u2019s broad discretion will be afforded great weight. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>When, after the first day of testimony, the defendant moved for a mistrial due to possible juror exposure, the court polled the jury. No juror reported having been exposed to the publicity. In fact, the judge remarked that the jurors seemed surprised to have been asked. Such an inquiry was an entirely appropriate form of investigation. See id., 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">After additional newspaper coverage, the defendant requested further inquiry of the jurors. These requests were denied. The judge stated his satisfaction that the jurors were not being exposed. Where it does not appear that the jury is being exposed, the court need not conduct any investigation. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In the present case, the trial court properly exercised its discretion. Before the trial began, the court instructed the jury to avoid the local newspapers. After questioning the jury about possible exposure, and at the end of each day during the trial, the court admonished the jurors to avoid the local newspapers. The defendant has presented no evidence of juror misconduct. Absent evidence to the contrary, jurors are presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions. Id., 196. We will not, on appeal, speculate on what jurors might have seen and its possible effects. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion by repeatedly refusing to question the jury about possible exposure to publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly increased his sentence after execution by making it consecutive to the sentence imposed after his first conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The jury convicted the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>on July 17, 1992; he was sentenced on August 14. Immediately after announcing the sentence, the trial court set an appeal bond. A hearing on the defendant\u2019s request to post a real estate bond followed. After denying the defendant\u2019s request to post a real estate bond, the court announced that the defendant\u2019s sentence would run consecutive, not concurrent, to his prior sentence. The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s conduct violated his state and federal constitutional rights against double jeopardy and to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u201cOrdinarily a sentence may not be modified if any act is done in execution of it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 123, 445 A.2d 304 (1982). Once commenced, a trial court cannot modify a valid sentence unless expressly authorized by statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Luzietti, </em>32 Conn. App. 1, 4, 628 A.2d 8, cert. granted, 227 Conn. 919, 632 A.2d 697 (1993). A sentence commences when custody is transferred from the court to the custodian of the penal institution. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (a) (sentence commences \u201cwhen the prisoner is received in the custody or institution to which he was sentenced\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>208 Conn. 420, 424-25, 545 A.2d 559 (1988). The defendant passes into the jurisdiction of the commissioner of correction when a judgment of mittimus is issued. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>supra, 425-26; see also <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 129, 440 A.2d 848 (1981) (sentence commences only upon incarceration); <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>14 Conn. App. 119, 133, 539 A.2d 1022 (1988) (sentence had not commenced because mittimus had not yet been drafted); <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>8 Conn. App. 566, 575, 513 A.2d 1285, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 813, 517 A.2d 630 (1986) (date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>of issuance of mittimus indicates commencement of sentence). At this point, the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the prisoner terminates. <em>State </em>v. <em>Luzietti, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The record clearly reveals that the defendant\u2019s sentence had not commenced before the trial court\u2019s alteration. Immediately after announcing sentence, the trial court set an appeal bond and held a hearing on the defendant\u2019s request for a real estate bond. At the conclusion of the hearing, the defendant posted bond and left. No act occurred in execution of the sentence. The defendant was not transferred to the custody of the penal institution to which he was sentenced. No mittimus was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Because the defendant never commenced his sentence, the court never lost jurisdiction over him. Thus, the trial court had the authority to clarify the sentence after the bond hearing without violating the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person is (1) under sixteen years of age . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who wilfully or unlawfully . . . does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, shall be fined ... or imprisoned . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the fourth degree when: (1) Such person intentionally subjects another person to sexual contact who is (A) under fifteen years of age . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\"> His conviction was reversed on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>28 Conn.

Two of the articles were nothing more than news accounts of the defendant\u2019s buying a stable, and a fire at the property. The remaining articles dealt solely with the first trial and conviction, and were published months before the jury was selected for this trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 477, 522 A.2d 249 (1987) (noting that significant delay between publicity and trial lessens likelihood of prejudice).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b238-10\"> On conviction by a jury of sexual assault in the first degree, the defendant was sentenced to a term of fourteen years, execution suspended after seven years. His conviction was reversed on appeal to this court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chap</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>man, </em>28 Conn.

Our Supreme Court granted the state\u2019s motion to reconsider its ruling en banc on October 5, 1993. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 617 n. If this court\u2019s judgment is upheld, this issue is moot. Since the case is being reconsidered, however, we will address the issue as briefed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
