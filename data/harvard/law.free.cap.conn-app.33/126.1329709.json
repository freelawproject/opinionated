J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQb\">The defendant appeals from the judgment following his conviction by a jury of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (1). His sole claim is that, contrary to the mandate of General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b), the trial court failed to instruct the jury that no adverse inference could be drawn against him because of his failure to testify at trial. We agree that the omission of that instruction was improper, reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found certain relevant facts. On April 1,1992, at approximately 9 p.m., two Clinton police officers were dispatched to the Holiday Motel in Clinton, where Vagshi Keshwala, the motel manager, complained that he had been assaulted by the defendant. Keshwala told the officers that he had gone to collect rent from the defendant, a tenant of the motel, when the defendant pulled Keshwala into his room and punched him in the face. Both officers reported that Keshwala\u2019s eyeglasses were broken and his face was swollen and discolored. He did not request medical attention, however. When confronted by the two officers, the defendant denied striking Keshwala.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In addition to describing the events of April 1,1992, Keshwala testified that he suffered from a preexisting medical condition that caused pain and discomfort in his face, but he did not mention swelling and discoloration as symptoms. The defendant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court erroneously failed to give a \u201cno adverse inference\u201d instruction to the jury in accordance with the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b), and that as a consequence he should be awarded a new trial. Section 54-84 (b) mandates: \u201cUnless the accused requests otherwise, the court shall instruct the jury that they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d It is undisputed that no such language was included in the court\u2019s charge to the jury, and that it was improper for the court not to give that instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 583-84, 500 A.2d 539 (1985). It is also undisputed that the defendant made no objection to the omission of the \u201cno adverse inference\u201d instruction at trial. He attempts to raise this issue for the first time on appeal under either the \u201cplain error\u201d doctrine or the four-pronged test for constitutional error enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Thurman, </em>10 Conn. App. 302, 523 A.2d 891, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 805, 528 A.2d 1152 (1987), we were faced with a defendant who, like the defendant in this case, did not testify at trial and neither requested a \u201cno adverse inference\u201d instruction pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b) nor objected to the court\u2019s failure to provide one. The defendant in <em>Thurman </em>claimed on appeal that such failure constituted a violation of his rights to due process and against self-incrimination under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, and a violation of his rights under \u00a7 54-84 (b). We found his constitutional claim to be reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70-71, 327 A.2d 576 (1973),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and his statutory claim to be reviewable under the plain error doctrine. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thurman, </em>supra, 306; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>206 Conn. 621, 625, 539 A.2d 114 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, 582; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>194 Conn. 594, 595-96, 483 A.2d 1087 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>182 Conn. 330, 331, 438 A.2d 93 (1980); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>19 Conn. App. 48, 562 A.2d 35, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 804, 567 A.2d 834 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">It is clear from existing case law that the defendant\u2019s request for plain error review must be granted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>supra, 55; <em>State </em>v. <em>Thurman, </em>supra, 308-10. \u201c[Njoncompliance with \u00a7 54-84 (b) is plain error .... We have regularly characterized as error any but the most minor departure from the language that \u00a7 54-84 (b) requires.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, 582-83. Cases holding the failure to instruct the jury properly under \u00a7 54-84 (b) to be plain error include <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>199 Conn. 322, 324, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>507 A.2d 457 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, 582; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>supra, 595; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>17 Conn. App. 490, 493-94, 554 A.2d 297 (1989); and <em>State </em>v. <em>Thurman, </em>supra, 309. We hold that the trial court\u2019s failure to give the statutorily required instruction was plain error in this case as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We next consider the state\u2019s argument that the failure of the trial court to instruct the jury properly should be considered harmless error in light of what the state claims to be overwhelming evidence against the defendant. A harmless error analysis has been undertaken in cases in which a \u201cno adverse inference\u201d instruction that deviated from the language of the statute was given. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carrione, </em>188 Conn. 681, 453 A.2d 1137 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In cases where the trial court totally omitted the \u201cno adverse inference\u201d instruction, however, the propriety of a harmless error analysis has been questioned, although the issue has not been expressly decided. \u201cIt would be entirely reasonable to conclude that the principle of harmless error may be inconsistent with the unconditional language of the statute that the legislature has enacted for the protection of the right not to testify.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, 585; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cohane, </em>193 Conn. 474, 484, 479 A.2d 763, cert. denied, 496 U.S. 990, 105 S. Ct. 397, 83 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Thurman, </em>supra, 310-13, this court observed that <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>182 Conn. 330, 438 A.2d 93 (1980), <em>and. State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>182 Conn. 580, 438 A.2d 778 (1980), had determined that the complete omission of a \u201cno adverse inference\u201d instruction was reversible error without consideration of a harmless error analysis. We then noted that <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, 585-86, considered the applicability of harmless error analysis in such a case, but expressly left the question of its propriety open. We also declined to rule on that question, determining that even if a harmless error analysis were undertaken, the state had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s noncompliance with \u00a7 54-84 (b) was harmless. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thurman, </em>supra, 313-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We now rule on the question and hold that the total omission of the \u201cno adverse inference\u201d instruction is plain error that is not subject to a harmless error analysis. The unconditional language of the statute is a legislative mandate and the failure to use that language is a pivotal aspect of the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. The statutory language is based on a constitutional right, and its omission can never be harmless. See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 577, 106 S. Ct. 3101, 92 L. Ed. 2d 460 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>(1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>30 Conn. App. 68, 76-78, 618 A.2d 1372, cert. granted on other grounds, 225 Conn. 910, 621 A.2d 290 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>12 Conn. App. 408, 414-15, 530 A.2d 1110 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-5\"> <em>State v. Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), was the precursor to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). <em>State </em>v. <em>Thurman, </em>10 Conn. App. 302, 523 A.2d 891 (1987), was decided prior to the release of the <em>Golding </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> The United States Supreme Court has yet to pass on the question of whether, after a request by a defendant, a trial judge\u2019s refusal to give a \u201cno adverse influence\u201d instruction in violation of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 305, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1981), can ever be harmless error. <em>James </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>466 U.S. 341, 351-52, 104 S. Ct. 1830, 80 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1984); see also <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967) (some constitutional violations are subject to harmless error analysis). In <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>934 F.2d 856, 860 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 388, 116 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1991), the Seventh Circuit decided in a six to five decision that in light of overwhelming evidence against the defendant, the refusal of the state trial judge to provide a requested \u201cno adverse influence\u201d instruction was harmless error. See also <em>Finney </em>v. <em>Rothgerber, </em>751 F.2d 858, 863 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1020, 105 S. Ct. 2048, 85 L. Ed. 2d 310 (1985); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>741 F.2d 753, 755 (5th Cir. 1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Eiland, </em>741 F.2d 738, 743 (5th Cir. 1984). These cases, however, do not deal with whether the omission in a jury charge of a statutorily mandated \u201cno adverse inference\u201d instruction is subject to a harmless error analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
