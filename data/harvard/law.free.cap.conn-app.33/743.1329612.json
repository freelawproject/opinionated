Because we agree with the defendant\u2019s second claim, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On June 20, 1991, the victim, his mother, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>defendant, Barbara Tirado and her daughter went to a lake. The victim was eight years old at the time. After staying at the lake, they drove to the home of the defendant\u2019s mother, then to the home of his sister and then to Tirado\u2019s home located on Maple Street in Meriden. The victim\u2019s father later joined the group and the adults all began drinking. The victim fell asleep on the couch in Tirado\u2019s home wearing his pants, shirt and underpants. The victim\u2019s father was asleep on a chair near the couch and the victim\u2019s mother was asleep in another room. The victim awoke to find the defendant placing his hands between the victim\u2019s legs on the outside of the victim\u2019s pants. The defendant was attempting to pull down the victim\u2019s pants. The defendant was behind the victim on the couch and the victim was facing away from the defendant. The defendant told him to be quiet. The victim took off his pants while the defendant continued to touch the outside of the underpants between the legs and then the defendant cut the victim\u2019s underpants. The victim was scared and ran to his mother\u2019s room and told her what had just occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The victim\u2019s mother ran into the living room to wake the victim\u2019s father. In the meantime, the defendant, who was wearing only a tee shirt, ran down the stairs and out the backdoor. Tirado caught the defendant outside and asked him \u201cwhy he did it\u201d and the defendant responded that he was sorry and the drugs made him do it. Tirado brought the defendant back upstairs. The victim\u2019s father and the defendant then fought while the victim\u2019s mother took off the victim\u2019s underpants and dressed him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The victim then went downstairs with his parents and got into a van. The victim\u2019s father began to drive on Main Street in Meriden to the police station when he observed the defendant driving a truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>with Tirado as a passenger on Maple Street. The victim\u2019s father blocked the defendant\u2019s vehicle and the two vehicles collided. The victim and his mother exited the van and proceeded to the side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Officers Michael Merrigan, Mark Masse and Grant Treiber of the Meriden police department arrived at the scene in uniform shortly thereafter. Merrigan approached the father and was informed by him about the events that occurred at Tirado\u2019s home. Masse and Treiber approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle and asked him to exit it. As they attempted to open the door of the defendant\u2019s vehicle and take the keys, the defendant hit Treiber in the face and drove the vehicle in reverse. The officers at that point were hanging onto the doors of the vehicle. The truck veered to the right and almost hit a building on Maple Street. Treiber fell off the side of the truck and Masse hit a door attached to the building with sufficient force to break a hole in the door. Masse sustained lacerations to his right hand, right forearm, shoulder and back. Treiber sustained bruises and injured his right hand. Treiber then placed the defendant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">At the crime scene, Robert Pocobello, a Meriden police detective, seized a pair of scissors and underpants. He discovered the scissors on a coffee table near the couch and the underpants on the couch. Pocobello processed the scissors for fingerprints. The processing revealed the presence of fingerprints that were not clear enough to be identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Ted Standish, another Meriden police detective, employed by the department\u2019s sexual assault unit, interviewed the victim on June 21, 1991. The victim stated that after arriving at Tirado\u2019s home, she told him to sleep on the couch, where the defendant was already sleeping. The victim further told Standish that he awoke when the defendant placed his hands on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>victim\u2019s \u201cdinky\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the defendant pulled at the victim\u2019s pants. The victim also told Standish that the defendant told the victim to take off his pants and keep quiet. The victim then told Standish that the defendant tried to make him take off his underpants and when he refused, the defendant cut the underpants with scissors.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The defendant disputed the facts. He testified on his own behalf that he, the victim, Tirado and the victim\u2019s mother arrived at Tirado\u2019s home after they had spent the day at the lake. The defendant also testified that he left Tirado\u2019s at 11 p.m., just after the victim\u2019s father arrived, returned at around 4:30 or 5 a.m., and found Tirado and the victim\u2019s father drinking and the victim asleep on the couch. The defendant also stated that he fell asleep on the couch, \u201copposite the victim\u201d and awoke to find the victim\u2019s father with his hand in the pocket of the defendant\u2019s pants, which the defendant had on, and thought that the victim\u2019s father was attempting to steal money. The defendant then testified that he tried to get up and that the victim\u2019s father jumped on him and hit him in the face. The defendant then testified that Tirado offered to drive him to the hospital and that he accepted Tirado\u2019s offer. He further testified that as Tirado drove him to the hospital, the victim\u2019s father forced their vehicle to a stop on Maple Street. The defendant then testified that he moved into the driver\u2019s seat, placed the truck in reverse and police officers tried to grab him, causing the truck to move in reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The defendant first asserts that the trial court improperly denied his motions for directed verdict and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>judgment of acquittal on the count of sexual assault in the third degree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant posits that the state failed to present sufficient evidence of the threat of use of force as discussed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hufford, </em>205 Conn. 386, 533 A.2d 866 (1987). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">\u201cThe record discloses that the defendant made a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 884. The trial court denied this motion. The defendant then proceeded to offer evidence on his own behalf. Under the existing rules, when a defendant elects to put on evidence after a denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the state\u2019s evidence, he is deemed to have waived his right to appellate review as to the sufficiency of the evidence at the completion of the state\u2019s case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Booker, 28 </em>Conn. App. 34, 41-42, 611 A.2d 878, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 919, 614 A.2d 826 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kari, </em>26 Conn. App. 286, 291, 600 A.2d 1374 (1991), appeal dismissed, 222 Conn. 539, 608 A.2d 92 (1992).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim with regard to the sufficiency of the evidence at the completion of the state\u2019s case is not reviewable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>supra, 41.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>29 Conn. App. 524, 527-28, 616 A.2d 1143 (1992). The defendant, however, is entitled to a review of the sufficiency of the evidence as presented in the entire case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>supra, 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748A\">*748A</page-number>In <em>Hufford, </em>the defendant did not exert force to effect the sexual contact. \u201cThe complainant had been legally rendered immobile for transport to the hospital and the defendant had only to open her blouse and pants to commit the sexual assault.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hufford, </em>supra, 393. Here, the jury could have reasonably found from the evidence that the victim removed his pants after the defendant physically attempted to remove them forcibly and then the defendant cut the victim\u2019s underwear. \u201cThe force used or threatened to be used in the course of committing sexual assault in the . . . third [degree] is that necessary to compel the victim to engage in sexual intercourse or to submit to sexual contact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 62, 502 A.2d 360 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>30 Conn. App. 281, 289, 620 A.2d 168, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 916, 623 A.2d 1026 (1993). We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient is without merit. We are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury\u2019s returning a verdict of guilty. If the case had been submitted to the jury under proper instructions, the verdict of guilty of sexual assault in the third degree involving the victim would have been proper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra, 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury by failing to relate the issues of law to the facts of the case. The defendant concedes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748B\">*748B</page-number>he failed to object to the jury charge. See Practice Book \u00a7 852.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant nevertheless claims that he is entitled to review under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Certain additional facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this appeal. The defendant was charged with nine counts in the information. They included (1) sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) (A),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which related to the victim, (2) sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) (B), <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which related to the victim, (3) risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which related to the victim, (4) two counts of assault of a police officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (l),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> each of which related to one of the police officers, (5) two counts of criminal attempt to commit assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>to the two police officers, and (6) two counts of reckless endangerment in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-63,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> one of which related to the victim\u2019s father and the other to Tirado. After the close of evidence and after the final arguments of counsel, the trial court instructed the jury as to the law applicable to the charges in this case. The trial court first instructed the jury on the general principles of law applicable to the case, such as reasonable doubt, direct evidence, circumstantial evidence and other areas applicable to all criminal jury instructions. The trial court then instructed the jury as to the specific elements of the crimes charged in the information and on the use of constancy of evidence testimony as that concept related to the sexual assault and risk of injury charges. During deliberations, the jury asked for a playback of some testimony and asked to have charges on three counts reread. The only facts to which the trial court referred during its charge to the jury or in its recharge were that one count of assault of a peace officer and criminal attempt to commit assault in the first degree applied to Masse while the second count of assault of a peace officer and criminal attempt to commit assault in the first degree pertained to Treiber, and that one count of reckless endangerment pertained to the victim\u2019s father while the second count pertained to Tirado.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s instructions were constitutionally deficient because they failed to relate the issues of law to the facts of the case, thereby denying the defendant his right to due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>of law as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and by article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As we have already indicated, this claim was not preserved before the trial court, but the defendant claims that it is, nonetheless, reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">\u201cOur standard of review in cases when the defendant claims that the instructions violate constitutional due process protections is whether the jury instructions were so deficient that it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra, 530; <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>225 Conn. 650, 661, 626 A.2d 287 (1993). We will reverse a conviction only if, in the context of the whole charge, there is a \u201creasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>212 Conn. 387, 408, 563 A.2d 646, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 980, 110 S. Ct. 510, 107 L. Ed. 2d 512 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff </em>supra, 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">We are first called on to consider whether the trial court\u2019s instructions were so deficient as to implicate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial. A jury instruction conforms with constitutional requirements if it provides the jury with a \u201cclear understanding of the elements of the crime[s] charged, and affords them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present.\u201d (Internal quo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>tation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>223 Conn. 595, 602, 613 A.2d 731 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Plude, </em>30 Conn. App. 527, 537, 621 A.2d 1342, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 923, 625 A.2d 824 (1993). \u201cAn instruction that fails to satisfy these requirements . . . violate[s] the defendant\u2019s right to due process of law as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>supra, 603; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra, 530. \u201cThe due process clause protects an accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 157, 460 A.2d 26 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>226 Conn. 20, 28, 627 A.2d 862 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff </em>supra. \u201cIf justice is to be done . . . it is of paramount importance that the court\u2019s instructions be clear, accurate, complete and comprehensible, particularly with respect to the essential elements of the alleged crime[s]. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">\u201c[I]n reviewing jury instructions our task is also to view the charge itself as part of the whole trial. . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff </em>supra, 531. We note that the defendant did not file specific requests to charge with the trial court and no exception was taken to the trial court\u2019s failure to relate factual claims of the parties to the charge with respect to the elements of the crimes charged. Under these circumstances \u201cwe do not engage in a microscopic examination of the charge, dissecting it line by line, nor do we consider the challenged portions of the charge in isolation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff </em>supra. Instead, we examine the charge as a whole to determine whether the charge adequately guided the jury toward a proper resolution of the issues presented to it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 268, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra. While \u201c[j]ury instructions need not be exhaustive, perfect or technically accurate,\u201d they must be correct in law, adapted to the issues presented by the case and sufficient to guide the jury properly in reaching a verdict. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Keith, </em>217 Conn. 12, 17, 584 A.2d 439 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">When a trial court instructs the jury, it \u201chas not only the right but also the duty to comment on the evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>32 Conn. App. 84, 104, 628 A.2d 1318, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 924, 632 A.2d 702 (1993). \u201cA charge cannot be given in the abstract without reference to the evidence sufficient to provide guidance to the jury in arriving at a just result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff </em>supra. It is the function of a jury charge to assist the jury in applying the legal principles set forth by the court to the facts that they may find to have been established by the evidence. Id.; see <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>2 Conn. App. 27, 33, 476 A.2d 621 (1984). The court\u2019s instructions must \u201cgo beyond a bare statement of accurate legal principles to the extent of indicating to the jury the application of those principles to the facts claimed to have been proven.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>178 Conn. 163, 170-71, 422 A.2d 299 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra. The charge must be viewed in the context of the factual issues developed at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 558, 442 A.2d 1327 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra. The trial court does not properly fulfill the role of giving proper jury instructions by simply laying down a series of general principles of law applicable to the case and then leaving it to the jury to apply them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra, 531-32. Rather, it is the trial court\u2019s obligation to inform the jury what the law is as applicable to the facts of the case as claimed to have been proven by the parties. Id., 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>\u201cWhile the degree to which reference to the evidence may be called for lies largely in the discretion of the court . . . reference to the evidence is required sufficient to guide the [jurors] in their application of the stated law to the evidence before them.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mack </em>v. <em>Clinch, </em>166 Conn. 295, 297, 348 A.2d 669 (1974). If the issues presented to the jury are not complicated, the trial court must, at a minimum, refer to the essential facts surrounding each instruction. <em>Amato </em>v. <em>Sawicki, </em>159 Conn. 490, 494, 271 A.2d 80 (1970). Further, the instruction must refer to the defendant\u2019s claims made in his defense. <em>Phoenix Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brenckman, </em>148 Conn. 391, 397, 171 A.2d 194 (1961). If the issues are complicated, the trial court must refer to the details of the evidence presented. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra; <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 34. Because the trial court\u2019s charge was devoid of any reference to the facts of the case, except a passing reference to the names of the victims in four counts, we need not determine whether the issues in the case are complicated. <em>Amato </em>v. <em>Sawicki, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Here, the charge failed to refer to any facts of the case, despite the nine count information involving five victims.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cEven if we were to assume that the court correctly stated the rules of law in the abstract, with no further instructions applying the rules to the particular facts of this case, such a charge could not adequately serve to guide the jury in a determination [of the guilt of the defendant] .... See <em>Vita </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>158 Conn. 75, 78, 255 A.2d 848 (1969). Thus, a complete lack of facts in the jury charge cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>ates a reasonable possibility, as a matter of law, that the jury was misled.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial on those charges of which the defendant was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the third degree when such person (1) compels another person to submit to sexual contact . . .
