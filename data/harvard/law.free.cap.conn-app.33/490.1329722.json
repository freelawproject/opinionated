The plaintiff filed his complaint with the workers\u2019 compensation commission pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (b) (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides a right of appeal to this court from the decision of the commissioner. The issue on appeal is whether the commissioner improperly determined, pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a, that the plaintiff failed to prove a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge. Because we conclude that the plaintiff has failed to present an adequate record for review of this claim, we affirm the decision of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff began work as a driver for the defendant in 1973. The plaintiff alleged that between March, 1985, and September, 1988, he had suffered a total of nine work related injuries. In an effort to settle these claims, the parties entered into a \u201cStipulation for Full and Final Settlement\u201d in January, 1990. This voluntary agreement required approval by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-296.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>A separate \u201cResignation Agreement\u201d tendered by the plaintiff in January, 1990, was not presented to the commissioner to be reviewed with the stipulation. The resignation agreement stated that the plaintiff \u201chereby promises to resign his employment . . . and further promises not to seek re-employment .... These promises are made in consideration of $1.00 . . . and other good and valuable consideration. This agreement is to take effect solely upon the approval of the attached [stipulation] by the Commissioner of the First District of the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation System.\u201d When the commissioner approved the stipulation on March 5, 1990, the resignation agreement became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In January, 1992, the plaintiff filed a complaint with the workers\u2019 compensation commission, alleging that the resignation agreement tendered by the plaintiff violated \u00a7 31-290a, and that the employer improperly failed to present the resignation agreement to the commissioner reviewing the stipulation. The case was presented before a commissioner on August 15, 1992. Prior to testimony, the defendant moved that the complaint be dismissed, but the commissioner reserved judgment. The plaintiff\u2019s case consisted solely of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony. The plaintiff testified both that he willingly resigned and that he did not want to resign. When the plaintiff rested, the commissioner granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, and stated \u201ceven if I believe and draw every inference [the plaintiff] want[s] me to draw ... I can\u2019t hold the employer liable under 290a because [the plaintiff] entered into an agreement that he didn\u2019t want to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>into, and [because the plaintiff] tendered a resignation he didn\u2019t want tendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">At the close of trial, the plaintiff orally requested that the commissioner articulate his findings of fact and conclusions of law. The commissioner denied these requests. Further, the commissioner neither issued any written findings for the basis of his decision, nor, as required by \u00a7 31-290a (b) (2), issued a written copy of his decision to the parties. The plaintiff did not make a written motion for articulation of the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The appellant has the responsibility to provide this court with an adequate record for review. Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>DeMilo </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>189 Conn. 671, 681, 458 A.2d 362 (1983); <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>32 Conn. App. 317, 319, 629 A.2d 1137, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 902, 634 A.2d 295 (1993); <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co., N.A. </em>v. <em>Linsky, </em>32 Conn. App. 13, 15, 627 A.2d 956 (1993); <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>24 Conn. App. 172, 178, 586 A.2d 635, cert. denied, 218 Conn. 904, 588 A.2d 1383 (1991). \u201cThis court recently noted that we cannot render a decision without first having \u2018specific findings of fact to determine the basis of the court\u2019s ruling.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Rios, </em>30 Conn. App. 712, 715, 622 A.2d 618 (1993).\u201d <em>Gelormino </em>v. <em>Blaustein, </em>31 Conn. App. 750, 751, 626 A.2d 1325 (1993). The commissioner failed to present, orally or in writing, the findings of fact that led to his conclusion that the case should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a party can move in writing that a trial court articulate its findings. If a trial court denies a party\u2019s motion for articulation, that party may move that this court review the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>court\u2019s denial of the motion and, if appropriate, require that the trial court articulate its findings. Practice Book \u00a7 4054.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The plaintiff claimed at oral argument that \u00a7 31-290a (b) (2), by providing for a direct appeal from the decision of the commissioner to this court, precluded him from filing a written motion for articulation and, if that motion were denied, from seeking a review of that denial. In this instance, the plaintiff had the choice of filing a complaint with the workers\u2019 compensation commission or bringing an action in the Superior Court. Because these proceedings are comparable, the commissioner acted, in effect, as the trial court in hearing the plaintiff\u2019s claims. For example, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (b) (1), the trial court makes findings of fact and conclusions of law, and, pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a (b) (2), \u201c[t]he workers\u2019 compensation commissioner has the power and the duty to determine the facts, and we will not review facts reasonably found by the commissioner. The commissioner\u2019s conclusions that are drawn from those facts must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, 212 </em>Conn. 441, 448, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989); <em>Aurora </em>v. <em>Miami Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>6 Conn. App. 45, 47, 502 A.2d 952 (1986).\u201d <em>Chiaia </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farm, Inc., </em>24 Conn. App. 362, 364, 588 A.2d 652, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 907, 593 A.2d 133 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Under normal circumstances, this court will not remand a case to correct a deficiency that the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>lant should have remedied. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>188 Conn. 736, 739 n.2, 453 A.2d 1151 (1982); <em>Scherr </em>v. <em>Scherr, </em>183 Conn. 366, 368, 439 A.2d 375 (1981); <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co., N.A. </em>v. <em>Linsky, </em>supra, 15; <em>North Park Mortgage Services, Inc. v. Pinette, </em>27 Conn. App. 628, 632, 608 A.2d 714 (1992). The plaintiff elected to bring his complaint to the workers\u2019 compensation commission rather than to proceed in the Superior Court. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff was not absolved of the requirement of filing a motion for articulation and seeking appropriate review in this court, where such review was necessary to create an adequate record for our review of his claim. \u201cWithout an adequate record on which to review the findings of the trial court, this court must assume that the trial court acted properly. <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>177 Conn. 259, 267, 413 A.2d 854 (1979); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Newell, </em>160 Conn. 269, 277, 278 A.2d 776 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>James L., </em>26 Conn. App. 81, 86, 598 A.2d 663 (1991).\u201d <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co., N.A. </em>v. <em>Linsky, </em>supra, 16. Likewise, because there is no adequate record from which to review the decision of the commissioner, we must assume that the commissioner acted properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (a) provides: \u201cNo employer who is subject to the provisions of this chapter shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, or in any manner discriminate against any employee because the employee has filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or otherwise exercised the rights afforded to him pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b517-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (b) provides the following alternative procedures: \u201cAny employee who is so discharged or discriminated against may either: (1) Bring a civil action in the superior court for the judicial district where the employer has its principal office for the reinstatement of his previous job, payment of back wages and reestablishment of employee benefits to which he would have otherwise been entitled if he had not been discriminated against or discharged and any other damages caused by such discrimination or discharge. The court may also award punitive damages. . . . or (2) file a complaint with the chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission alleging violation of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. Upon receipt of any such complaint, the chairman shall select a commissioner to hear the complaint .... After the hearing, the commissioner shall send each party a written copy of his decision. The commissioner may award the employee the reinstatement of his previous job, payment of back wages and reestablishment of employee benefits to which he otherwise would have been eligible if he had not been discriminated against or discharged. . . .
