The appeal largely rests on fact bound issues. The trial court\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence and the inferences that may reasonably be drawn therefrom. Having applied the appropriate standard of review, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous, that it did not abuse its discretion and that its decision conforms to the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
