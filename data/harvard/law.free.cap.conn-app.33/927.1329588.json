App. 500, 505, 568 A.2d 1037 (1990). \u201cWe will not reverse such a ruling unless the appellant demonstrates that the court has misapplied the law or could not reasonably have reached its conclusions.\u201d <em>Curzi </em>v. <em>Curzi, </em>21 Conn. App. 5, 7, 570 A.2d 1134, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 802, 574 A.2d 217 (1990). Our review of the record indicates that the trial court acted within its broad discretion. Specifically, the record fails to disclose that the factual findings of the court were clearly erroneous in view of the evidence, that the decision was otherwise erroneous in law; Practice Book \u00a7 4061; or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Cromwell Common Associates </em>v. <em>Koziura, </em>21 Conn.
