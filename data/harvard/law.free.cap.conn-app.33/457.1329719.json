The defendant claims that (1) the trial court improperly (a) refused to give a jury instruction as required by <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S.

We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On November 16,1981, the victim and her roommate went to the Agora Ballroom in New Haven. They left the bar around 1:30 a.m. and walked to the victim\u2019s car located in a nearby parking lot. The victim unlocked the car, got into the driver\u2019s seat and unlocked the passenger door. When the roommate got into the front passenger seat, she saw a man with a gun bending down at the driver\u2019s window. She said, \u201cOh my God.\u201d The victim turned and saw the defendant pointing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>gun at her. The victim offered the defendant money and her car. The defendant responded, \u201cShut up and let me in.\u201d The victim unlocked a rear door and let him in the car. The defendant continued to point the gun at the victim. When the victim looked into the rear-view mirror, the defendant told her to look straight ahead and drive. At the defendant\u2019s direction, the victim drove a few blocks, and was then told to stop the car. The defendant told the victim and her roommate to get out of the car, he told the victim to open the trunk, and then ordered the roommate to get in. The defendant then locked her in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The victim and the defendant got back into the car, the victim in the driver\u2019s seat and the defendant in the passenger seat. All the while, the defendant kept the gun pointed at the victim. The defendant demanded her money. The victim told him she had only $5 and that her roommate did not have any money. The victim gave the defendant her $5. The defendant then directed her to continue driving. After she drove a few blocks, he told her to stop and get out of the car. The defendant took her by the arm, with the gun still pointed at her, and led her to a large field. The defendant ordered the victim to remove her jacket and to lay it on the ground. He ordered the victim to remove her clothes and forced her to perform oral sex on him, and then ordered her to lie down. The defendant penetrated the victim vaginally. During the vaginal penetration, the defendant supported himself on his right elbow while he continued to point the gun, held in his right hand, at the victim. The assault lasted between fifteen and twenty minutes. After the assault, the defendant told the victim to get dressed. When she picked up her jacket, her car keys fell to the ground. The defendant and the victim tried unsuccessfully to find the keys. They went to the car to get a flashlight, returned to the field, found the car keys and walked back to the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>When they returned to the car, the defendant told the victim to let her roommate out of the trunk. After the roommate was released from the trunk, all three got into the car. The defendant was in the backseat with the gun pointed at the victim. The victim drove until the defendant told her to stop the car. He asked the women for their addresses and phone numbers. They wrote them down and the defendant compared them with their driver\u2019s licenses and checkbooks. The defendant ordered the victim to get out of the car. He led her down the street a short distance and threatened her with harm if she went to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The victim returned to the car and the defendant continued down the street. The victim told her roommate that the defendant had raped her and drove to Saint Raphael Hospital. The roommate told the emergency room staff that the victim had just been raped. The victim was examined and the police were called. Both women gave statements to the police. The next morning the victim looked through numerous photographs but was unable to identify anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In 1986, five years later, the victim was contacted by Sergeant Michael Sweeney of the New Haven police department who told her he had some photographs he wanted to show her. Sweeney showed the victim an array of photographs. The victim immediately identified the defendant as the man who had kidnapped and raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">At trial, in 1992, the jury convicted the defendant on all counts charged. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly refused to give a jury instruction as required by <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, and refused to admit, as an exhibit, a prior inconsistent statement under <em>Whelan. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The following facts are pertinent to the disposition of this claim. On the night of the sexual assault, the victim gave a written and signed statement to the police. In this statement, she told the police that her assailant had hidden his face most of the time and her only description of outstanding facial features was that she thought he might have a long chin. At trial, the victim testified that she had ample opportunities to observe the defendant, and that she would never forget his face. The defendant offered the statement given to the police on the night of the sexual assault as a prior inconsistent statement offered for its truth. Portions of the statement that the defendant claimed constituted prior inconsistent statements were read to the jury, the victim testified with regard to the statement, and the defendant extensively cross-examined the victim with regard to the statement. The trial court, however, refused to instruct the jury that the victim\u2019s statement to the police on the night of her sexual assault could be taken for its truth and refused to admit the written statement as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury that the statement to the police could be taken for its truth. To support his claim, the defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra. <em>Whelan </em>sets forth the rule that a prior inconsistent statement should be admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted, provided the statement is in writing, signed by a declarant who has personal knowledge of the facts stated, and the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination. Id. The trial court found that the victim\u2019s statement to the police on the night of the sexual assault met the criteria set forth in <em>Whelan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>We must, therefore, determine whether <em>Whelan </em>requires the trial court to instruct the jury that such prior inconsistent statements may be taken for their truth. The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 595 A.2d 322 (1991), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>21 Conn. App. 688, 575 A.2d 1057, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 805, 577 A.2d 1063 (1990), for the assertion that such a jury instruction is required. These cases, however, involve jury instructions that specifically instructed the jury that a prior inconsistent statement could not be used for its truth but only to impeach the witness. That is not the situation here. Here, the trial court instructed the jury to make its decision by considering \u201call of the testimony and exhibits received into evidence. . . . The evidence is the sworn testimony both on direct and cross-examination, the exhibits which have been received into evidence and anything that the lawyers agreed on.\u201d The victim\u2019s prior inconsistent statements were a part of that testimony to be considered as evidence. Absent a limiting instruction, evidence presented at trial is taken for its truth. See C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 3.5.1; 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (4th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 54, and cases cited therein. Here, unlike in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>supra, and in <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>supra, because there was no limiting instruction made, the jury was free to take the prior inconsistent statements made by the victim as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The trial court did instruct the jury on credibility of witnesses. In that portion of the charge, the trial court included as one of six criteria to consider in determining a witness\u2019 credibility, an instruction that the jury may consider the consistency of a witness\u2019 testimony. This, however, is not the same as a charge that the victim\u2019s prior inconsistent statement may be used for impeachment purposes only. Absent a limiting instruction, the jury was free to take the victim\u2019s prior incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>sistent statement as true. We hold that an affirmative instruction that such prior inconsistent statements may be taken for their truth, while being a correct statement of the law, is not mandatory under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly refused to admit the prior inconsistent written statement as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u201cWhen a witness admits making the statement, additional documentary evidence of inconsistency might be deemed to have been merely cumulative. <em>State </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>179 Conn. 121, 127, 425 A.2d 935 (1979).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>supra, 704; see also <em>G &amp; R Tire Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>177 Conn. 58, 61, 411 A.2d 31 (1979). Here, the witness victim admitted making the statement to the police. Defense counsel read the relevant portions of the statement to the jury several times and the trial court also permitted defense counsel to argue the statement\u2019s truth to the jury. Therefore, the portions of the statement that the defendant claimed consisted of prior inconsistent statements were before the jury and the witness\u2019 credibility had been called into question. Any further evidence of the inconsistency would have been cumulative. \u201cThe trial court has wide discretion in its rulings on evidence and its rulings will be reversed only if the court has abused its discretion or an injustice appears to have been done. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>[223 Conn. 535, 549, 613 A.2d 770 (1992)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 258, 630 A.2d 577 (1993). Viewing the testimony of the victim in its entirety, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the victim\u2019s written statement to the police as a full exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly required the defendant to sit at the defense table and to submit to a one-on-one identification in front of the jury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The following facts are necessary for the disposition of this claim. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the out-of-court identification of a photograph of the defendant made by the witness in 1986. After the hearing on the motion to suppress, the defendant conceded that there was no evidence of suggestive procedures and, thus, that the out-of-court identification was admissible. The defendant also conceded that the out-of-court identification could not be claimed to have tainted any in-court identification. The defendant was not present at this suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The defendant then moved to suppress any in-court identification on the ground that such identification would lack probative value because of the eleven year time period since the date of the sexual assault. The defendant also expressed concern over the inherent suggestiveness of any in-court identification. The trial court denied the motion. The defendant then requested a waiver of his presence at trial. This request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The defendant asserts that the in-court identification of the defendant violated the defendant\u2019s right to due process. Our Supreme Court has addressed the question of in-court identifications on a number of occasions. While it is true that in-court identifications are inherently suggestive, they are not impermissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>supra, 729. The United States Supreme Court has not established guidelines for in-court identification procedures. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 465, 469, 512 A.2d 189 (1986), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Domina, </em>784 F.2d 1361, 1368 (9th Cir. 1986). Nor has it \u201cindicated that in-court identifications must be made in a way that is not suggestive. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Domina, </em>[supra].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra. Additionally, where an out-of-court identification is not unconstitutional, a subsequent in-court identification need not be excluded. Id. \u201c[T]he manner in which in-court identifications are conducted is not of constitutional magnitude but rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. ... In such cases, the defendant\u2019s protection against the obvious suggestiveness in any courtroom identification confrontation is his right to cross-examination ... or other practical procedures designed to lessen the degree of suggestiveness. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>224 Conn. 445, 470, 619 A.2d 453 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>supra, the defendant contested the in-court identification procedure as impermissibly suggestive because, as here, the defendant was the only black man in the courtroom. There, our Supreme Court concluded that, because the defendant had not requested any less suggestive in-court identification procedures, the court could not \u201ccharacterize the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to waive the defendant\u2019s presence as an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id., 471. Here, as in <em>Reddick, </em>the defendant did not request any less suggestive in-court identification procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of the fact that the defendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>request any less suggestive in-court identification procedures, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to waive his presence at trial and allowed the in-court identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial after the state, in its closing argument, indirectly commented on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The following facts are pertinent to the disposition of this claim. The state, at the end of its closing argument, argued to the jury, \u201cAnd I would ask you as you go over the evidence carefully. Think about what [the victim] said, her demeanor, your observations of her. And as you do, say the evidence proves that [the defendant] is guilty. [The defendant] should not be allowed in the courtroom to twist the evidence and distort the evidence because the evidence proves that he was guilty . . . .\u2019\u2019At this point, the defendant asked to be heard outside the presence of the jury. The trial judge said, \u201cOne moment.\u201d The state then briefly concluded its closing argument. The trial judge immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>addressed the jury stating, \u201cIn anticipation of one thing that [defense counsel] may ask me to say to you, and I\u2019m going to make my remarks to you about both closing arguments. [The assistant state\u2019s attorney] just mentioned that [the defendant] may have tried to twist the testimony. His lawyer conducted cross-examination. [The defendant] didn\u2019t try to twist anything. He did not testify in this case. He doesn\u2019t try to twist anything. So, I should correct you on that.\u201d The defendant then objected to the state\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Later, in the charge to the jury, the trial court stated, \u201c[The defendant] has not testified here. And I\u2019ve told you a number of times and you all agreed, and we\u2019ve gone over this, that a defendant does not have to testify. And you all agreed it was a good idea, much better than when a person has to prove their innocence. And I don\u2019t think that [the assistant state\u2019s attorney] was trying to highlight the fact that a person did not testify. What she was calling attention to was the fact that on cross-examination these people were vigorously cross-examined, the witnesses for the state. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with that. That\u2019s what lawyers do. I\u2019ve told you that. And that\u2019s not [the defendant\u2019s] trying to twist anything. That\u2019s [defense counsel\u2019s] trying to defend his client to the best of his ability. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The defendant contends that the argument by the state was an indirect comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. It is well established that the state may not directly or indirectly comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1965). \u201cThe ultimate test of whether a prosecution argument indirectly and impermissibly comments on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify is whether, because of its language and context, the jury would naturally and necessarily interpret it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>as comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. . . . A significant factor in applying this test is whether the argument calls for information or explanations which only the defendant could be expected to supply.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>9 Conn. App. 169, 179, 517 A.2d 1043 (1986), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 205 Conn. 370, 533 A.2d 559 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Here, the state\u2019s comment that the defendant was trying to twist the evidence is not one that the jury would \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d have interpreted as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. It does not call for any information or explanations that only the defendant could be expected to supply. The statement did not call for any information at all; it is merely a comment on the defendant\u2019s case. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-6\"> Our review of the transcript reveals that defense counsel did not request an in-court lineup but claimed that the burden is on the state to request such an in-court lineup if the state wants to make an in-court identification.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: The court is familiar with the Practice Book section where the state can move for a lineup. There\u2019s a specific Practice Book section and that\u2019s what the state should do if they want an in-court identification. They should move for some type of lineup. So, I am trying to waive the presence of my client. If that is denied, then I\u2019m saying that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>only circumstance by which he should be allowed in court for any identification is if the state conducts a lineup here in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Your request for waiver of his presence is denied. Your request for lineup is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I\u2019m not \u2014 I know <em>Tatum </em>gets into that. I want to be clear. And I disagree with <em>Tatum. </em>They sort of suggest that perhaps the defense should move for the lineup. I think the \u2014 but it\u2019s an evidence thing. It\u2019s somewhat dicta. I think the burden is on the state; that if they want an in-court identification, the burden should be on the state to move for a lineup and let the state conduct the lineup, because I basically don\u2019t have the facilities. I don\u2019t have the power to bring in people. I don\u2019t have subpoena powers to bring in \u2014 fill a courtroom up of people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">\u201cThe Court: You do not want to initiate a procedure that is going to be beneficial in the identification of your client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Many people consider that a tactical decision but I think the burden should be on the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
