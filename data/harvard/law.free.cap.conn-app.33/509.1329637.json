During an investigation of the Private Club in Stamford, Richard Conklin and Larry Eisenstein, Stamford police officers, found several small bags of heroin under the carpet near where the defendant was sitting. Conklin and the defendant were acquainted before this incident. Conklin informed the defendant, who was wearing a leg cast and using crutches, that he was being arrested for narcotics violations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Conklin\u2019s search of the defendant produced a wad of money, which the defendant grabbed and refused to yield. Despite the officer\u2019s explanation that the money was evidence and that the defendant would receive a receipt, the defendant refused to release it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>A struggle ensued, during which the defendant hit Conklin with one of his crutches and kicked Eisenstein with his uninjured leg. After a third officer arrived, the defendant was subdued and handcuffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The defendant elected to have a jury trial. During voir dire, the judge retired to his chambers and permitted jury selection to continue in his absence. \u201c[T]he trial judge\u2019s absence from the courtroom during voir dire in a criminal trial is per se reversible error.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>31 Conn. App. 278, 303, 624 A.2d 1146, cert. granted, 227 Conn. 901, 630 A.2d 72 (1993). Thus, this case is controlled by our decision in <em>Patterson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167c (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault of a peace officer . . . when, with intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable peace officer . . . from performing his duty, and while such peace officer ... is acting in the performance of his duties, (1) he causes physical injury to such peace officer . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a (a) provides: <em>\u201cA </em>person is guilty of interfering with an officer when he obstructs, resists, hinders or endangers any peace officer ... in the performance of his duties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\"> The defendant also raises other claims on appeal. We need not address them, however, as our decision requires a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b536-11\"> The defendant was acquitted of possession of heroin with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
