We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The relevant facts are as follows. In 1987, the plaintiff, Forge Square Associates Limited Partnership (Forge Square), contracted with the defendant Construction Services of Bristol, Inc. (CSB), to convert an old forge building in Middletown into eighty-one residential rental units. Shortly after CSB commenced work on the project, a series of problems arose. These problems, the causes of which were vigorously disputed by the parties, resulted in the project\u2019s completion date being pushed back considerably beyond the original deadline. Believing that blame for the problems and corresponding delays rested with CSB, Forge Square sought to discharge CSB. Toward this end and pursuant to \u00a7 2.2.9 of the contract,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Forge Square referred the matter to the architect who, after an investigation, certified that sufficient cause existed for Forge Square to terminate CSB\u2019s contract. On the basis of this certification, Forge Square terminated the employment of CSB. CSB responded by filing a timely demand for arbitration,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seeking damages for each of the following: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>breach of contract; failure to issue change orders; failure to make timely payment; and wrongful termination of contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Forge Square filed an answer and counterclaim, also seeking damages for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">After extensive hearings,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the arbitration panel<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> awarded $617,740 to CSB on its claim and $278,069 to Forge Square on its counterclaim. Forge Square then filed an application to vacate the award under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the ground that \u201cthe arbitrators had manifestly disregarded the governing law in Connecticut with respect to the binding effect of the architect\u2019s certification on termination.\u201d CSB countered by filing a motion to confirm the arbitration award. After the submission of briefs and oral argument, the trial court denied Forge Square\u2019s motion to vacate and confirmed the award. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The parties agree that the trial court\u2019s scope of review of an arbitration award under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) is governed by <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 612 A.2d 742 (1992). In <em>Garrity, </em>our Supreme Court held that a trial court should vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) where \u201cthe award reflects an egregious or patently irrational rejection of clearly controlling legal priniciples.\u201d Id., 11. The court will generally examine whether the award conforms to the submission; it will not review an arbitrator\u2019s decision in an unrestricted submission merely for errors of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>errors in the application of the law to the facts or the relative merits of an unsatisfied party\u2019s claim. Id., 10-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Forge Square argues that the architect\u2019s certification stating that it had sufficient cause to terminate the contract with CSB was final and binding on the arbitrators, absent proof that the architect\u2019s decision was the product of fraud, bad faith, or gross misconduct. Because there was no showing of fraud, bad faith or gross misconduct, Forge Square claims that the arbitrators\u2019 award in favor of the defendant ignored the architect\u2019s decision regarding termination \u201cin manifest disregard of the law.\u201d Id., 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">CSB claims that under the terms of the contract the architect\u2019s decision on claims or disputes between the parties became final and binding on the arbitrators under only a limited number of situations, none of which are applicable here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the decision of the architect was not final, CSB contends that the arbitrators\u2019 award in its favor, despite the architect\u2019s conclusion otherwise, reflects a result consistent with vigorously contested issues regarding the cause of the delays, contract interpretation and the applicability of the law to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>The parties submitted comprehensive briefs and engaged in robust oral argument in support of their respective claims on appeal. We have carefully reviewed the briefs and oral argument as well as the entire record and are satisfied that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. We have also reviewed the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision. <em>Forge Square Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Construction Services of Bristol, Inc., </em>43 Conn. Sup. 32, 638 A.2d 653 (1994). In that decision, the trial court determined that the arbitrators\u2019 award did not represent an \u201cegregious or patently irrational rejection of clearly controlling legal principles.\u201d See <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision is an accurate statement of the Connecticut law governing in this action. Little would be accomplished by our recitation of what the trial court, through its diligent efforts, has already ably furnished. Accordingly, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law in this ease. See <em>Daw\u2019s Critical Care Registry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Labor, </em>225 Conn. 99, 102, 622 A.2d 518 (1993); see, e.g., <em>Loeb </em>v. <em>Al-Mor Corp., </em>224 Conn. 6, 7, 615 A.2d 149 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mobley, </em>33 Conn.
