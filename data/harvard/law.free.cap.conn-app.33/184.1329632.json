We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The trial court could reasonably have found the following facts. On December 30, 1990, the victim was at the Pembroke Grill on Pembroke Street in Bridgeport. She left the grill at approximately 11:45 p.m., walked down Pembroke Street and turned left onto East Main Street. While on East Main Street, she heard someone following her. She stopped at a phone booth and was approached by the defendant. The defendant, who had a Spanish accent, asked if she was calling the police. She said no and pretended to call her boyfriend. A person in a tow truck then pulled up next to the phone booth. The victim asked the driver to give her a ride because she believed the defendant was going to hurt her, but he refused, stating that the defendant was his relative. The driver and the defendant then began to talk to each other. Meanwhile, the victim began to walk down Seymour Street toward Kossuth Street. On Sey<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>mour Street, she again saw the defendant following her. She walked down Kossuth Street toward the thruway. When the victim reached an Interstate 95 underpass, the defendant grabbed her and punched her in the mouth. He then pulled out a knife, placed it at her neck and pulled her beneath the underpass and through a gate. The defendant pushed the victim down on her knees, told her not to move or say anything and to keep her head down or he would kill her. The defendant dropped the knife and told the victim to unbutton and unzip her pants. The defendant then pulled off her pants and underwear, got behind her and, while holding her around the neck, bit her \u201con [the] butt.\u201d The defendant then \u201cput his thing in [her] butt.\u201d He bit her neck and jumped off of her while telling her to keep her head down or he would kill her, and he \u201cwiped his penis off on [the victim\u2019s] jacket.\u201d The defendant then pulled off her necklaces and bracelet and walked away. The victim then walked down Stratford Avenue and stopped a car that she recognized as belonging to a friend. The friend drove the victim to the Bridgeport police station. The police called an ambulance that transported the victim to Park City Hospital for treatment. After treatment, she gave a statement to Detective Annie Osika about the incident and turned over her jacket to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In the spring of 1991, while a passenger on a bus, the victim saw the defendant standing on the corner of Stratford Avenue and East Main Street. She stayed on the bus for a few stops, then disembarked and called the police. The police transported the victim back to where she had seen the defendant. She identified him as her attacker, and he was arrested on March 11, 1991.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The defendant first asserts that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. We decline to afford review to this claim because it was not properly preserved before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this issue. On November 20,1991, the defendant filed a motion for a speedy trial pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m (thirty day motion).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court granted the motion on November 27,1991. On December 17,1991, the defendant entered an <em>Alford,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>plea of guilty to a charge of robbery in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-135 (a) (2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The terms of the plea bargain included a provision that the agreement could be withdrawn if the defendant was known by an alias or had a criminal record. On January 17,1992, the guilty plea was vacated because the defendant was found to have an alias, to have prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>convictions, and to be an escapee. His real name was Angel Penja. The case was then scheduled for trial no more than sixty days from that date. The defendant, acting pro se, filed a motion for a speedy trial on January 29, 1992, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c (120 day motion).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On April 20, 1992, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. He argued, on the basis of the thirty day motion, that he was entitled to a jury trial within thirty days of the January 17,1992 hearing that vacated the guilty plea. The defendant\u2019s only claim to the trial court was that the thirty day motion was still effective despite the intervening plea bargain and plea withdrawal. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">On appeal, the defendant now asserts that \u201cthe crux of [his] claim is the trial court\u2019s order on January 17, 1992, that his trial begin within sixty days. This order was a reasonable attempt by the court to enforce the defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights after the court rejected the defendant\u2019s plea. The court\u2019s order that the defendant be tried within sixty days of the rejection of his plea takes the instant case out of the statutory and Practice Book framework for the speedy trial of criminal cases. Once that order issued the question in this case became not whether the defendant was <em>entitled </em>by statute or court rule to be tried within that period, but instead whether the deadline could be ignored with im[p]unity. The defendant respectfully submits that the order could not simply be ignored and thus when that order was not rescinded or modified prior to its expiration, the defendant was entitled either to the speedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>trial ordered or to relief for the violation of that order.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) This is not the claim advanced before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u201cThis court will not review issues of law that are raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>27 Conn. App. 171, 186, 605 A.2d 563, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 907, 608 A.2d 693 (1992). \u201cWe have repeatedly held that this court will not consider claimed errors on the part of the trial court unless it appears on the record that the question was distinctly raised at trial and was ruled upon and decided by the court adversely to the appellant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Glass Container Corporation, </em>197 Conn. 428, 431, 497 A.2d 763 (1985); <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn.

We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this issue. The defendant, after assaulting the victim, \u201cwiped his penis off on [her] jacket.\u201d The victim gave the jacket to the police after the incident. Upon the victim\u2019s request, the police returned the jacket to her prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest. On May 22, 1991, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for discovery and inspection of certain items. The motion requested the disclosure of \u201cexculpatory information and materials.\u201d The jacket was unavailable at trial because the Bridgeport police had returned it to the victim prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest. The defendant claims that the failure by the Bridgeport police department to preserve the jacket violated his due process right, as guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The defendant claims that the test for determining whether the state violated his state due process right is to determine  the reason for the unavailability of the evidence,  the materiality of the evidence,  the likelihood of mistaken interpretation [due to the absence of the evidence] by witnesses or the jury, and  the prejudice to the defendant caused by the unavailability of the evidence. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Gonzalez, 206 Conn. 213, 224-25, 537 A.2d 460 (1988). The United States Supreme Court has stated \u201cthat unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 58, 109 S. Ct. 333, 102 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1988). The effect of <em>Youngblood </em>on the state constitutional test to determine whether the defendant\u2019s state due process right has been violated has never been fully explored by the courts of this state. Prior to the <em>Youngblood </em>decision, our courts applied a four-prong test to determine whether a prosecution should be dismissed for failure to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence in violation of the due process clause. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra. After the <em>Young-blood </em>decision, neither we nor our Supreme Court has ever confronted the issue of whether the due process clause of our state constitution comports with the <em>Youngblood </em>test. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brosnan, </em>24 Conn. App. 473, 589 A.2d 1234 (1991), reversed in part, 221 Conn. 788, 812, 608 A.2d 49 (1992) (the defendant failed to supply an analysis of the state due proces clause for lost evidence); <em>State </em>v. <em>Genotti, </em>220 Conn. 796, 811, 601 A.2d 1013 (1992) (\u201cthe defendant\u2019s brief [was] void of a separate state constitutional analysis alleging a violation of his state due process rights\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leroux, </em>18 Conn. App. 223, 230, 557 A.2d 1271, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 809, 564 A.2d 1072 (1989) (court refused to determine if test under state constitution was different from federal test because defendant\u2019s claim failed under four-prong analysis). Further, the Connecticut Supreme Court and this court have applied the four-prong analysis, since the <em>Youngblood </em>decision, only to claims of due process violations arising from a denial of a motion to suppress inculpatory evidence presented by the state about lost or destroyed evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>224 Conn. 347, 363-66, 618 A.2d 513 (1993) (defendant never claimed that evidence was potentially exculpatory); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>222 Conn. 506, 514-17, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>(defendant claimed a violation of due process arising out of admission of testimony concerning lost evidence, not from destruction of evidence and <em>Youngblood </em>is not addressed); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grillo, </em>23 Conn. App. 50, 57, 578 A.2d 677 (1990) (court applied four factor test set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Leroux, </em>supra, without mentioning <em>Youngblood </em>decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u201c \u2018[T]he requirements of due process are met in the trial of a person accused of crime if he has been given the benefit of a fair and impartial trial in accordance with the settled course of judicial proceedings in this state.\u2019 . . . (Citation omitted.)\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>supra, 363. \u201cOur Supreme Court has repeatedly held that, as a general rule, \u2018the due process clauses of both the United States and Connecticut constitutions have the same meaning and impose similar limitations.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 542, 442 A.2d 927 (1982); <em>Caldor\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 304, 314, 417 A.2d 343 (1977) .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Leroux, </em>supra, 229-30; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>212 Conn. 351, 364, 562 A.2d 1071 (1989). Following this principle, the Connecticut Supreme Court adopted the four-prong test, as stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, from a test enunciated under the federal constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>175 Conn. 315, 326-27, 398 A.2d 1169 (1978) , citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Herndon, </em>536 F.2d 1027, 1029 (5th Cir. 1976). Similarly, we adopt the test stated in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>supra, as the test for determining whether the state violated the defendant\u2019s state due process right by failing to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201cunless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law\u201d under our state constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u201c \u2018[B]ad faith\u2019 connotes a deliberate act done with intent to deprive the defense of information.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>212 Conn. 6, 16, 562 A.2d 470 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>supra, 364. The defendant concedes that, in this case, the state never intended to deprive the defense of information because the defendant had not yet been arrested. The defendant urges us to find bad faith, however, where the exculpatory value of the evidence should have been known by the police. Under <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>supra, 57 n., \u201c[t]he presence or absence of bad faith by the police for purposes of the Due Process Clause must necessarily turn on the police\u2019s knowledge of the exculpatory value of the evidence at the time it was lost or destroyed.\u201d The defendant must show, however, that \u201cthe police knew the semen samples would have exculpated him when they failed to perform certain tests [on the clothing] . . . .\u201d Therefore, the defendant must show actual knowledge by the police of the definitive exculpatory nature of the evidence. \u201c[T]his evidence was simply an avenue of investigation that might have led in any number of directions.\u201d Id. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s state due process right has not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The defendant next asserts that he was deprived of his right to due process by the prosecution\u2019s use of evidence from a previous plea bargain that was withdrawn. We decline to afford review to this claim because it was not properly preserved before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The following facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this issue. On December 17,1991, the defendant entered an <em>Alford </em>plea of guilty to the charge of robbery in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-135 (a) (2).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The terms of the plea bargain included a provision that the agreement could have been withdrawn if the defendant was known by an alias or had a criminal record. On January 17, 1992, the guilty pleas were vacated because the defendant was found to have used an alias, to have prior convictions, and that he was an escapee. On April 27,1992, the trial court found the defendant guilty of sexual assault in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, and threatening. At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor asked the court to consider the fact that \u201cthere was a change in plea in this matter. When he was first arraigned, he gave the name of Roberto Morales and date of birth and when he changed his plea, he also insisted his name was Roberto Morales. He was directly asked by the court, upon the suggestion of the state, to confirm his identity and his date of birth and they both turned out to be fictitious. That was, as I say, in response to direct questions by the court, so obviously Mr. Morales or Pena, is not particularly impressed by the authority of the court or the experience of being incarcerated.\u201d The defendant neither objected to this statement nor argued before the trial court the impro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>priety of the statement. The defendant, however, requests that this court review the claim under <em>State </em>v. Golding, supra, and as plain error under Practice Book \u00a7 4185.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The defendant claims that Practice Book \u00a7 718<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> protects a constitutional right in prohibiting the use of the evidence of the change of plea at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We conclude that the defendant cannot satisfy the second prong of <em>Golding, </em>since he has failed to demonstrate that his claim alleges a violation of a fundamental constitutional right. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra. In the past, we have stated that \u201c[rjobing garden variety claims of [impropriety] in the majestic garb of constitutional claims does not make such claims constitutional in nature.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ulen, </em>31 Conn. App. 20, 37, 623 A.2d 70, cert. denied, 226 Conn. 905, 625 A.2d 1378 (1993). \u201cA sentencing judge has very broad discretion in imposing any sentence within statutory limits. . . . The court may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information [it] may consider or the source from which it may come. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 47, 561 A.2d 897 (1989). The right of due process is implicated only when the information to be considered lacks \u201csome minimal indicium of reliability.\u201d Id. The information stated by the prosecutor was reliable. The circumstances surrounding the change of plea was a matter of record stated in a court proceeding.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>We also conclude that the use of the statements from the prior plea bargain is not entitled to plain error review. Practice Book \u00a7 4185. \u201cWhere a trial court\u2019s action does not result in any manifest injustice, a defendant\u2019s claim under the plain error doctrine does not warrant review. . . .

The four-prong test still applies to claims of due process violations arising out of a motion to suppress the admission of testimony about destroyed evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>222 Conn. 506, 516, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b220-6\"> Having relied here on the principle that due process has the same meaning under both constitutions, we note, that we will adopt a federal standard of constitutional law when that standard \u201cprovide[s] no less individual protection than is guaranteed by Connecticut law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 160, 579 A.2d 58 (1990); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 641-42, 376 A.2d 359 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>29 Conn.

Here, the bad faith test may provide more protection to defendants than the four-prong test, even though the defendant urges us to apply the four-prong test. Without analyzing the two tests, it may be easier for the defendant to show bad faith than to show a deprivation of his due process right under the four-prong test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\"> See footnote 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 718 provides: \u201cNo evidence of the court proceedings at which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere was entered, where such plea is not accepted by the judicial authority or is later withdrawn pursuant to Sec. 719, shall be received at the trial of the case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\"> Since we conclude that the defendant has not presented a constitutional claim, we do not reach the issue of whether Practice Book \u00a7 718 applies to sentencing hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
