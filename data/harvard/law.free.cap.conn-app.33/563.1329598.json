(Quality), appeals from a summary judgment dismissing its amended cross complaint. The issues are (1) whether Quality met its burden of demonstrating that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment, and (2) whether the trial court improperly struck Quality\u2019s cross complaint from the jury list. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">On April 21, 1988, Heritage Canal Development Associates, Inc. (Heritage), executed a $4,500,000 promissory note to People\u2019s Bank (People\u2019s) to secure a construction mortgage deed. Pursuant to the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>and mortgage deed, People\u2019s advanced $4,123,714 to Heritage. When Heritage defaulted on its interest payments, People\u2019s instituted this foreclosure action. Heritage raised no defenses to the foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Quality was included as a party defendant because of its status as a subsequent encumbrancer by virtue of a recorded mechanic\u2019s lien which recited that it had commenced work on the mortgaged premises on June 6,1988. Quality filed an answer, special defenses and cross complaint in which it sought to foreclose its mechanic\u2019s lien. Because its mechanic\u2019s lien refers to the commencement of work two months after People\u2019s mortgage was recorded, the trial court granted People\u2019s motion to strike the special defenses and cross complaint on October 15, 1990. While the motion to strike was pending before the trial court, People\u2019s filed an application to discharge Quality\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien and to substitute a bond pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-37.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted People\u2019s motion to discharge Quality\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien upon substitution of a bond on February 11, 1991. People\u2019s posted a bond and proceeded to a judgment of strict foreclosure with law days set to commence on March 18, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">After rendition of the judgment of strict foreclosure, but prior to the first law day, People\u2019s assigned all of its right, title and interest in the mortgage to the 2830 Whitney Avenue Corporation (Whitney Avenue). Accordingly, when the final law day elapsed without redemption, title vested in Whitney Avenue. <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Lomis, </em>128 Conn. 697, 700, 25 A.2d 650 (1942). With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>title to the property now vested in Whitney Avenue, Quality filed a second cross complaint seeking to invalidate People\u2019s mortgage and to foreclose on the bond posted by People\u2019s. This second cross complaint became the operative pleading between Quality and Whitney Avenue as People\u2019s assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Whitney Avenue filed an answer and special defenses on December 17,1991. Quality claimed its foreclosure cross complaint to a jury and the trial court granted Whitney Avenue\u2019s motion to strike the case from the jury list on the ground that this was an action in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Thereafter, Whitney Avenue filed a motion for summary judgment. Following oral argument, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Whitney Avenue. Quality appeals the granting of the summary judgment and also the striking of the case from the jury list.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We first consider the issue of whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment. A party moving for summary judgment must show that it is clear what the truth is and must exclude any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact. Practice Book \u00a7 384; <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>186 Conn. 632, 647, 443 A.2d 471 (1982). \u201cThe test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts. . . . \u2018[A] summary disposition . . . should be on evidence which a jury would not be at liberty to disbelieve and which would require a directed verdict for the moving party.\u2019 \u201d (Citation <em>omitted.) Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Whitney Avenue. Quality now asserts that Whitney Avenue bears the burden on appeal of proving that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the summary judgment was not clearly erroneous. Quality cites <em>Plouffe </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>160 Conn. 482, 488, 280 A.2d 359 (1971), in support of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Quality confuses the burden of proof on a motion for summary judgment in the trial court with the burden of proof on appeal from the granting of a summary judgment. In the trial court, the movant bears the burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material fact; Practice Book \u00a7 384; <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>supra; and the opposing party \u201cmust substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue.\u201d <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Carriage Lane Associates, </em>219 Conn. 772, 781, 595 A.2d 334 (1991). The existence of the genuine issue of material fact must be demonstrated by counteraffidavits and concrete evidence. <em>Kasowitz </em>v. <em>Mutual Construction Co., </em>154 Conn. 607, 613, 228 A.2d 149 (1967). A material issue of fact is one that will affect the outcome of the case. <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>158 Conn. 364, 379, 260 A.2d 596 (1969). \u201cSupporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">On appeal, however, the burden is on the opposing party to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the movant\u2019s summary judgment motion was clearly erroneous. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 222, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). On appeal, we review the affidavits to determine whether the opposing party sustained that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Quality filed two affidavits. The first was that of Quality\u2019s attorney averring that he had conferred with opposing counsel concerning replies to interrogatories. Even if we ignore the principle that generally an affidavit by a party\u2019s attorney should not be used to oppose a summary judgment motion; <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>182 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Conn. 34, 37 n.2, 438 A.2d 415 (1980); this affidavit is irrelevant to the issue of the existence of an issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The second affidavit was executed by Stephen Russo, Quality\u2019s president. The affidavit contains seven initial paragraphs identifying the parties and the nature of the action, none of which provides any substantive support of Quality\u2019s claims. Eleven of the remaining twenty-one paragraphs are hearsay, while six other paragraphs contain self-serving, unsubstantiated speculation by Russo regarding People\u2019s alleged mishandling of the loan. Simply put, Russo\u2019s averments do not amount to competent evidence supporting the claims in Quality\u2019s cross complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Hearsay statements are insufficient to contradict facts offered by the moving party; <em>McColl </em>v. <em>Pataky, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>160 Conn. 457, 459, 280 A.2d 146 (1971); <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>20 Conn. App. 231, 240, 565 A.2d 882 (1989); and if an affidavit contains inadmissible evidence it will be disregarded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>New Haven Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>37 Conn. Sup. 815, 819, 438 A.2d 440 (1981). \u201cIf the affidavits and the other supporting documents are inadequate, then the court is justified in granting the summary judgment, assuming that the movant has met his burden of proof.\u201d Id. In the present case, Whitney Avenue\u2019s affidavits satisfied the movant\u2019s burden of proof. In support of its motion for summary judgment Whitney Avenue submitted, among other evidence, the following: the assignment agreement between People\u2019s and Whitney Avenue, the certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien filed by Quality and the mortgage deed between People\u2019s and Heritage. In addition, Whitney Avenue submitted the sworn affidavit of People\u2019s vice-president, Christopher T. Arnold, who negotiated and administered the loan to Heritage. In that affidavit, Arnold swore that there was no agreement between People\u2019s and Heritage to eliminate subsequent lienors. As analyzed in footnote two, Quality offered nothing by way of factual proof inconsistent with Whitney Avenue\u2019s considerable evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Because Whitney Avenue\u2019s affidavits were adequate and not countered by affidavits or other documentary proof showing a genuine issue of material fact, Quality has not sustained its appellate burden of showing that the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment was erroneous in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Because we conclude that the trial court properly granted summary judgment, we do not reach the defendant\u2019s claim concerning striking the case from the jury list.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-37 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Whenever any mechanic\u2019s lien has been placed upon any real estate pursuant to sections 49-33, 49-34 and 49-35, the owner of that real estate, or any person interested in it, may make an application to any judge of the superior court that the lien be dissolved upon the substitution of a bond with surety, and the judge shall order reasonable notice to be given to the lienor of the application. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\"> Quality\u2019s cross complaint included a litany of claims against People\u2019s. First, Quality claimed that People\u2019s did not have priority over its mechanic\u2019s lien and that the description of the terms in the original mortgage between People\u2019s and Heritage was too indefinite to be effectual. Notwithstanding Quality\u2019s claims, it is undisputed that People\u2019s mortgage was recorded two months prior to the commencement of Quality\u2019s work at the mortgaged premises. Moreover, the terms of the mortgage between People\u2019s and Heritage are the exact language suggested in General Statutes \u00a7 49-3 (a) relating to mortgages securing future advancements. Accordingly, Quality\u2019s claim is without merit. Second, Quality advanced the claim that People\u2019s conspired with Heritage and the cosigners of the note and deed to destroy any security interest Quality had in its mechanic\u2019s lien. Quality\u2019s allegations of a conspiracy are purely speculative and wholly unsubstantiated and are thus without merit. Finally, Quality claimed that People\u2019s was unjustly enriched by and through Quality\u2019s installation of plumbing at the property used to secure the note. As the holder of a mortgage recorded prior to Quality\u2019s commencing work on the site, People\u2019s has a right on default to foreclose on the property securing the note. Quality provides no support, legal or factual, for its claim that People\u2019s was unjustly enriched. See <em>Providence Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Sutton Place, Inc., </em>161 Conn. 242, 246, 287 A.2d 379 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">On appeal, Quality argued that People\u2019s owed, to third parties like itself, a duty of good faith in the continued administering of the loan to Heritage. Because Quality alleged the issue of bad faith for the first time on appeal, we decline to review it. <em>Lopiano </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>22 Conn. App. 591, 594, 577 A.2d 1135 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b595-5\"> A motion to strike is the proper method to attack a counteraffidavit that does not comply with the rules. See <em>McCourt </em>v. <em>Anemostat Corp., </em>25 Conn. Sup. 462, 207 A.2d 585 (1965). In the present case, however, the counteraffidavit was delivered to Whitney Avenue\u2019s counsel during the course of argument, thereby depriving them of an opportunity to file a proper motion to strike. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 154 and 155.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
