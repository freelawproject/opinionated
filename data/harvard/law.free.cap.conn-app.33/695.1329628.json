The plaintiff began working around asbestos in 1947. In 1975, he filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for pulmonary asbestosis that caused a 50 percent respiratory disability arising out of asbestos exposure from 1947 to 1974. One of the defendants named in that claim was Cummings Insulation Company. On March 31, 1977, the parties settled the claim and agreed that payments were \u201cin full accord and satisfaction of a disputed claim\u201d and \u201cshall be made and accepted as a full and final settlement for all compensation for said injury and for all results upon the [plaintiff], past, present and future, and for all claims for past, present and future medical, surgical, hospital and incidental expenses and all compensation which may be due to anyone in case of the death of the [plaintiff], to the end that the payment of such sum shall constitute a complete satisfaction of all claims due or to become due at any time in favor of anybody on account of the claimed injury, or on account of any condition in any way resulting out of the said injury, or on account of the death of the [plaintiff] on account of said condition.\u201d The settlement further stated that the plaintiff understood the agreement to be a \u201cfull and final settlement and that it is intended to deal with any and all conditions, known or unknown, which exist as of the date thereof, or any changes of conditions which may arise in the future on account of said alleged occupational disease occurring between 1947 and 1974.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>On December 12,1986, the plaintiff filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for intestinal cancer arising out of asbestos exposure from 1947 to 1984. On June 23, 1987, the plaintiff filed a second claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for increased pulmonary asbestosis that caused a 75 percent respiratory disability arising out of asbestos exposure from 1975 to 1984.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On May 24, 1989, the only medical report referring to the plaintiffs post-1984 lung condition was filed with the commissioner. The report stated that the increased pulmonary disability was a \u201cprogression\u201d of the same disease. On April 26,1991, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the fourth district found that the plaintiff \u201cdeveloped a substantial increase in his pulmonary disability.\u201d The commissioner further found that the exposure to asbestos from 1975 through 1984 was a \u201csubstantial causal factor\u201d in the \u201csubstantial increase\u201d of his pulmonary disability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the basis of this finding, the commissioner ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiff benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-299b.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The defendants appealed the commissioner\u2019s decision to the review division without presenting additional evidence. The review division affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision and stated, in relevant part, that the stipulation among the parties did not prohibit the claim because the increased pulmonary disability \u201cconstituted new evidence of a new injury.\u201d The defendants appealed from this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">We must first determine whether the review division properly found that the increased pulmonary disability \u201cconstituted new evidence of a new injury\u201d when the commissioner found that the increased pulmonary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>disability was a \u201csubstantial increase\u201d from the old injury. Determining whether an injury was a substantial increase from a preexisting injury or was a new injury is a question of fact for the commissioner. See <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 346, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993); <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>207 Conn. 535, 539, 542 A.2d 1118 (1988); <em>Mellor </em>v. <em>Pleasure Valley Mobile Homes, </em>11 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 270, 271 (1993); <em>Glynn </em>v. <em>Terry Corp., </em>8 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 87, 88 (1990). \u201cIt is clear that under General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (a) and \u00a7 31-301-8<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies the review division\u2019s hearing of an appeal from the commissioner is not a de novo hearing of the facts.\u201d <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>supra, 538. \u201c[I]t is obliged to hear the appeal on the record and not \u2018retry the facts.\u2019 . . . [T]he power and duty of determining the facts rests on the commissioner, the trier of facts. . . . [T]he conclusions drawn by him from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 347. The commissioner\u2019s finding that the disability was a \u201csubstantial increase\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>from the old injury was supported by the facts and the review division should not have substituted its finding that the disability was a \u201cnew injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">We must next determine whether the review division properly affirmed the commissioner based on the commissioner\u2019s findings that the injury was a substantial increase resulting from the old injury. Our scope of review of the actions of the review division is limited to a determination of whether \u201c[t]he decision of the review division [was] correct in law, and it must not include facts found without evidence or fail to include material facts which are admitted or undisputed.\u201d <em>DeBarros </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>21 Conn. App. 107, 110, 572 A.2d 69, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 808, 576 A.2d 538 (1990) ; see <em>Vanzant </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>219 Conn. 674, 677, 594 A.2d 967 (1991). A settlement agreement is a contract among the parties. <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>143 Conn. 456, 460, 123 A.2d 192 (1956). \u201c \u2018Normally, a determination of what the parties intended by contractual commitments is \u201ca question of fact, reversible only if the trier of fact could not reasonably have arrived at the conclusion it had reached\u201d; <em>Thompson &amp; Peck, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Marine Contracting Corporation, </em>[203 Conn. 123, 130, 523 A.2d 1266 (1987)]; but \u201c[w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law.\u201d Id., 131. \u201cTerms cannot be added to a contract by interpretation.\u201d <em>Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone, </em>148 Conn. 192, 200, 169 A.2d 646 (1961).\u2019 <em>Gaynor Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Hollander, </em>29 Conn. App. 865, 872-73, 618 A.2d 532 (1993); <em>Bank of Boston Connecticut </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, </em>220 Conn. 152, 158, 595 A.2d 872 (1991) .\u201d <em>Rosick </em>v. <em>Equipment Maintenance &amp; Service, Inc., </em>33 Conn. App. 25, 38, 632 A.2d 1134 (1993). The settlement agreement states that the payments \u201cshall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>be made and accepted as a full and final settlement for all compensation for said injury and for all results upon the claimant, <em>past, present and future, </em>and for all claims for <em>past, present </em>and <em>future </em>medical, surgical, hospital and incidental expenses . . . to the end that the payment of such sum shall constitute a complete satisfaction of all claims due or to become due <em>at any time </em>in favor of anybody on account of the claimed injury, or on account of any condition in any way resulting out of the said injury . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The settlement further states that the claimant understood the settlement \u201cto deal with any and all conditions, <em>known or unknown, </em>which exist as of the date thereof, or <em>any changes of conditions which may arise in the future </em>on account of said alleged occupational disease . . . .\u201d On the basis of the contract language, the parties intended, as a matter of law, to have the settlement resolve any claim for an increase in disability resulting from asbestosis of the lung. A settlement agreement resolves \u201cthe entire case, including claims both known and unknown, and both certain and uncertain. . . . Obviously, if injuries worsen as time passes, damages will increase, and, if injuries mend, damages will decrease. These are the vagaries of . . . settlement.\u201d <em>Lutynski </em>v. <em>B. B. &amp; J. Trucking, Inc., </em>31 Conn. App. 806, 813, 628 A.2d 1, cert. granted on other grounds, 227 Conn. 914, 632 A.2d 692 (1993). Since the commissioner found that the claimed injury was an increase in the disability and not a \u201cnew\u201d injury, the plaintiff was precluded by his contract from collecting further compensation for the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The decision of the review division is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to sustain the appeal of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\"> The defendants in the workers\u2019 compensation action were Homestead Insulation Company, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, C.N. Flagg and Company, Kemper Group, Crouse Nuclear Energy, Zurich American Insurance, Home Insurance Company, American Guarantee and Liability Insurance Company, Cummings Insulation Company and CNA Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Appeal No. 12112 was filed by Homestead Insulation Company, C.N. Flagg and Company, Crouse Nuclear Energy and Cummings Insulation Company. Appeal No. 12113 was filed by Cummings Insulation Company and CNA Insurance Company. This court granted the motion by the appellants in appeal No. 12112 to adopt the brief of the appellants in appeal No. 12113. Our decision on the appeal by Cummings and CNA is dispositive of appeal No. 12112.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b provides: \u201cAny party aggrieved by the decision of the compensation review [division] upon any question or questions of law arising in the proceedings may appeal the decision of the compensation review [division] to the appellate court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b722-10\"> The compensation review division of the workers\u2019 compensation commission is now the compensation review board of the workers\u2019 compensation commission. Public Acts 1991, No. 91-339, \u00a7 20. We will refer to the entity as the review division since that designation applied when the proceedings commenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b722-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-299b provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf an employee suffers an injury or disease for which compensation is found by the commissioner to be payable according to the provisions of this chapter, the employer who last employed the claimant prior to the filing of the claim, or the employer\u2019s insurer, shall be initially liable for the payment of such compensation. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b723-6\"> The defendants also claim on appeal that the review division improperly (1) concluded that the conduct of the plaintiff did not constitute wilful and serious misconduct, (2) concluded that Cummings Insulation Company was the last responsible employer, and (3) refused to correct the findings as requested. Since we reverse the judgment of the review division, we need not discuss these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b724-7\"> The parties agreed to have the two claims consolidated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b724-8\"> The commissioner also found that the plaintiff suffered from colon cancer. The commissioner never made a finding that the asbestos exposure caused the cancer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b725-5\"> Section 31-301-8 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides: \u201cOrdinarily, appeals are heard by the compensation review division upon the certified copy of the record filed by the commissioner. In such cases, the division will not retry the facts or hear evidence. It considers no evidence other than that certified to it by the commissioner, and then for the limited purpose of determining whether the finding should be corrected, or whether there was any evidence to support in law the conclusion reached. It cannot review the conclusions of the commissioner when these depend upon the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. Its power in the corrections of the finding of the commissioner is analagous to, and its method of correcting the finding similar to the power and method of the Supreme Court in correcting the findings of the trial court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
