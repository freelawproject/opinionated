On September 1,1989, a commuter train collided with the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle at a railroad crossing in Danbury. As a result of the collision, the plaintiff sustained injuries. On January 10,1991, the plaintiff instituted this negligence action against the named defendant, Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company (Metro-North). The plaintiff was a Connecticut resident at the time of the accident. Metro-North operates a railroad service between Grand Central Terminal in New York City and New Haven with branch service to New Canaan, Danbury and Waterbury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">On December 24,1991, Metro-North filed an answer and three special defenses. On September 25, 1992, Metro-North filed a motion for summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>based on its special defense claiming that the plaintiffs action was barred by the statute of limitations. On January 19, 1993, the trial court filed a memorandum of decision granting Metro-North\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court found that Metro-North was a public authority created by the New York state legislature, and thus, under the sovereign immunity doctrine, subject to suit only to the extent that immunity was waived by statute. It further found that Metro-North is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, and that both the Transit Authority and Metro-North are public benefits corporations governed by the New York Public Authorities Law. The court stated that \u00a7 1276 (2) of the New York Public Authorities Law creates a right to sue the Transit Authority and its subsidiaries within one year after the cause of action in tort arises.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the plaintiff\u2019s action was commenced fifteen months after the cause of action arose, the trial court held that it was time barred under \u00a7 1276 (2) of the New York Public Authorities Law, and granted Metro-North\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">\u201c[T]he granting of summary judgment by the trial court must meet well established standards. Practice Book \u00a7 384 provides that \u2018[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>31 Conn. App. 824, 832, 627 A.2d 1347 (1993). \u201cWhile the burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact is on the party seeking summary judgment; see <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980); the party opposing [summary judgment] must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue. . . . <em>Bassin </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>26 Conn. App. 534, 537, 602 A.2d 1044 (1992). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Strada </em>v. <em>Connecticut Newspapers, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 313, 317, 477 A.2d 1005 (1984). The test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts. . . . <em>Trotta </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>[26 Conn. App. 407, 410, 601 A.2d 1036 (1992)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cortes </em>v. <em>Cotton, </em>31 Conn App. 569, 572-73, 626 A.2d 1306 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">On the basis of our independent review of the doctrine of sovereign immunity, we conclude that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The trial court failed to make a threshold determination as to whether, as a matter of law, the defendant was entitled to claim sovereign immunity in this state. In making such a determination, the trial court is required to assess whether the action is, in effect, against the state,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>defendant asserting sovereign immunity is an instrumentality of the state<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the extent that the interests or rights of the state are directly affected,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or whether the state has a pecuniary interest or substantive right to protect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An examination of the attributes of the entity in question will disclose whether there is a state nexus. Several factors for consideration have evolved in determining whether a given entity is an \u201carm\u201d of the government entitled to be clothed in the tort immunity of the state. These inquiries include whether the entity was created by the state and to whose control the entity is subject,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> an analysis of the issues involved and the relief sought,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> whether the state itself has a pecuniary interest or a substantive right in need of protection,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> whether the governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>body functions statewide, does the state\u2019s work, was created by the state legislature and is subject to local control, and to what extent the entity depends financially on state coffers,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and whether the instrumentality was created as a state agency and empowered to accomplish a public purpose.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Some other considerations are the character of power delegated to the governmental body by a legislative enactment,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the relation of the entity to the state,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> whether the entity is a public corporation separate from the state,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and whether the instrumentality uses state owned land or owns the land independently.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The fact that an entity was created by a state statute does not alone establish that it is an arm of the state. Indeed, all of the above characteristics must be examined before a trial court can conclude that a governmental body is entitled to sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>\u201cIn ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the trial court\u2019s function is not to decide issues of material fact, but rather to decide whether any such issues exist. <em>Telesco </em>v. <em>Telesco, </em>187 Conn. 715, 718, 447 A.2d 752 (1982).\u201d <em>Cortes </em>v. <em>Cotton, </em>31 Conn. App. 569, 575, 626 A.2d 1306 (1993). Our review of the record shows that there was insufficient evidence presented by which the trial court could determine, as a matter of law, that the defendant was entitled to our state\u2019s sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>immunity. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court improperly granted the motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-10\"> The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the named defendant, Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company.

On November 16,1992, the plaintiff filed a motion to reargue, which the trial court granted on November 30, 1992.

Because resolution of the plaintiffs first claim is dispositive of this appeal, we do not address the estoppel claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b863-6\"> In determining whether an action was a suit against the state, the court in <em>Robb </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>147 Ill. App. 3d 710, 713, 498 N.E.2d 267 (1986), analyzed two factors, the issues involved and the relief sought. \u201c[I]f a judgment for the plaintiff could operate to control the actions of the State or subject it to liability, it will then be deemed an action against the State, even though the State is not a named party.\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b864-5\"> A governmental body cannot avoid suit simply because of its governmental nature. \u201c[W]hether any governmental entity is amenable to suit depends upon whether it is or is not part of the [state] . . . .\u201d <em>Specter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>462 Pa. 474, 478, 341 A.2d 481 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b864-6\"> <em>\u201cIn order for the </em>doctrine [of sovereign immunity] to apply and immunity to attach, the relief asked must involve some direct or substantial interest of the state. <em>(Lefebvre </em>v. <em>Somersworth Shoe Co., </em>93 N.H. 354, 357 [41 A.2d 924 (1945)]; see <em>Morrill </em>v. <em>American Reserve Bond Co., </em>151 F. 305, 308-310 (1907); <em>Ex parte State, </em>245 Ala. 193, [16 So. 2d 187 (1943)]; <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. </em>v. <em>Shaid, </em>103 W.

Thus, even though the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars suits against the state and its agencies alike, that doctrine will not be applied where the state or governmental unit, although named as a defendant, is not an actual or interested adverse party.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Glassman v.

The court ruled that in a suit against the state in which the doctrine of sovereign immunity applies, the state has a pecuniary interest or substantive right to protect.

Ct. 1182, 59 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1979). In <em>Hall, </em>the plaintiffs brought suit in California to recover for injuries resulting from a automobile accident in California against the driver of an automobile owned by the university and state of Nevada. The Supreme Court held that a state is not constitutionally immune to suit in the courts of another state. The decision of the Nevada legislature to limit liability in tort was not one in which the people of California had any voice. The system adopted by California was a different system and the court held: \u201cEach of these decisions is equally entitled to our respect.\u201d Id,, 426. The <em>Hall </em>court explained that California\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction would not usurp the principles of sovereign immunity \u2014 \u201ctraffic accidents occurring outside of Nevada could hardly interfere with Nevada\u2019s capacity to fulfill its own sovereign responsibilities.\u201d Id., 424 n.24; see also <em>Daughtry </em>v. <em>Arlington County, </em>490 F. Sup. 307 (D. D.C. 1980) (state of Virginia could be sued in District of Columbia for alleged misconduct of Virginia police); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>635 P.2d 241 (Colo.

The <em>Hall </em>court reasoned that \u201c[i]t may be wise policy, as a matter of harmonious interstate relations, for States to accord each other immunity or to respect any established limits on liability. They are free to do <em>so.\u201d Nevada </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 426. Some states have declined jurisdiction as a matter of comity and public policy. See <em>Newberry </em>v. <em>Georgia Department of Industry &amp; Trade, </em>286 S.C. 574, 336 S.E.2d 464 (1985); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>State, </em>206 Mont. 264, 670 P.2d 1372 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b867-12\"> The trial court cited, inter alia, <em>Ecker </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>205 Conn. 219, 530 A.2d 1056 (1987), and <em>Morris Plan Industrial Bank </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>131 Conn. 671, 42 A.2d 147 (1945), for the proposition that Connecticut\u2019s two year statute of limitations in negligence actions could not be applied in this case because it is a procedural limitation rather than substantive in nature. These cases hold that \u201c[wjhere ... a specific time limitation is contained within a statute that creates a right of action that did not exist at common law [as does the statute in this case], then the remedy exists only during the prescribed period and not thereafter. ... In such cases, the time limitation is not to be treated as an ordinary statute of limitation, but rather is a limitation on the liability itself, and not of the remedy alone.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Ecker </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 232.
