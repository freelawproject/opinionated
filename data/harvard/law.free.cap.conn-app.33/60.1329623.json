We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The court reasonably could have found the following facts. During the early evening of December 12,1990, Efrain Acevedo visited the Meriden apartment of the defendant, who expressed his dissatisfaction with a car radio that Acevedo had sold to him one month earlier. When Acevedo refused to refund his money, the defendant became angry and challenged Acevedo to fight. Acevedo declined and left the defendant\u2019s apartment. He observed a police car nearby, and asked Officer Lou Sobieraj, who was inside the car, to calm down the defendant. Acevedo was concerned that the defendant might attack him. Sobieraj did not get a chance to speak to the defendant, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">After Acevedo had returned to his own apartment, the defendant and another man knocked at the door while Acevedo was in the living room playing with his son. When Acevedo again refused to refund his money, the defendant pushed in the partially opened door and stabbed Acevedo in the left side of his chest with a knife. Acevedo pulled out the knife, grabbed a nearby baseball bat, struck the defendant over the head with the bat and then fell to the floor. Acevedo\u2019s wife ran into the living room to help, and he asked her to get his revolver. At that point, the defendant and his com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>panion left. After the police arrived, Acevedo was taken to the hospital for emergency surgery on the potentially deadly wound, and has since fully recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">After reporting to the scene of the stabbing, two police officers, Michael Lyons and Sobieraj visited the defendant\u2019s apartment. The defendant was bleeding from a cut on his head when he answered the door, and, when asked by Lyons what had happened, the defendant said that he had \u201churt himself.\u201d Another police officer, Carlos Otero, later arrived at the defendant\u2019s apartment and advised the defendant in Spanish of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights. Otero then asked him how he had received the gash in his forehead. The defendant replied that someone had hit him over the head with a baseball bat, but did not mention the stabbing. Subsequently, the defendant was transported to the hospital. When the defendant was released from the hospital, Otero had him sign a <em>Miranda </em>rights form printed in Spanish, which the defendant said he understood. At that time, the defendant refused to make a further statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">At trial, the prosecutor asked Lyons once, the defendant once, and Otero twice if the defendant ever mentioned that he had stabbed someone. The state, in its closing argument, again alluded to the silence of the defendant as to the stabbing. The defendant was found guilty of assault in the first degree by the trial court. His sole claim is that the trial court improperly admitted the testimony of Otero and the defendant regarding the defendant\u2019s <em>postMiranda </em>silence, which the state used to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The defendant claims that the trial court violated his rights to due process and against self-incrimination pursuant to the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution when it permitted the state to ask questions that focused on the defendant\u2019s post-<em>Miranda </em>silence. Such questioning is prohibited by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>204 Conn. 769, 529 A.2d 1263 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Apostle, </em>8 Conn. App. 216, 512 A.2d 947 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The defendant\u2019s counsel did not preserve this claim by raising an objection to the challenged testimony at trial. The defendant maintains, however, that the issue can be reviewed under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). <em>Golding </em>held that a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error only if the record is adequate to review the claim of error, if the defendant alleges the violation of a fundamental constitutional right that clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial, and, if a harmless error analysis must be undertaken, the state has failed to demonstrate the harmlessness of the violation beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 239-40. \u201cIn the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d Id., 240. Here, we need not decide whether the trial court committed a <em>Doyle </em>violation by allowing the state to ask questions about the defendant\u2019s <em>postMiranda </em>silence because we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that any violation of the principles of <em>Doyle </em>was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The test for harmfulness of a <em>Doyle </em>violation \u201cis whether \u2018there is a reasonable possibility that the improperly admitted evidence contributed to the conviction. . . .\u2019 <em>\u2019' State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>215 Conn. 173, 184, 575 A.2d 216 (1990), quoting <em>Schneble </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>405 U.S. 427, 432, 92 S. Ct. 1056, 31 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1972). \u201cThe harmlessness of an error depends upon its impact on the trier and the result . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Here, the trial was before a court, not a jury, which decreases the likelihood that the trier of fact was misled by the state\u2019s allusion to the defendant\u2019s invocation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sherbacow, </em>21 Conn. App. 474, 484, 574 A.2d 817, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 808, 580 A.2d 65 (1990). The collective decision of a jury is more likely to reflect the taint of a <em>Doyle </em>violation than the decision of a trial judge trained to sift out and discard evidentiary improprieties.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Moreover, the defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent is neither mentioned nor alluded to in the transcript of the court\u2019s decision. The transcript instead contains the court\u2019s assessment of the overall incredibility and transparency of the defendant\u2019s story in comparison to Acevedo\u2019s \u201clogical and consistent\u201d explanation of the altercation. The court stated that it did not have much difficulty determining which account to believe, as there was not \u201ca single piece that [did not] fit\u201d Acevedo\u2019s story. The court concluded that the evidence against the defendant was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Although the state alluded to the silence of the defendant on four separate occasions, none of its questions was specifically directed at postarrest, as opposed to prearrest, silence. Rather, the state asked whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the defendant had \u201cever\u201d told the police that he stabbed Acevedo. We acknowledge that <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>223 Conn. 299, 319-20, 613 A.2d 242 (1992), held that a question that could reasonably be understood to encompass both prearrest and postarrest silence should not be allowed. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>220 Conn. 698, 721, 601 A.2d 993 (1991), cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 3041, 120 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1992). The state\u2019s questions in this trial to the court, however, cannot be said to have \u201cstruck at the jugular\u201d of the defendant\u2019s defense, or \u201chighlighted\u201d the defendant\u2019s silence to the point of prejudicial error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Canty, </em>223 Conn. 703, 714, 613 A.2d 1287 (1992). On the basis of the totality of the circumstances in this case, we conclude that the state has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged improper questioning was not a factor in the outcome of the trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Canty, </em>supra, 714; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 185-87; <em>State </em>v. <em>Apostle, </em>supra, 227. The defendant, therefore, cannot prevail. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\"> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\"> In the defendant\u2019s brief, he also claimed as improper the court\u2019s admission of the testimony of Lyons regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to inform the police of the stabbing. Because it is unclear from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the record, however, whether Lyons spoke to the defendant before or after Otero read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the defendant abandoned this claim in his reply brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
