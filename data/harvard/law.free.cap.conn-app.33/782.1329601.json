We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On April 3, 1991, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Vincent Ellison was stabbed to death at the doorway to his apartment. The victim\u2019s apartment is located on the first floor of a dilapidated, brick building at 500 Ann Street in Hartford. The front entrance to the building opens into a large hallway on the first floor and there are two apartments located on the left side of the hallway that are visible from the front entrance. The victim\u2019s apartment was the first one on the left and James Osborne\u2019s was the second. Beyond Osborne\u2019s apartment is a short corridor leading to another apartment, not visible from the front entrance. The victim\u2019s cousin, Oscar Steve Anglin, lived in the third apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The defendant frequently visited the victim at his apartment. On April 3, 1991, the victim, the defendant and the victim\u2019s cousin, Michael Antoine Nixon, were present in the victim\u2019s apartment. The three men spent the afternoon drinking alcohol and taking drugs. At about 5:30 p.m., the defendant left the apartment to \u201chustle\u201d some money in order to obtain more drugs. He returned shortly thereafter with two sweaters he had shoplifted from a local store. At about 6 p.m., the victim sent Nixon out with directions to sell the sweaters and to purchase more drugs with the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">When Nixon failed to return within the hour, the defendant became concerned about Nixon\u2019s absence and expressed this concern to the victim several times. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>The victim became angry with the defendant for mistrusting his cousin. He threatened to harm the defendant if he did not leave the apartment. The defendant then ran out of the victim\u2019s apartment into the hallway and knocked on the door to Osborne\u2019s apartment. He did not wait for Osborne to answer because he thought the victim was pursuing him with a knife. He continued down the hallway and knocked on Anglin\u2019s door. When Anglin opened the door he saw that the defendant was carrying a large butcher knife.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant entered Anglin\u2019s apartment and pleaded with him to calm the enraged victim. Anglin then stepped into the hallway to speak with the victim, who was carrying a broomstick. Anglin had shut the door behind him and the defendant locked the door from the inside. After speaking with Anglin for approximately seven to eight minutes, the victim turned and went down the hallway in the direction of his apartment. The defendant let Anglin return to his apartment and the defendant then decided to leave Anglin\u2019s apartment and to retrieve his shoes and clothes from the victim\u2019s apartment before he left the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Osborne, who had overheard the voices of the defendant, the victim and Anglin coming from the direction of Anglin\u2019s apartment, opened his apartment door to see what was going on in the hallway. Osborne saw the victim first, standing in front of Osborne\u2019s apartment door, holding a broomstick and shouting loudly about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>\u201ckick[ing the defendant\u2019s] ass.\u201d Osborne then saw the defendant walking down the hallway from the direction of Anglin\u2019s apartment with a knife in his hand. The defendant came face-to-face with the victim and stated that he was tired of his threats and that he was not going to take it any longer. At that point, the victim assumed a karate stance holding the stick with both hands and said to the defendant, \u201cCome on, bitch, come on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The victim then swung the stick at the defendant, hitting him in the shoulder and the defendant thrust the knife at the victim. The men fought back and forth from the doorway of Osborne\u2019s apartment toward the front entrance of the building and back to the doorway of the victim\u2019s apartment. At some point during the fight, the knife and stick fell to the hallway floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">After several minutes of fistfighting, the victim lost his footing and fell backward onto the floor and across his apartment\u2019s threshold. The victim was lying on his back with his legs extended into the hallway and his upper torso inside his apartment. The defendant ended up on top of the victim, straddling him, while the victim struggled to push or kick the defendant off of him. In the midst of the struggle, the defendant picked up the knife from the hall floor and fatally stabbed the victim. The defendant then went into Osborne\u2019s apartment and asked for a pair of shoes. When Osborne told the defendant that he could not believe he had stabbed the victim, the defendant responded, \u201cI did it, and I\u2019ll do it again.\u201d The defendant then left Osborne\u2019s apartment with the knife and a pair of Osborne\u2019s shoes, went next door to the victim\u2019s apartment to retrieve his jacket, and fled the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">When arrested, the defendant told the police, \u201cI had to stab him; I had to stab him.\u201d At trial, however, the defendant testified that he did not recollect actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>stabbing the victim although he did recall thrashing at the victim with a knife in his hand. He claimed to have been scared and confused and to have acted in self-defense. After a jury trial, the defendant was found not guilty of murder and was convicted of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. The trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of twenty years. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The defendant first claims that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to disprove his defense of justification beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">We employ a two part test in reviewing claims relating to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>29 Conn. App. 754, 767, 618 A.2d 65 (1992), cert. denied, 225 Conn. 904, 621 A.2d 287 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>28 Conn. App. 575, 578, 611 A.2d 457 (1992). We first construe the evidence presented at trial in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>supra. \u201cWe then determine whether, from the evidence and all the reasonable inferences which it yields, [the jury] could reasonably have concluded that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>225 Conn. 450, 455, 625 A.2d 791 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>224 Conn. 347, 368, 618 A.2d 513 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosswell, </em>223 Conn. 243, 249, 612 A.2d 1174 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>At trial, the defendant claimed that he was acting in self-defense when he stabbed the victim to death. \u201cSelf-defense is raised by way of justification, and when such defense is asserted \u2018the state shall have the burden of disproving such defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (a). . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gelormino, </em>24 Conn. App. 556, 561, 590 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 913, 593 A.2d 138 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>218 Conn. 766, 772, 591 A.2d 1225 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Deptula, </em>31 Conn. App. 140, 147, 623 A.2d 525, appeal dismissed, 228 Conn. 852, 635 A.2d 812 (1993). The defendant maintains that the state failed to introduce sufficient evidence to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of self-defense as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>A person is justified in using deadly physical force, under the self-defense statute, \u00a7 53a-19 (a), only when he reasonably believes such force to be necessary because he \u201creasonably believes that [another] person is (1) using or about to use deadly physical force, or (2) inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm.\u201d Even then, under \u00a7 53a-19 (b) and (c), a person is not justified in using deadly physical force on another person if (1) he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating, (2) with intent to cause physical injury or death to another person, he provokes the use of physical force by such other person, (3) he is the initial aggressor, or (4) the physical force involved was the product of a combat by agreement. Section 53a-19 \u201c \u2018presents a question of fact about what the defendant himself reasonably believed about his exposure to jeopardy under the circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>194 Conn. 376, 389, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 663, 453 A.2d 427 (1982).\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>203 Conn. 466, 470, 525 A.2d 498 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The jury was free to disbelieve the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense and to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant could not reasonably have believed that he was faced with an imminent use of physical force by the victim or that the degree of physical force he used against the victim was necessary to defend himself. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellino, </em>31 Conn. App. 385, 392-93, 625 A.2d 1381, cert. granted, 226 Conn. 917, 628 A.2d 988 (1993). At the time of the altercation in the hallway that resulted in his death, the victim was armed only with a broomstick. The defendant, in contrast, was armed with a large butcher knife. Both men eventually lost their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>weapons before the victim slipped backward and fell across the threshold of his apartment. At that point, the victim was unarmed, lying on his back, with his upper torso, including his arms and hands, inside the apartment. The defendant was on top of the victim, straddling him. The victim could not reach either the knife or broomstick and tried unsuccessfully to kick the defendant off of him. The defendant, although not threatened with deadly physical force or great bodily harm, reached into the hallway, grabbed the butcher knife, and, while he straddled the unarmed victim, stabbed him three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The evidence also supports the conclusion that the defendant was in a position to avoid the use of deadly physical force by retreating with complete safety. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (b) (1). The victim\u2019s apartment was located immediately inside the front entrance of the building. Thus, the defendant could have gotten up and safely exited the building through the front entrance once he realized the victim was unarmed and trapped beneath him. The defendant, however, did not safely retreat from the scene at the first opportunity but instead fatally stabbed the victim before exiting the building via the front entrance. The defendant also could have sought refuge in Anglin\u2019s apartment, where he had initially gone when the victim came after him with a knife earlier in the evening. Despite the defendant\u2019s claims to the contrary, the jury reasonably could have concluded that a retreat in complete safety was available and that the defendant knew one existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The jury also reasonably could have concluded from the evidence presented that the defendant was not justified in using deadly force on the victim because he had either provoked the victim, was the initial aggressor, or because he and the victim had engaged in a combat by agreement. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (c) (1) through (3). When the defendant left the safety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Anglin\u2019s apartment, armed with a large butcher knife, he immediately confronted the victim. He told the victim that he was \u201ctired of his bullshit\u201d and that he was \u201cnot going to take it any longer.\u201d The defendant then challenged the victim \u201cto shoot his best shot,\u201d thus provoking the victim to swing the broomstick at the defendant and strike him on the shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">We are satisfied, on the basis of the evidence and the reasonable and logical inferences to be drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence was more than sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that the state had met its burden of disproving the defense of justification. The defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The defendant next claims that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient for a jury reasonably to find the defendant guilty of manslaughter in the first degree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He asserts that the evidence adduced at trial demonstrates that the state did not meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt as required by \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) that he intended to cause serious physical injury to the victim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The standard of review for a sufficiency of the evidence claim is set forth in part I. \u201cWhen applying the sufficiency of the evidence test, the court must ensure that [e]ach essential element of the crime charged . . . be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and although it is within the province of the [trier] to draw reasonable, logical inferences from the facts proven, [it] may not resort to speculation and conjecture. . . . Where it cannot be said that a rational trier of fact could find guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then, a conviction cannot constitutionally stand, as it is viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>tive of due process under the fourteenth amendment [to the constitution of the United States]. . . . [T]he burden rested upon the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused, i.e., to prove each material element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>[29 Conn. App. 704, 708-709, 618 A.2d 43 (1992), cert. denied, 225 Conn. 904, 621 A.2d 287, cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 3057, 125 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1993)], quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>supra.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In order to convict the defendant of manslaughter in the first degree, the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant intended to cause serious physical injury to the victim, and (2) with that intent, the defendant caused the victim\u2019s death. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1). The intent to cause serious physical injury required for a conviction of manslaughter in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1), by definition, \u201crequire[s] a jury\u2019s finding that the defendant caused a \u2018physical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes seri-. ous disfigurement, serious impairment of health or serious loss or impairment of the function of a bodily organ.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (4).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>28 Conn. App. 81, 89, 611 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 920, 614 A.2d 826 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient to establish his intent to cause a serious physical injury is flawed. \u201cIntent, may be, and usually is, inferred from conduct. . . . The use of inferences based on circumstantial evidence is necessary because direct evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>supra, 368. \u201cThe intent of the actor is a question for the trier of fact, and the conclusion drawn by the trier in this regard should stand unless it is an unreasonable one.\u201d <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>v. <em>Holley, </em>174 Conn. 22, 26, 381 A.2d 539 (1977); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>25 Conn. App. 275, 281, 594 A.2d 481 (1991). \u201c[A] factfinder may infer an intent to cause serious physical injury from circumstantial evidence such as the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading up to and immediately following the incident.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 89-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">In the present case, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury reasonably could infer the requisite intent to cause serious physical injury to the victim. There was evidence that the defendant approached the victim wielding a large butcher knife, confronted the victim face-to-face and told him that he was tired of his threats and he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to take it any longer,\u201d and then challenged the victim \u201cto shoot his best shot.\u201d There was also evidence that during their altercation, the victim slipped backward and fell and the defendant ended up on top of him, straddling him. The jury heard testimony that, once the victim was on his back, both men were unarmed and only the defendant could reach the knife. The defendant then picked up the knife and stabbed the victim, who was still unarmed, in the chest three times. The jury also had before it the testimony of the medical examiner that these three stab wounds to the upper left chest directly caused the victim\u2019s death. Additionally, the jury heard testimony that after the defendant stabbed the victim, he told Osborne, \u201cI did it and I\u2019ll do it again,\u201d entered the victim\u2019s apartment to retrieve his jacket, and fled the building, the knife still in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Moreover, the jury had before it the defendant\u2019s testimony and the testimony of his expert on the issue of the defendant\u2019s intent. The defendant maintained that the stabbing was his reaction to the victim\u2019s violent hitting and kicking and not evidence of his intent. The defendant\u2019s expert explained that at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>stabbing, the defendant \u201cwas experiencing serious and severe disruption of his feelings\u201d caused by what he perceived as a life threatening situation. The jury apparently rejected this testimony. The determination of the credibility of a defendant or an expert witness and the weight to be accorded their testimony is within the province of the jury. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>226 Conn. 20, 38, 627 A.2d 862 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>225 Conn. 114, 123, 622 A.2d 519 (1993); <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>31 Conn. App. 824, 843, 627 A.2d 1347 (1993). When conflicting explanations are presented, the jury is not required to accept the testimony and inferences offered on behalf of the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sauris, </em>227 Conn. 389, 402, 631 A.2d 238 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>supra. Thus, the jury in the present case was free to reject the testimony of the defendant and his expert, in full or in part, and find persuasive the state\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The evidence presented at trial was more than sufficient for the jury reasonably to have inferred that the defendant intended to cause serious physical injury to the victim, and therefore to permit a conviction of manslaughter in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The defendant further claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the duty to retreat imposed by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (b). He argues that the instruction as a whole failed to direct the jury to evaluate the defendant\u2019s subjective knowledge of the availability of retreat. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">The state contends that we should not entertain this issue because the defendant failed to take an exception to the jury instruction pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 852 and further failed to request review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We disagree with the state. Although at trial the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>ant did not take an exception to that portion of the jury instruction he now attacks, he did preserve his claim by filing a proper request to charge with respect to the issue of self-defense pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 852.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">During its charge to the jury on the issue of self-defense, the trial court properly instructed the jury by quoting the relevant statutory language: \u201c[A] person is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person <em>if he knows </em>that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety ... by retreating . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (b). In its explanation to the jury of that statutory language, however, the trial court misstated the duty to retreat. After reciting the statutory language, the trial court stated: \u201cAs to retreating with complete safety, <em>you must consider what was reasonable for the defendant to perceive was available as retreat </em>or if none was available without the use of physical force, what degree of physical force was reasonably necessary to make one available. Now, in this connection, you can realize what you are doing is attempting to stand in the shoes of the defendant, <em>as you would perceive a reasonable person to view the same situation, under the same conditions. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The defendant challenges this portion of the charge as it improperly interjected an objective standard into the duty to retreat. The trial court did, however, conclude its charge on self-defense with a proper statement of the law. It stated that, in determining whether the defendant had breached the duty to retreat, the jury must consider whether the defendant himself could in fact have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>perceived that he had the opportunity to avoid the necessity of using force by retreating.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Our review of the defendant\u2019s claim requires that we consider the trial court\u2019s charge in its entirety to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the jury could have been misled by the instruction as it was given. <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 498, 590 A.2d 901 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 662, 588 A.2d 127 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>29 Conn. App. 533, 540, 616 A.2d 1148 (1992), cert. denied, 224 Conn. 924, 618 A.2d 531 (1993). \u201c[W]e do not engage in a microscopic examination of the charge, dissecting it line by line, nor do we consider the challenged portions of the charge in isolation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>29 Conn. App. 524, 531, 616 A.2d 1143 (1992). \u201cJury instructions need not be exhaustive, perfect or technically accurate. . . . They must be correct in law, adapted to the issues presented in the case and sufficient to guide the jury in reaching a verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Reading the instructions as a whole, we find that a correct statement of the law preceded and subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>followed a misstatement of the law. We conclude, however, that in the context of the entire jury instruction, the improper instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cWhile it is true that an instruction containing a misstatement of the law is more likely to be prejudicial than an instruction that contains an omission or an incomplete statement of the law ... an incorrect instruction to the jury may be cured by a later correct instruction . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>32 Conn. App. 687, 696-97, 631 A.2d 324, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 932, 632 A.2d 708 (1993). In the present case, the trial court immediately cured its misstatement of the duty to retreat in its charge to the jury on self-defense. After incorrectly instructing the jury to consider the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the defendant\u2019s perception regarding the availability of retreat, the trial court properly instructed the jury that the defendant must <em>subjectively </em>perceive that he can retreat in safety. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Considering the trial court\u2019s charge as a whole, we conclude that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court deprived him of his federal and state constitutional rights to a fair trial by an impartial jury by improperly marshaling the evidence in its jury charge in favor of the state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that the court unfairly emphasized the state\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>\u201cA trial court often has not only the right, but also the duty to comment on the evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>218 Conn. 458, 461-62, 590 A.2d 112 (1991). Fair comment does not become improper merely because it tends to point out strengths, weaknesses, or difficulties of a particular case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 132, 157, 531 A.2d 125 (1987). In marshaling the evidence, the court must be careful not to imply any favor or criticism of either side. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>supra, 463. The trial court may, at its discretion, call the attention of the jury to the evidence, or lack of evidence, bearing on any point in issue and may comment on the weight of the evidence as long as it does not direct or advise the jury how to decide the matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>212 Conn. 387, 408, 563 A.2d 646, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 980, 110 S. Ct. 510, 107 L. Ed. 2d 512 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The defendant argues that the trial court unfairly marshaled the evidence during its explanation of the legal principles of intent and self-defense by ignoring or passing lightly over facts favorable to the defendant. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, the record reveals that the defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s charge. Unlike in <em>Hernandez, </em>where our Supreme Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s charge was improper, the court here did not recapitulate \u201cnearly all of the state\u2019s testimonial and physical evidence\u201d and did not frequently comment \u201cfavorably on the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>supra, 464. Although the trial court did provide a more detailed account of some of the state\u2019s evidence than of the defendant\u2019s counterevidence, it explained in detail the defendant\u2019s theories of defense and outlined the exculpatory evidence in support thereof. One reason more time was spent in marshaling the state\u2019s evidence is that there was more of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>\u201cIn evaluating the court\u2019s charge, we are cognizant that [t]he test of a charge is not whether it applies pertinent rules of law to every ramification of facts conceivable from the evidence. . . . The pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted).
