On appeal, the defendant claims that the review division improperly found a date of injury different from that found by the commissioner. We affirm the decision of the compensation review division.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The following facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this appeal. On October 13,1988, the plaintiff filed a notice of claim with the workers\u2019 compensation commission alleging repetitive injury \u201cto binaural ears\u201d that occurred while employed by the defendant on August 2, 1988. Notice was sent to the commissioner and to the employer. On September 26,1990, the plaintiff filed a motion to preclude the defendant from contesting the compensability of the claim because the defendant failed to disclaim liability to pay the claim within twenty days of receiving the notice of claim from the plaintiff. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-297 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 16,1991, the commissioner denied the motion to preclude. The commissioner found that the defendant had paid medical bills for hearing loss related problems on January 15 and January 24, 1987. The commissioner further found that the \u201clatest time that [the plaintiff\u2019s] injury could have occurred was January 15,1987.\u201d On the basis of this date of injury, the notice of claim dated October 13, 1988, was untimely and invalid. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-294 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commissioner further held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>since a plaintiff cannot prevail on a motion to preclude a defense to an invalid claim, the motion to preclude must have been denied. <em>Pelletier </em>v. <em>Caron Pipe Jacking, Inc., </em>13 Conn. App. 276, 281, 535 A.2d 1321, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 805, 540 A.2d 373 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The plaintiff appealed the commissioner\u2019s finding to the compensation review division on September 20, 1991, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-301 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The review division reversed the finding by the commissioner that the date of injury was January 15, 1987. The review division stated that \u201cwhere the injury claimed, as in many hearing loss cases, results from repetitive trauma we have held the date of injury to be the last date of exposure to the incidents of repetitive trauma, i.e., the last day worked.\u201d The review division further found that the plaintiff worked after the January, 1987 injury and was working on August 2, 1988. Therefore, the review division found that the notice of claim was filed within the proper time frame and the motion to preclude should have been granted. The defendant appealed from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The review division may not disturb \u201c[t]he conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found . . . unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>207 Conn. 535, 539, 542 A.2d 1118 (1988); <em>DeBarros </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>21 Conn. App. 107, 110, 572 A.2d 69, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 808, 576 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>538 (1990). \u201c[T]he conclusions drawn by the commissioner cannot stand when they result from an incorrect application of the law.\u201d <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 59, 566 A.2d 670 (1989). \u201cOur scope of review of the actions of the review division is similarly limited. . . . The decision of the review division must be correct in law, and it must not include facts found without evidence or fail to include material facts which are admitted or undisputed.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>DeBarros </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>supra; see <em>Vanzant </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>219 Conn. 674, 677, 594 A.2d 967 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u201cWe accord great deference to the construction given to \u00a7 31-294 by the commissioner and the review division because they are both charged with its enforcement. <em>Police Department </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>225 Conn. 297, 300, 602 A.2d 1005 (1993); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>217 Conn. 110, 119-20, 584 A.2d 1172 (1991).\u201d <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 354, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993). The review division and our court have considered the type of injury alleged in the notice of claim to be accurate for the purpose of reviewing the timeliness of the claim. See <em>Pelletier </em>v. <em>Caron Pipe Jacking, Inc., </em>supra; <em>Dorsett </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>8 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 77, aff\u2019d, 23 Conn. App. 827, 584 A.2d 484 (1990), cert. denied, 218 Conn. 901, 588 A.2d 1076 (1991). The review division has repeatedly held that, as a matter of law, the date of injury of a repetitive trauma is the last day of exposure, which is usually the last date of employment. See <em>Carvalko </em>v. <em>Bassick Co., </em>9 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 258 (1991); <em>Dorsett </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>supra; <em>Delos </em>v. <em>United Illuminating, </em>7 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 111 (1989); <em>Pich </em>v. <em>Pratt &amp; Whitney, </em>4 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 163 (1988). Our courts have endorsed this construction. <em>Crochiere </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra; <em>Dorsett </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The commissioner found that the plaintiff was employed by the defendant on August 2,1988,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the notice of claim alleged a repetitive trauma. Since the plaintiff was exposed to the incidents of the trauma on August 2,1988, an injury date of August 2,1988, must be found. Therefore, the motion to preclude should have been granted by the commissioner because the filing of the claim did not violate the time limitation set forth in General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-294 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The defendant also claims that the review division lacked the ability to determine a different date of injury because the plaintiffs motion to correct the commissioner\u2019s finding was not proper. The defendant asserts that the plaintiff requested only an additional finding that the injury occurred on August 2, 1988, without requesting a deletion of the finding of injury on January 15, 1987. Further, the defendant asserts that the plaintiff failed to present evidence properly to the commissioner in support of the motion to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The record fails to indicate that these claims were raised before the review division. \u201cWe have generally taken the position that we do not sit de novo on civil cases for arguments that have not been raised in the agency whose action we are reviewing.\u201d <em>Ancona </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>217 Conn. 50, 54 n.6, 584 A.2d 454 (1991). Accordingly, we decline to address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The decision of the compensation review division of the workers\u2019 compensation commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-301b provides: \u201cAny party aggrieved by the decision of the compensation review division upon any question or questions of law arising in the proceeding may appeal the decision of the compensation review division to the appellate court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-297 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, whenever liability to pay compensation is contested by the employer, he shall file with the compensation commissioner, on or before the twentieth day after he has received a written notice of claim, a notice in accord with a form prescribed by the commissioners ....
