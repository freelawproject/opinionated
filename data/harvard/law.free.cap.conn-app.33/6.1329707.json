Johnson sustained personal injuries on April 21,1989, while a passenger in a vehicle operated by Danziger. Danziger\u2019s car was involved in a collision with a car operated by the defendant, Ida J. Shaknaitis. The writ of summons and the complaint were personally served on the defendant on April 17,1991, and were returned to the court prior to the return date. The documents were given a return day of <em>Wednesday, May 8, 1991. </em>On May 28, 1991, the defendant filed a timely motion to dismiss the action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming that the plaintiffs\u2019 use of a Wednesday for a return day violated General Statutes \u00a7 52-48<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which requires that the return day be a Tuesday.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On May 31,1991, the defendant was served with amended mesne process that was filed with the Superior Court on June 3,1991, together with \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Request for Permission to Amend Writ, Summons and Complaint,\u201d and an objection to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The defendant did not object to the request for permission to amend and filed an answer to the amended complaint together with a special defense alleging that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>barred by the applicable statute of limitations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Johnson, in her reply, denied the special defense, and, by motion dated November 20, 1991, moved for summary judgment with respect to the defendant\u2019s special defense. Johnson\u2019s reply closed the pleadings as to her and the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the count applicable to Johnson claiming that the action was time barred. The pleadings remained open as to Danziger at that time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The standards governing our review of a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment are clear. Practice Book \u00a7 384 provides that summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d See <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Carriage Lane Associates, </em>219 Conn. 772, 780-81, 595 A.2d 334 (1991); <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>219 Conn. 644, 650, 594 A.2d 952 (1991); <em>Trotta </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>26 Conn. App. 407, 409, 601 A.2d 1036 (1992). While the burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact is on the party seeking summary judgment; see <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980); \u201cthe party opposing [summary judgment] must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bassin v. Stamford, </em>26 Conn. App. 534, 537, 602 A.2d 1044 (1992). \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>dence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Strada </em>v. <em>Connecticut Newspapers, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 313, 317, 477 A.2d 1005 (1984). \u201cThe test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts. . . . <em>Trotta </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>supra, 410.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cortes </em>v. <em>Cotton, </em>31 Conn. App. 569, 573, 626 A.2d 788 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The plaintiff argues that General Statutes \u00a7 52-72<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> allows her to amend her process to reflect the correct return date. The defendant, on the other hand, argues that the plaintiff cannot amend her civil process because the return date had already passed at the time the request to amend had been filed in the trial court and, therefore, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u201cStatutory limitations . . . for the return of process implement the speedy determination of the issues involved. . . . Such time limitations on the enforcement of a right, created by statute and not existing at common law, [are] a part of the right and must be met in order to provide a court with jurisdiction to hear the cause of action. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bergin </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>3 Conn. App. 566, 569, 490 A.2d 543, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 806, 494 A.2d 903 (1985). \u201c[A]n improperly specified return date affects the court\u2019s jurisdiction. . . . [An] incorrect return date should not be viewed lightly. The defect of an improper return day is not a minor defect. Rather ... an improper return day is a defect which could not be corrected at all until [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-72 was enacted.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>18 Conn. App. 488, 495-96, 558 A.2d 1029 (1989). \u201c \u2018[I]t is the actual return of the writ to the court which really puts the action before the court and empowers the court to proceed . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Arpaia </em>v. <em>Corrone, </em>18 Conn. App. 539, 541, 559 A.2d 719 (1989). Until such time as a proper return is made to the court, it lacks jurisdiction to consider the matter. Even though a defendant in a civil action may consent to the jurisdiction of the court, that court will still not have the power to proceed with the action until a proper return of process is made to the court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">A review of <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>supra, appears initially to support the plaintiffs position. The <em>Carlson </em>court, upholding the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, recognized that \u00a7 52-72 allows for \u201c \u2018a proper amendment to civil process which has been made returnable to the wrong return day . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., 495. In <em>Carlson, </em>however, the motion to dismiss was filed before the date for return had passed, and there was no indication whether the amendment was filed before or after the return day had passed. Here, the curative amendment was filed after the return date had passed and <em>Carlson, </em>therefore, is not controlling under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">By contrast, in <em>Arpaia </em>v. <em>Corrone, </em>supra, this court held that when the return of service is not timely, it is a defect that cannot be cured by amendment. The rationale is that once the date for return has passed, there is nothing before the court that can be amended. Id., 540-41. The same rationale applies here. The plaintiff\u2019s summons in this case failed to state a correct return date. Therefore, there was no proceeding before the trial court. The plaintiff\u2019s request<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to amend the return day was filed after the date for return had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>passed. The plaintiffs request attempted to amend an action that was not properly before the trial court and must fail. <em>Concept Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>31 Conn. App. 793, 627 A.2d 471, cert. granted, 227 Conn. 913, 632 A.2d 689 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The trial court\u2019s judgment rendered against Johnson for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-9\"> The trial court\u2019s decision, on January 22,1992, did not address the merits of the plaintiff Rita Johnson\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding no authority in Practice Book \u00a7 379 for a party to move for summary judgment as to a special defense. Without commenting on the trial court\u2019s reasoning, we recognize that the trial court\u2019s decision granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on the claim of statute of limitations effectively denied Johnson\u2019s motion for summary judgment and we will treat it as such. See <em>Plouffe </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., </em>160 Conn. 482, 487, 280 A.2d 359 (1971). At oral argument, both parties conceded that the trial court\u2019s decision granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment encompassed a denial of Johnson\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b33-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-584 provides: \u201cNo action to recover damages for injury to the person, or to real or personal property, caused by negligence, or by reckless or wanton misconduct, or by malpractice of a physician, surgeon, dentist, podiatrist, chiropractor, hospital or sanatorium, shall be brought but within two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>discovered, and except that no such action may be brought more than three years from the date of the act or omission complained of, except that a counterclaim may be interposed in any such action any time before the pleadings in such action are finally closed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b34-7\"> An appearance was filed by the defendant on May 9, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b34-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-48 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Process in civil actions, including transfers and applications for relief or removal, but not including summary process actions, brought to the superior court may be made returnable <em>on any Tuesday </em>in any month. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b34-10\"> Within the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss she argues that her \u201cMotion to Dismiss should be granted unless plaintiffs amend the return day and reserve the defendant with the amended process.\u201d To the extent that defendant\u2019s argument encompasses a waiver claim, in light of our holding that the issue involves subject matter jurisdiction, that argument is inappropriate. \u201c \u2018Subject matter jurisdiction is the power of the court to hear and determine cases . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 764-65, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993).
