HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b247-17\">After a full trial, a jury found Melody Thomas guilty of conspiring to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, and of the use of a federal communication facility, a telephone, to commit a felony, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). On appeal, she challenges only her sentence. She contends that the sentencing guidelines are unconstitutional; that she was entitled to a reduction to her offense level because she accepted responsibility for her crimes; that she was entitled to a reduction in her offense level because she was a minor participant in her crimes; and that the district judge incorrectly computed the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy. Finding no error in the sentence imposed, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b247-19\">At trial, the government sought to prove, and the jury found, that Thomas had participated in a conspiracy to distribute approximately one kilogram of cocaine. She had used a telephone to arrange a sale of the cocaine to Art Vela, an undercover drug enforcement agent. Thomas defended on the ground that she had been coerced, by her boyfriend\u2019s death threats, to commit the crime. She also maintained that, for some time during the conspiracy\u2019s operation, she was unaware that the white substance possessed by the conspirators was cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-20\">Thomas was convicted, and sentenced to sixty-three months incarceration \u2014 a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range applicable to an offense level of 26 and a criminal history in category I \u2014 on the conspiracy count. She received a concurrent sentence on the other count.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Thomas challenges the constitutionality of the sentencing guidelines. Her argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Mistretta v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Thomas appeals the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of cocaine implicated by her conspiracy conviction. <em>See </em>Guideline 2D1.4. She contends that because the conspiracy was incapable of producing the quantity of cocaine that it had negotiated to supply, the district court erred by using that agreement to find that the conspiracy involved one kilogram of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The district court\u2019s findings about the quantity of drugs implicated by the crime are factual findings, protected by the clearly erroneous rule. The district court may consider a variety of evidence, not limited to amounts seized or specified in the indictment, in making its findings. <em>See United States v. Sarasti, </em>869 F.2d 805, 806 (5th Cir.1989). The guidelines provide, in \u00a7 2D1.4, that a defendant convicted of an incomplete conspiracy will be sentenced as if the object of the conspiracy had been completed. Application Note 1 to that guideline states that drug weights used by conspirators in negotiations should be used to calculate the drug weight applicable in the sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">In this case, the judge rejected Thomas\u2019s account of the conspiracy, believing instead the account contained in the presentence report. This factual finding suffices to support the judge\u2019s determination of the drug weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">In any event, however, Thomas\u2019s argument misunderstands Guideline 2D1.4. Application Note 1 to that guideline, upon which Thomas relies, says that where \u201cthe defendant was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount the court may depart and impose a sentence lower than the sentence that would otherwise result.\u201d This suggestion does not alter the offense level, but instead proposes that the sentencing judge consider a discretionary departure. Thomas\u2019s argument, therefore, amounts to a claim that the sentencing judge should have made a downward departure. We will uphold a sentencing judge\u2019s refusal to depart from the guidelines unless the refusal was in violation of law. <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 139 (5th Cir.1989). No law would compel a departure in this case, even were the facts as Thomas contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">Thomas contends that she accepted responsibility for her crimes, and that the trial court should have allowed her a two-point reduction to her offense level. <em>See </em>Guideline 3E1.1. Whether or not a defendant has accepted responsibility for his crime is a factual question. The district court\u2019s determination of that question, like its findings with respect to manager status, <em>United States v. Mejia-Orosco, </em>868 F.2d 807 (5th Cir.1989) and minimal participant status, <em>Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, enjoys the protection of the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. Because the trial court\u2019s assessment of a defendant\u2019s contrition will depend heavily on credibility assessments, the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard will nearly always sustain the judgment of the district court in this area. Indeed, the guidelines specifically state that \u201c[t]he sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. For this reason, the determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review and should not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.\u201d Application Note 5, \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">The trial judge expressly found at the sentencing hearing that Thomas had never, even after conviction, accepted responsibility for her crimes. The judge said, \u201chaving presented the issue of coercion to the jury, and the jury having found that she was, in fact not coerced, she still doesn\u2019t accept that finding, nor does she accept other matters which I think she clearly ought to do if she wanted to accept responsibility, such as ... that she knew what was going on was a cocaine transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>tion, not something with white powder.\u201d These findings are not \u201cwithout foundation,\u201d and so are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Thomas also contends that the sentencing guidelines, and their application to her case, exact a penalty for her exercise of her constitutional right to a trial. She argues that her insistence that a jury pass upon her claim of innocence cannot be a valid ground for denying her a shorter sentence. This argument is irrelevant, for Guideline \u00a7 3E1.1, on its face and as applied by the district judge, authorizes reductions to the sentences of those who are tried as well as reductions to the sentences of those who plead guilty. Guideline \u00a7 3El.l(b) reads, \u201cA defendant may be given consideration under this section without regard to whether his conviction is based upon a guilty plea or a finding of guilt by court or jury or the practical certainty of conviction at trial.\u201d Of course, accepting responsibility for a crime entails admitting the crime, while trial strategies predicated upon a claim of innocence entail denial of the crime. A defendant who maintains her innocence at trial, and then purports to accept responsibility afterward, may have a difficult time persuading the trial judge that her later position is sincere rather than merely convenient. Cases where the convicted defendant succeeds may be rare as a factual matter, but they are not barred by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In this case, however, the trial judge not only questioned the sincerity of Thomas\u2019s post-trial declarations, but found that those declarations themselves manifested a denial of responsibility. The trial judge said explicitly, \u201cThis has nothing to do with her going to trial in the case ... I don\u2019t assess her any additional sentence for exercising her right to go to trial.\u201d The trial judge need not have made these observations expressly; an assessment of the defendant\u2019s post-trial credibility would, by itself, have sufficed to provide the requisite foundation for the judge\u2019s conclusions. But the judge\u2019s comments underscore the inapplicability of Thomas\u2019s constitutional argument. <em>See also United States v. White, </em>869 F.2d 822 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The judge rejected the probation officer\u2019s proposed finding that Thomas was a manager within the meaning of \u00a7 3B1.1, but also rejected Thomas\u2019s own contention that she was a minor participant within the meaning of \u00a7 3B1.2. Thomas appeals the district court\u2019s finding with respect to minor participant status.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">At the sentencing hearing, the district judge explicitly found that Thomas was not a minor participant in her crimes. This finding is factual in nature, and we will not disturb it unless it is clearly erroneous. In this case, the record clearly supports the trial judge\u2019s finding. Thomas\u2019s crime involved a significant quantity of a dangerous drug. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial judge. <em>See Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">For the reasons stated, the sentence imposed by the district court is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
