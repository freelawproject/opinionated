Bonsai, Senior District Judge of the Southern District of New York, is sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b268-19\">TONE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b268-20\">This is an appeal from an order of the district court affirming the bankruptcy judge\u2019s dismissal of a third-party complaint for lack of jurisdiction. We do not reach the issue of the correctness of the order appealed from, because we are without jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-21\">Appellants, Wayne and Bettie Fair, and Licek Potato Chip Company entered into an agreement, the terms of which are not clear from the record but which seems to have provided for distribution of potato chips by the Fairs. Soon thereafter Licek filed a petition under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 701, et seq. At the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>meeting of creditors, Licek presented a proposed plan of arrangement. The Fairs filed an acceptance and a proof of claim for $35,000, based on a note Licek had executed and delivered to them. The bankruptcy judge then entered an order confirming the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Subsequently Licek and the receiver filed a complaint in the bankruptcy proceeding seeking a declaration that the transaction between Licek and the Fairs was a loan transaction and that the Fairs\u2019 claim was unsecured and subject to the provisions of the plan of arrangement, and asking that the Fairs be required to deliver to Licek and the receiver certain vehicle titles involved in the Licek-Fairs transaction. The Fairs answered, alleging that the transaction \u201cwas for the purchase of routes and equipment from the debtor and was not a loan transaction.\u201d The bankruptcy judge allowed the Fairs\u2019 claim as an unsecured claim and later entered an order approving the final report of the receiver and closing the case as to all matters except \u201cthe claim of Wayne H. Fair and Bettie A. Fair against the debtor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The Fairs then filed a \u201ccross-complaint and third-party complaint\u201d naming Licek as cross-defendant and the appellees herein as third-party defendants and alleging as follows: Appellees First National Bank of Decatur and Jonann, Robert, and Charles Lyon wrongfully induced the Fairs to purchase a Licek distributorship from the Lyons using $35,000 borrowed from the bank for that purpose without informing the Fairs of the precarious financial position of Licek and its obligation to the bank in excess of $200,000. Appellees William Walker and Patrick Nolan, who subsequently purchased Licek in the course of the Chapter XI proceedings, promised to make the Fairs whole in the transaction. Appel-lee Acton Company purchased Licek from Walker and Nolan subject to the claim of the Fairs. The relief sought was the return of the $35,000 to the Fairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">On motion of appellees, the bankruptcy judge dismissed for lack of jurisdiction \u201cthe third-party complaint,\u201d meaning that part of the Fairs\u2019 pleading that sought relief against appellees. The record before us contains no ruling on the claim which the pleading asserted against Licek. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy judge\u2019s order. Although no determination and direction under Rule 54(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., was entered, the Fairs filed a notice of appeal from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Appellant\u2019s argument in support of our jurisdiction is based primarily on \u00a7 24(a), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 47(a), which is made applicable to Chapter XI by \u00a7 316, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 716. 8 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, </em>13.30[2.1] at 276 &amp; n.5 (14th ed. 1978); 9 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>H 206.02 at 1205 &amp; n.9 (2d ed. 1975). Section 24(a) grants the courts of appeals jurisdiction over both final and interlocutory orders in \u201cproceedings in bankruptcy\u201d but over only final orders in \u201ccontroversies arising in proceedings in bankruptcy.\u201d 2 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, </em>124.04[2] at 715 (14th ed. 1976); 9 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, supra, </em>$ 110.19[5] at 222; 16 Wright, Miller, Cooper &amp; Gressman, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 3926 at 103 &amp; n.6 (1977). For the distinction between the quoted terms, <em>see In re Durensky, </em>519 F.2d 1024, 1027 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>see generally 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, </em>$$ 24.12-24.36.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">However difficult it may sometimes be to apply this often criticized distinction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the days of which are now numbered,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is readily determinable that, at the very least, the dispute here is not a proceeding in bankruptcy; for it concerns the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over a claim by an adverse claimant against third-parties and is not an administrative matter presented in the ordinary course of the administration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the bankrupt\u2019s estate. <em>Accord, United Kingdom Mutual Steamship Assurance Association v. Liman, </em>418 F.2d 9 (2d Cir. 1969); <em>In re Christ\u2019s Church of the Golden Rule, 172 </em>F.2d 523 (9th Cir. 1949). We need not decide whether the dispute is a controversy arising in a proceeding in bankruptcy, as were those in the <em>United Kingdom </em>and <em>Christ\u2019s Church </em>cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because even if it is we have no jurisdiction unless the order appealed from is final. Whether the dispute is a \u201ccontroversy\u201d under \u00a7 24(a) or is neither a \u201cproceeding\u201d nor a \u201ccontroversy\u201d under that section and hence outside its purview and subject to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the order is appealable only if it is final. <em>See </em>9 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, supra, </em>\u00b6110.19[5] at 222 &amp; n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">We turn therefore to the question of whether the order appealed from, in which the district court affirmed the bankruptcy judge\u2019s order dismissing the third-party claim for lack of jurisdiction, is final. An order dismissing a third-party complaint but leaving another claim pending is a paradigm of an interlocutory order subject to Rule 54(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. <em>E. g., Courembis v. Independence Avenue Drug Fair, Inc., </em>115 U.S.App.D.C. 7, 8, 316 F.2d 658, 659 (1963). Rule 54(b) is made applicable in Chapter XI proceedings by Bankruptcy Rules 11-61(a) and 754. The Fairs contend, however, that the dismissal of their third-party claim was a final order because it adjudicated the rights of all the parties before the district judge on the appeal from the bankruptcy judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">This argument rests on a misconception of the jurisdictional scheme in bankruptcy cases. We note initially that orders of the bankruptcy judge need not be final to be appealable to the district judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This does not mean, however, that the latter\u2019s ruling on an interlocutory appeal is appealable to the court of appeals,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for our jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>tion is, with exceptions not applicable here, limited to review of final orders of the district court in bankruptcy cases, as it is in other cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The district judge\u2019s order in the case at bar did not finally decide all the issues between all the parties. Undecided issues remained before the bankruptcy judge and hence before the district court. In the absence, therefore, of an appropriate determination and direction under Rule 54(b), the order was not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The Fairs argue that the district court\u2019s entry of a stay pending disposition on appeal implied a determination that no just reason for delaying appeal existed. Rule 54(b), however, requires that the \u201cdetermination that there is no just reason for delay\u201d and the \u201cdirection for the entry of judgment\u201d both be \u201cexpress.\u201d These requirements not having been satisfied, we are without jurisdiction to hear this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Appellants are, of course, free to seek an appropriate determination and direction from the district court, in compliance with Rule 54(b), that would make the ruling appealable. If the district court sees fit to grant such a request and to enter judgment accordingly, and a notice of appeal from that judgment is filed, the new appeal will be considered by this panel on the briefs and oral arguments already presented.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-6\">. <em>E. g., In re Brissette, </em>561 F.2d 779, 781 (9th Cir. 1977); 9 <em>Moore's Federal Practice, supra, </em>11110.19[5].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\">. The distinction is eliminated by the Bankruptcy Reform Act, Pub.L. No. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549, 2667 (1978), adding \u00a7 1293 to Title 28. Under that provision only final orders of the trial court in bankruptcy matters are appeala-ble to the courts of appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-5\">. Here the dispute over jurisdiction arose between adverse claimants and third-parties who the claimants allege fraudulently induced them to enter into the original transaction. This does \u201cpresent distinct and separable issues\u201d but not \u201cbetween the trustee and adverse claimants\u201d and not \u201cconcerning the right and title to the bankrupt\u2019s estate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\">. The parties do not contend that jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292. The order appealed from does not fall within any of the categories of \u00a7 1292(a). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(2) refers only to the \u201cordinary equity receiver,\u201d 7B <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>fl 1292(a)(2) (2d ed. 1978), and not to bankruptcy receiverships, 2 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, </em>H 24.27[2.1] at 726.1 n.7. Section 1292(b) does not apply because the district judge did not state in writing that his order satisfied the criteria listed therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\">. Section 2(a)(10) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 11(a)(10), gives the district court jurisdiction to \u201cconsider records, findings, and orders certified to the judges by referees, and confirm, modify, or reverse such findings and orders, or return such records with instructions for further proceedings . . .\u201d Neither this section, nor \u00a7 39, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 67, which prescribes the procedure for review of a bankruptcy judge\u2019s order and allows review as of right, nor the bankruptcy rules governing appeal to the district court, <em>see </em>Bankruptcy Rules 801-814, nor any other applicable provision contain a finality requirement. The Act and Rules place no limit on the jurisdiction of the district court to review interlocutory orders of the bankruptcy judge. <em>Willyerd v. Buildex Co., </em>463 F.2d 996, 1001 (6th Cir. 1972); <em>Sulmeyer </em>v. <em>Pfohlman, </em>329 F.2d 915, 917 (9th Cir. 1964); 2A <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, </em>II 39.21 (14th ed. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"ay-dedup-0\">Interlocutory orders of the bankruptcy judge will also be reviewable at the trial court level under the Bankruptcy Reform Act, Pub.L. No. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549 (1978). Under \u00a7 201 of that Act, 92 Stat. 2659 (1978), which will become 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 160, appellate panels consisting of three bankruptcy judges may be designated \u201cto hear appeals from judgments, orders, and decrees of the bankruptcy court [created in the new 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, Pub.L.
