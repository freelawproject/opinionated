Upon the United States importation, a duty on the fabric was assessed under TSUS item 338.30 as \u201cWoven fabrics, of manmade fibers * * * Other.\u201d Appellant, in an appeal of this classification to the Customs Court, contended that the processing in Canada constituted an alteration within the scope of TSUS item 806.20. Under this proposed classification, a duty is imposed only on the value of the alterations performed in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>\n<em>Customs Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">In its opinion, the Customs Court summarized the Canadian processing steps as follows: <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-6\">The essential facts concerning the processing operation in Canada are not in dispute. The domestic loom product is exported as <em>greige goods </em>in rolls of approximately 800 to 1,000 yards in length and approximately 118 to 119V2 inches in width. It is returned as <em>finished fabric </em>suitable for manufacture into curtains, folded over double, widthwise, and cut in lengths of approximately 60 to 80 yards. In Canada the greige goods are subjected to a number of operations, consisting of heat-setting, chemical-scouring, dyeing and heat-setting a second time during which finishing chemicals consisting of melamine resin for anti-creasing characteristics, an antistatic chemical, and a softener chemical are applied to the fabric in this final stage. The initial heat-setting treatment serves to stabilize the fabric through the elimination of shrinkage. Scouring removes sizing and impurities from the fabric. And the second heat-setting treatment induces a permanent adherence of the finishing chemicals to the fabric during the drying stage of the processing. The finished fabric is then inspected, folded and shipped back to the United States. [Footnotes omitted. 81 Cust.Ct. at 455 F.Supp. at 619.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">Upon considering the testimony and exhibits proffered during the trial, the court concluded that the greige goods and finished fabrics differed in name; that the finished fabrics were softer and more full than the greige goods; that the finished fabrics were sold for $1.50 to $1.60 per yard more than the greige goods; that the greige goods and finished fabrics differed in size; and that the greige goods and finished fabrics were sold to different classes of buyers and in different commercial markets. ' Citing <em>A. F. Burstrom v. United States, </em>44 CCPA 27, C.A.D. 631 (1957), the court held the processing in Canada did not merely amount to alterations under 806.20 because the imported finished fabrics were not the same articles as the exported greige goods since they differed in name, value, appearance, size, shape and use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-10\">The court also relied on <em>Burstrom, </em>supra, to dispose of appellant\u2019s argument that the Canadian processing merely resulted in an alteration of the goods because both the exported greige goods and imported finished fabrics were woven fabrics of man-made fibers and were classifiable under the same tariff item, i. e., item 338.30. The court distinguished its holding in <em>Amity Fabrics, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>305 F.Supp. 4, 43 Cust.Ct. 64, C.D. 2104 (1959), that dyeing of fabric is an alteration, by noting that, in the instant case, the Canadian processing resulted in other significant changes. The court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-11\">The court is of the opinion that where, as here, foreign processing of an exported article, to whatever degree, produces such changes in the performance characteristics of the exported article as to alter its subsequent handling and uses over that which earlier prevailed, the resultant product is of necessity a new and different article. [81 Cust.Ct. at 2, 455 F.Supp. at 622.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-12\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"axc-dedup-1\">In support of his alternative classification, appellant cites the following definition of the phrase \u201crepairs or alterations\u201d from the Treasury Regulations in effect at the time the entries in issue were <em>filed:</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>The term \u201crepairs or alterations\u201d shall be held to mean restoration, change, addition, renovation, cleaning, or other treatment which does not destroy the identity of the article exported or create a new or different article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">According to appellant, this definition means that processing which effects some change or addition to an article can be considered an \u201calteration\u201d as long as the article remains basically the same. Appellant argues that the articles in question remained basically the same because both the greige goods and finished fabrics were man-made fabrics of polyester fiber and, thus, the Canadian processing steps did not change the essential characteristics of the fabrics.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">Appellant further contends a reasonable interpretation of 806.20 contemplates changes in articles which result in advancements in value or improvements in condition and, therefore, the mere fact that the Canadian processing resulted in changes in name, appearance, value, size, shape and use does not require a determination that such processing did not comprise alterations within the meaning of 806.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">\n<em>Appellee\u2019s Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aau3\">In its brief, appellee cites testimony in the record supporting the Custom Court\u2019s determination that the greige goods differed from the finished fabrics in name, value, appearance, size, shape and use. Ap-pellee also alleges that the Canadian processing limited the number of potential uses of the greige goods to the single use for the finished fabric, i. e., as curtain material. Further, appellee agrees with the Customs Court\u2019s conclusion that where, as here, the foreign processing has created a new article, the fact that the article as exported and the article as imported are classifiable under the same TSUS item is immaterial. Finally, appellee notes that to extend this argument of appellant to its logical conclusion would necessarily mean that had the Canadian processing transformed the fabrics into curtains, wearing apparel or the like, such processing would also be mere alterations because these articles would also be comprised of man-made fabrics of polyester fabric.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\">Appellant correctly contends that simply because intermediate foreign processing of articles of U.S. origin that are subsequently reimported into the United States results in differences in name, value, appearance, size, shape and use for the articles does not require a conclusion that the foreign processing does not comprise \u201calterations\u201d under TSUS item 806.20. This is self evident from this tariff provision which levies a duty only on the <em>increase in value </em>due to the alterations. Similarly, to hold that alterations cannot change the name, appearance, size, shape and use of an article unreasonably restricts the scope of item 806.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-12\">Being correct on this one point, however, does not save appellant\u2019s case because, as noted in <em>Burstrom, </em>supra at 81, a \u201cdistinction which must be made is between the terms \u2018repairs,\u2019 \u2018alterations\u2019 and \u2018processing.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-13\">That such a distinction has been recognized by Congress is apparent from the Customs Simplification Act of 1954, ch. 1213, Pub.L.No.768, 68 Stat. 1137, which extended to certain foreign processing oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>ations, the tariff treatment previously accorded to repairs and alterations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The reasons for this amendment were noted by this court in <em>United States v. Douglas Aircraft Co., </em>510 F.2d 1387, 1390, 62 CCPA 53, 57, C.A.D. 1145 (1975) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-5\">[I]t appears that, in the case of articles sent by U.S. manufacturers along the Canadian border to Canada for processing and return to the United States for additional processing, duty was imposed on not only the value of the Canadian processing but also on the value of the article in its original exported form. Such treatment was based on subparagraph 1615(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the 1938 Act, with interpretation by the Customs Service of \u201crepairs\u201d and \u201calterations\u201d being limited chiefly to those of a mechanical nature on equipment such as locomotives and buses. It was objected that imposing duty on the value of the article in its original exported form constituted a duty on American material and American labor. <em>Hearings on H.R. 5106 Before the House Comm, on Ways and Means, </em>83d Cong., 1st Sess., 199-200 (1953).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">In addition to that observation, two things are evident from the very language <em>(see </em>supra note 6) of the provision. First, it applies to <em>intermediate </em>processing operations which are performed abroad as <em>a matter of course </em>in the preparation of certain articles. Second, this advantageous tariff treatment for regularly performed intermediate foreign processing is limited to <em>articles made of metal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">It follows generally from these two points that repairs and alterations are</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-10\">made to <em>completed articles </em>and do not include intermediate processing operations which are performed as a matter of course in the preparation or the manufacture of finished articles. In the instant situation, the operations performed in Canada comprise further processing steps which are performed on unfinished goods and which lead to completed articles, i. e., the finished fabrics, and, therefore, the processing cannot be considered alterations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">This view is consistent with this court\u2019s previous interpretation of the term \u201calterations\u201d in <em>United States </em>v. <em>The J. D. Richardson Company, </em>36 C.C.P.A. 15, C.A.D. 390 (1948). At issue in that case was the question of whether the processing performed in Canada on a United States origin metal wheel rim resulting in flanged rims for importation into the United States constituted \u201calterations\u201d under paragraph 1615(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-12\">The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-13\">It clearly appears from the record that the articles exported to Canada were not parts of machines but were manufacturers of metal. It is true that they had been so processed as to be dedicated to the use of making rims for the T-26 tank. However, they were not completed parts but, on the contrary, required the manufacturing processes hereinbefore referred to in order to complete them as \u201cflanged\u201d rims for their intended use. Broadly, it may be said, as seems to have been held by the trial court, that the term \u201calterations\u201d of articles means any manufacturing process to which articles may be subjected. <em>We are of opinion, however, that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number><em>Congress did not intend by the term \u201cal</em>terations\u2019\u2019\u2019 <em>in paragraph 1615(g), supra, to mean that uncompleted articles, such as those here involved, manufactured in the United States or imported into the United States, could be exported to a foreign country and there manufactured into completed articles such as those in the case at bar, and when returned to the United States, be subject only to duties on the so-called \u201calterations\u201dprovided for in paragraph 1615(g), supra. [Id. </em>at 17. Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">The ease law also includes two examples of foreign processing which merely involved alterations to finished goods. In <em>Wilbur G. Hallauer v. United States, </em>40 CCPA 197, C.A.D. 518 (1953), this court determined that the cleaning, grading, wrapping and packing in Canada of American-grown apples constituted \u201calterations\u201d within the meaning of the then applicable paragraph 1615(g). Appellant had claimed that no duty should be imposed because \u201capples went out and apples came back.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201. Although the court did not dispute the fact that the apples were complete when exported to Canada, it concluded that the Canadian operations had converted the articles from bulk apples to a different unit of merchandise, packaged apples, and that a duty could be imposed on the resultant increase in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">In a case of particular relevance to the instant appeal, the Customs Court in <em>Amity Fabrics, Inc. v. United States, </em>supra, held that the dyeing of certain fabrics comprised an alteration under paragraph 1615(g). In that case, velveteen fabric had been dyed a particular color and placed on sale in the United States. The color proved to be unpopular and, as a result, the fabric was exported to Italy, dyed black, and then imported back into the United States and placed on sale. The court concluded that this processing was an alteration of an already finished fabric to place it in a more marketable condition without either destroying its identity or creating a new article.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">In the instant situation, the dyeing and numerous other processing steps are all necessarily undertaken to initially produce the finished fabric and, thus, a result different from that in <em>Amity, </em>supra, must be reached.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">Finally, we find no merit in appellant\u2019s argument that because both the greige goods and finished fabrics are man-made fabrics of polyester fiber and would be classifiable under the same TSUS item, the Canadian processing merely comprised alterations. The irrelevance of such common classification was noted by this court in <em>Burstrom, </em>supra at 30, when we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq0\">Appellant attempts to distinguish the instant case from <em>United States v. The J. D. Richardson Company, </em>36 C.C.P.A. (Customs) 15, C.A.D. 390. The court there held that unflanged rims or flat bands exported from this country and reimported after being flanged by three pressing operations, had been changed to new articles and had not merely been altered. Here the foreign processing has likewise created new articles and the law of the <em>Richardson </em>case applies. Appellant argues that the fact that the exported ingots and the imported slabs, in the instant case, would be dutiable under the same paragraph distinguishes this case from the <em>Richardson </em>case where the exported and imported wares were subject to different duties. This difference is immaterial where the foreign processing has created a new article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">Further, to follow appellant\u2019s reasoning could lead to the anomalous result that all articles made from the finished fabric would be commonly classified because they would also be man-made fabrics of polyester fiber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">The Canadian processing operations did not comprise alterations under item 806.20 TSUS. The judgment of the Customs Court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">.
