Plaintiff Robert H. Cook, a United States citizen, is a sculptor, long-resident in Rome, Italy, who works in bronze.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Essentially, he uses a lost wax process, making a model of the sculpture in beeswax reinforced by strips of bamboo. The model is then taken to an outside foundry where it is cast in bronze. Mr. Cook creates his sculptures in his studio in Rome, and then sells them on a noncommissioned or a commissioned basis, primarily to persons in the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the two taxable years now in question, 1970 and 1971, plaintiff had both commissioned and noncommissioned sales; the commissioned work was a large bronze sculpture, commissioned in 1970 by Mr. Jack Rudin for placement in New York and delivered there in 1971, for a total price (including foundry expenses) of $65,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>For both 1970 and 1971 taxpayer\u2019s income tax returns excluded part of his income as foreign earned income under section 911 of the Code. On audit, the Internal Revenue Service disallowed portions of the claimed foreign income exclusion and increased plaintiff\u2019s tax liability. The Service made its recomputation mainly on the basis that Mr. Cook was not entitled to a section 911 foreign \u201cearned income\u201d exclusion for his noncommissioned sales in the United States (which were sold to purchasers in this country, usually through art galleries, after full completion of the sculpture in Italy). The Service\u2019s position at that time was that these noncommissioned sales were sales of tangible products, rather than the result of personal labor or services.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Taxpayer paid the additional amounts found due by the Service, and then filed timely refund claims for both years. These claims stated that in light of the Tax Court\u2019s decision in <em>Tobey v. Commissioner, </em>60 T.C. 227 (1973) <em>acq. </em>1979-10 I.R.B. at 6,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> taxpayer\u2019s returns for the respective years should have been accepted as filed. Th\u00e9 refund claims were disallowed (except for a small mathematical adjustment for 1970) and this suit was then brought. Both parties have moved for summary judgment, on the basis of stipulated facts and affidavits, and we believe that the case can properly be disposed of on the materials we now have before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">At the center of the case is section 911(a), providing for the exclusion of foreign income if three general conditions are satisfied: (1) taxpayer must be either a bona fide foreign resident [\u00a7 911(a)(1)] or physically present abroad for 510 days [\u00a7 911(a)(2)]; (2) the income received must be \u201cfrom sources without the United States\u201d; (3) the income received must constitute \u201cearned income attributable to services performed\u201d during foreign residency.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties have stipulated that taxpayer was a bona fide resident of Italy under section 911(a)(1) and also agree that, under the then-existing provisions of section 911(c), taxpayer was entitled to an exclusion of up to $25,000 of foreign income. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 911(c)(1)(B) (1970). Moreover, contrary to the Service\u2019s position on the audit, the Government does not now contest the application to plaintiff of the holding in <em>Tobey v. Commissioner, supra, </em>that both taxpayer\u2019s commissioned and noncommis-sioned income is earned income under section 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>The currently disputed issues are these: (a) Is taxpayer correct that he is entitled to calculate his net earned income and then deduct his foreign income exclusion of $25,-000? (b) Is the defendant right that a large part of plaintiffs income from his work was not \u201cfrom sources without the United States\u201d? (c) Is taxpayer bound, because of the nature and wording of his refund claims, by the figures and factual statements set forth in his returns for the two taxable years? and (d) Was capital a \u201cmaterial income-producing factor\u201d for plaintiff\u2019s income? In the subsequent sections of this opinion, we answer the first three of these questions, and find it unnecessary to delve into the fourth; we also compute, on the basis of our analysis of the substantive issues taken together with the facts which have to be accepted on these motions, the amount of the taxes owed for each of the two taxable years.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In claiming an exclusion under section 911(a), taxpayer argues that he is entitled to exclude his foreign source income from <em>net </em>income. Plaintiff would subtract his business expenses from gross receipts to arrive at a figure labeled \u201cSchedule C Net Earned Income.\u201d From this net income figure taxpayer would then subtract his excludable foreign income, without any reduction for expenses allocable to the foreign income.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">We reject this attempt to compute an exclusion from net income as contrary to the statute, as it has been implemented by regulations, revenue rulings, and case law. Section 911(a) begins with the statement that \u201c[t]he following items shall not be included <em>in gross income </em>and shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle * * * \u201d (emphasis added). This language, together with the last sentence of section 911(a) (precluding deductions from gross income when such deductions are \u201cproperly allocable to * * * amounts excluded from gross income under this subsection\u201d) tends to suggest at least for individual taxpayers, that the section 911 exclusion is to be computed on the basis of gross income.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">The tilt of the statutory language is strongly reinforced by the interpretative regulations, in effect since 1963, relating to individuals. <em>See </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.911-2(a)(1) (\u201camounts constituting earned income * * shall be excluded from the <em>gross income </em>of an individual * * * \u201d) (emphasis added); <em>id. </em>at (a)(4) (specifying the maximum amount to be \u201cexcluded from the <em>gross income </em>of an individual\u201d) (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Rev.Rul. 75-86, 1975-1 Cum.Bull. 242 (example number one). The cases which have discussed the section 911 exclusion for individuals also calculate the exclusion from the taxpayers\u2019s gross income. <em>See, e. g., Brewster v. Commissioner, </em>154 U.S.App.D.C. 30, 473 F.2d 160 (1972) (per curiam), <em>aff\u2019g </em>55 T.C. 251 (1970); <em>Tobey v. Commissioner, </em>60 T.C. 227 (1973); <em>Brewster v. Commissioner, </em>67 T.C. 352 (1976), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 77-2010 (D.C.Cir. Nov. 14, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">Against this statutory inference reinforced by consistent administrative and judicial interpretation taxpayer relies on a partnership case, <em>Vogt v. United States, </em>537 F.2d 405, 210 Ct.Cl. 246 (1976), to support his theory that the foreign income should be excluded from net income. Particularly, plaintiff quotes language from <em>Vogt </em>which is said to hold that earned income (for purposes of section 911) is not necessarily equivalent to gross income and he argues that a revenue ruling here relied on by the Government, Rev.Rul. 75-86, 1975-1 Cum.Bull. 242, was specifically rejected in <em>Vogt. </em>Taxpayer ignores two salient features of <em>Vogt </em>that distinguish it from this case. First, that decision involved partners and the suggestion that section 911(a) does not literally compel use in every instance of gross income as the basis for the exclusion was made in the course of an analysis showing that the statutory language was not so clear as to invalidate a long-standing administrative interpretation allowing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>foreign earned income exclusions of a partner to be based on his share of the partnership net profit. <em>See Vogt v. United States, </em>537 F.2d 405, 409-17, 210 Ct.Cl. 246, 252-65 (1976). The whole rationale of the <em>Vogt </em>opinion was tied to the lengthy existence of that administrative construction for foreign-based partners. Second, <em>Vogt </em>parsed the language of section 911 and the post-litigation interpretation contained in Rev.Rul. 75-86 only in terms of partnership income, not individual returns. The decision in <em>Brewster v. Commissioner, </em>154 U.S.App.D.C. 30, 473 F.2d 160 (1972) (per curiam), was specifically distinguished in <em>Vogt </em>as involving an individual, not a partnership return. 537 F.2d at 415, 210 Ct.Cl. at 262-63; <em>see Brewster v. Commissioner, </em>67 T.C. 352, 358 n.7 (1976), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 77-2010 (D.C.Cir. Nov. 14, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Here, taxpayer is clearly reporting on an individual basis, and has not shown (or even argued) that the Service had any longstanding administrative policy allowing individuals to exclude foreign Source income from a net figure. The contrary is clearly true, and there is therefore no reason to reject the facial suggestion of the statute that gross income is to be the starting point.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">A precondition for a section 911 exclusion is that the income received be \u201cfrom sources without the United States.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 911(a)(1) &amp; (2). Sections 861-864 of the Code provide general rules for determining the source of income, and the regulations interpreting section 911 specifically refer to these provisions for proper allocation of income sources. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.911-2(c)(4) (1971). Both parties accept reference to the sourcing provisions, but dispute vigorously whether the artwork sold by Cook constituted \u201clabor or personal services\u201d to be governed by the sourcing provisions of sections 861-862 (plaintiff\u2019s view) or whether the artwork was a sale of \u201cpersonal property\u201d to be sourced under section 863 (defendant\u2019s view). The Government insists that taxpayer\u2019s sales of sculpture, both commissioned and noncommissioned works, constituted sales of \u201cpersonal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">We agree with plaintiff that the rationale of <em>Tobey v. Commissioner, </em>60 T.C. 227 (1973) (reviewed by the court) <em>acq. </em>1979-10 I.R.B. at 6, compels the conclusion that Mr. Cook\u2019s sales be deemed \u201cpersonal services\u201d under the sourcing rules. <em>Tobey </em>did not directly deal with the proper sourcing of that artist\u2019s income,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but only with whether the sale of the work (primarily paintings in that instance) constituted \u201cearned income\u201d under section 911. However, in assessing what was \u201cearned income\u201d <em>Tobey </em>considered and rejected the Commissioner\u2019s argument that Mark Tobey\u2019s art work was a \u201cproduct,\u201d not within the definition of \u201cearned income.\u201d The Tax Court noted that section 911 was intended to allow the exclusion of foreign source income derived from personal labor, even if the immediate source of gain was derived from a product incorporating that labor. 60 T.C. at 231-32, 235 &amp; n.9. \u201cIf the taxpayer\u2019s personal efforts result in the creation of personal property, the gain derived from the sale of that property is properly categorized as \u2018earned income.\u2019 \u201d 60 T.C. at 235. The court summarized its position by stating: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>See generally, Note, </em>Robida &amp; Tobey: <em>The New Test for Section 911 \u201cEarned Income,\u201d </em>27 Tax Law. 493, 498-500 (1974) <em>(Tobey </em>clearly rejected the \u201cproduct test\u201d for determining earned income).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>In this case the respondent [the Commissioner] has created a colorful fabric of definition and illustrations to enhance his argument that petitioner is making \u201cproducts\u201d rather than producing \u201cearned income\u201d by his personal efforts in creating his paintings. We view this argument as untenable. * * * * The concept of the artist as not \u201cearning\u201d his income for the purposes of section 911 would place him in an unfavorable light. * * * To avoid discriminatory treatment, we perceive no sound reasons for treating income earned by the personal efforts, skill, and creativity of a Tobey or a Picasso any differently from the income earned by a confidence man, a brain surgeon, a movie star, or, for that matter, a tax attorney. 60 T.C. at 235</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>To hold now that (as defendant urges) Congress intended to allow an exclusion of foreign-source income earned through personal efforts under 911 but to limit that exclusion by treating the outcome of personal efforts as \u201cpersonal property\u201d under the sourcing rules would gut the <em>Tobey </em>decision and produce an internally inconsistent application of the statutory pattern. In an effort to avoid the implications of <em>Tobey, </em>defendant argues that the sourcing rules provide different, narrower definitions of \u201cpersonal property\u201d and \u201cpersonal services\u201d than the 1911 use of \u201cearned income.\u201d What defendant cannot avoid however, is that an application of the sourcing rules under section 911 which would create an absolute distinction between labor and the tangible results of that labor \u2014 a distinction squarely rejected by <em>Tobey </em>for section 911 \u2014would be to attribute to Congress an inconsistent and self-contradictory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Furthermore, defendant\u2019s reading would create artificial and technical distinctions without genuine substantive foundation. That interpretation of the sourcing rules requires that, after defining the artist\u2019s work as \u201cpersonal property,\u201d a second determination be made under state law\u2014 where the sale took place. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 863(b)(2) (specifying sourcing rule for \u201cpersonal property\u201d which was produced without and <em>\u201csold within </em>the United States\u201d) (emphasis added). Because the Uniform Commercial Code provisions on the sale of goods <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 normally, the local law\u2014 provides generally that unless explicitly agreed otherwise title passes on physical delivery of the goods, <em>see </em>U.C.C. \u00a7 2 \u2014 401(2), a well-counseled artist would either arrange to make delivery of his works outside the United States, or specifically allocate passage of title by an event other than delivery. <em>See </em>U.C.C. \u00a7 2-401(1) (if parties make explicit agreement in contract then title passes under terms of that agreement). The artist would thereby escape defendant\u2019s dragnet of the sourcing rules, which apply only to personal property sold or produced \u201cwithin\u201d the United States.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude, for these reasons, that taxpayer is entitled to treat his earnings from his artwork as from \u201clabor or personal services,\u201d to be sourced as earned abroad, according to sections 861(a)(3) and 862(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Thus, taxpayer meets three basic conditions for exclusion of income under section. 911: he is conceded to be a bona fide foreign resident under 911(a)(1) (part I, <em>supra ); </em>his income is derived (with the exception of some business days he spent in the United States in 1970) from \u201cwithout the United States,\u201d as demonstrated in part III, supra; and his income for both his commissioned and noncommissioned sales is conced<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ed to be \u201cearned income\u201d under the <em>Tobey </em>holding (part I, supra). We have also ruled above that the $25,000 foreign income exclusion is to be computed on the basis of taxpayer\u2019s gross income (not his net income). <em>See </em>Part II, <em>supra. </em>But before we can determine the proper tax for 19.70 and 1971 we must decide a question bearing directly on the appropriate figures to use\u2014 to what extent is taxpayer bound in this court by his original returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">We hold that because of the nature of his refund claims taxpayer cannot now contest the figures and statements in his own returns (though of course the Government can do so). His refund claims twice emphasized that his original returns should be accepted as filed and without adjustment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless he seeks in this litigation to change (to his advantage) two major factual aspects of those returns \u2014 the number of business days he spent in the United States in 1970 and the amount of commissioned receipts attributable to his foreign income exclusion for 1970. This he cannot do because he is precluded from making any claim in court which is at substantial variance with the refund claims filed administratively.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The substantial variance rule is based on section 7422(a) which requires a refund claim to be \u201cduly filed\u201d with the Internal Revenue Service before maintaining a lawsuit for a tax refund. Regulation section 301.6402-2(b) states one of the requirements for a \u201cduly filed\u201d refund claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV-\">The claim must set forth in detail each ground upon which a credit or refund is claimed and facts sufficient to apprise the Commissioner of the exact basis thereof. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.6402-2(b)(l) (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">This regulation and its predecessors have long been interpreted as barring a subsequent refund suit which presents claims at \u201csubstantial variance\u201d with those presented in the refund claim. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Felt &amp; Tarrant Mfg. Co., </em>283 U.S. 269, 51 S.Ct. 376, 75 L.Ed. 1025 (1931); <em>Real Estate-Land Title &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>309 U.S. 13, 17-18, 60 S.Ct. 371, 84 L.Ed. 542 (1940); <em>Fruehauf Corp. v. United States, </em>477 F.2d 568, 574-75, 201 Ct.Cl. 366, 378-79 (1973). Although many cases (including those cited) found a substantial variance based on a different legal theory argued to the court, the language of the regulation and the objective behind the rule also prevent taxpayers from substantially varying the factual bases of their claims as presented to the Service in their refund claims. <em>See generally, Union Pacific R.R. v. United States, </em>389 F.2d 437, 442, 182 Ct.Cl. 103, 109 (1968) (purposes of rule to prevent surprise; give adequate notice to Service; and allow Service to correct errors and thereby limit scope of contested issues).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here, taxpayer expressly told the Service to accept his returns as filed and without adjustment. That meant that, so far as he was concerned, the Service could and should accept his facts and figures without further inquiry (especially statements as to his own affairs, which he presumably knew). It is no answer that the Government has raised new legal theories in this court to deny recovery. Plaintiff is not barred from re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>sponding to those theories but in doing so he should not depart from the facts stated in his returns which he specifically demanded (in the refund claims) that the Service accept as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In this segment of our opinion, we concern ourselves with the proper tax for 1970. Although taxpayer\u2019s original return for 1970 listed gross business \u2022income (\u201cgross receipts\u201d or \u201cgross sales\u201d of line 1, schedule C, Form 1040, 1970 edition) as $36,107, this amount was readjusted during the Service audit to the figure of $48,506.99. (The latter figure is a total of some $20,006.99 in noncommissioned sales and $28,500 in receipts from the Rudin commission.) Defendant is, of course, entitled to challenge the figure in plaintiff\u2019s return and to use its own figure of $48,506.99. We adopt the latter, on these cross-motions for summary judgment, because taxpayer has not contested it, in oral or written argument in this court, and indeed has used it in his own brief to compute the tax on the erroneous net basis theory. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Another factual assumption we make is that Mr. Cook spent 67 business days in the United States during 1970. That is what he stated in his return and in effect reaffirmed in his refund claim (as explained in part IV, <em>supra). </em>He now says that most, perhaps all, of those 67 days should not be counted as \u201cwork\u201d days. This change in factual position from his refund claim is impermissible, for the reasons given in part IV, <em>supra. </em>Having claimed and reclaimed a deduction of business expenses for 67 days in the United States, he cannot now say that he spent a lesser number of days for the purposes of the present case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Given our factual assumptions, the computations set forth in Appendix A, <em>infra, </em>show that for 1970 taxpayer is entitled to no refund. In fact, he would owe the Government a small amount of money, but defendant has interposed no counterclaim. We add that, even if taxpayer is not precluded from varying the number of work or business days he spent in the United States in 1970, it would not affect the outcome for that year.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Our computation of taxpayer\u2019s liability for 1971 rests on two factual assumptions\u2014 that taxpayer\u2019s gross business income for 1971 was $27,772 and that the $12,250 taxpayer received in 1971 on the Rudin commission was for work done in 1970. Plaintiff\u2019s original return for 1971 listed $15,522 in noncommissioned sales, and $12,250 in commissioned receipts <em>(i. </em>e. the Rudin commission), for a total of $27,772. Plaintiff\u2019s refund claim for 1971 stated that this return \u201cshould have been accpted [sic] without adjustment.\u201d <em>See </em>note 10, <em>supra. </em>In his reply brief taxpayer now contends that the actual amount of commissioned receipts in 1971 was only $10,000, for a total gross business income of $25,522. This new factual contention is barred by the substantial variance rule, discussed in part IV, <em>supra. </em>Taxpayer is also bound to the factual assertion in his original return, reiterated in the refund claim, that the $12,250 received in 1971 for the Rudin sculpture was paid for services rendered in 1970. On that premise, section 911(c)(2) mandates that, in applying the $25,000 maximum income exclusion, <em>\u201c * * * </em>amounts received shall be considered received in the taxable year in which the services to which the amounts are attributable are performed.\u201d Because the taxpayer has already received the maximum statutory exclusion of $25,000 for 1970, see part V, <em>supra, </em>and appendix A, <em>infra, </em>he cannot exclude any of the $12,250 which is attributable to the 1970 tax year. <em>See </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.911-2(d)(1) (1971); Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens Abroad 11-12 (I.R.S. Public No. 54, 1971 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We do <em>not </em>assume that taxpayer is precluded from calculating his 1971 tax liability by excluding his noncommissioned receipts for that year as foreign-sourced income. Defendant strenuously contends that taxpayer cannot now exclude any of the 1971 noncommissioned sales because plaintiff did not exclude such receipts in his 1971 return, and his 1971 refund claim states that the original return should have been accepted as filed. We'reject this application of the substantial variance rule because taxpayer\u2019s refund claim did raise the issue of applying the section 911 income exclusion to noncommissioned sales. The first sentences of taxpayer\u2019s 1971 refund claim stated that the Service erred in not allowing an income exclusion for \u201call work\u201d performed in Rome, and that that position should be reconsidered in light of <em>Tobey. See </em>note 10, <em>supra. Tobey </em>held, as we have pointed out, that that artist\u2019s noncommissioned sales were excludable as foreign income under section 911.60 T.C. 227 (1973). Thus a fair reading of taxpayer\u2019s refund claim is that taxpayer wanted the proceeds of all foreign work, including his noncommissioned work, to be excluded from his income.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This attempt to exclude noncommissioned sales, unlike the belated attempts to alter certain factual assumptions, is not a surprise or totally novel claim of which the Service was unaware. The Service\u2019s notice of disallowance of the refund claims states that the claim was denied because \u201c[t]he Commissioner has not acquiesced in the Tax Court decision regarding Mark Tobey.\u201d Allowing taxpayer to raise the claim that his 1971 noncommissioned foreign income should have been excluded would not frustrate the purposes of the variance rule \u2014 to allow full administrative consideration of a taxpayer\u2019s claim. <em>See Union Pacific R.R. v. United States, </em>389 F.2d 437, 442, 182 Ct.Cl. 103, 109 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-18\">With these assumptions, our computations for 1971, contained in appendix B, <em>infra, </em>reveal that taxpayer is entitled to a refund of only $40.46.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-19\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-20\">There is still another theory, pressed by defendant, under which taxpayer could be denied recovery of even this $40.46. The Government observes that Mr. Cook used expensive bronze materials to produce his sculptures,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and concludes that the limitation on earned income contained in the second sentence of section 911(b), when capital is a \u201cmaterial income-producing factor\u201d, should be invoked.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We decline in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>case \u2014 where only the relatively trivial sum of $40 + turns on this issue \u2014 to follow defendant into the uncertain waters of either trying ourselves to define when, if ever, an artist\u2019s materials are a material income-producing factor for the purposes of section 911, or of remanding for a trial on that issue before developing legal criteria applicable to this case. Exploring an unchartered sea for so small a potential catch is not a lightly-undertaken task, and here it is quite clear that defendant\u2019s theory does involve a novel area. We are aware of no case dealing with the foreign earned income exclusion by artists or other specially-skilled individuals which has analyzed whether a large investment in materials can be deemed a capital investment under 911(b). <em>Cf.

The regulations under section 911, a revenue ruling interpreting 911, and the Service\u2019s Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens Abroad all limit their examples of capital as a material income-producing factor to business enterprises such as retail merchants. <em>See </em>Treas.

We therefore decline defendant\u2019s invitation to venture into this issue when the result could have such tiny practical impact in the instant case.
