The Government\u2019s proof showed that Dr. Schaffer would routinely hospitalize accident victims referred to him by the named attorneys and others, whether the victims needed to be hospitalized or not, and further that he would submit medical bills charging for visits not made and services not rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Dr. Schaffer does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction, and advisedly so \u2014 the evidence was overwhelming. He contends rather that the District Court erred in (1) instructing the jury on Florida law and in effect directing the jury to find a fact in issue; (2) failing to give a complete <em>Apollo </em>instruction, see <em>United States v. Apollo, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 476 F.2d 156,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on numerous occasions when co-conspirator hearsay was introduced, and failing to give any instruction at all on other such occasions; (3) admitting testimony concerning another crime or wrong where such testimony was not relevant to motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, etc. and was highly prejudicial, see F.R.Evid. 404; <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>5 Cir., en banc, 1978, 582 F.2d 898; (4) instructing the jury that a reasonable doubt \u201cmust be substantial rather than speculative,\u201d see <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 585 F.2d 1234, 1240-42, rehearing en banc granted; (5) instructing the jury that \u201ca defendant may be convicted as a conspirator even though he may have played only a minor part in the conspiracy\u201d; and (6) failing to instruct the jury that an element of mail fraud is that \u201csome person or persons must have been defrauded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The record shows that the defendant failed to object or otherwise preserve error as to all but the last of these six points of error. Since the defendant has not demonstrated that any of the other alleged errors was \u201cso basic, so prejudicial\u201d or so \u201cobvious and substantial\u201d as to constitute plain error, see <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 585 F.2d 119, 127, we need only consider defendant\u2019s sixth point: the failure to instruct that \u201csome person or persons must have been defrauded\u201d is an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">Our recent mail fraud cases do not support the defendant. We summarized the elements of the offense in <em>United States v. Shryock, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 537 F.2d 207: \u201cThe elements of mail fraud under \u00a7 1341 are [1] a scheme to defraud, and [2] causing a mailing for the purpose of executing the scheme.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Netterville, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 553 F.2d 903, 909, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1009, 98 S.Ct. 719, 54 L.Ed.2d 752; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Melvin, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 544 F.2d 767, 773, <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 910, 97 S.Ct. 1184, 51 L.Ed.2d 587; <em>United States v. Green, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 494 F.2d 820, 823, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1004, 95 S.Ct. 325, 42 L.Ed.2d 780. In order to constitute a \u201cscheme to defraud,\u201d the scheme must be shown to be \u201creasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension.\u201d <em>Netterville, supra. </em>In order to satisfy the second element, the Government must show that the defendant \u201ccaused\u201d the mails to be used and that the mailing was \u201csufficiently closely related to the scheme.\u201d <em>Shryock, supra. See United States v. Maze, </em>1974, 414 U.S. 395, 399, 94 S.Ct. 645, 38 L.Ed.2d 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">The defendant\u2019s argument for requiring the Government to show the success of the scheme as an additional element relies on two earlier Fifth Circuit cases: <em>United States v. Bruce, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 488 F.2d 1224, 1230; <em>Bass </em>v. <em>United States, </em>5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 179, <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 863, 90 S.Ct. 138, 24 L.Ed.2d 117. It is true that both of those cases include \u201csome person or persons must have been defrauded\u201d in their discussion of the elements of the offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>In neither case, however, was an issue made of whether the offense requires showing the success of the scheme, nor was the fact of the success of the scheme contested. The relied-upon language was therefore dicta. <em>Compare United States v. Green, supra, </em>where the defendants were convicted of mail fraud by making false and fraudulent representations in applications for credit cards from businesses they intended to defraud. That BankAmericard recognized the fraud and did not issue credit cards, the Court held, was irrelevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-4\">The criminal activity for which appellants were convicted occurred when they used the mails to submit the applications in attempting to secure credit cards for use in their fraudulent scheme to obtain goods and services without intending to pay for them. There is, therefore, no legal significance in this case to the fact that no credit cards were issued to appellants after they submitted the applications treated in counts 1 and 5 of the indictment or to the fact that the card received on the basis of the application named in count 6 was not used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">494 F.2d at 822 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The statutory language, quoted at note 1, <em>supra, </em>does not support the defendant. Nor does his policy argument that without the proposed element, convictions could be predicated on mere innocuous misrepresentations \u2014 the definition of \u201cscheme to defraud\u201d requires that the scheme be \u201creasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension.\u201d In light of all this, we think that <em>Shryock, Netterville, Melvin, </em>and <em>Green </em>state the law of this Circuit, and that the success of the scheme is not a necessary element of the crime of mail fraud. The District Judge did not err in refusing to so instruct the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the cumulative effect of the errors and \u201cnear errors\u201d requires reversal is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"azl-dedup-1\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-15\">. \u00a7 1341.
