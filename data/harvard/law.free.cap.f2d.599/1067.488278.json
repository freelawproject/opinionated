A secondary question is whether the Board properly found a violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act in TI\u2019s rule prohibiting its employees from discussing its wage schedule with outsiders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">The Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">TI is a major manufacturer of sophisticated electronic products and much of its work is defense related. It therefore has had, since 1960, a well developed internal security system, to deal adequately with defense security demands, to protect itself against those who would seek highly valued technological product and process information, and to safeguard certain managerial information including \u201ccompetitive or business intelligence\u201d. There are two levels of classification: \u201cTI Strictly Private\u201d and \u201cTI Internal Data\u201d. The former is the more sensitive and is applied to all \u201cimportant TI information or material of a proprietary nature, the unauthorized use or disclosure of which could seriously impair the interests of TI\u201d. A deliberate dissemination of information so classified to those who are not employees who \u201cneed-to-know\u201d the contents in connection with their work invokes the sanction of immediate and summary discharge. This sanction, while invoked only a few times since 1960, has been regularly applied in cases of proven wilful disclosures of classified material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-11\">TI is strongly opposed to unionization of its plants. So far as the record indicates, this policy has not led, apart from the events with which we deal in this case, to any illegal anti-union activity. All four of the unfair labor practice charges previously brought against TI in the past ten years have been unconditionally withdrawn or dismissed. Frequent leafletting has taken place. Of the 5000 employees at the Attle-boro plant, approximately ten constitute the core of the Union Organizing Committee. Some of those, well known union proponents, have been given offers of promotion or have been promoted. All received good ratings on performance reviews during the year prior to the events here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-12\">The company, as a matter of policy, seeks to make its schedule of wages and benefits competitive in the area. Its primary means of realizing this objective is to conduct a yearly wage survey among employers in the area of wages and benefits for specific jobs. The data sought include the number of employees in a specific job category, and the minimum, maximum, and average rates of pay. In seeking the cooperation of other employers TI advises them that \u201call data will be treated with strict confidence\u201d. When it sends cooperators the survey results, it lists the companies, identified only by a code letter, in order, the highest paying employer being first. TI informs each cooperator of its own code letter and also TPs. TI repeats that the wage data is \u201csubmitted in confidence and we trust will be treated appropriately.\u201d TI uses the wage analysis sheets based on the data to help its top managers arrive at its wage increase decisions. TPs analysis sheets differ from the survey results sent to cooperators in that all companies are listed by name. They have always been classified \u201cTI Strictly Private\u201d, and, indeed, bear the stamped classification label.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>Some time before May 25, 1977, a copy of TI\u2019s most recent wage survey analysis sheets was anonymously mailed to the Organizing Committee\u2019s post office box. Members of the Committee were never implicated in the mailing. After receipt of the papers, members of the Committee discussed the information; realized that it would be helpful in their attempts to unionize the company, inasmuch as organized plants were shown to be paying higher rates; and cut off the \u201cStrictly Private\u201d label, reduced and reproduced in a leaflet two comparative tables of wages, one comparing rates for a grade 2-3 benchworker at TI and sixteen other named plants and the other comparing rates for a grade 10 toolmaker at TI and 15 other named plants. Narrative material pointed to the moral:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A270\">\u201cThe key thing for setting the wages in this area is what the union shops are doing. Take G.E., for example, doing the same work we\u2019re doing but making well over $1.00 more an hour, because workers there have struggled over the years through their union for a decent wage. If it wasn\u2019t for these organized places paying better wages to bring the average up, we\u2019d be down there with Balfours.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">On May 25 the leaflets were distributed at 6:30 a. m. TI\u2019s management became aware of the use of the information, Augat and Balfours, two companies at or near the bottom of the tables, called TI to express their concern. The leafletting continued at 3:30 p. m. and management representatives contacted four of the distributors, informing them that the leaflet contained \u201cStrictly Private\u201d matter and warning them that continued distribution would subject them to summary termination. They and others met in the evening. One of them testified, \u201cWe discussed it and our decision was that if the company did have any rights in the matter, had any claim on the material or anything of that sort; then they would have confiscated the leaflet right on the spot or taken some kind of measures against us. And, since that hadn\u2019t happened, we decided to go out again the next day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">On the next morning, May 26, the leaflet-ting continued, notwithstanding renewed warnings. Later in the day the six people who had been distributing the leaflets were interviewed and then suspended. Five days later TI concluded that evidence was lacking to implicate the employees in the original leak of the data, but that the six employees had wilfully disseminated classified materials and that company policy required immediate termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">The ALJ\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-9\">The ALJ\u2019s first step was to state: \u201cThat the reason why they were discharged was literally because the six engaged in that sidewalk distribution activity, is . conceded]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>! That discrimination in employment . . for such activity is an unfair labor practice . . . is so obvious that no citation of authority is required at this late date. All that has to be decided is whether there is any merit in the defense argument that in this case there were special circumstances that must excuse what is on its face the clearest unfair labor practice imaginable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-11\">The decision then proceeded to describe the defense. It set forth TI\u2019s \u201cstudied technique\u201d to use the periodic wage surveys in a selective fashion \u201cconveying the thought that [the employees] are doing well by comparison\u201d with others. After detailing the circumstances of the leak of the wage data and the use thereof in the campaign leaflet, the AU described the reasons advanced by TI to justify the discharges as \u201creally argument\u201d to the extent that they declared the classification \u201cof value to the Company, helps its position in a competitive market, and serves the purpose of keeping unions out of the plant.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He continued by saying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>that to the extent that the company\u2019s \u201cgeneralizations and conclusions, real or fancied, have anything to do with the employees, the only substantive evidence . . . [of misbehavior] is the Company\u2019s handbook, which does contain rules of conduct. And there the only one which could, if at all, apply to what these six did, reads: \u2018The following major infractions may be considered grounds for termination: . Disclosure of classified material to unauthorized persons.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">The third and final step is the conclusion of the ALJ, with no findings of fact other than the description of \u201cThe Asserted Defense\u201d summarized above. He finds unpersuasive the argument that knowledge of other companies\u2019 wages is to be equated with commercial or defense secrets; labels the argument that such knowledge is a matter of proprietorship \u201csound and fury signifying nothing\u201d; and feels that it would \u201cdemean this decision to discuss at length\u201d why the employees\u2019 use of the leaked information for organizational purposes was not likely to injure or destroy TI\u2019s business. The ALJ endorsed the General Counsel\u2019s theory that \u201c[w]hen the wages of the employing company are so inextricably entwined with the wages of other employers, and the employing company so advises its employees, it should not be allowed to place any greater restriction on the discussion or disclosure of the other employers\u2019 wages than it can place on the discussion of its own wages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">Concluding that the \u201cattempt to place this incident within the rules of conduct set out in the employee handbook is . unconvincing\u201d, the ALJ found that the company discharged the employees \u201cwith an object directly to discourage their statutorily protected right to self-organization.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-12\">Our Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-13\">In proceeding with our own review, we first note the complete absence of reference to case authority in connection with the ALJ\u2019s decision of the discharge issue. Of course there is no merit to citation merely as a display of scholarship. But we would have thought that any AU dealing with a discharge case in this circuit would be aware of the efforts of this and other courts over the years to articulate a rationale governing analysis of such cases. In any event the decision proceeded as if there were no special strictures guiding analysis: the discharge was the \u201cclearest unfair labor practice imaginable\u201d; the asserted defense was without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-14\">The absence of an analytical framework was compounded by the way in which the AU characterized the action of the employer: discharging employees \u201cbecause the six engaged in sidewalk distribution activity.\u201d This characterization of course begs the ultimate question of motive and would render any further analysis superfluous. And if further analysis were to be undertaken, such a perception of TI\u2019s conduct would at least impose upon it a heavy burden of justification. Setting up the problem in this way may well have led the AU to his total dismissal of TI\u2019s proffered \u201cexcuse\u201d, its rule requiring termination for wilful distribution of classified material, deeming TI\u2019s effort \u201cunconvincing\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-16\">Perhaps because of the AU\u2019s lack of analysis, TI and the Board have viewed this appeal from two entirely different perspectives. TI, looking on this as a typical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>dual motive discharge case, has criticized the Board for not adhering to our requirement that motive for the discharge be determined. <em>See NLRB v. Eastern Smelting and Refining Corp., </em>598 F.2d 666 (1979). The Board looks on the case as one in which an employer\u2019s rule directly penalizes protected activity, and the employer has not demonstrated a sufficient business justification for that rule. The Board is correct in viewing this as a case where, before it need attempt a weighing of good and bad motive, it must determine the validity of the rule as applied to this case, on which TI relied as its justification. If the rule requiring summary discharge for wilful dissemination of \u201cstrictly private\u201d material, as applied to employees distributing innocently obtained, classified wage survey data in an organizing leaflet, is held invalid, under \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act, a discharge based on such rule would be in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(3). <em>See Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, </em>324 U.S. 793, 805, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945). This is so because the employer\u2019s asserted motivation \u2014 i. e., enforcement of a rule \u2014 must be in support of a rule not prohibited by labor law. If it is not it could not support a discharge even if the motivation to enforce the rule, a neutral not an anti-union objective, were the employer\u2019s only motivation for that discharge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the rule were held valid, however, then the inquiry into motives, recently outlined in <em>NLRB v. Eastern Smelting, supra, </em>would be material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">The difficulty presented on this record is that, while we perhaps can sense how the AU and the Board might have found if they had assessed the validity of the rule, the issue was never confronted. The ALJ recognized that among the rules in the handbook there was only one which \u201ccould, if at all\u201d apply to the discharged employees\u2019 conduct, but finally concluded that TI\u2019s attempt to bring the incident within the rule failed. We cannot read these cryptic references as embodying the kind of careful analysis required by <em>Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, supra, </em>and particularly <em>NLRB v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., </em>351 U.S. 105, 76 S.Ct. 679, 100 L.Ed. 975 (1956). While the Court in the former case had held invalid a rule barring, among others, employees from distributing union literature on plant property, the question in the latter case was whether an employer could bar nonemployee union organizers from so distributing. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-7\">\u201cThis is not a problem of always open or always closed doors for union organization on company property. Organization rights are granted to workers by the same authority, the National Government, that preserves property rights. Accommodation between the two must be obtained with as little destruction of one as is consistent with the maintenance of the other. The employer may not affirmatively interfere with organization; the union may not always insist that the employer aid organization.\u201d 351 U.S. at 112, 76 S.Ct. at 684.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">Noting that different considerations apply to restrictions on employees and those on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>non-employees, and that the evidence revealed no difficulty of access to employees by others which would justify use of the employer\u2019s property, the Court held that the Act \u201cdoes not require that the employer permit the use of its facilities for organization when other means are readily available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 76 S.Ct. at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">We cannot predict whether discriminating analysis in this case would result in holding that the application of the security rule to wage survey data impermissibly burdened protected activity or that the employer was not compelled to allow distribution of classified but leaked wage survey data because \u201cother means [were] readily available\u201d to employees to accumulate the same or similar information or otherwise to support the same or similar arguments in favor of unionization. In making this determination, it is of course \u201cthe primary responsibility of the Board and not of the courts \u2018to strike the proper balance between the asserted business justifications and the invasion of employee rights in light of the Act and its policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>NLRB v. Fleetwood Trailer Co., Inc., </em>389 U.S. 375, 378, 88 S.Ct. 543, 546, 19 L.Ed.2d 614 (1967), <em>quoting NLRB v. Great Dane Trailers, </em>388 U.S. 26, 33-34, 87 S.Ct. 1792, 18 L.Ed.2d 1027 (1967). The point is that, in order to reach the proper balance between TI\u2019s interests in security and maintenance of discipline and the employees\u2019 organizational interests, the Board must focus on the issues of the validity of the rule invoked by the company to justify the discharges, just as it did in <em>Jeannette Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>532 F.2d 916 (3rd Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">Only if the rule as applied is determined to be valid under the Act would the Board face the task of assessing motive. As we have recently pointed out in <em>NLRB v. Eastern Smelting, supra, </em>there are two steps in the motive analysis. The first is the determination that a significant \u201cbad\u201d, or anti-union, motivation contributed to the discharges. The second is the subsequent weighing of the employer\u2019s defense that a \u201cgood\u201d reason for the discharge existed and would have produced the discharge even in the absence of the bad reason.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-12\">If the case proceeds to this stage, the factfinder is bound to weigh the employer\u2019s asserted justification with some delicacy and deference. \u201cIt is important in cases involving business judgment that the Board not set up its own standard, and then conclude that, since the employer had another, it was ipso facto suspect.\u201d <em>Eastern Smelting supra, </em>578 F.2d at 673. The ALJ and the Board cannot dismiss an employer\u2019s justification entirely, as having no weight or substance at all. Rather there must be a weighing of the relative strengths of the good and bad motivations, not to determine how the Board would have behaved under similar circumstances but to determine what in fact motivated the employer. Before liability can be imposed, there must be a determination in accordance with <em>Mt. Healthy, supra, </em>and <em>Givhan, supra, </em>that the discharges would not have taken place but for the improper motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-13\">The 8(a)(1) Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-14\">The second issue arises out of an 8(a)(1) charge based on the existence of a company policy classifying wage schedules as \u201cT.I. Internal Data\u201d and thus barring TI employees from discussing or disseminating TI\u2019s wage schedules with outsiders. Indeed the proscription bars revealing to outsiders, according to the company\u2019s manual, \u201cExcerpts from wage and salary schedules\u201d. The ALJ and Board observed that this would prevent employees from talking to the public or union organizers about wages and that they would be \u201ceffectively muzzled where it counts most.\u201d The only justification for the classification put forward by respondent was that public knowledge of its wage rates would assist competitors to figure out its costs and raid its employees. But this argument is utterly deflated by the fact that TI, in mounting its annual wage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>survey, gives out its own wage data to every one of its competitors within a 25 mile radius. We therefore have no difficulty in affirming the weighing process and conclusion of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">\n<em>The order as to the 8(a)(3) and (1) violation is set aside and the case remanded to the Board for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. The order as to the 8(a)(1) violation shall be enforced.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">. To state respondent\u2019s position as a \u201cconcession\u201d and so to describe it, leaving out the content of what was being distributed, has the appearance of stacking the deck.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1156-12\">. We have not found, unsurprisingly, any testimony of company witnesses that the classifying of information about other companies\u2019 wages has or serves \u201cthe purpose of keeping unions out of the plant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1157-9\">. The Board noted that it had reviewed the record and found no basis for reversing the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings. We quite agree since we have found no such findings to reverse. The Board also disassociated itself from any of the ALJ\u2019s unspecified \u201cgratuitous comments which are unnecessary to the ultimate findings and conclusions herein\u201d. These steps taken, the Board briefly affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1157-10\">. We realize that tempers and patience run short in extensive, hard fought labor-management hearings. But this makes it all the more important for the presiding officer to set an example of evenhandedness. The sharp retort, the sly dig, the sarcastic innuendo cannot fail to give the appearance of injustice, no matter how sound and fair may be the final judgment. Our concern about such matters was activated at a number of points in the hearing below. <em>See </em>Tr. 56, 59, 68, 88, 92, 154, 195, 233, 238, 324, 340, 372, 375, 376, 390, 391.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">. Under <em>NLRB v. Great Dane Trailers, </em>388 U.S. 26, 34, 87 S.Ct. 1792, 1798, 18 L.Ed.2d 1027 (1967), motive may also be irrelevant if \u201cthe employer\u2019s discriminatory conduct was \u2018inherently destructive\u2019 of important employee rights\u201d. This exception is based on the principle that \u201csome conduct carries with it \u2018unavoidable consequences which the employer not only foresaw but which he must have intended\u2019 and thus bears \u2018its own indicia of intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 87 S.Ct. at 1797, <em>quoting NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., </em>373 U.S. 221, 228, 231, 83 S.Ct. 1139, 10 L.Ed.2d 308 (1963). The Board argues that the company\u2019s reason for discharge which it characterizes as \u201cdistributing organizational leaflets containing \u2018strictly private\u2019 information\u201d, brought its actions within <em>Great Dane\u2019s </em>\u201cinherently destructive\u201d category. On this record we do not agree. The company\u2019s conduct was that of discharging employees for violating a rule that could apply to those not engaging in protected activity as well as to these union organizers. If the Board determines that the rule is otherwise valid, it would be straining to conclude that enforcing the rule revealed an inherent intent to interfere with employee rights simply because the employees\u2019 violation occurred during the carrying on of protected activity. We have rejected the proposition that an employee is immune from discharge for an act committed while engaging in protected activity. <em>NLRB v. William S.
