HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">In this case we examine the propriety of assessing attorneys\u2019 fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1988, 2000e-5(k)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys in a Title VII case. Finding that the three statutes relied on by the district court do not support the assessment of attorneys\u2019 fees against attorneys, we vacate that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment which awards attorneys\u2019 fees to the defendants at the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 expense, and we remand to the district court for modification of the judgment to reflect only the excess costs caused by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">On June 3,1975, J. D. Monk, Percy Green, and Robert McPherson, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, filed suit against Roadway Express, Inc. (Roadway) and Local Union No. 194 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for racial discrimination. The plaintiffs were represented by Robert C. Piper, Jr., Frank E. Brown, Jr., and Bobby Stromile, the appellants in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-8\">On September 5, 1975, the plaintiffs commenced discovery by propounding interrogatories to Roadway. Roadway\u2019s motion for enlargement of time within which to answer interrogatories was filed and granted on November 14, 1975. On January 5, 1976, Roadway answered the plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories and simultaneously propounded interrogatories to the plaintiffs. Roadway filed a motion on April 13, 1976, for an order compelling the plaintiffs to answer their interrogatories. A hearing on the motion was scheduled for 10:00 a. m. on April 22, 1976, but the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys failed to appear, requiring the hearing to be rescheduled for 3:00 p. m. on the same day. Following the hearing, the magistrate ordered the plaintiffs to answer the interrogatories on or before May 24, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-13\">At the same time that it had filed a motion to compel, Roadway had noticed depositions of each of the plaintiffs to be taken on May 6 and 7, 1976. The depositions of Monk and Green were taken, but McPherson could not be located by his attorney and his deposition was not taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-14\">The plaintiffs\u2019 lack of cooperation in the defendants\u2019 pretrial discovery efforts led Roadway to file two motions to dismiss. On May 18, 1976, Roadway moved to dismiss McPherson\u2019s complaint for failure to give his deposition, and on June 14, 1976, Roadway moved to dismiss the complaint of the plaintiffs, with prejudice, for failure to answer interrogatories. On June 16, 1976, the district court ordered the plaintiffs to show cause why their complaint should not be dismissed, with prejudice, and why they should not be taxed with all of the defendants\u2019 reasonable expenses, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. Pursuant to a hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>order, the district court dismissed the case without prejudice on June 30, 1976, but retained jurisdiction to determine whether the defendants were entitled to an award of expenses, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">On October 5, 1976, the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the imposition of sanctions and/or the taxation of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees against the plaintiffs and their counsel. On January 6, 1977, the district court ordered certain costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, and expenses taxed against the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys on the grounds that their conduct was deliberate and vexatious in that they failed to diligently pursue the plaintiffs\u2019 interests and abide by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court found that the forced dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims was caused by the total and deliberate failure of their counsel to properly prosecute them, as evidenced by their failure to answer Roadway\u2019s interrogatories as ordered; their failure to produce McPherson for his deposition as previously agreed; their failure to advise their clients of their denomination as class representatives and the possible consequences of class representation; and their failure to file briefs twice requested by the court concerning this case\u2019s relation to a class action certification entered in the Western District of Texas. A motion for a rehearing on the motion to assess attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys was filed and denied. The plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, Piper, Brown, and Stromile, appeal from the judgment against them in the amount of $17,372.53 for the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred by Roadway in defending the law suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">The appellants contend first that the district court erroneously assessed attorneys\u2019 fees against them under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1988, 2000e-5(k), since \u00a7 1927 refers only to \u201cexcess costs\u201d and \u00a7\u00a7 1988 and 2000e-5(k) are applicable only to parties. They next contend that their conduct was not vexatious so that no award of costs under \u00a7 1927 should have been entered against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-7\">Looking first to the propriety of entering any award at all against the appellants under \u00a7 1927, we find that the district court\u2019s determinations regarding the vexatiousness of the appellants\u2019 behavior are not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>National Ass\u2019n of Real Estate Boards, </em>339 U.S. 485, 70 S.Ct. 711, 94 L.Ed. 1007 (1950); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). The instances of misconduct related in the district court\u2019s ruling on the motion to assess costs and attorneys\u2019 fees adequately support the court\u2019s findings of fact concerning the vexatious manner in which the appellants conducted the law suit. Thus, under \u00a7 1927, the appellants are subject to personal liability for the excess costs generated by their unreasonable and vexatious multiplication of the proceedings. Having determined that the appellants are liable for an award under \u00a7 1927, we turn to the proper scope of their liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-8\">The general American rule is that attorneys\u2019 fees are not ordinarily recoverable as costs. <em>E. g., Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 U.S. 375, 391, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1969). Section 1927\u2019s reference to \u201ccosts\u201d neither specifically includes nor specifically excludes attorneys\u2019 fees as allowable costs under the statute. Our research reveals a split among circuits concerning the correct construction of \u00a7 1927 and the scope of allowable costs under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-9\">The Second Circuit indicated clearly in <em>Browning Debenture Holders\u2019 Committee v. DASA Corp., </em>560 F.2d 1078, 1087-89 (2d Cir. 1977), that, where an attorney has been vexatious in increasing costs through improper motions, actions, or delays, he may be assessed, under \u00a7 1927, the \u201cexpenses, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees reasonably incurred by the opposing party or parties in meeting such improper motions, action, or delays.\u201d Although the District of Columbia Circuit did not address the question as directly as did the Second Circuit, a recent case from the District of Columbia Circuit suggests that that circuit would rule similarly were it faced with a case where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>attorney had acted vexatiously. <em>See Asal v. Castillo, </em>193 U.S.App.D.C. 68, 593 F.2d 1222 (1979). In addition, several cases at the district court level have allowed attorneys\u2019 fees as part of a \u00a7 1927 award against an attorney. <em>Nemeroff v. Abelson, </em>469 F.Supp. 630 (S.D.N.Y.1979); <em>North American Foreign Trading Corp. v. Zale Corp., </em>77-C-1056 (S.D.N.Y.1979); <em>Wheeler v. Anchor Continental, Inc., </em>19 Empl.Prac. Dec. (CCH) \u00b6 9006 (D.S.C.1978); <em>In re Complaint of Cosmopolitan Shipping Co., </em>F.Supp. (slip op. issued 12-26-78) (S.D.N.Y.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-4\">On the other hand, the Sixth Circuit, in <em>United States v. Ross, </em>535 F.2d 346, 350-51 (6th Cir. 1976), concluded that the \u201ccosts\u201d provided by \u00a7 1927 should be limited to taxable costs, recognizing in the course of that determination that attorneys\u2019 fees cannot be part of those costs. The Seventh Circuit had reached the same conclusion earlier in <em>1507 Corp. v. Henderson, </em>447 F.2d 540, 542 (7th Cir. 1971). Three district courts, two of which are in this circuit, have since followed suit. <em>See Yarborough v. Texas Oklahoma Express, Inc., </em>86 Lab.Cas. (CCH) \u00b6 11,256 (N.D.Tex.1979); <em>Exhibitors Poster Exchange, Inc. v. National Screen Service Corp., </em>78 F.R.D. 192 (E.D.La.1978); <em>Chrysler-Corp. v. Lakeshore Commercial Finance Corp., </em>389 F.Supp. 1216 (E.D.Wis.1975), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>549 F.2d 804 (7th Cir. 1977). In addition, the First Circuit, while not having clearly addressed the issue, suggests that attorneys\u2019 fees are not allowable in a \u00a7 1927 award, <em>see Bonsukan v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>554 F.2d 2, 4 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 833, 98 S.Ct. 118, 54 L.Ed.2d 93 (1977), and a fourth district court reaches the same result in construing similar statutory provisions for awards of costs, <em>see Lockett v. Hellenic Sea Transports Ltd., </em>60 F.R.D. 469 (E.D.Pa.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-7\">We agree with the Sixth Circuit in its observations that \u00a7 1927 should be strictly construed because it is penal in nature. <em>United States v. Ross, </em>535 F.2d at 350. To read \u00a7 1927\u2019s provision for \u201ccosts\u201d as including an award of attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cwould require us to ascribe to Congress a purpose to vary the meaning of that term without either statutory language or legislative history to support the unusual construction,\u201d as the Supreme Court was urged to do in construing the provision for \u201ccosts\u201d in \u00a7 35 of the Lanham Act. <em>Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., </em>386 U.S. 714, 720, 87 S.Ct. 1404, 1408, 18 L.Ed.2d 475 (1967). The Court\u2019s observations in that case bear repeating in our endeavor to divine the Congressional intent underlying \u00a7 1927\u2019s provision for the assessment of costs against attorneys. \u201cWhen a cause of action has been created by a statute which expressly provides the remedies for vindication of the cause, other remedies should not readily be implied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 720, 87 S.Ct. at 1408. Since \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees are not ordinarily recoverable in the absence of a statute or enforceable contract providing therefor,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 717, 87 S.Ct. at 1407, and since \u00a7 1927\u2019s provision for assessment of costs against attorneys is an extraordinary remedy, we conclude, as did the Supreme Court with regard to \u00a7 35 of the Lanham Act, that \u201c[a] judicially created compensatory remedy in addition to the express statutory remedies is inappropriate in this context,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 721, 87 S.Ct. at 1409.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We thus hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>that the district court\u2019s inclusion of attorneys\u2019 fees in the award of costs, pursuant to \u00a7 1927, against the appellants was erroneous, and we vacate that portion of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-4\">Our construction of \u00a7 1927 does not foreclose assessment of attorneys\u2019 fees against attorneys in every conceivable situation, it merely forecloses the imposition of such liability under \u00a7 1927. Moreover, new legislation specifically providing for such assessments can, of course, be enacted at Congress\u2019 will.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-5\">We note that the district court\u2019s reliance on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1988 and 2000e-5(k) in assessing attorneys\u2019 fees against the appellants does not alter the result in this case. Those sections provide for attorneys\u2019 fees awards against unsuccessful <em>parties </em>to a suit, and they focus on actions which are frivolous, unreasonable, and baseless in allowing awards against unsuccessful <em>plaintiffs. See, e. g., Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978); <em>Little v. Southern Electric Steel Co., </em>595 F.2d 998 (5th Cir. 1979). Nothing in the language of those statutes and nothing in the cases cited to us by the appellees leads us to believe that \u00a7\u00a7 1988 and 2000e-5(k) authorize the imposition of attorneys\u2019 fees against an unsuccessful party\u2019s attorneys. Neither could the district court combine the provisions of those statutes with those of \u00a7 1927 to produce a hybrid result contemplated by none of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-6\">In conclusion, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for determination of a proper award consistent with this opinion. We point out in closing that \u00a7 1927 provides only for <em>excess </em>costs caused by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 vexatious behavior and consequent multiplication of the proceedings, and not for the total costs of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1466-9\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-10\">Any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the United States or any Territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case as to increase costs unreasonably and vexatlously may be required by the court to satisfy personally such excess costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1466-11\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aiv-dedup-0\">In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1985, and 1986 of this title, title IX of Public Law 92-318, or in any civil action or proceeding, by or on behalf of the United States of America, to enforce, or charging a violation of, a provision of the United States Internal Revenue Code, or title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aeq-dedup-1\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ans-dedup-0\">(k) In any action or proceeding under this subchapter the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the Commission or the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs, and the Commission and the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1468-5\">. We acknowledge that a panel of this circuit affirmed the assessment of jury expenses under \u00a7 1927 in <em>Harrell v. Joffrion, </em>73 F.R.D. 267, 268 (W.D.La.), <em>aff'd without opinion, </em>545 F.2d 167 (5th Cir. 1976). We point out, however, that the judgment in <em>Harrell v. Joffrion </em>was affirmed pursuant to Local Rule 21. Under that rule, the panel to whom the case is submitted must determine that an opinion in the case would have no precedential value before the rule is triggered. Given that fact, in conjunction with the fact that the basis for a Rule 21 affirmance is never subjected to the scrutiny of the entire court as are published opinions which are circulated among the court prior to their release, we are doubtful that a district court opinion affirmed without opinion pursuant to Rule 21 is Fifth Circuit authority to which we are bound in our ensuing opinions. Even if we were bound by <em>Harrell v. Joffrion, </em>we would decline to expand \u00a7 1927 further to include attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
