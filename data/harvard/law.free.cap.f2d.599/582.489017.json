The district court held, relying essentially on <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 97 S.Ct. 401, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976), that it did not. In light of <em>Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, </em>434 U.S. 136, 98 S.Ct. 347, 54 L.Ed.2d 356 (1977) decided during the pendency of this appeal, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">The instant case presents another classic illustration of the difficulty wryly observed by Mr. Justice Powell in <em>Satty </em>that has attended the best efforts of parties and courts to bring Title VII lawsuits to final resolution during a recent past characterized by a \u201cmeandering course\u201d of adjudication in which both parties and lower courts have often \u201cproceeded on what was ultimately an erroneous theory of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148, 98 S.Ct. at 354 (Powell, J., concurring). Whatever the frustrations for both parties and courts during such a period of necessarily laborious working-out of important national policy through the judicial process, a patient faithfulness to the imperatives of that process binds us to the course. For reasons that will appear, this requires at least one more meander for this case before it may finally come to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Ann Mitchell was a state-certified high school Spanish teacher in the Pickens County School District, South Carolina, for the school year 1971-72. There is full agreement that her work was of the highest quality. In February 1972, she signed a letter of intent relating to the renewal of her contract for the school year 1972-73. In April 1972, she discovered she was pregnant with anticipated delivery in November 1972. As required by the school district\u2019s regulations she gave notice of this fact to the school administration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, Mitchell made tentative arrangements to have a teacher serve as a substitute for the six weeks anticipated leave. This plan was disapproved by the Superintendent and as a result Mitchell\u2019s contract was not renewed. The Board of Trustees ultimately upheld the Superintendent\u2019s decision, applying an \u201cunwritten policy\u201d against renewing the contract of any teacher who at renewal time could not commit to a full-year\u2019s service.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In August 1972, Mitchell brought suit against school officials under \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violation of her federal constitutional rights by the non-renewal of her contract. On April 4, 1973, the district court gave summary judgment for the school officials on the authority of this Court\u2019s then recent decision in <em>Cohen v. Chesterfield County School Board, </em>474 F.2d 395 (4th Cir. 1973) (en banc), <em>rev\u2019d sub nom. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, </em>414 U.S. 632, 94 S.Ct. 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (1974). Mitchell appealed that judgment to this Court and while the appeal was pending filed a second action stating essentially the same claim under Title VII. After the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>LaFleur </em>decision reversed this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cohen, </em>we vacated the district court\u2019s decision in the \u00a7 1983 action and remanded for further proceedings. Upon remand the district court consolidated the two actions on the basis of ap amended complaint stating both claims. After discovery, the case was submitted for decision by the court upon the pleadings, depositions, and various affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Relying essentially on this Court\u2019s then recent decision in <em>Gilbert v. General Electric Co., </em>519 F.2d 661 (4th Cir. 1975), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>429 U.S. 125, 97 S.Ct. 401, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976); on <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971); and on applicable EEOC guidelines, the district court made findings of fact from which it concluded that, although facially neutral, the Board\u2019s policies had the forbidden consequence, albeit unintended, of sex-related discrimination, and so violated <em>prima facie </em>Mitchell\u2019s rights under Title VII. Concluding also that the policies had not been shown \u201cnecessary to the normal operation of a school,\u201d the district court on January 22, 1976 entered judgment awarding back pay and attorney\u2019s fees to Mitchell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants filed notice of appeal from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gilbert </em>was then pending, docketing of defendant\u2019s appeal was deferred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the Supreme Court then reversed this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gilbert, </em>the district court on July 27, 1977 \u201cwithdrew\u201d its then extant judgment and entered a new judgment for the school official defendants. Leaving its findings of fact intact, the district court construed the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Gilbert </em>decision to require different conclusions of law .leading to a complete reversal of its pre-Gilbert judgment. At this point the school official defendants of course withdrew their appeal, and plaintiff Mitchell filed the appeal now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">When the district court entered its original judgment for plaintiff on her Title VII claim, it correctly utilized the \u201cdisparate impact\u201d analysis that originated in <em>Griggs </em>and had recently been applied by this Court in our <em>Gilbert </em>decision. Under this approach the court accurately identified the challenged policy; concluded that although facially neutral its consequences bore with disparate impact upon women; and held that not being shown \u201cnecessary to the normal operation of a school\u201d it violated \u00a7 703(a)(1) and (2) of Title VII. The key to this analysis lay in the court\u2019s correct perception of the nature and scope of the policies under challenge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As identified by the district court, the policy was that by which school board officials secured and used information provided them at contract renewal time that a teacher would likely experience during the ensuing school year an extended period of absence as a basis for declining to renew that teacher\u2019s contract. In assessing the consequential impact of this policy, the court had little direct evidence of specific applications. There was evidence from the school board that the policy had on several occasions been applied to deny renewal to persons who for various reasons unassociated with anticipated physical disability could not commit to full year employment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Beyond these few instances, school officials testified that <em>if </em>they had been notified of any sorts of anticipated absences of extended duration comparable to those necessitated by pregnancy, these <em>would have been </em>treated comparably, but no specific instances were shown. On the other hand, the plaintiff could offer, in addition to her own case, only two other specific instances from the same school year in which advance notifications of pregnancy had resulted in non-renewal of contracts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus the court was faced with a record in which the universe of persons potentially affected and those actually affected by the challenged policy did not permit the sort of reliable statistical proofs of actual consequences frequently available and useful in disparate impact cases. It had instead to proceed on the basis of the few specific applications of the policy proven, such inferences of likely other applications as these instances could rationally support, and judicial notice of the world as it is and as it is known in common experience to be. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 201.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On this record, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>trict court rightly concluded that a policy that arguably would not renew the contract of any teacher who for any reason could not commit at contract renewal time to a full year\u2019s uninterrupted service, but that singled out pregnancy alone for compelled disclosure, would necessarily impact disproportionately upon women. Because, as the district court put it, \u201cdefendants\u2019 actions . . . resulted in the denial of a teaching job to plaintiff solely because of pregnancy,\u201d <em>Griggs\u2019 </em>teaching, as then recently applied by this Court in <em>Gilbert, </em>was thought to compel the conclusion that the policy\u2019s \u201cconsequences,\u201d as experienced by Mitchell, constituted a <em>prima facie </em>violation of her Title VII employment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Then followed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gilbert </em>that held the exclusion of pregnancy from a generally comprehensive employee disability insurance program not violative of \u00a7 703(a)(1) of Title VII. Confronted with this decision, the district court then concluded that its earlier disparate impact analysis that had relied heavily on this Court\u2019s <em>Gilbert </em>decision had been undercut. Basically, the district court now read the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Gilbert </em>opinion to mandate for all Title VII cases the stringent constitutional standards for proof of discrimination that it had applied in such constitutional claim cases as <em>Geduldig v. Aiello, </em>417 U.S. 484, 94 S.Ct. 2485, 41 L.Ed.2d 256 (1974), and that this Court had explicitly rejected for Title VII cases in our own <em>Gilbert </em>decision. On that premise the district court now concluded that \u201c[i]n light of <em>Gilbert </em>and the statutory language it construed, the defendants\u2019 unwritten policy of the non-renewal of teacher contracts where a predicted period of absence is indicated, has not been shown to constitute gender-based discrimination or to be gender-based in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\"><em>Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, </em>434 U.S. 136, 98 S.Ct. 347 (1977), decided during the pendency of this appeal, makes plain that, however understandably, the district court has read <em>Gilbert </em>too broadly, and that its first conclusion of a <em>prima facie </em>Title VII disparate impact violation was correct. <em>Satty, </em>holding violative of Title VII a facially neutral leave absence policy that without business necessity denied accumulated seniority to women on maternity leave while granting it for all other disability leaves, distinguished <em>Gilbert </em>on two major points. They also distinguish <em>Gilbert </em>from this case. Most importantly, the <em>Satty </em>Court pointed out that the <em>Gilbert </em>practice \u201cmerely refused to extend to women a benefit that men cannot and do not receive,\u201d while the <em>Satty </em>practice \u201cimposed on women a substantial burden that men need not suffer.\u201d 434 U.S. at 142, 98 S.Ct. at 351. Furthermore, this distinction was said to be \u201cmore than one of semantics,\u201d <em>id., </em>and to be based upon the application of different sections of Title VII in the two cases. While \u00a7 703(a)(1), the Title VII section invoked in <em>Gilbert, </em>had been there held not to require that \u201cgreater benefits be paid to one sex or the other \u2018because of their differing roles\u2019 in \u2018the scheme of human existence,\u2019 \u201d this did not mean that \u00a7 703(a)(2), the Title VII section invoked in <em>Satty, </em>could be read to \u201cpermit an employer to burden female employees in such a way as to deprive them of employment opportunities because of their different role.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Within the <em>Satty </em>analysis, as applied to the facts found by the district court in this case and undisturbed in its judgment before us, the defendants\u2019 policy as applied clearly also imposed upon women school teachers a substantial burden that their male counterparts need not suffer. Women <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>teachers alone were required by regulation to give advance notice of any anticipated absence of extended duration during an ensuing year. While it may be factually in-ferable that any male whose comparable anticipated absence was voluntarily disclosed either by himself or others would similarly have been denied renewal of contract, no official obligation of disclosure was laid upon men, and the record is devoid of evidence that anticipated absences for reasons of physical disability were ever used to deny renewal to men. The policies in combination clearly deprived women, including this plaintiff, of \u201cemployment opportunities\u201d \u2014 renewal for another year\u2014 and \u201cadversely affect[ed their] status as . employee[s]\u201d \u201cbecause of [their] sex\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 703(a)(2). The policy and its consequences in application are not only indistinguishable in substance from those held violative of \u00a7 703(a)(2) in <em>Satty, </em>but also from those found <em>prima facie </em>violative in <em>Pennington v. Lexington School District 2, </em>578 F.2d 546 (4th Cir. 1978), another post-Saify decision of this Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Finding a <em>prima facie </em>violation of \u00a7 703(a)(2) does not end the matter. It still lies with a defendant found in <em>prima facie </em>violation of that section to escape liability by showing \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d as justification for the challenged policy. <em>See Pennington v. Lexington School District 2, id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Unlike the <em>prima facie </em>violation that we have found established, this issue cannot be resolved on the present record. The defendants have pressed throughout this litigation a justification type defense, but it is at least questionable on the record before us whether either they or the district court have fully apprehended it as the \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense that originated with the \u201cdisparate impact\u201d theory of recovery under \u00a7 703(a)(2). Rather, the defendants from the outset have considered that plaintiff\u2019s Title VII claims were claims requiring proof of constitutionally proscribed discrimination and consequently were subject to the defense of a \u201clegitimate state interest.\u201d This defense they have sought to show in the state\u2019s educational interest in continuity of instruction. While the record is not perfectly clear on the point, it appears most likely that the district court has similarly assessed the defendant\u2019s justification defense in these terms.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In gauging the requirements of fairness on remand it is important to recall that, except for the brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>interlude when plaintiff held the upper hand in district court prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gilbert, </em>defendants\u2019 view of the appropriate theory of this defense has been vindicated by the course of procedural developments in which this view has never been directly rejected by any court until this opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We must concede that plaintiff might understandably and accurately complain that she has never been under any misapprehension about the correct theory of claim and defense for her \u00a7 703(a)(2) claim<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that defendants\u2019 failure to have perceived what she has perceived should yield the ordinary litigation result of waiver of the defense. However, given the course of Title VII doctrinal developments while this case has proceeded, we do not think it would be fair to foreclose defendants from presenting in the district court such business necessity defense as they may have now that the course of adjudication has revealed it as the appropriate justification defense. <em>See Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, </em>434 U.S. 136, 150-52, 98 S.Ct. 347 (1977) (Powell, J., concurring). Accordingly, as we did in <em>Pennington, </em>we remand for consideration of any business necessity defense that defendants may be disposed and able to present on the existing or a reopened record. If this defense is not established, judgment should be entered for plaintiff on the basis of the <em>prima facie </em>violation found on this appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-6\">. The teacher\u2019s Manual provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6_\">The principal of the school shall decide when the presence of a pregnant woman (teacher, student, or employee) is detrimental to the satisfactory operation of the school program. In all cases of maternity, women who are under contract with the Board of Trustees must in writing apply to the principal of the school or immediate superior official for termination of contract as soon as pregnancy is determined. This termination should take effect not less than three (3) months prior to expected delivery date. Exceptions must be approved by the District Superintendent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">While the notification requirement critical to this regulation is literally related to \u201ctermination\u201d of ongoing.contracts rather than to \u201cnon-renewal\u201d of contracts for succeeding years, the duty to notify is literally addressed to any teacher \u201cunder contract\u201d who determines she is pregnant. There is no question on the record of its intended application to Mitchell\u2019s determination and disclosure of her pregnancy; and of course both she and the board so acted upon it, with the results that gave rise to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"aem-dedup-0\">This regulation was revoked by the school board during this litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b670-12\">. The court deliberately avoided ruling on the constitutional claim, and it has technically never been determined. Although plaintiff originally sought injunctive relief, back pay and reinstatement, and attorney\u2019s fees, she later abandoned all claims for relief except a declaration of violation of rights, back pay for only that portion of the fall semester outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>maternity leave period requested, court costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\">. And \u201crelief\u2019 from the January 22, 1976 judgment was granted under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6) pending the <em>Gilbert </em>decision. We note the practice without approving it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\">. That disparate impact analysis may well turn on the threshold identification of the nature and scope of the policy or practice being challenged, hence the \u201cuniverse\u201d of persons potentially and actually affected by it, <em>see General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 147-48, 97 S.Ct. 401, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976) (Brennan, J\u201e dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b671-13\">. <em>E. g., </em>spouse taking employment necessitating family relocation. Such information apparently came by voluntary disclosure or upon specific inquiry. None was officially compelled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b671-14\">. And a school official concluded that he was \u201csure\u201d there had been other cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b671-15\">. Statistical proof of actual applications is not of course indispensable to proving the disparate impact <em>prima facie </em>case, particularly where, as here, the action is individual and not class. Circumstantial evidence, complemented by judicial notice to show that a facially neutral policy must in the ordinary course have a disparate impact on a protected group of which an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>individual plaintiff is a member is often utilized. See, e. <em>g., Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, </em>434 U.S. 136, 98 S.Ct. 347, 54 L.Ed.2d 356 (1977). To require statistical proof involving a significant sample of actual applications of a policy to establish its disparate impact would always preclude the claim of a \u201cfirst impactee.\u201d Title VII of course cannot be read to yield such a result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">. That there is a critical distinction between the intended coverage and the proof requirements of \u00a7 703(a)(1) and (2) respectively was necessary to decision in <em>Satty, </em>where both a <em>Gilbert </em>-type exclusion of benefits and a <em>Griggs </em>-type imposition of burdens on a protected group by facially neutral policies were involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b673-6\">. In <em>Pennington, </em>the policies in question, although different in literal formulation and in thrust of application, came in the end to essentially the same thing as those in the instant case. In <em>Pennington </em>a pregnant teacher requested a 40-day maternity leave at the beginning of the next school year. This was denied on the basis of a written policy providing that, ordinarily, absences of 20 consecutive days\u2019 duration should be cause for termination, with reinstatement a matter of grace. The teacher was guaranteed instead reinstatement in the same or a comparable position no later than the first day of the school year following her certified physical fitness for full-time employment, and was in fact at that time reemployed teaching a different subject in which she was not as proficient. The evidence showed a consistent practice of reinstatement within the same year for other disabilities than pregnancy that led to absences of longer duration than 20 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\">. As indicated earlier in this opinion, the district court\u2019s finding of non-justification that un-dergirded its later withdrawn judgment for plaintiff was stated in terms of a failure to show that the challenged policy was \u201cnecessary to the normal operation of a school.\u201d In context, it seems apparent that this was in turn based upon the court\u2019s perception that plaintiffs arrangement for a substitute teacher completely met any necessity to provide continuity of instruction, this being the legitimate state educational interest advanced by the defendants as justification. While the \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense might be thought completely subsumed within the \u201clegitimate state educational interest\u201d defense plainly advanced by defendants and rejected by the district court, they are enough different in concept that we are not disposed to hold on this record that failure of proof of the latter necessarily precludes proof of the former. <em>Compare Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, </em>414 U.S. 632, 650, 94 S.Ct. 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (1974) (legitimate state interest) <em>with Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 431, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971) <em>and Robinson v. Lorillard Corp., </em>444 F.2d 791, 797-99 (4th Cir. 1971) (business necessity).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b674-5\">. Plaintiffs first claim, on which defendants were the prevailing parties until <em>LaFleur </em>necessitated our remand, was a constitutional claim for which the state interest defense was indisputably the appropriate one. Subsequent litigation was entirely upon the Title VII claim added in the interim. On this, the plaintiff was briefly the prevailing party, but on the authority of our <em>Gilbert </em>decision later reversed. It was during this interval that the district court\u2019s finding of \u201cnon-necessity to the operation of a school\u201d was in effect. Defendants never had a chance to challenge on appeal that finding of the district court because of the withdrawal of the judgment following the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal in <em>Gilbert. </em>From that point until this opinion was filed, the defense has not been in issue because the defendants have been the prevailing parties on a finding of no <em>prima facie </em>violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"AmD\">. Plaintiff\u2019s brief on this appeal maintained its consistent position that the Title VII claim can only be defeated by a showing of Griggs-type business necessity, and argued that on the facts of record defendants have failed to make the requisite showing. Defendants continued to rely in terms upon the legitimate state interest theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"AVx\">. Unless there are reasons not apparent of record, such a judgment would presumably include the award given in the withdrawn judgment of January 22, 1976, with such adjustment in costs and attorney\u2019s fees as the district court determines.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
