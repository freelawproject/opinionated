Appellants moved to enlarge the certified class. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">In July 1977, the district court ordered appellants\u2019 counsel to compile a list of the names and addresses of class members by making a search of Meridian\u2019s business records (1977 order).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">In November 1977, appellants learned that Meridian had a computer generated list of all of Meridian\u2019s 11,000 mortgagors, which list included between 1,650 and 4,000 names of mortgagors who are not within the certified class because they obtained their mortgages either before or after the specified period or from other companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-18\">Appellants filed a motion for permission to use the computer list for class notification purposes because it would cost between $16,000 and $24,000 less to use the computer list than to compile a class list from Meridian\u2019s files. Appellants agreed to include in the notice an explanation to help mortgagors determine whether they belong to the plaintiff class.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-19\">Meridian objected to the motion on the grounds that the computer list would confuse a great number of its customers, would require it to spend much time and money to answer inquiries generated by the notices and would damage Meridian\u2019s good will.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-20\">In July 1978, the district court denied appellants\u2019 motion and ordered them to comply with the 1977 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Appellants appeal from the July 1978 order. They assert that the district court failed to comply with Rule 23(c) Fed.R.Civ.P. which requires the court to \u201cdirect to the members of the class the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">We affirm on the ground that the order is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">We have \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts . . \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Appellants concede that the 1978 order is not a \u201cfinal decision,\u201d but they assert that the order is appealable under the doctrine announced in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan, </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">In <em>Cohen, </em>plaintiff brought a derivative action in federal court alleging that the directors and managers of the defendant corporation were guilty of fraud and mismanagement. Plaintiff and an intervenor together held about 0.0125% of the corporation\u2019s stock. Defendants moved to require plaintiff to post the security for costs required by a New Jersey statute which they asserted would amount to about $125,000. The district court denied the motion. Defendants sought immediate review of the question whether the state statute applied in federal court. The Supreme Court held that the district court order was appealable under \u00a7 1291, even though it was not a final decision, so that it could consider that issue. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-9\">\u201cThis [district court] decision appears to fall in that small class which finally determines claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225-1226.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">The Supreme Court has recently held that the <em>Cohen </em>exception, or \u201ccollateral order doctrine,\u201d applies only to orders which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-11\">\u201cconclusively determine the disputed question, resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and [are] effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2458, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">In that case, plaintiffs purchased shares in reliance on a prospectus issued by defendant accounting firm. Plaintiffs brought an action on behalf of themselves and other purchasers, alleging that defendants had violated federal securities laws. The district court certified a plaintiff class, but then decertified it. Plaintiffs sought immediate review of the decertification order, asserting that the order was appealable under the <em>Cohen </em>exception to \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">The Supreme Court held that the <em>Cohen </em>exception did not apply, because orders granting or denying class certification are subject to revision in the district court, and, unlike the order in <em>Cohen, </em>may effectively be reviewed even after final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">In <em>Weit v. Continental Illinois National Bank, </em>535 F.2d 1010 (7th Cir. 1976), plaintiffs in an antitrust class action sought to review an order determining the form of notice sent to class members. We found that the order did not involve a broad question of general applicability, and the propriety of the notice was an issue capable of review after the entire case was resolved in the district court. Regardless of whether plaintiffs prevailed on the merits, the district court could order the notification costs which were later held to have been improper. We held that the collateral order doctrine did not apply and that the district court order on the form of the notice was not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-15\">The issue here is the costs which appellants must incur to notify the plaintiff class. That is not \u201can important issue completely separate from the merits of this action.\u201d Nor does the 1978 order \u201cconclusively determine the disputed question.\u201d As in <em>Weit, </em>regardless of who prevails on the merits, if a court later decides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>appellants were improperly required to incur costs of the notice, the court can order appellees to reimburse them.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The 1978 order is not appealable under section 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">In the circumstances, we do not reach appellants\u2019 other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Appeal Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
