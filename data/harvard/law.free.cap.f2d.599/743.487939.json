We conclude that the holding of the district court was correct for the reasons stated in Judge Hand\u2019s well-reasoned opinion. 458 F.Supp. 123 (S.D.Ala.1978).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-4\">. The appellant claims that our decision in <em>Wilkinson v. Manpower, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 712 (5th Cir. 1976) shows that the district court erred in concluding that enforcement of the restrictive covenant would violate a fundamental public policy of Alabama. The short answer to this argument is that <em>Wilkinson </em>is inapposite. <em>Wilkinson </em>concerned the public policy of <em>Florida </em>with respect to its enforcement of restrictive covenants, and the fact that Florida and Alabama have very similar statutes dealing with restrictive covenants, <em>compare </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 8-1-1 <em>with </em>Fla.Stat. \u00a7 542.12, does not necessarily mean that they have the same public policy on this issue. Moreover, our review of Alabama cases convinces us that Alabama\u2019s statute on restrictive covenants, Ala.Code \u00a7 8-1-1, embodies a fundamental public policy of the state and that the enforcement of this restrictive covenant would violate that policy. <em>See Robinson v. Computer Servicenters, Inc., </em>346 So.2d 940, 943 (Ala. 1977); <em>Gant v. Warr, </em>286 Ala. 387, 240 So.2d 353, 355 (1970); <em>Hill v. Rice, </em>259 Ala. 587, 67 So.2d 789, 793 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
