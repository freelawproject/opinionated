He contends that at his guilty plea colloquy, he was not advised personally by the district court judge of the nature of the charges against him, or of the consequences of the imposition of a special parole term.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, he asserts that his rights under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were violated, and that he should be entitled to withdraw his original plea and plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>anew. We believe that this ease is controlled by <em>United States v. </em>Timmreck, U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 2085, 60 L.Ed.2d 634 (1979). Therefore, we affirm the denial of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">On June 12, 1975 a two count indictment was returned against Horsley, charging him with conspiracy to distribute heroin and with distribution of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1) (1976). Horsley pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count on April 29, 1976, at which time the district court judge conducted the guilty plea colloquy here challenged. Horsley was sentenced to six years imprisonment, plus a mandatory three year special parole term. He did not appeal from his judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">Fifteen months later, Horsley filed a ha-beas corpus petition, contending that he was entitled to withdraw his guilty plea because the judge who accepted the plea committed errors in the Rule 11 colloquy. The district court denied him relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-11\">Horsley\u2019s first contention on appeal is that he was not informed by the judge of the nature of the charges against him. His challenge arises out of the following exchanges during the guilty plea colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap2l\">By MR. ATKINS [Assistant U.S. Attorney]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-12\">Q. Mr. Horsley, have you received a copy of the indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-13\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-14\">Q. Okay. And have you read it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-15\">A. Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-16\">Q. And have you discussed it with your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-17\">A. Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-18\">Q. Okay. And do you understand what you are being charged with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-19\">A. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-20\">Q. Okay. Do you want the indictment read to you, or do you waive a formal reading of the indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-21\">MR. GAITENS [Defense Counsel]: We will waive the formal reading, your Hon- or. We have had an opportunity to examine it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-22\">THE COURT: And the Defendant says so too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-23\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-24\">THE COURT: You know what is in it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-25\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-26\">THE COURT: You have talked this over with your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-27\">THE DEFENDANT: I have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1353-28\">Shortly thereafter, the district court judge again directed questions to the defendant about the indictment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-29\">Q. And do you understand what the indictment says?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-30\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-31\">Q. And you do have the help of your counsel in explaining to you what the indictment means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-32\">A. Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-33\">Q. And what it charges and the consequences of a plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-34\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-35\">Q. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-36\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1353-37\">The final exchange relating to the indictment occurred as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-38\">[BY THE COURT]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-39\">Q. And from the presentence report, as I have the record before me, you refused to admit any guilt when questioned by the Probation Officer. Do you still refuse to admit your guilt\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-40\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-41\">Q. (continuing) \u2014 to count one here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-42\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-43\">Q. Then you have changed your mind in that regard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-44\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-45\">Q. And you now say that you are guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-46\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-47\">Q. Will you tell the Court why you pleaded guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-48\">A. Because I committed a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-49\">Q. Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-50\">A. Because I collaborated with another\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>Q. I don\u2019t understand you and I can\u2019t hear you. Louder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-4\">A. I say that I pleaded guilty because I was guilty of the charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-5\">Q. All right, you pleaded guilty because you are guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-6\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">Horsley also claims that he was not advised that the special parole term required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) &amp; 846, was in addition to, rather than instead of, the fine and/or term of imprisonment provided for by the statutes. During the Rule 11 colloquy, the only reference to the special parole term provision was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-8\">BY MR. ATKINS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-9\">Q. Mr. Horsley, are you aware that the possible maximum penalty on count one is a fine of not more than $25,000.00 or imprisonment for fifteen years, or both?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-10\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-11\">Q. And that it carries with it a three-year special parole term?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-12\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1354-13\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-15\">A. <em>The Nature of the Charge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-16\">The record demonstrates that the district court judge never explained to Horsley \u201cthe meaning of the charge and what basic acts must be proved to establish guilt.\u201d <em>Woodward v. United States, 426 </em>F.2d 959, 962-63 (3d Cir. 1970). The judge thus failed to comply with the requirement of Rule 11 that he \u201cpersonally\u201d inform the defendant of \u201cthe nature of the charge to whieh the plea is offered.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Horsley does not claim, however, that he did not <em>in fact </em>understand the nature of the charge to which he pled, or that, but for the court\u2019s failure to comply strictly with the Rule, he would not have pled guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, under the ruling of <em>United States v. </em>Timmreek,-U.S.-, 99 S.Ct. 2085, 60 L.Ed.2d 634 (1979), Horsley is not entitled to collateral relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-23\">In <em>Timmreek, </em>the petitioner moved, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, to vacate his sentence on the ground that the district court judge failed to inform him during the Rule 11 colloquy of the existence of the mandatory special parole term required by the applicable statute. The petitioner did not, however, allege any specific prejudice arising out of the asserted violation of the Rule. The Supreme Court denied his claim, holding that \u201ccollateral relief is not available when all that is shown is a failure to comply with the formal requirements of the Rule.\u201d - U.S. at -, 99 S.Ct. at 2088, quoting <em>Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 429, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962). The Court reasoned that habeas corpus relief is available only to protect against \u201ca fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice, [or] an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\u201d - U.S. at -, 99 S.Ct. at 2087, <em>quoting Hill, </em>368 U.S. at 428, 82 S.Ct. 468. And the Court concluded that petitioner could not claim that a \u201cfundamental\u201d defect or omission occurred when he did not \u201cargue that he was actually unaware of the special parole term or that, if he had been properly advised by the trial judge, he would not have pleaded guilty.\u201d - U.S. at -, 99 S.Ct. at 2087.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>We are convinced that no principled distinction between <em>Timmereck </em>and this case can be drawn. Thus, because Horsley failed to allege specific prejudice<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 i. e., failed to maintain that he did not understand the nature of the charge to which he pled, or that he would have pled not guilty but for the district court\u2019s error \u2014 collateral relief is not available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-4\">At argument, Horsley\u2019s counsel relied on <em>Horsley v. United States, </em>583 F.2d 670 (3rd Cir. 1978) <em>(Horsley I </em>),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which also involved a failure of the district court to comply with Rule ll\u2019s \u201cnature of the charge\u201d requirement, and which is factually indistinguishable from this case. In <em>Horsley I, </em>we recognized that under <em>Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974), a collateral attack cannot be successful unless the petitioner \u201csuffered prejudice\u201d as a result of error by the trial court. 583 F.2d at 672. We held, however, that \u201cprejudice inheres when an accused pleads guilty, thus convicting himself of a criminal offense, without understanding the significance or consequences of his action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673, <em>quoting Berry v. United States, </em>412 F.2d 189, 191 (3d Cir. 1969). Moreover, we created what was in effect an irrebuttable presumption that if the record does not show that the defendant was \u201capprised of facts that constitute commission of a crime,\u201d 583 F.2d at 674 n.6, then the defendant did not, for purposes of Rule 11, understand the nature of the offense to which he pled. In sum, <em>Horsley I </em>stands for the proposition that a defendant automatically suffers prejudice whenever the district court fails to comply with the \u201cnature of the charge\u201d provision of Rule 11. We conclude that this approach is inconsistent with <em>Timmreck, </em>and therefore we are compelled to reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">15. <em>The Consequences of the Special Parole Term</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-7\">Horsley also claims that the judge who accepted his guilty plea failed to advise him that the special parole term required by the statute was to be imposed in addition to, rather than in lieu of, a fine, imprisonment or ordinary parole. In addition, although Horsley does not raise this issue on appeal, the record indicates that the existence of the special parole term was mentioned at the colloquy by Assistant U.S. Attorney Atkins, and not by the judge himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">Even assuming, however, that a Rule 11 violation did occur \u2014 an assumption which we make for the sake of argument only \u2014 Horsley is plainly not entitled to collateral relief. In <em>Timmreck, </em>the judge omitted any <em>mention </em>during the Rule 11 colloquy of the mandatory special parole term. See - U.S. at -, 99 S.Ct. 2085. Yet, the Supreme Court held that this omission \u2014 surely greater than that which existed here \u2014 did not entitle the petitioner to habeas relief absent an allegation of actual prejudice. Because Horsley also failed to go forward with evidence of specific prejudice, <em>Timmreck </em>is dispositive of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-12\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1352-12\">. Horsley also claims that the district court erred in failing to determine whether he understood and consented to the plea bargain negotiated by his attorney on his behalf. We have reviewed this claim and find it to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1354-17\">. Rule 11(c)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-18\">Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court must address the defendant <em>personally </em>in open court and inform him of, and determine that he understands, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-19\">(1) <em>the nature of the charge </em>to which the plea is offered, the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law, if any, <em>and the maximum possible penalty provided by law. </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1354-32\">. Indeed, the record establishes that Horsley did read the indictment and discuss it with counsel, that Horsley informed the court that he understood the charge against him, and that Horsley stated that he was pleading guilty because he \u201ccollaborated with another,\u201d and because he \u201ccommitted a crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">. <em>Timmreck </em>plainly stands for the principle that the petitioner has the burden to produce evidence of actual prejudice. <em>Timmreck </em>is silent, however, regarding which party has the burden of persuasion if petitioner meets his production burden. We need not decide that question here, because Horsley failed to make any contention of actual prejudice, and because, regardless of which party had the burden of persuasion, the evidence was abundantly clear that Horsley suffered no specific prejudice. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Ag0U\">. Howard Horsley was also the defendant in <em>Horsley I, </em>although that case concerned a guilty plea to a different drug related indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
