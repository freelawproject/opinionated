The government\u2019s evidence pictured Walker as the leader by showing that he dictated which store was to be robbed, supplied one partner with a weapon and instructed him in its use, arranged for the other partner to drive the getaway car, directed which jewelry display cases to open, arranged the eventual escape and admonished them not to flee prematurely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-23\">Walker did not deny any of this. Instead, he pleaded insanity and introduced evidence both expert and lay, as to his mental condition at tile time of the crime. Two doctors testified that examinations of Walker revealed a paranoid character disorder and that on the date of the homicide he was not able to conform his conduct to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>law and unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">The government did not contradict the defendant\u2019s medical testimony. Instead, to prove his sanity circumstantially, it relied on the lay evidence showing Walker\u2019s calculated organization of the robbery. In addition it leaned heavily upon the \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d, a judicially created presumption that carries evidentiary weight in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">Walker appealed his conviction to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court; the court rejected his numerous assignments of error. <em>Commonwealth v. Walker, </em>370 Mass. 548, 350 N.E.2d 678 (1976). Walker then renewed his objections in this habeas corpus petition to the federal district court. Chief Judge Caffrey agreed with much of the reasoning of the Supreme Judicial Court and denied the petition. It is this denial that is now before this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">The defendant argues as errors, the trial judge\u2019s instructions as to the \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d and two procedures ^employed in the trial as ordered by the court, <em>i. e., </em>that defendant personally exercise his peremptory challenges and not sit at counsel table but be confined, in the \u201cprisoner\u2019s dock\u201d throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">The judge followed Massachusetts practice and required defendant to exercise his peremptory challenges personally after consulting with his lawyer. Defendant\u2019s lawyer, noting that sanity was the critical issue in this case, objected to this practice. It further developed that during his closing argument, the prosecutor, in what was later described as unprofessional conduct, highlighted Walker\u2019s personal exercise of the peremptory challenges and utilized them as evidence of Walker\u2019s sanity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-8\">Ask yourself about this particular defendant. What do you think? Do you think he knew what he was doing when he stood up there and said, \u201cI am content with this juror? I am content with this juror? I am content with this juror?\u201d Do you think he knew what he was doing then?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-11\">Walker\u2019s attorney also objected to this pros-ecutorial tactic and requested a specific cautionary instruction which was not granted. Instead, the trial judge informed the jury that the petitioner was required to make the challenges and gave a generalized instruction which noted that either lawyer\u2019s arguments were not to be considered as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-12\">Defendant\u2019s counsel likewise objected when the trial judge confined Walker to the prisoner\u2019s dock. Massachusetts practice allows a judge to utilize his discretion as to this practice and, in the present case, the court apparently required its use as it had done in all first degree murder trials. The prisoner\u2019s dock is described as being about four feet square and four feet high, open at the top so that the defendant\u2019s head and shoulders can be seen by the jury. The lawyer may freely go to the box to consult with his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-13\">Finally, Walker\u2019s counsel also objected to various portions of the lengthy jury charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-14\">At the outset of the charge, the trial judge attempted to explain to the jurors why the defendant had taken exceptions to evidentiary rulings during the trial, although the government had not. In explaining that the defendant had the right to except to a ruling in order to preserve the point for appeal, the judge noted that only the defendant had a right to an appeal; this jury instruction was accompanied by cautionary language demanding that the jury\u2019s verdict be free of surmise, conjecture, bias, or hostility. As the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court suggested, such mention of the appellate mechanics is unwise. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>350 N.E.2d 678, 687 (1976). However, the language and context of this particular instruction evidences an intent to protect the defendant from any jury confusion or hostility that may have been aroused by the frequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>taking of exceptions. Such an instruction is not unduly prejudicial and is not an error of constitutional magnitude. <em>See Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">The judge began his discussion of the sanity issue by describing the conclusive effect of the \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d when the defendant fails to make sanity an issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These comments were merely introductory and, when taken in context, might be considered superfluous, but not unduly prejudicial. <em>Cupp v. Naughten, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">The judge then emphasized that the jury must \u201cconsider and look at the whole evidence regarding the mental condition of the defendant.\u201d In this vein, the judge noted that the expert testimony was valuable evidence but that the medical opinions were not binding upon the jury; as the \u201csole judges of the credibility and weight of all evidence on the issue of insanity\u201d, the jury \u201cmay believe, but is not compelled to believe, any . . testimony or opinion given by an expert\u201d. The jury was also told that \u201c[i]n assessing a defendant\u2019s mental responsibility for crime, the jury should weigh the fact that a great majority of men are sane and the probability that any particular man is sane\u201d. In applying this \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d to the present case, the judge reiterated \u201cit is for the jury to determine whether or not the fact that a great majority of men are sane and the probability that any particular man is sane may be deemed to outweigh the evidential value of any expert testimony that [a person] is insane\u201d. As to the burden of persuasion on this issue, the trial judge repeatedly noted that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving Walker legally sane beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-12\">Aside from the two superfluous instructions already addressed, Walker concedes that the judge\u2019s jury instruction and trial procedures fully complied with traditional Massachusetts practice and procedure. The petitioner, however, argues that the well established Massachusetts \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d relieves the state of its constitutional burden of proving defendant\u2019s sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). Defendant also asserts that confinement in the \u201cprisoner\u2019s dock\u201d during the trial erodes a defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence. Walker finally argues that the forced personal exercise of his peremptory challenges reflected upon his sanity and violated his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. We find this last contention sufficiently persuasive to require a granting of this habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-13\">\n<em>The Presumption of Sanity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-14\">Exactly what constitutes a presumption is a troubling question. In an attempt to describe presumptions, commentators have likened these evidentiary creatures to \u201cbursting bubbles\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and to \u201cbats of the law flitting in the twilight\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These analogies may be more colorful than illuminating. Surveying the law of presumption, Dean McCormick noted that the \u201cuse of the term presumption is only confusing\u201d. McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 346, at 830 (1972). <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number><em>also </em>Hecht &amp; Pinzler, Rebutting Presumptions: Order out of Chaos, 58 B.U.L.Rev. 527 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">Heeding Dean McCormick\u2019s warning, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, in a recent decision, carefully defined the operation of the \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d. <em>Commonwealth v. Kostka, </em>370 Mass. 516, 350 N.E.2d 444 (1976). Massachusetts courts have long held that once sanity is an issue the burden of proof rests upon the Commonwealth to prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>357 Mass. 168, 258 N.E.2d 13 (1970). The judicially created \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d, however, aids the Commonwealth in meeting this burden because the jury is always instructed to consider the presumption of sanity when weighing the evidence. Thus, Massachusetts adopts a minority position in that the \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d always remains, carrying \u201cevidential value\u201d, and may never be kept from the jury by introducing evidence of insanity. <em>Commonwealth v. Kostka, supra, </em>at 453. This definition of the \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d allows the Commonwealth to rely upon the presumption \u201cto meet its burden even in a case where there is uncontradicted expert testimony that the defendant was insane at the time he committed the crime in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">Instructing the jury to weigh this presumption necessarily lessens the government\u2019s burden of proof. The use of this evidentiary device can be viewed as artificially aiding the government in satisfying its burden of production or as diluting the standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. Either way, the standard of proof has been altered by a judicially created mechanism. The United States Supreme Court has often scrutinized presumptions that operate in such an evidentiary fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-9\">The Supreme Court has set down certain due process guidelines that must be met when a fact is to be presumed by a jury. In Leary v. <em>United States, </em>395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 .(1969), the Supreme Court held that a statutory presumption was arbitrary and unconstitutional \u201cunless it can at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 36, 89 S.Ct. at 1548. <em>See also Turner v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-10\">In light of the Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), that the due process clause \u201cprotects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime . . the Supreme Court has suggested that a presumption that supplies \u201c[a] fact necessary to constitute the crime\u201d must meet the reasonable doubt standard. Thus, <em>Barnes v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 837, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 37 L.Ed.2d 380 (1973), set forth a dual standard: \u201cif a statutory inference submitted to the jury as sufficient to support conviction satisfies the reasonable-doubt standard (that is, the evidence necessary to invoke the inference is sufficient for a rational juror to find the inferred fact beyond a reasonable doubt) as well as the more-likely-than-not standard, then it clearly accords with due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843, 93 S.Ct. at 2361.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>Despite the evidentiary effect of the Massachusetts \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d and the Supreme Court\u2019s careful review of presumptions in criminal cases, the particular presumption in this case need not meet the standards set forth in such cases as <em>Turner </em>and <em>Barnes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">The due process clause only requires that a state prove the essential elements of the crime charged. <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). If the presumption concerns a fact ancillary to the crime, such as an affirmative defense, there is no constitutional reason to demand that the logic giving rise to the presumption meet a certain due process or burden-of-proof standard. The Supreme Court underscored this point in <em>Patterson v. New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977). The Court emphasized that the earlier holding of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, supra, </em>still stood:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-6\"><em>Mullaney </em>surely held that a State must prove every ingredient of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, and that it may not shift the burden of proof to the defendant by presuming that ingredient upon proof of the other elements of the offense. This is true even though the State\u2019s practice, as in Maine, had been traditionally to the contrary. Such shifting of the burden of persuasion with respect to a fact which the State deems so important that it must be either proved or presumed is impermissible under the Due Process Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1165-10\"><em>Patterson v. New York, </em>432 U.S. at 215, 97 S.Ct. at 2330. In <em>Patterson, </em>however, the Court upheld a New York law designating insanity as an affirmative defense. The Court reasoned that sanity was not an essential ingredient of murder; a person could intentionally kill another person, \u201can act which it is not disputed the State may constitutionally criminalize and punish\u201d, without being completely sane. <em>Id. </em>at 209, 97 S.Ct. at 2326. Nor had the New York legislature deemed sanity so important to make it an ingredient that must be proven by the government. Instead, once the fundamental ingredients of the crime exist, the legislature may choose \u201cto recognize a factor [i. <em>e., </em>insanity] that mitigates the degree of criminality or punishment\u201d and place the burden of raising and proving this mitigating factor upon the defendant. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the government\u2019s burden of proof and any presumptions that may affect that burden are only constitutionally relevant if they relate to an indispensable \u201cingredient\u201d of the crime or an ancillary ingredient that the legislature has directed the government to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-11\"><em>Patterson </em>holds that sanity is not an essential, constitutional ingredient of the crime of murder. Nor has the Massachusetts legislature deemed sanity sufficiently important to statutorily designate it as an element of murder to be proven by the government beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>In fact, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, in an opinion foreshadowing the reasoning of <em>Patterson, </em>held that sanity is not an element of the Massachusetts crime of murder. <em>Commonwealth v. Kostka, supra, </em>at 455. The Massachusetts court stated: \u201cWe do not believe that a defendant\u2019s mental disease or defect . . . bears any \u2018necessary relationship to the existence or nonexistence of the required mental elements of the crime [charged].\u2019 <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 706, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455 n.15. Because neither the federal constitution nor Massachusetts law make sanity an ingredient of the crime of murder, the burden of proof on the issue of sanity and the effect that the Massachur setts \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d has on that burden do not raise constitutional questions. We must agree with the conclusion of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-5\">If sanity were an \u201celement\u201d of the crime charged, then recent Supreme Court cases on the use of presumptions and inferences to establish an element of the offense would be apposite to our inquiry. Because sanity is not an element of the crime charged, we do not think that cases like <em>Barnes v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 837, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 37 L.Ed.2d 380 (1973); <em>Turner v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970); and <em>Leary v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969), which concerned the use of statutory and common law inferences to establish an element of the crime charged, set forth the appropriate test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 455-56. <em>See also Commonwealth v. Walker, supra </em>at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-7\">\n<em>The Prisoner Dock</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-8\">Petitioner claims that his confinement to the prisoner dock unconstitutionally eroded his presumption of innocence in the eyes of the jury. Confinement in the prisoner dock is analogized to the wearing of prison garb during trial, a practice held unconstitutional in <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126, <em>reh. den., </em>426 U.S. 954, 96 S.Ct. 3182, 49 L.Ed.2d 1194 (1976). Petitioner argues that confinement in the prisoner dock served as a \u201cconstant reminder of the accused\u2019s condition [that] may affect a juror\u2019s judgment . . [and] is so likely to be a continuing influence throughout the trial that ... an unacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504-05, 96 S.Ct. at 1693.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-12\">The practice of isolating the accused in a four foot high box very well may affect a juror\u2019s objectivity. Confinement in a prisoner dock focuses attention on the accused and may create the impression that he is somehow different or dangerous. By treating the accused in this distinctive manner, a juror may be influenced throughout the trial. The impression created may well erode the presumption of innocence that every person is to enjoy. Of course, \u201c[t]he actual impact of a particular practice on the judgment of jurors cannot always be fully determined. But this Court has left no doubt that the probability of deleterious effects on fundamental rights calls for close judicial scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504, 96 S.Ct. at 1693.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-13\">We see no state policy sufficiently compelling or essential to justify risking a dilution in the accused\u2019s presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-14\">The Massachusetts courts and the federal district court found that this traditional practice of prisoner dock confinement served such state purposes as: identification of the accused person to the jury; minimizing the danger of harm to the public, court, and jury; and encouraging maintenance of courtroom order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-15\">From the record in this case, we cannot determine whether the practice of the prisoner dock realistically promoted the interests of safety or courtroom order. In any event, the use of a dock is hardly the most advanced or least restrictive means of insuring courtroom order and protection. This is not a case where the prisoner exhibited any dangerous and disruptive propensities at trial. <em>See Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>337, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970). Further, argument that the dock helped identify the accused is hardly persuasive. Prison clothing served identification purposes in <em>Estelle v. Williams, supra ; </em>yet, the Supreme Court found this to provide no justification for the practice. The defendant can be easily identified without using the dock. Thus, even if the state\u2019s purposes are rational on an abstract level, the use of a prisoner dock may not further those interests significantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">We must agree with District Judge Caf-frey in terming the prisoner\u2019s dock \u201can anachronism in a modern criminal trial which could have been abandoned years ago\u201d. <em>Walker v. Butterworth, </em>457 F.Supp. 1233 at 1239 (D.Mass.1978). The right to a fair trial is simply too delicate and valuable a right to be impeded by an anachronistic practice. Because confinement in the prisoner dock is unnecessary to accomplish any important state interest and may well dilute the presumption of innocence, the Massachusetts prisoner dock must be considered, as a general matter, to be an unconstitutional practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">The record is unclear as to whether this unconstitutional practice constituted harmful error in this case. Determining harmless error in such a case is always difficult because \u201c[t]he actual impact of a particular practice on the judgment of jurors cannot always be fully determined.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. at 504, 96 S.Ct. at 1693. It is true that the record reveals no evidence of prejudicial references to the defendant\u2019s confinement; yet, this is no guarantee that the jurors failed to be influenced by the prisoner dock. In such a situation, the objective record may often prove unenlightening, but a court should be ready to vindicate constitutional rights whenever an \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d is presented. <em>Id. </em>at 505, 96 S.Ct. 1691. Because we find other grounds upon which to grant this petition, however, we need not decide, from the rather bare record before us, whether the use of the prisoner dock produced a likelihood of harmful error in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-10\">\n<em>Personal Exercise of Peremptory Challenges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-11\">The trial judge, in keeping with traditional Massachusetts practice in a murder case, required Walker to personally exercise his peremptory challenges. Walker was allowed to consult with his attorney about each prospective juror but he was required, in the presence of each individual juror, to announce his decision personally. After the prosecutor emphasized petitioner\u2019s ability to make such peremptory challenges personally, the trial judge\u2019s charge did inform the jury that such personal challenges were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-12\">Both the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and the federal district court criticized the prosecutor\u2019s conduct as ill advised but rejected petitioner\u2019s contention that the required personal exercise of his challenges violated his privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-13\">These courts reasoned that the petitioner\u2019s peremptory challenges may have been probative as to his competency at the time of trial; but this forced communication was found to have little if any relation to the central issue of petitioner\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The federal district court also analogized petitioner\u2019s conduct to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>physical actions which possessed no testimonial or communicative content.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">We cannot accept this reasoning. In a case where sanity is the sole issue, the court\u2019s requirement that the petitioner personally exercise his peremptory challenges and the prosecution\u2019s subsequent emphasis on the conscious and knowing exercise of those challenges combined to violate petitioner\u2019s constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">There is no dispute that Walker was required, against his will and over his attorney\u2019s objection, to announce his objection or contentment as to each individual juror in front of that juror. Of course, the fact that the accused is forced to utter words does not, in itself, constitute self-incrimination. Recordings of an accused\u2019s voice are permissible if they are \u201cused solely to measure the physical properties of the witnesses\u2019 voices, not for the testimonial or communicative content of what was to be said\u201d. <em>United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. 1, 7, 93 S.Ct. 764, 768, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973). Likewise, requiring the uttering of words in a lineup, for purposes of identification rather than as a way of eliciting testimony, does not violate the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967). Nor has the fifth amendment ever prohibited the government from requiring the accused to supply some form of incriminating evidence. In <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), the Supreme Court allowed the government to introduce an incriminating blood sample involuntarily taken from the defendant. The Supreme Court noted that a distinction had emerged in the law of self-incrimination: \u201cthe privilege is a bar against compelling \u2018communications\u2019 or \u2018testimony,\u2019 but that compulsion which makes a suspect or accused the source of \u2018real or physical evidence\u2019 does not violate it.\u201d Id. at 764, 86 S.Ct. at 1832.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-8\">The critical question, for the purposes of the self-incrimination clause, is whether the forced utterances had communicative content. One can safely start with the premise that Walker\u2019s statements of objection or satisfaction were not typical testimony in the sense of narrating an occurrence or confessing guilt. The concept of verbal communication, however, is not limited to narration or direct confessions of guilt. Rather, verbal communication is the use of words to impart or transmit information. Walker\u2019s comments constitute such verbal communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-9\">Walker obviously was communicating his satisfaction with the individual jurors. More importantly, these forced words revealed Walker\u2019s mental process of evaluating each juror. In exercising these challenges, Walker was transmitting, against his will, an important message to the jury. Roughly translated, this message would read: \u201cthe accused can rationally and sanely communicate with his lawyer and make important trial decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Each juror was not measuring Walker\u2019s words for their \u201cphysical properties\u201d, <em>United States v. Dionisio, supra, </em>and the words were not being used for their identifying characteristics, <em>United States v. Wade, supra. </em>Taken in isolation, the words \u201cI am content with this juror\u201d mean little. But, in the context of an insanity defense, the words necessarily take on an additional meaning and relate important and incriminating information. The content of the words and the mental processes that they necessarily embodied and revealed, conveyed an inescapable mes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>sage to the jury. The message conveyed was directly relevant to the sole issue at trial and can be fairly defined as communication for the purposes of the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">Any doubts as to the communicative or testimonial nature of the peremptory challenges were resolved by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. The prosecutor had no doubt about the important statement that Walker\u2019s words conveyed. In highlighting the accused\u2019s personal exercise of the peremptory challenges, the prosecutor explicitly repeated the words spoken by Walker and attempted to utilize them as testimonial evidence bearing upon Walker\u2019s sanity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Requiring Walker to speak and seizing upon his words as constituting evidence against him, threatened the central values of the privilege against self-incrimination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1169-6\">[T]he constitutional foundation underlying the privilege is the respect a government \u2014 state or federal \u2014 must accord to the dignity and integrity of its citizens. To maintain a \u201cfair state-individual balance,\u201d to require the government \u201cto shoulder the entire load,\u201d 8 Wigmore, Evidence 317 (McNaughton rev. 1961), to respect the inviolability of the human personality, our accusatory system of criminal justice demands that the government seeking to punish an individual produce the evidence against him by its own independent labors, rather than by the cruel, simple expedient of compelling it from his own mouth. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>309 U.S. 227, 235-238, 60 S.Ct. 472, 476-477, 84 L.Ed. 716 (1940). In sum, the privilege is fulfilled only when the person is guaranteed the right \u201cto remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will.\u201d <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 8, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1493, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\"><em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 460, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1620, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-9\">Forcing one to exercise his peremptory challenges personally is hardly comparable to the practices of the Star Chamber. In the context of an insanity defense, however, the uttering of peremptory challenges reveals damaging inferences. In capitalizing upon Walker\u2019s utterances, the prosecutor was not producing evidence by his own independent labors but relying upon the simple expedient of compelling testimony from the accused. Walker simply was not provided the right \u201cto remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will.\u201d <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 8, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1493, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"ayt-dedup-1\">The present case is a far cry from cases holding that no fifth amendment violation exists when a court orders psychiatric examination of defendants pleading insanity. The legal arguments and theoretical justifications that support compelled psychiatric examination are completely inapplicable to this case. In a psychiatric examination, a neutral expert analyzes the defendant\u2019s statements, dreams and actions; the psychiatrist then correlates this information to medical postulates and issues a report. Although such an examination often requires compelled communication from the defendant, the courts find the resulting psychiatric analysis sufficiently neutral and buffered by expertise to equate it with the medical examination of physical characteristics upheld in <em>Schmerber, supra. See, e. g., United States v. Baird, </em>414 F.2d 700 (2d Cir. 1969). These courts recognize that expert examination of the defendant who pleads insanity is one of the few methods of obtaining scientific, reliable evidence on the issue. <em>See, e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Bohle, </em>445 F.2d 54, 66 (7th Cir. 1971); <em>United States v. Handy, </em>454 F.2d 885 (5th Cir. 1971). Even though compelled communication is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>volved, the psychiatric examinations are constitutionally permissible because the \u201cgreat importance of expert testimony on the issue of insanity\u201d outweighs \u201cthe minimal risk to the Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d <em>United States v. Bohle, </em>445 F.2d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">Compared to the rationale supporting compelled psychiatric examinations, this case presents almost the reverse situation. The prosecutor decided not to introduce any expert testimony but instead relied, in part, on the defendant\u2019s personal exercise of peremptory challenges. The forced statements in this case went directly to the jury; the lack of any expert evaluation or guidance made these statements extremely unreliable and prejudicial. Indeed, because these comments were compelled, they are not evidence of any rational decisional process; yet, to each juror the appearance of the defendant uttering these words and apparently making important trial decisions was both damaging and misleading. The prosecutor\u2019s comments exacerbated the situation. This series of events threatened one of the key purposes behind the self-incrimination clause: protection against forced, unreliable evidence. <em>Murphy v. Waterfront Comm\u2019n, </em>378 U.S. 52, 55, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">This is not a situation where there is an important interest to be served by permitting reliable and expert evidence. In fact, no rational purpose supports the archaic practice of compelling a defendant to personally exercise peremptory challenges.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>' When the prosecution spurns expert testimony and relies upon compelled statements which transmit an extremely unreliable message, there is a substantial risk to the fifth amendment privilege. In light of this risk and the lack of any countervailing purpose, the constitutional balance is struck differently than in such cases as <em>Bohle, supra. </em>When sanity is an issue, the practice of requiring and allowing comment on the personal exercise of peremptory challenges unconstitutionally infringes the accused\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-9\">This constitutional violation cannot be overlooked by asserting that Walker\u2019s utterances were only probative of his competency at the time of trial. Almost inevitably, evidence of defendant\u2019s current mental abilities carried inferential weight as to his past mental condition. The actual impact of the defendant\u2019s utterances on the jury cannot be measured. The prosecutor certainly recognized that demonstrating sanity at the time of trial might well persuade the jury of the accused\u2019s sanity at the time of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-10\">The personal exercise of the peremptory challenges communicated damaging information to the jury. Even so, the Commonwealth argues, the accused\u2019s expressions or actions in the courtroom could have communicated the same information. Maybe so, but this argument misses the point. Unlike expressions or actions, the challenges were compelled. The defendant could not control the words or conceal the thought process that they revealed... This compulsion, for the purposestef the privilege against self-incrimination, makes all the difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-11\">We must conclude that \u00a1the compelled utterances conveyed important and relevant information to the jury./ The prosecutor insured that the utterances conveyed the message of the accused\u2019s sanity; the sanity of the accused was the sole issue at trial. In the context of this case, such a combination of occurrences violated Walker\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination and denied him a fair trial. The trial judge\u2019s well intentioned, but highly generalized, charge could not adequately remedy the constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-12\">Recognizing that the privilege against self-incrimination is an essential mainstay of our adversary system and a hallmark of our society, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-13\">The writ of habeas corpus shall issue unless the Commonwealth makes arrangements for a new trial within ninety days.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1162-15\">. The petitioner renewed all his present claims at each appellate stage. Both sides agree that exhaustion is not an issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1163-8\">. The \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d does place the burden of production, or burden of \u201cgoing forward\u201d with the evidence, upon the defendant. Thus, the defendant must raise the issue of insanity by introducing some supporting evidence. If defendant fails to raise the issue, he is conclusively presumed sane. The defendant in this case does not challenge this particular aspect of the presumption. Defendant contests the effect that the presumption has on the government\u2019s burden of persuasion once the issue of sanity is properly raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1163-9\">. <em>See </em>J. Thayer, A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at Common Law, 313-52 (1898).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1163-15\">. 9 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2491. <em>See also </em>Boh-len, The Effect of Rebuttable Presumptions of Law Upon the Burden of Proof, 68 U.Pa.L.Rev. 307, 314 (1920) where presumptions are described: \u201cLike Maeterlinck\u2019s male bee, having functioned they disappear.\u201d Judges have also discussed, and sometimes confused, the law of presumptions. Referring to the law of presumptions, Learned Hand complained: \u201cJudges have mixed it up until nobody can tell what on earth it means. . . 18 ALI Proceedings 217-18 (1941).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">. In dismissing Walker\u2019s appeal the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court stressed that the \u201cpresumption\u201d itself was not evidence, <em>Commonwealth v. Walker, </em>350 N.E.2d 678, 700 (1976); rather, the jury was to \u201cweigh the facts underlying the presumption and the inferences that may follow from [the] facts . . . <em>Commonwealth v. Kostka, </em>350 N.E.2d 444, 454 (1976). Whether the \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d is an inference or a presumption or a creature possessing \u201ccharacteristics of both presumptions and inferences\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 454, makes no constitutional difference. The Supreme Court has chosen to scrutinize presumptions and inferences identically if they operate to shift the burden of production and are to be given evi-dentiary weight by a jury in criminal cases. <em>See Barnes v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 837, 841-45, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 37 L.Ed.2d 380 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"a5b-dedup-0\">' The <em>Barnes </em>case concerned the traditional common law inference that knowledge necessary for conviction may be drawn from the unexplained possession of recently stolen goods. As with the statutory presumptions involved in <em>Leary </em>and <em>Turner, </em>this \u201cinference\u201d operated to shift the burden of producing re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>butting evidence onto the defendant. All three of the above cases are similar to the present case in that the jury was clearly instructed that they were permitted, but not required to find the presumed fact.</p>\n<p id=\"avt-dedup-1\">The Supreme Court made no distinction between the <em>Barnes </em>common law \u201cinference\u201d and a statutory presumption. In fact, the Court appeared to use the two terms interchangeably.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1165-9\">. The requirement that the government prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt is a judicial doctrine. <em>See e. g., Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em>188 Mass. 382, 74 N.E. 939 (1905). This standard must be considered in context with another long-established judicial doctrine, the \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d. Even if one finds that the presumption reduces the government\u2019s burden of proof on the issue of sanity to something less than \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d, the burden of proof is strictly a judicially created standard in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"aor-dedup-0\">This is not a case where the legislature has balanced competing concerns and designated sanity as an element (or ingredient) of the crime, only to have a state court dilute that standard by creating an evidentiary presumption. <em>Patterson </em>primarily was concerned with allowing the legislative branch sufficient leeway to define mitigating factors that affect criminality. 432 U.S. at 210, 97 S.Ct. 2319. That decision does not authorize judicial modification of a legislature\u2019s evidentiary standard. Once the legislature designates a fact to be proven \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d by the government, an expectation is created and the fact must be proven in accord with the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>tive standard and due process. 432 U.S. at 215, 97 S.Ct. 2319. When the legislature is silent, however, traditional judicial evidentiary standards are controlling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">. Judge Bownes would find reversible constitutional error in the use of the prisoner dock. Judge Coffin shares the writer\u2019s concerns about the serious constitutional questions raised by the use of the prisoner dock in this case but would reserve decision on the issue until such time as it is necessary for the disposition of an appeal. Accordingly, Judge Coffin does not join in the portion of the opinion dealing with the prisoner\u2019s dock.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">. As both courts noted, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court had used similar reasoning in rejecting a nearly identical self-incrimination claim at a much earlier date. <em>Commonwealth v.

Of course, this transmitted message might be completely erroneous. Forcing one to exercise his peremptory challenges personally may well produce a dangerously incorrect impression of sanity precisely because the person is not communicating with entire independence and under his own free will. The likelihood that the message transmitted may be erroneous argues for applying the protections of the fifth amendment. Prohibiting the inherent unreliability of forced communication is an important policy reflected in the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>See Murphy v.
