Plaintiff seeks declaratory, monetary and injunctive relief because of alleged denial of substantive and procedural due process in connection with the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles\u2019 consideration of his eligibility for parole. His major complaints are that (1) his past criminal record was considered by the board; (2) he was not allowed to appear and present evidence; (3) he was not given the minutes of the meeting; (4) he was not permitted to challenge the board\u2019s decision; and (5) the board has established a discriminatory scheme to determine parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">Correctly applying fifth circuit precedents, the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-16\">Subsequently, the Supreme Court announced its opinion in <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979). <em>Greenholtz </em>is in general accord with prior decisions of this circuit. It held, however, that the expectancy of release provided in the Nebraska parole statute then under review was entitled to a measure of constitutional protection. Significantly, the court also stated \u201c. . whether any other state statute provides a protectible entitlement must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 99 S.Ct. at 2106. The analysis of the Texas statute required in this case can better be conducted initially by the district court rather than on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-21\">The case comes to us only on plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Leave to Proceed on Appeal In Forma Pauperis, but it is now ripe for summary disposition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion is granted; the clerk is instructed to docket the case; the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings. Specifically contemplated is a determination of the effect, if any, of <em>Greenholtz </em>under the Texas statute. Texas Adult Probation, Parole and Mandatory Supervision Law, Tex.Code Crim.Proc. art. 42.12 (Vernon\u2019s 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-22\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-23\">. <em>See Groendyke Transport, Inc. v.
