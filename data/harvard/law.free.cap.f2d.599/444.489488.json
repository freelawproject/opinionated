The court held that plaintiff (appellant) had not overcome the presumption of correctness of the classification of the imported figures as \u201cmodels\u201d under TSUS item 737.15, and had not proven correct its claimed classification as \u201ccharts\u201d under TSUS 273.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Upon thorough consideration of the record, briefs, and oral arguments, we are in full agreement with the opinion of Judge Maletz and adopt it as our own, adding only the following comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cuse is a relevant factor in establishing <em>vel non </em>the identity of the article as a \u2018model,\u2019 \u201d is without merit. The common meaning of \u201cmodel,\u201d as used in TSUS 737.15, and as established by the record evidence and dictionary definitions, neither entails nor requires consideration of the article\u2019s use. The general rule precluding consideration of use in eo nomine d\u00e9signations applies here. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Quon Quon Company, </em>46 CCPA 70, 72-73, C.A.D. 699 (1959); <em>F.W. Myers &amp; Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>24 Cust.Ct. 178, 184-85, C.D. 1228 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Appellant\u2019s contention that Congress did not intend that the present models provisions should apply to representations of animate objects such as the imported human figures is not supported by legislative history. The <em>Tariff Classification Study, </em>Schedule 7, 292 (1960) states that under the Tariff Act of 1930, \u201cmodels of inventions and other improvements in the arts\u201d were specifically provided for, while the types of models now provided for in items 737.07, 737.09, and 737.15 were dutiable as children\u2019s toys or under various \u201cbasket\u201d provisions. Although one purpose of the present provisions was to eliminate disputes over \u201cwhether certain models, particularly trains, are \u2018toys\u2019 for children or \u2018models\u2019 for the use of hobbyists,\u201d the provisions encompass all models and do not differentiate between the animate and inanimate. The cases cited by appellant, <em>Associated Hobby Manufacturers, Inc. v. United States, </em>475 F.2d 654, 60 CCPA 121, C.A.D. 1093 (1973), <em>Hudson Shipping Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>75 Cust.Ct. 26, C.D. 4606 (1975), and <em>Polk\u2019s Model Craft Hobbies, Inc. v. United States, </em>42 Cust.Ct. 103, C.D. 2073 (1959), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>47 CCPA 137, C.A.D. 746 (1960), are not controlling. Those cases involved different articles and different competing tariff provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our present conclusion is confirmed by the statement in 4 <em>Summaries of Trade and Tariff Information, </em>Schedule 7, 171 (1968), that \u201c[mjodels are three dimensional representations of objects such as * * * the human anatomy * *</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">In support of its burden of proving the imported figures charts, appellant points to hand-drawn lines on the figures and to the manual accompanying the figures, asserting that each satisfies the \u201cprinted matter\u201d requirement of Schedule 2, part 5, Headnote 1. However, the hand-drawn lines are drawn on machine-made lines embossed on the figures. Thus the hand-drawn lines do not constitute the requisite \u201ctextual or pictorial matter,\u201d but are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u201cemployed mainly for coloration.\u201d Although appellant\u2019s testimony indicated that the figures would be useless without the accompanying explanatory manuals, the manuals are not themselves alleged to be charts. The evidence as a whole indicates that a manual may accompany either a model or a chart, as those terms are commonly understood, and the presence of the manual cannot therefore control the designation of the imported figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Customs Court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-12\">. Appellant also points to two Customs Bureau rulings, 99 Treas.Dec. 105, T.D. 56111(56) (1964) and 99 Treas.Dec. 476, T.D. 56237(19) (1964), that anatomical or biological models were classifiable as rubber or plastic articles, not specifically provided for. We note that in a later Customs Bureau ruling, 101 Treas.Dec. 437, T.D. 66-157(23) (1966), anatomical models were classified as \u201cOther models\u201d under TSUS 737.15.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
