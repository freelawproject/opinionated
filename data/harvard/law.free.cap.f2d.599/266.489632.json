Compiled Laws Ann. \u00a7 22-18-14. While incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution at Englewood, Colorado, he filed a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the court which had imposed his sentence. This appeal followed denial of the motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"ALu\">Janis alleges commitment for treatment and supervision under 'the Federal Youth Corrections Act, <em>id., </em>was a promise made in his plea bargain agreement. Because the Englewood institution allegedly does not meet the criteria set forth in the Act, Janis claims he should be allowed to withdraw his plea and, due to the time he has already served, be released.</p>\n<p id=\"ABS\">It is evident from Janis\u2019 allegations that he does not challenge the imposition or legality of his sentence, but its execution. <em>See United States v. DiRusso, </em>535 F.2d 673, 676 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>Robinson v. United States, </em>474 F.2d 1085, 1091 (10th Cir. 1973); <em>Mordecai v. United States, </em>137 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 204-205, 421 F.2d 1133, 1139-1140 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 977, 90 S.Ct. 1098, 25 L.Ed.2d 272 (1970). Accordingly, his claim is not cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>United States v. Monteer, </em>556 F.2d 880 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>Lee v. United States, </em>501 F.2d 494 (8th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 a claim may be asserted where personal jurisdiction may be obtained over Janis\u2019 custodian, whether the warden of the Englewood, Colorado institution or the United States Bureau of Prisons. <em>United States v. Monteer, supra </em>at 881; <em>Lee v. United States, supra </em>at 501. The jurisdictional requirement was not met below.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand with directions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction without prejudice to filing the petition in the proper forum.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
