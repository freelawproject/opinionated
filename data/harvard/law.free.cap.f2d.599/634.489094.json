Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et </em>al., 5 Cir., 1970, 430 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b720-23\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b720-24\">In this diversity case decided under Texas substantive law, a carefully instructed jury found that defendant had knowingly made a false statement to the sheriff in violation of a state statute, Tex.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 37.08, which resulted in the incarceration of plaintiff, who was almost immediately released when the charges were dismissed. It assessed $10,000 against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-25\">The controlling issue on appeal is whether there is such a cause of action in Texas. Plaintiff has cited no cases which hold there is such a cause of action. Defendant, asserting that in Texas there is no civil cause of action for violation of Tex.Penal Code <em>* </em>Ann. \u00a7 37.08, absent all the elements of malicious prosecution, has cited no cases supporting his position. The trial judge denied two motions for directed verdict and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict against the argument that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>had not proven all of the elements of malicious prosecution, without which, defendant argued, there is no civil cause of action for violation of the state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In the absence of controlling state authority, the interpretation of state law by a local federal trial judge must be accorded great weight. 1A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 1309[2] at 3125-3129 (2d ed. 1965); <em>Wren v. New York Life Insurance Co., </em>493 F.2d 839, 841 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>Insurance Co. of North America v. English, </em>395 F.2d 854, 860 (5th Cir. 1968). <em>See also Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co., </em>350 U.S. 198, 204, 76 S.Ct. 273, 100 L.Ed. 199 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The burden of appellant on appeal is to persuade the appellate court that the trial judge committed an error of law. <em>See Gardner v. California, </em>393 U.S. 367, 370, 21 L.Ed.2d 601 (1969); <em>Eastern States Petroleum Co. v. Gilliland Refining Co., </em>103 F.2d 186, 187 (5th Cir. 1939). We are not so persuaded in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
