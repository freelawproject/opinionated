Each then filed a motion to vacate sentence and set aside his guilty plea, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">The motions, which are identical, allege that because of the erroneous denial of their motions to discover the identity of informants upon whose affidavits a wiretap application was based, appellants were unable to pursue their only defense \u2014 suppression of wiretap evidence. They contend that as a result they were forced to plead guilty and receive a lesser sentence or receive a longer sentence following trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">The district court denied the motions without holding a hearing. It held the pleas were not involuntary because they were motivated by the strength of the prosecution\u2019s evidence, even though the appellants considered the evidence inadmissible. <em>See Tucker v. United States, </em>470 F.2d 220 (8th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>412 U.S. 929, 93 S.Ct. 2758, 37 L.Ed.2d 157 (1973). When construed as a challenge to the merits of the pretrial orders, the court ruled the allegations did not present grounds for relief because a voluntary plea of guilty waives all nonjurisdictional defects. <em>Id. </em>at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-17\">We find no error and therefore affirm on the basis of the well reasoned district court opinion. 8th Cir.R. 9(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
