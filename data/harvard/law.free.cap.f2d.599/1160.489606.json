One provision <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is designed to protect the interests of debtors, the other<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is intended to safeguard the rights of creditors. In an effort to harmonize these seemingly discordant segments of the law, we reverse and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-17\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-18\">The Bohack Corporation (Bohack) filed a petition for an arrangement with the bankruptcy court pursuant to Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq., </em>on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>July 30, 1974. The petition was granted by order of the same date, and Bohack was continued as debtor-in-possession. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 742. In conformance with \u00a7 314 of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 714 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Rule 11-44, Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the bankruptcy court\u2019s order included a provision expressly staying the initiation or continuation of all suits and claims against the debtor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The appellant, Borden, Inc., on November 13, 1974, filed a proof of claim for $451,198.86 representing goods sold and delivered prior to the initiation of the proceedings in arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Some two years later, Bohack, together with various other plaintiffs, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York charging Borden and other major sugar refiners with violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Borden answered the complaint and interposed a counterclaim for the $451,198.86 originally sought under the proof of claim. Borden did not at any time during the course of this proceeding seek to obtain relief from the stay imposed by the bankruptcy court\u2019s order and Rule 11-44. On March 18, 1977, the action was transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for consolidated pre-trial proceedings by the judicial panel on multi-district litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">Bohack moved in the antitrust action for an order dismissing Borden\u2019s counterclaim, arguing that the district court, by virtue of the Rule 11-44 stay, was without subject matter jurisdiction. In the alternative, Bo-hack argued that the debt underlying Borden\u2019s claim was not mutual, and thus could not be asserted as a setoff pursuant to \u00a7 68 of the Act. Borden opposed, but the court decided the motion in favor of Bohack, Borden, however, successfully moved for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">While the issue remained <em>sub judice, </em>Bo-hack filed suit in the bankruptcy court seeking an order enjoining the continued prosecution of the counterclaim. The bankruptcy judge, anchoring his ruling on precepts of exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 311 of the Bankruptcy Act, reasoned that the antitrust court\u2019s concurrent consideration of the claim would unnecessarily frac-tionalize the arrangement proceeding. With the filing of the proof of claim, the court ruled, Borden consented to the bankruptcy court\u2019s exclusive, summary jurisdiction and was bound by the automatic stay embodied in Rule 11-44 and the court\u2019s separate restraining order. The bankruptcy judge further found that Borden was estopped from asserting the claim before the antitrust court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-12\">On the basis of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, the district judge in the antitrust matter entered an order dismissing the counterclaim without prejudice to any rights Borden might have to appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-13\">The district judge below affirmed the bankruptcy court but did not rely on exclusive jurisdiction as the legal basis of his decision. The district court\u2019s ruling was primarily based upon his determination that \u00a7 68 of the Act, which permits a creditor to set off mutual debts with a debtor, is permissive in nature and subject to the discretion of the court. The district judge concluded that the bankruptcy court could, in an appropriate exercise of discretion, defer or deny a setoff on equitable grounds. He then went on to analyze the equities involved in permitting Borden\u2019s counterclaim to be interposed in the antitrust action to examine whether the denial of the counterclaim by the bankruptcy judge had been an abuse of discretion. In a thoughtful and comprehensive decision, the district judge cited the potential for delays in the antitrust litigation and the potential for complication of that already complex lawsuit and concluded that there had been no such abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>Borden appeals from the decision of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order restraining and enjoining Borden from continuing the prosecution of its counterclaim in the antitrust litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"A2NN\">Bohack relies primarily on the exclusive jurisdiction approach adopted by the bankruptcy court. Section 311 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 711, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-5\">Where not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, the [bankruptcy] court . . . shall . . . have exclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and his property, wherever located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"azx-dedup-0\">Section 311 contemplates the centralization of all matters affecting the debt- or into one tribunal. <em>Fidelity Mortgage Investors v. Camelia Builders, Inc., </em>550 F.2d 47 (2nd Cir. 1976). The intent and design of Chapter XI makes the need for exclusive jurisdiction compelling. Unlike ordinary bankruptcy, where liquidation is the object, the purpose of an arrangement is to revive a moribund business, not to bury it. See <em>Susquehanna Chemical Corp. v. Producers Bank and Trust Co., </em>174 F.2d 783 (3rd Cir. 1949). In order to achieve this goal without interference, the bankruptcy court\u2019s action must be swift and its jurisdiction unfettered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">Accordingly, the bankruptcy court herein held that it had exclusive, summary jurisdiction over Borden\u2019s counterclaim and further found that Borden consented to such jurisdiction by filing its claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge did not discuss the merits of Borden\u2019s counterclaim, nor indicate whether or not the setoff might be preserved within the context of the arrangement proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-9\">Under the circumstances of this ease we do not believe that assertion of exclusive jurisdiction would be correct without first considering the equities of Borden\u2019s \u00a7 68 claim. It is unquestioned that the Chapter XI court must be assured of its ability to exercise exclusive jurisdiction in appropriate cases. However, despite dogmatic assertions that \u201cexclusive jurisdiction means exclusive jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Fritz v. United States, </em>535 F.2d 1192 (9th Cir. 1976) the exercise of such jurisdiction is not mandatory. The bankruptcy court must have the discretion to determine, under the particular circumstances of each case, whether it or another court is the most efficacious and equitable forum for resolution of the controversy; otherwise it becomes imprisoned within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-12\">The boundaries of the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction halve not been rigidly delineated by Congress. There is inherent flexibility in the language of \u00a7 311 which confers exclusive jurisdiction \u201cwhere not inconsistent\u201d with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. The Supreme Court has counseled that the exact scope of summary jurisdiction in bankruptcy is a matter to be determined after due consideration of the structure and purpose of the Bankruptcy Act as a whole, as well as the particular provisions of the Act brought into question. <em>Katchen v. Landy, </em>382 U.S. 323, 328, 86 S.Ct. 467, 15 L.Ed.2d 391 (1965). Accordingly, resolution of this controversy should not rest on the jurisdictional issue alone. The ramifications of Borden\u2019s alleged right of setoff must first be explored in order to determine the effect of an exercise of exclusive jurisdiction on the equities of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-13\">THE DOCTRINE OF SETOFF</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-14\">The doctrine of setoff has long occupied a favored position in our history of jurisprudence. It originated in the antiquity of Roman law and was later adopted into the English legal system. See Loyd, <em>The Development of Setoff, </em>64 U.Pa.L.Rev. 541 (1916). It was incorporated into the English bankruptcy scheme in 1705 and became a recognized doctrine of American bankruptcy law with the passage of the Act of 1800. 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 68.01 (14th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>Ed. 1975). Today, the doctrine of setoff is preserved in \u00a7 68 of the Act which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-5\">In all cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between the estate of a bankrupt and a creditor the account shall be stated and one debt shall be set off against the other, and the balance only shall be allowed or paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">Although proceedings in bankruptcy are equitable in nature, the dominant impulse of \u00a7 68 is inequality among creditors. <em>In re Applied Logic Corp., </em>576 F.2d 952 (2nd Cir. 1978). A setoff has the effect of paying one creditor more than another. Despite the preferential advantages bestowed upon certain creditors by virtue of \u00a7 68, setoffs are accepted and approved because they are based upon long-recognized rights of mutual debtors. Although \u00a7 68 is permissive rather than mandatory, the Supreme Court has held that when the statutory provision is relied upon by a creditor, it .should be enforced by the court. <em>Cumberland Glass Manufacturing Company v. DeWitt and Company, </em>237 U.S. 447, 455, 35 S.Ct. 636, 59 L.Ed. 1042 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">Allowance or disallowance of a set-off is a decision which ultimately rests in the sound discretion of the bankruptcy court. This circuit, however, has repeatedly favored the allowance of setoffs. In <em>In re Applied Logic Corp., supra, </em>a bank was permitted to exercise its right to set off a debt owed it by the bankrupt against deposits and certificates of deposit held by the bank. Judge Friendly commented therein that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-8\">[t]he rule allowing setoff, both before and after bankruptcy, is not one that courts are free to ignore when they think application would be \u201cunjust.\u201d It is a rule that has been embodied in every bankruptcy act the nation has had, and creditors . . . have long acted in reliance upon it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-10\">576 F.2d at 957-958.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1251-11\">In an earlier case Judge Friendly described an injunction against a setoff as \u201cstrong medicine.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Lehigh and Hudson River Railway Company, </em>468 F.2d 430, 434 (2nd Cir. 1972). And see <em>Tyler v. Marine Midland Trust Co. of New York, </em>128 F.2d 927 (2nd Cir. 1942). The policy of the Bankruptcy Act is to allow setoffs and counterclaims. <em>Western Land Planning Company v. Midland National Bank, </em>434 F.Supp. 616 (E.D.Wis.1977). This court is reluctant to disturb this policy unless compelling circumstances require it. A decision disallowing a setoff must not be made cavalierly. The statutory remedy of set off should be enforced unless the court finds after due reflection that allowance would not be consistent with the provisions and purposes of the Bankruptcy Act as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-13\">SETOFFS IN ARRANGEMENT PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-14\">Bohack contends that \u00a7 68 is not to be accorded the same favor in an arrangement proceeding as would be appropriate in the context of an ordinary bankruptcy case. An unqualified right of setoff in a Chapter XI proceeding might conceivably defeat the purpose of the arrangement. A setoff could deprive the debtor of all or a large part of its current assets at a time when it needs them most. <em>Susquehanna Chemical Corp. v. Producers Bank and Trust Co., supra. </em>In support of its position, Bohack relies on <em>Lowden v. Northwestern National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>298 U.S. 160, 56 S.Ct. 696, 80 L.Ed. 1114 (1936) and <em>Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, Inc., </em>417 U.S. 467, 94 S.Ct. 2504, 41 L.Ed.2d 243 (1974). Both cases involved railroad reorganizations pursuant to \u00a7 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 205. Reorganizations and arrangements are somewhat analogous in that the objective of both proceedings is the rehabilitation of a faltering business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-15\">In <em>Lowden </em>the Supreme Court indicated that principles of equity demand greater flexibility in railroad reorganizations than in ordinary bankruptcy and that the rigid rule of \u00a7 68 should not control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-16\">the trustees must have the power to gather in the assets and keep the business going. To exercise that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>power, they may find it necessary to sue, and the suit may turn upon the right of setoff . . . . In a suit for such a purpose, collateral to the m\u00e1in proceeding and initiated at a time when the outcome of that proceeding is still unknown and unknowable, \u00a7 68 of the statute does not control the disposition of the controversy <em>ex proprio vigore. </em>It governs, if at all, by indirection and analogy according to the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-5\">298 U.S. at 164, 56 S.Ct. at 698.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">In <em>Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, Inc., supra, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that the debtor in a reorganization must keep its precarious cash inflow sufficient for operating purposes in order to survive. Accordingly, the Court concluded that, as a general rule, setoffs should not be allowed in \u00a7 77 reorganizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">The district judge herein adopted the reasoning of the foregoing Supreme Court decisions and, paraphrasing <em>Lowden, </em>held that to the extent that \u00a7 68 governs the course of Chapter XI proceedings, it is by analogy only, and with due regard to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the case. In our view, the district judge erred in his construction of the law. The applicability of \u00a7 68 in arrangement proceedings is determined by statute, not by analogy. Section 302 of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, explicitly provides that specified portions of the Act, including \u00a7 68, are applicable in Chapter XI proceedings insofar as they are not inconsistent with or in conflict with the provisions of the chapter. To the contrary, no express approval of setoffs under \u00a7 68 appears in the statute governing \u00a7 77 reorganizations. <em>Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, Inc., supra </em>417 U.S. at 475, 94 S.Ct. 2504 (Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-9\">Consequently, we believe that the district court may have placed undue emphasis on what Judge Friendly has described as the \u201cvacuous pronouncement\u201d of the <em>Lowden </em>decision. <em>In the Matter of Lehigh and Hudson River Railway Company, supra </em>at 433. In <em>Tyler v. Marine Midland Trust Co. of New York, supra, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-10\">[WJere this ordinary bankruptcy, no question of the propriety of the setoff would arise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-11\">The question then becomes whether a different rule obtains because the debtor has proceeded under Chapter XI. . Nothing in Chapter XI indicates that \u00a7 68 and the right of setoff are inapplicable. . [the <em>Lowden </em>] case hardly goes so far as completely to deny application of the usual rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-13\">128 F.2d at 928.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1252-14\">We do not mean to suggest that the right to setoff in Chapter XI proceedings is unqualified; nor are we attempting to undermine the discretion of the bankruptcy court in determining the propriety of a setoff in a particular case. We merely wish to establish a framework within which to reach that decision. A setoff in the context of a Chapter XI arrangement should not be regarded with the disfavor accorded the remedy in the railroad reorganization cases of <em>Lowden </em>and <em>Baker. </em>Rather, a bankruptcy judge should be guided by decisions of this court favoring setoffs where statutorily authorized. The test for disallowance is that suggested by \u00a7 302, <em>i. e., </em>would application of \u00a7 68 be inconsistent with the provisions of Chapter XI? <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The question before us on this appeal, therefore, is whether Borden\u2019s pursuit of its counterclaim in the antitrust action is inconsistent with the provisions of Chapter XI, and more specifically, with Rule 11 \u2014 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>RULE 11-44</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\">Rule 11-414 provides that the filing of the Chapter XI petition shall operate as a stay of any action against the debtor or his property. Rule 11-44 supplements and reinforces the stay provisions of \u00a7 314 of the Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Prior to the enactment of Rule 11-44 a Chapter XI debtor could apply under \u00a7 314 for a discretionary order staying or enjoining suits against the debtor. Under Rule 11-44 the stay becomes automatic upon the filing of the petition. To obtain relief from the stay, a creditor may apply under Rule ll-44(d) to have such stay annulled, terminated or modified. Rule 11 \u2014 44 does not, however, alter the original purpose of \u00a7 314, <em>i. e., </em>to protect the debtor from harassment and from frustration of his rehabilitation by prejudicial dismemberment and diminution of his assets during the pendency of the Chapter XI proceeding. <em>Preferred Surfacing, Inc. v. Gwinnett Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>400 F.Supp. 280 (N.D.Ga.1975); <em>Teledyne Industries, Inc. v. Eon Corporation, </em>373 F.Supp. 191 (S.D.N.Y.1974), aff\u2019d <em>Teledyne Industries, Inc. v. Podell; </em>546 F.2d 495 (2nd Cir. 1976). The applicability of \u00a7 68 in the instant case depends upon whether the counterclaim in the antitrust proceeding would defeat this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">Where property of the debtor is in the possession of a creditor, the need to protect the debtor from an immediate exercise of a setoff is evident. In <em>Preferred Surfacing, Inc., supra, </em>for example, the debtor had a general checking account with the respondent bank. Shortly after the debtor filed its Chapter XI petition, the bank by means of setoff applied the sum on deposit against the amount of an outstanding indebtedness allegedly owed by the debtor to the bank. The bankruptcy court fully appreciated the devastating impact such a setoff could have on the arrangement proceeding and properly held the bank in contempt. In an ordinary bankruptcy, a bank may set off a deposit against an unmatured indebtedness even though done after the petition is filed. See generally, 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b668.02 (14th Ed. 1975). In a Chapter XI proceeding, however, where a business is struggling to resist bankruptcy, resort to such a unilateral, self-help remedy could thwart the arrangement entirely and push the debtor over the brink and into insolvency. Where an immediate setoff would seriously threaten the continued vitality of the debtor, the setoff should be deferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">This seemingly harsh course of not permitting a creditor to exercise a right that-would have been available in ordinary bankruptcy may be justified on the ground that the immediate sacrifice can be compensated, if the proceeding is successful, by appropriate recognition upon confirmation of the plan. <em>In Re Yale Express Systems, Inc., </em>362 F.2d 111, at 116. In some instances, the setoff may ultimately be denied, but at the outset of the proceeding the deferral of the setoff amounts to little more than a provisional sequestration to give protection for the future. <em>Lowden v. Northwestern National Bank &amp; Trust Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-10\">Rule 11-44 also reinforces the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court by protecting the debtor from the harassment of lawsuits initiated in other forums. If the debtor were subject to suit in various courts without restriction, the mere costs of defending itself could be debilitating, and a judgment could be fatal. See <em>Fidelity Mortgage Investors, supra. </em>Rule 11-44 facilitates an expeditious and economical arrangement by precluding fractionalization and thereby consolidating most claims within the insular proceedings in the Chapter XI court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-12\">The guidelines for determining whether a setoff is inconsistent with Chapter XI are far from definitive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>In other words, sometimes the setoff rule of Section 68 is to be applicable; at other times it is not. Whether it is or not depends upon the equities of the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1254-4\"><em>Susquehanna Chemical Corp. v. Producers Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>174 F.2d 783, 787 (3rd Cir. 1949).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">Our review of the equities of this situation persuades us that Borden\u2019s pursuit of its counterclaim in the antitrust litigation would not defeat the policies and purposes of Chapter XI and Rule 11-44. Initially, we must distinguish this case from the bulk of the cases arising under Rule 11-44 because here the antitrust lawsuit was initiated by Bohack. There is no issue, therefore, of an attempt by Borden to harass Bohack. Rule 11-44 was designed in part to protect debtors from legal harassment and in general contemplates a situation where a creditor institutes a suit against the debtor. The purpose of the rule is the protection of the debtor, but when the debtor is in the position of assailant rather than victim, the potential for abuse of that purpose is manifest. Under Rule ll-44(d) suits against the debtor are prohibited absent leave of the bankruptcy court; however, Rule 610, Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, permits the debtor to file suit in any forum without first securing authorization from the bankruptcy judge. Conceivably, an unscrupulous debtor could take advantage of this statutory imbalance and transform Rule 11-44 into an instrument of harassment by filing a proliferation of questionable lawsuits. Such suits could not only impede the progress of the arrangement and keep creditors waiting interminably for a confirmation, but the costs of prosecution would further deplete the assets of the estate. The threat of setoff, however, would discourage such abuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">We are not intimating that Bohack was guilty of bad faith in initiating the antitrust action. We are, however, cognizant of the precedential import of our rulings and must be cautious to avoid a decision which could convert Rule 11-44 from a shield into a weapon. Where a debtor institutes a lawsuit and then invokes the protection of Rule 11-44 on a counterclaim, the situation warrants a very thoughtful scrutiny. Just as the court has discretion to deny setoffs in appropriate cases, so the court has an equitable duty to grant a setoff when a debtor moves outside the confines of the bankruptcy court in an attempt to reap the benefits but circumvent the burdens in another forum. <em>Binnick v. Avco Financial Services of Nebraska, Inc., </em>435 F.Supp. 359 (D.Neb.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-8\">Furthermore, this is not a case in which Rule 11-44 should be invoked in order to spare the debtor the expense of defending itself in litigation. Bohack initiated the costly antitrust proceeding. It would be patently inequitable to deny Borden\u2019s counterclaim in order to reduce Bohack\u2019s legal fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-9\">The same reasoning applies to arguments regarding judicial economy and interference with the administration of the debtor\u2019s estate. The district judge feared that concurrent consideration of Borden\u2019s claim could impede final acceptance of a Chapter XI plan and that such inexcusable delay would be a detriment to the remaining creditors. It would be far more detrimental to creditors to proceed to confirmation without taking into account a potential recovery on Bohack\u2019s antitrust claim. Bohack has included pending litigation in the assets of its estate. Creditors would be entitled to share in the recovery in the event of Bo-hack\u2019s ultimate success in the antitrust lawsuit. It is possible, even if it is not likely, that the pending antitrust suit, an asset, would be distributed among the creditors as part of an arrangement. An arrangement is more likely to be based on payments of cash or notes from the debtor. Should such an arrangement be proposed, the creditors will be able to vote on whether to accept it or not. Their vote may be influenced by their estimate of what value there may be in Bohack\u2019s antitrust suit. Should they decide to accept an arrangement without having that antitrust claim assigned to them, then Borden would be bound. In that case, the assertion of its counterclaim in the anti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>trust suit could be stricken on a motion for summary judgment supported by a certified copy of the arrangement. In the meantime, there is no reason why Borden should be required to elect or why a stay should be continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">Whether the creditors want to keep Bo-hack alive as a going concern is up to them to determine, and in that decision Borden will have no greater or lesser right to a voice than any other creditor. Should the creditors decide to throw Bohack into bankruptcy, then each of them would presumably receive a proportionate share in the antitrust claim. The effect to be given to Borden\u2019s claim as a creditor against the trustee would be determined under the ordinary rules of bankruptcy. It appears that this would be simply an unsecured claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">In affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order enjoining prosecution of Borden\u2019s counterclaim, the district judge commented that Borden could obtain a setoff in the context of the arrangement and that Borden\u2019s recovery would merely be delayed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The procedure whereby Borden might accomplish this result was not specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-7\">We find that the equities in this case are weighted in Borden\u2019s favor and that it was an abuse of discretion to enjoin the counterclaim. Borden should be afforded the opportunity to pursue its setoff in a plenary proceeding before the antitrust court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On remand, the bankruptcy judge must be given the latitude to weigh \u201cthe best interests of the creditors,\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 766(2), and to proceed, subject to the provisions of this opinion, as far as possible with confirmation of a plan or with liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-10\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the district court with instructions to remand to the bankruptcy judge with instructions to proceed in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-11\">Reversed and remanded with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1248-19\">. Rule 11-44, Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1248-20\">. Section 68 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">. See note 7, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">. Although the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure were not in effect at the time the petition was filed, both parties and both courts below treated Rule 11-44 as having pivotal importance in this action, and we will follow suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1250-10\">. This court in <em>In Re Eastern Freightways, Inc., </em>577 F.2d 175 (2nd Cir. 1978), commented that in some instances the filing of a claim against a bankrupt estate constitutes implied consent to summary jurisdiction over a setoff issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">. We believe that a test paralleling the language of \u00a7 302 is preferable to the broader \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach adopted by the district judge. He placed considerable emphasis, for example, on the fact that prosecution of Borden\u2019s counterclaim would further entangle the already complicated antitrust litigation. Although principles of comity dictate that a court carefully weigh the possible impact its decision might have on another tribunal, \u00a7 302 does not go so far as to give a bankruptcy judge the discretion to deny a setoff on the ground that its exercise might inconvenience another court. Section 302 provides only one standard for testing the applicability of \u00a7 68 in Chapter XI proceedings: inconsistency with the provisions of the chapter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">. Upon the filing and acceptance of a chapter XI petition, the bankruptcy court may, pursuant to \u00a7 314,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-7\">enjoin or stay until final decree the commencement or continuation of suits other than suits to enforce liens upon the property of the debtor, and may, upon notice for cause shown, enjoin or stay until final decree any act or the commencement or continuation of any proceeding to enforce any lien upon the property of a debtor.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">. Rule 11-44 is a rule of procedure; it cannot abridge or modify any substantive right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2075; <em>In re Williams, </em>422 F.Supp. 342, 344 (N.D.Ga.1976). It can, however, operate to defer the exercise of a given right, particularly where equity requires it. See <em>Preferred Surfacing, Inc. v. Gwinnett Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>400 F.Supp. 280 (N.D.Ga.1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1255-9\">. Under \u00a7 68 Borden\u2019s right to a setoff in the bankruptcy proceeding would not mature unless and until Borden and Bohack become mutual debtors. Their status as mutual debtors cannot be determined until the conclusion of the antitrust case. It is almost a certainty that the arrangement proceeding will terminate before the antitrust suit. An arrangement is intended to proceed swiftly, simply, and efficiently, Fed.R.Bankr.P. 903, whereas antitrust cases are notoriously lengthy and tortuously complex.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
