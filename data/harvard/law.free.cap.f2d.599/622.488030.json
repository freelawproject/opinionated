HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">In this case we examine the validity of three provisions of the commercial diving health standard<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor (OSHA), pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 651-678 (1975) (the Act). The petitioning companies, all members of the petitioning Association of Diving Contractors (ADC) who are engaged in commercial diving operations in waters in and adjacent to the United States, attack the medical examination procedure and cost allocation required by \u00a7 1910.411 of the diving standard and the employee-access-to-records provision in \u00a7 1910.440(b)(2) of the regulation. Sections 1910.411 and 1910.440(b)(2) are set out in full in an appendix to this opinion. Section 1910.411 places upon employers the obligation to determine that divers who are, or are likely to be, exposed to hyperbaric conditions are medically fit to perform assigned tasks in a safe and healthful manner. Employers are required to provide each such employee with a comprehensive medical examination prior to initial hyperbaric exposure with the employer, unless an equivalent evaluation has been made within the preceding year, and yearly thereafter. The mandatory medical examination is the first step of what may, at the employee\u2019s option, develop into a three-tiered medical assessment procedure, all levels of which must be financed by the employer. If the examining physician selected by the employer determines that the examinee is medically unfit to engage in diving activities, the examinee has the option of seeking the opinion of a second physician. If the opinion of the second physician differs from that of the initial examining physician, then a third opinion must be secured from a physician selected by the first two physicians. In such circumstances, the opinion of the third physician dictates the employer\u2019s final determination of the diver\u2019s medical fitness. That is, if the third physician finds the applicant medically fit for exposure to hyperbaric conditions, the employer must accept the applicant as medically qualified and would be barred by OSHA from declining to employ him on such grounds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Because OSHA is without authority to so restrict the medical fitness determinations of employers, the petitions for review are granted with respect to \u00a7 1910.411.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Section 1910.440(b)(2) is challenged only with regard to the manner of its promulgation, in that the Secretary of Labor is claimed to have failed to meet the notice requirements of the Act prior to enacting that provision of the standard. The petitioners\u2019 challenge is without merit, however, and the petitions for review are denied with respect to \u00a7 1910.440(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The petitioners first claim that the Secretary of Labor exceeded his statutory authority in promulgating \u00a7 1910.411, the medical requirements provisions of the standard. Basically, the petitioners object to \u00a7 1910.411 because it gives an employee the right to appeal an initial determination of medical unfitness for diving to a second, and possibly third, doctor until the first examining doctor\u2019s evaluation is either concurred in by the second doctor or overruled by the third. Also, the employer is required to pay for all medical examinations accorded under \u00a7 1910.411.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The Secretary of Labor\u2019s authority to promulgate occupational safety and health standards <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> derives from \u00a7 655 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. The Act defines an \u201coccupational safety and health standard\u201d as \u201ca standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 652(8). Judicial review of occupational safety and health standards is authorized by 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 655(f), and \u201c[t]he determinations of the Secretary shall be conclusive is supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d Another basic premise in our review of OSHA regulations is that the Secretary can only effectuate the will of Congress as expressed in the Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">The power of an administrative officer or board to administer a federal statute and to prescribe rules and regulations to that end is not the power to make law\u2014 for no such power can be delegated by Congress \u2014 but the power to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will of Congress as expressed by the statute. A regulation which does not do this, but operates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute, is a mere nullity. <em>Lynch v. Tilden Produce Co., </em>265 U.S. 315, 320-322, 44 S.Ct. 488, 68 L.Ed. 1034; <em>Miller v. United States, </em>294 U.S. 435, 439, 440, 55 S.Ct. 440, 79 L.Ed. 977 and cases cited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-12\"><em>Manhattan General Equipment Co. v. Commissioner, </em>297 U.S. 129, 134, 56 S.Ct. 397, 400, 80 L.Ed. 528 (1936). Judicial review of occupational safety and health standards must include \u201ca review of whether the Secretary exercised his decisionmaking power within the limits imposed by Congress.\u201d <em>American Petroleum Institute v. OSHA, </em>581 F.2d 493, 497 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 1212, 59 L.Ed.2d 453 (1979). \u201cThe Act imposes on OSHA the obligation to enact only standards that are reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful workplaces. If a standard does not fit in this definition, it is not one that OSHA is authorized to enact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">Our task, then, is to determine whether the medical examination procedure established by \u00a7 1910.411 is reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful working conditions in the commercial diving industry. In light of the Act\u2019s language and legislative history, the Secretary\u2019s admitted purpose for promulgating this standard, and the practical effect of the standard on the employer\u2019s hiring practices, we conclude that the Secretary was not authorized to enact \u00a7 1910.411.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>We look first to the language of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 651-678, and its legislative history, [1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 5177, and we see that Congress created OSHA for the sole purpose of protecting the health and safety of workers and improving physical working conditions on employment premises. <em>Brennan v. OSHRC, </em>488 F.2d 337, 338 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>see especially </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 651. As we noted earlier, the Secretary is authorized to promulgate only regulations which are reasonably necessary or appropriate to achieve that Congressional goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">In promulgating \u00a7 1910.411, however, OSHA\u2019s choice of medical examination procedures was controlled by its \u201ccognizan[ce] of the employees\u2019 countervailing rights to be protected in their choice of occupation.\u201d 42 Fed.Reg. 37,650, 37,658 (1977). In its effort \u201cnot to create, through a health and safety standard, a situation which restricts entry into a profession or allows employees to be dismissed for a cause which is less than substantial,\u201d OSHA sought to achieve a \u201cbalance between the need for a mandatory medical examination and the employee\u2019s right to a thorough medical assessment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In effect, \u00a7 1910.411 imposes upon employers a mandatory job security provision. OSHA is simply not authorized to regulate job security as it has done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The medical examination procedure established by OSHA provides that the fitness evaluation of the third doctor in the examining process controls the medical fitness determination of the employer. Thus, even though the employer may genuinely question the medical fitness of a particular employee, due to the first doctor\u2019s conclusion of medical unfitness, the employer\u2019s determination of medical fitness is conclusively determined by the third doctor\u2019s evaluation, which may be that the employee is medically fit. Furthermore, the employer has no control over the third doctor\u2019s fitness standards, so that the employer is prevented from setting higher health standards for employees than the secondary examining doctors choose to set.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">While we commend OSHA for trying to avoid doing harm with regulations, we must condemn its efforts here because \u00a7 1910.411 invalidly binds employers in their determinations of employees\u2019 medical fitness. \u201cWhen adopting OSHA, Congress deliberately sought to achieve job safety while maintaining proper employee-employer relations.\u201d <em>Marshall v. Daniel Construction Co., </em>563 F.2d 707, 716 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 880, 99 S.Ct. 216, 58 L.Ed.2d 192 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">The Secretary argues that consideration of and accounting for the economic impact of regulations is permissible when promulgating occupational safety and health standards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree. Indeed, a regulation enacted in the single-minded pursuit of absolutely risk free workplaces regardless of cost or limitation of job opportunities might well be struck down; it would certainly be ill-advised. This Court has repudiated OSHA\u2019s use of such tunnel vision in an earlier opinion. <em>See American Petroleum Institute, </em>581 F.2d at 502-03. Had OSHA limited the employment of commercial divers by prohibiting the hiring of those who fail to pass a medical examination and then, mindful of unfairly prohibiting a banned employee from obtaining employment, provided for a challenge of the initial determination without making the results of that challenge binding on the employer\u2019s employment decision, we would be faced with a different question on appeal. OSHA may arguably provide for a threshold determination of medical fitness, but OSHA may not impose a ceiling on the medical fitness standards used by employers in hiring divers. To countenance the Secretary\u2019s regulation here would countenance OSHA\u2019s imposing not only minimum standards of safety, but also <em>maximum </em>stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>dards which employers would be allowed to impose upon themselves.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No such Congressional intent is to be found in the Act. Section 1910.411 is thus vacated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The Secretary made an impressive argument concerning the employers\u2019 obligation to bear the cost of medical examinations. We decline, however, to pass upon what would be the case were we presented a valid regulation. Section 1910.411 having been set aside as an attempt by OSHA to exceed its authority, the issue of cost allocation of the medical examinations provided thereunder is mooted.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The petitioners\u2019 final attack on the commercial diving health standard concerns the employee-access-to-records provision in \u00a7 1910.440(b)(2) of the regulation. Section 1910.440(b)(2) requires that any employee, former employee, or authorized representative be given access to the employer\u2019s records or documents which are required by the standard and pertain to the individual employee or former employee. The petitioners argue that \u00a7 1910.440(b)(2) is invalid because the Secretary, in promulgating the provision, failed to satisfy the notice provision of the Act, thereby prejudicing petitioners and other diving contractor-employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The Act provides that proposed rules and regulations be published in the Federal Register and that interested persons be afforded an opportunity to comment upon, and request a hearing with regard to, any proposed regulation. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 655(b)(2) \u2014 (3). It is not necessary, however, for the final form of a regulation to be republished under \u00a7 655(b)(2)-(3) where the proposed regulation, in its initial form, gives sufficient notice to the interested parties of the Secretary\u2019s intentions. <em>See GAF Corp. v. OSHRC, </em>183 U.S.App.D.C. 20, 25-26, 561 F.2d 913, 918-19 (1977); <em>South Terminal Corp. v. E.P.A., </em>504 F.2d 646, 659 (1st Cir. 1974); <em>International Harvester Co. v. Ruckelshaus, </em>155 U.S.App.D.C. 411, 428, 478 F.2d 615, 632 (1973). Here, as in <em>GAF Corp., </em>the contested provision in the standard finally promulgated was a logical outgrowth of provisions found in the standard originally proposed. Compare Proposed Rules, 41 Fed.Reg. 48. 950-69 (1976) <em>with </em>Rules and Regulations, 42 Fed.Reg. 37,650-74 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">We are concerned in this case, of course, only with whether \u00a7 1910.440(b)(2) was properly promulgated, and we find that it was. We are not faced with the question of whether a particular record or document can be gained under this provision, and we do not purport to decide that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">In summary, we hold that the Secretary\u2019s promulgation of \u00a7 1910.411 of the commercial diving standard was in excess of his statutory authority and is therefore vacated, and that the Secretary\u2019s promulgation of \u00a7 1910.440(b)(2) was proper under 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 655(b)(2)-{3). The petitions for review are, therefore, granted with regard to \u00a7 1910.411 and denied with respect to \u00a7 1910.440(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"AdE\">Section 1910.411 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-17\">Medical requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>(a) <em>General. </em>(1) The employer shall determine that dive team members who are, or are likely to be, exposed to hyper-baric conditions are medically fit to perform assigned tasks in a safe and healthful manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\">(2) The employer shall provide each dive team member who is, or is likely to be, exposed to hyperbaric conditions with all medical examinations required by this standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">(3) All medical examinations required by this standard shall be performed by, or under the direction of, a physician at no cost to the employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">(b) <em>Frequency of medical examinations. </em>Medical examinations shall be provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">(1) Prior to initial hyperbaric exposure with the employer, unless an equivalent medical examination has been given within the preceding 12 months and the employer has' obtained the results of the examination and an opinion from the examining physician of the employee\u2019s medical fitness to dive or to be otherwise exposed to hyperbaric conditions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">(2) At one-year intervals from the date ' of initial examination or last equivalent examination; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">(3) After an injury or illness requiring hospitalization of more than twenty-four (24) hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">(c) <em>Information provided to examining physician. </em>The employer shall provide the following information to the examining physician:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-11\">(1) A copy of the medical requirements of this standard; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-12\">(2) A summary of the nature and extent of hyperbaric conditions to which the dive team member will be exposed, including diving modes and types of work to be assigned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-13\">(d) <em>Content of medical examinations. </em>(1) Medical examinations conducted initially and annually shall consist of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-15\">(i) Medical history;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-16\">(ii) Diving-related work history;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-17\">(iii) Basic physical examination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-20\">(iv) The tests required by Table I; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-21\">(v) Any additional tests the physician considers necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-22\">(2) Medical examinations conducted after an injury or illness requiring hospitalization of more than 24 hours shall be appropriate to the nature and extent of the injury or illness as determined by the examining physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-23\">Table <em>I. </em>\u2014 Tests <em>for diving medical examination</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-24\">Initial Annual</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aca\">Test examination reexamination</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkY_\">Chest X-ray ........

The standard is codified at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1910.-401-.441, and is also published, along with OSHA\u2019s statement of reasons in support of the standard, at 42 Fed.Reg. 37,650-74 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\">. This authority has been delegated to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, the chief executive officer of OSHA. References to the Secretary and OSHA are used interchangeably in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\">. Previous cases which have approved the consideration of the economic effect of OSHA regulations have focused on the economic feasibility of a standard with regard to the employer\u2019s cost in meeting its requirements. <em>See AFL-CIO v. Brennan, </em>530 F.2d 109, 122-23 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO v.

In an analogous situation, out of concern for the economic opportunities of suppliers of tools, OSHA might require certain safety designs of the tools and also require employers to purchase and use tools meeting those standards, even though the employer might have concluded that higher standards are desirable for the tools to be used by its employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b712-18\">. Our conclusion that employers\u2019 maximum safety standards may not be limited by OSHA does not, of course, mean that an employer\u2019s maximum safety standards are never subject to outside limitation. The unwarranted exclusion from employment of applicants or former employees might well be limited through labor-management relations or some other appropriate avenue. We merely find that OSHA is an inappropriate authority for such regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-49\"> To be given to the employee once, at age 35 or over.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
