WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b425-21\">We withheld submission of this cause pending disposition by the Supreme Court in two consolidated cases that have recently been decided. <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights </em>Organization, - U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979). We now order the cause submitted and reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-23\">Idaho has elected to participate in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, established under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601 <em>et seq., </em>and has adopted regulations, partly under challenge here, to administer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-24\">Jane Doe first applied for AFDC benefits when she was 16, unmarried, pregnant, and living with her parents. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (Department) rejected her application. After her child was born, she applied again. Her application was granted to the extent of her child\u2019s needs, but not for her own. When she turned 18, the age of majority in Idaho, the AFDC grant was increased to cover her needs, but excluded a housing and utility allowance because she continued to live with her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-25\">On appeal, she asserts essentially two \u201cconstitutional claims\u201d and one \u201cstatutory claim\u201d. She contends a Department regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>tion, Manual \u00a7 3242.2(3), violates due process by establishing an irrebuttable presumption that her parents were adequately meeting her needs as the caretaker relative of her child as long as she continued to live with them. She also alleges that the denial of AFDC benefits was the result of classifications impermissibly based upon age, residence, and legitimacy of her child and therefore was a denial of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">As a statutory claim, she asserts that state AFDC regulations are stricter than allowed by the Social Security Act and are therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Appellant admits there is no jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, but suggests four alternative theories to find jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) and (4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">(1) Her due process and equal protection claims are actions to redress the deprivation of rights \u201csecured by the Constitution of the United States\u201d under \u00a7 1343(3);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">(2) Assuming proper jurisdiction exists over her constitutional claims, pendent jurisdiction is proper for her statutory claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">(3) By prohibiting a state law or regulation from conflicting with a federal law, the Supremacy Clause creates a right secured by the Constitution under \u00a7 1343(3); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">(4) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Social Security Act are \u201cAct[s] of Congress providing for equal rights\u201d under \u00a7 1343(3) and \u201cproviding for the protection of civil rights\u201d under \u00a7 1343(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">The district court dealt only partially with the jurisdictional issue, finding that jurisdiction could not be based on \u00a7 1343(3) because \u201c[a] colorable constitutional issue ha[d] not been presented.\u201d It did not address the possibility of jurisdiction under \u00a7 1343(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">Apparently assuming jurisdiction existed in disposing of the action, the court reached the merits and granted appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion. Because of the way we decide the appeal, we shall discuss only the jurisdictional issue and not reach the merits fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">It is not sufficient to obtain jurisdiction under \u00a7 1343(3) merely to assert a constitutional claim. The Supreme Court in <em>Ha-gans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974), held that, although the constitutional claim need not be \u201csubstantial\u201d,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-13\">federal courts are without power to entertain claims otherwise within their jurisdiction if they are \u201cso attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit,\u201d \u201cwholly insubstantial,\u201d \u201cobviously frivolous,\u201d \u201cplainly unsubstantial,\u201d or \u201cno longer open to discussion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-14\"><em>Id. </em>536-37, 94 S.Ct. at 1379 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">Appellant\u2019s \u201cconstitutional claims\u201d fit these criteria. Her due process argument is totally without merit. The Department\u2019s practice in applying its regulations contradicts the claim that <em>a11 </em>unwed minor mothers living with their parents are denied assistance for their own needs. Residence with the parents is simply one factor used to determine the need of the applicant. As the district court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-16\">There was a specific finding that Jane Doe\u2019s parents did not quality for AFDC assistance, and that they were providing for her needs. That this was the practice of the Department is shown by the fact that . . . of 80 applications made by unemancipated minor mothers on behalf of their children, 24 included grants for the child only and 56 included assistance for both the child and mother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-18\"><em>See also Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 768-69, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975) (unless a classification is \u201cpatently arbitrary\u201d or \u201cutterly lacking in rational justification\u201d, there is no due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-19\">Appellant\u2019s equal protection argument is equally without foundation. The Department does not discriminate on the basis of an applicant\u2019s age or residence, or the legitimacy of the child. It uses the first two factors merely as indicators of \u201cemancipation\u201d and, therefore, of need for assistance. Similarly, the applicant\u2019s marital sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>tus, not the legitimacy of her child, is another indicator of financial independence from her parents and hence of her need. Cases cited by the appellant are either irrelevant or easily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">It is apparent that appellant\u2019s alleged constitutional claims are asserted in order to obtain jurisdiction over her statutory claim. But because appellant\u2019s constitutional claims were not \u201cof sufficient substance to support federal jurisdiction,\u201d there can be no pendent jurisdiction over her statutory claim in federal court. <em>Hagans, </em>415 U.S. at 536, 94 S.Ct. at 1378. We express no opinion whether appellant may legitimately press her statutory claim in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Appellant\u2019s third and fourth theories of jurisdiction are disposed of by <em>Chapman. </em>The Court concluded there \u201cthat an allegation of incompatibility between federal and state statutes and regulations [under the Supremacy Clause] does not, in itself, give rise to a claim \u2018secured by the Constitution\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1343(3).\u201d -U.S. at-, 99 S.Ct. at 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Since \u00a7 1983 is only a remedial statute that does not itself create any substantive rights, the court held further that it was not an \u201cAct of Congress providing for equal rights . . . [or] for the protection of civil rights\u201d under \u00a7 1343(3) and (4). Id. - U.S. at -, 99 S.Ct. at 1907. The Social Security Act was also enacted for neither purpose and therefore cannot fulfill the prerequisites of \u00a7 1343(3) or (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">We agree with the district court that \u201c[a] colorable constitutional claim has not been presented.\u201d Insofar as the court examined the sufficiency of appellant\u2019s constitutional claims to determine if they warranted taking jurisdiction, it acted properly. A full review of the merits and the granting of appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion, however, was improper. We reverse and remand for dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
