It can be used, <em>inter alia, </em>as an intermediate in the production of the pharmaceutically active 4-nitrophenyl-l, 4-dihydropyridine derivatives. Appellant\u2019s invention resides in an industrially satisfactory process for the production of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde. Specifically, an alkali metal salt of a 2-nitrophenylpy-ruvic acid is reacted with an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hypochlorite to yield 2-nitrobenzylidene chloride, which compound is then subjected to aqueous hydrolysis at a temperature of from about 20 \u00b0C to about 150 \u00b0C to produce 2-nitrobenzalde-hyde. Using sodium as the alkali metal, the process can be diagrammatically depicted as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>Advantageously, the 2-nitrophenylpyruvic acid can be prepared by treating 2-nitroto-luene with a diester of oxalic acid<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and then using it directly without isolation. Claim 11 is illustrative of the appealed claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-24\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"106\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" width=\"723\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>11.

These include, <em>inter alia, </em>oxidation experiment (d) which uses an alkaline bromine solution, specifically sodium hypo-bromite, and oxidation experiment (e) which uses calcium hypochlorite.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Use of sodium hypobromite resulted in the production of 2-nitrobenzylidene bromide, which compound was treated with sodium carbonate to remove the bromine, and then treated with phenylhydrazine acetate to yield 2-nitrobenzaldehyde phenyl hydrazone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Use of calcium hypochlorite resulted in an unexamined chlorine-containing oil together with a crystalline substance of the formula C16H12N2O6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-20\">Cassebaum<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> reviews various existing methods for the production of 2-nitroben-zaldehyde, none of which need be discussed here, and concludes that they are unsatisfactory. The author notes that even though the compound has been known for more than 80 years, the literature still fails to describe any advantageous method of producing it. Cassebaum then describes the method which he developed which comprises oxidizing 2-nitrophenylnitromethane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>with KMn04 to produce 2-nitrobenzalde-hyde.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">Clarens<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> discusses the conversion of hy-pochlorites and hypobromites to chlorates and bromates, respectively. No further discussion of this reference is deemed necessary since its relevance is tenuous, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Feiser et al.,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the last of the references relied upon by the examiner, describes various reactions using sodium hypobromite and sodium hypochlorite, none of which involve the production of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde. As with Clarens, we see no need to further discuss this reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">\n<em>Rebuttal Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">A declaration was submitted by the inventor, Meyer, comparing the yield obtained by Reissert with that of the claimed process. By reacting 2-nitrophenylpyruvic acid with <em>sodium hypobromite, </em>Reissert\u2019s yield of 2-nitrobenzylidene bromide, based upon the acid employed, was <em>85.4%. </em>Assuming 100% conversion, the maximum yield of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde would only be 35.4%. Repeating Reissert\u2019s work, Meyer was unable to obtain a yield of more than about 18% of 2-nitrobenzylidene bromide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">In contradistinction to Reissert\u2019s use of sodium hypobromite, when <em>sodium hypo-chlorite </em>is used according to the claimed process, the yield of 2-nitrobenzylidene chloride, based upon the acid employed, is <em>64.3%.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">\n<em>Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">In the examiner\u2019s answer, all the appealed claims were rejected under <em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7103 </em>over Reissert taken in view of Casse-baum, Clarens, and Feiser et al. According to the examiner, Reissert discloses the use of an alkali metal hypobromite and equates the hypobromite and hypochlorite.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u201cthe Reissert reference by itself is deemed to teach every aspect of the claimed process and therefore the claimed process . . . [would have been,] at the very least[,] . . . obvious over Reis-sert.\u201d Cassebaum, Clarens, and Feiser et al. were relied upon as further evidence that it would have been obvious to use an alkali metal hypochlorite in place of the alkali metal hypobromite of Reissert.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-18\">With respect to appellant\u2019s uncontested evidence of unexpectedly improved yields with the alkali metal hypochlorite over the alkali metal hypobromite, the examiner dismissed it as \u201cnot persuasive of patentability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-19\">The board affirmed the examiner. According to the board, it is \u201cfairly well agreed that the difference in yields produced by the hypochlorite solution is significant and not readily explainable from the reference disclosures.\u201d With this in mind, the board phrased the issue to be decided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-20\">[A]s observed by the examiner, the Reissert reference, by itself, teaches every aspect of the claimed process. Consequently, if Reissert constitutes an <em>anticipation, </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b), of the claimed subject matter, such rejection cannot be avoided by a showing under 37 C.F.R. 1.132. On the other hand, if the cited art merely renders the claimed process <em>prima facie </em>obvious, the showing of record would adequately rebut the inference of obviousness raised by the cited art. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1115-21\">The board concluded that Reissert anticipated the claimed invention, within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b), since Reissert\u2019s reference to \u201calkaline chlorine or bromine solution\u201d must be construed to mean <em>alkali </em>solutions of chlorine or bromine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-22\">While the board apparently recognized that the examiner never mentioned 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102, it, nonetheless, anomalously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>concluded that a new ground of rejection was not being made since \u201canticipation is the epitome of obviousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">In a request for reconsideration, appellant argued that the board denied it procedural due process inasmuch as the board, in effect, entered a new ground of rejection (under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b)) while not affording appellant the procedural options provided for in 37 CFR 1.196(b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, appellant submitted an affidavit by Willaim Bertsche, the individual who prepared the translation of Reissert upon which the board relied. According to Bertsche, the German word actually used by Reissert, \u201cal-kalische,\u201d is an adjective and means alkaline or basic, referring to an alkaline condition capable of turning red litmus paper blue, and it cannot be translated to mean the noun, \u201calkali,\u201d as suggested by the board.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">In its decision on reconsideration, the board considered the newly submitted Bertsche affidavit even though it repeated its assertion that it had not made a new ground of rejection. While not expressly disavowing its prior construction of Reis-sert, the board did not repeat its prior statement that Reissert\u2019s reference to \u201calkali-sche\u201d must be construed to mean \u201calkali.\u201d Instead, the board advanced a new theory for construing Reissert. Since Reissert\u2019s oxidation experiment (d) using sodium hy-pobromite is entitled \u201cd) With alkaline bromine solution,\u201d and since this language is identical to Reissert\u2019s prior reference to \u201calkaline chlorine or bromine solution,\u201d Reis-sert must have had in mind the specific alkaline bromine solution of oxidation experiment (d) when he equated \u201calkaline bromine or chlorine solution.\u201d Thus, in the light of this new theory, the board repeated its conclusion that Reissert anticipated the claimed subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-10\">We will initially dispose of the examiner\u2019s rejection based on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 since the board did not expressly reverse it. <em>See In re Pritchard, </em>463 F.2d 1359, 59 CCPA 1284, 1292, 1365, 175 USPQ 17, 22 (1972). The Meyer declaration, which is undisputed, indicates that when Reissert\u2019s sodium hypobromite is used the yield of 2-nitrobenzyli-dene bromide was 35.4% (based on the acid employed). In contradistinction, when the claimed sodium hypochlorite is used the yield of 2-nitrobenzylidene chloride was 64.3%.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As the board correctly recognized, \u201cif the cited art merely renders the claimed process <em>prima facie </em>obvious, the showing of record would adequately rebut the inference of obviousness raised by the cited art.\u201d In <em>In re Von Schickh, </em>362 F.2d 821, 824, 53 CCPA 1352, 1355, 150 USPQ 300, 302 (1966), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>Even assuming the process to be prima facie obvious from a consideration merely of the reactants, media, and steps employed, we think the invention as a whole must be deemed unobvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 by reason of the increase in yield obtained while using considerably less nitrating acid. We find no suggestion of this characteristic of the claimed process. It appears to be quite unexpected and, being part of the invention as a whole, it should be treated under the law as is an unexpected property in compositions. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">Accordingly, the rejection of the claims under \u00a7 103 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">Turning to the board\u2019s reliance on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) in affirming the examiner,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we are convinced that this constituted a new ground of rejection. <em>In re Echerd, </em>471 F.2d 632, 176 USPQ 321 (Cust.Pat.App.1973). Considering that the examiner expressly stated the statutory ground of rejection was 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, that he never mentioned \u00a7 102, and that he never asserted Reissert anticipated the claimed subject matter, we conclude that the sole ground of rejection was, indeed, \u00a7 103. We decline to rely on conjecture as a basis for ascertaining what statutory ground of rejection the examiner might have had in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">Recognizing the possibility that the examiner may not have made a \u00a7 102 rejection, the board made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-8\">Although we realize that the examiner did not expressly frame his rejection as being based on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102, we consider such to be clear from his remarks. In any event, this is not a new ground of rejection, <em>since it has been repeatedly held that anticipation is the epitome of obviousness. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">While it is true that prior cases<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> from this court have used such phrases as \u201canticipation is the epitome of obviousness\u201d or \u201canticipation is the ultimate in obviousness,\u201d the board\u2019s reliance on those cases to support its conclusion that it had not made a new ground of rejection is totally misplaced. The use in prior cases of the aforementioned phrases is nothing more than the recognition of the commonsense fact that a rejection for obviousness under \u00a7 103 can be based on a reference which happens to anticipate the claimed subject matter. Those cases do not provide a license for the board to shift the statutory basis of rejection from \u00a7 103 to \u00a7 102 while denying appellant the procedural due process provided for by 37 CFR 1.196(b). <em>See In re Ercherd, supra </em>; <em>In re Hughes, </em>345 F.2d 184, 52 CCPA 1355, 145 USPQ 467 (1965). Since, as will be discussed hereinbelow, we disagree with the board on the merits of the \u00a7 102(b) rejection, there is no need to remand the case for further proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">For Reissert to constitute an anticipation, it must identically disclose or describe, <em>inter alia, </em>reacting an alkali metal salt of 2-nitrophenylpyruvic acid with an <em>alkali metal hypochlorite. See In re Marshall, </em>578 F.2d 301, 198 USPQ 344 (CCPA 1978). The Bertsche affidavit supports the conclusion that the reference in the Reissert translation to \u201coxidation by alkaline chlorine or bromine solution\u201d should be construed to mean oxidation by a <em>basic </em>chlorine or bromine solution, and not oxidation by an <em>alkali </em>solution of chlorine or bromine. The genus, \u201calkaline chlorine or bromine solution,\u201d does not identically disclose or describe, within the meaning of \u00a7 102, the species alkali metal hypochlorite, since the genus would include an untold number of species.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See In re Jacobson, </em>407 F.2d 890, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>896, 56 CCPA 982, 991, 160 USPQ 795, 800 (1969). In apparent recognition of that fact, the board relied upon the additional disclosure by Reissert of oxidation with sodium hypobromite. According to the board, Reissert\u2019s teaching that \u201c[u]pon oxidation by alkaline chlorine or bromine solution, halogen-containing products are furthermore formed,\u201d must be construed to be a direct reference to Reissert\u2019s specific oxidation experiment (d), to wit, oxidation with alkaline bromine solution (sodium hypobromite being specifically disclosed). Construing Reissert in this manner, the board concluded that Reissert equated sodium hypobromite with sodium hypochlorite. The problem with the board\u2019s interpretation is that it ignores the remainder of the Reissert disclosure, including oxidation experiment (e), <em>i. e., </em>oxidation with calcium hypochlorite, an \u201calkaline chlorine . . .solution.\u201d This reaction is described as producing, <em>inter alia, </em>a \u201cchlorine-containing oil,\u201d which, needless to say, is a \u201chalogen-containing\u201d product. Thus, there is simply no reason to conclude that Reissert\u2019s generic reference to \u201calkaline chlorine or bromine solution\u201d should be construed to refer only to specific oxidation experiment (d). Accordingly, since the aforementioned construction of Reissert by the board is without foundation, the board\u2019s rejection under \u00a7 102(b) must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">Summarizing, the examiner\u2019s rejection under \u00a7 103, and the board\u2019s new ground of rejection under \u00a7 102(b), are <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">\n<em>REVERSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">.
