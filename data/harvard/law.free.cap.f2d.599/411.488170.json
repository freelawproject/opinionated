Plaintiffs claim they are entitled to a salary rate set at an amount equal to two step-increases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>gues that this two step-increase does not apply to promotions from a WS position to a GS position. We agree with plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The six plaintiffs in this case are or were employed on the staff of the Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair, Department of the Navy. Between July 1973 and October 1974, all were promoted from various positions under the prevailing rate system (or WS) to positions covered under the GS. Plaintiff LiBretto was employed as a Ship Surveyor, Grade 8, level 4 of the WS, earning $7.92 per hour or $16,473.60 per year. His old salary fell between step 4 ($16,138) and step 5 ($16,627) of the GS-11 scale to which he had been promoted. His salary was set at a GS-11, step 5, the higher of the two rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The other five plaintiffs had also been promoted<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from Ship Surveyor to GS positions. However, they had received the benefits of two step-increases at the time of their respective promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">LiBretto, believing he was entitled to a GS-11, step 7 (instead of a GS-11, step 5) filed a complaint. That complaint touched off a Navy investigation into the method of calculating LiBretto\u2019s salary and the salaries of others who had been promoted in a similar manner. The Navy determined that it had correctly calculated LiBretto\u2019s salary and incorrectly calculated the salaries of the other five plaintiffs. The five then received a salary step downgrading in April 1975. However, any possible withholdings to recoup the alleged overpayments have been deferred pending a request by plaintiffs for a waiver. Plaintiffs\u2019 six-man Group Grievance was unsuccessful, and they now have filed a petition in this court. Defendant counterclaimed for the alleged overpayments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-16\">We hold for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-17\">This case turns on the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and various regulations contained in 5 C.F.R. Part 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-18\">Section 5334(b) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqt0\">(b) An employee who is promoted or transferred to a position in a higher grade is entitled to basic pay at the lowest rate of the higher grade which exceeds his existing rate of basic pay by not less than two step-increases of the grade from which he is promoted or transferred. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-19\">Plaintiffs therefore argue that since it is undisputed that they did receive \u201cpromotions,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> they are entitled to a two step-increase under section 5334(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>However, the Government points to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.204(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a regulation which purports to limit the above statute (\u00a7 5334(b)) to promotions within the G.S. The Government further argues that plaintiffs\u2019 salary rate is governed by 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.203(c), which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">when an employee is reemployed, transferred, reassigned, promoted, or demoted, the agency may pay him at any rate of his grade which does not exceed his highest previous rate; however, if his highest previous rate falls between two rates of his grade, the agency may pay him at the higher rate. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">We are, therefore, confronted with:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">(1) a <em>statute </em>that says \u201cpromotions\u201d entitled the employee to two step-increases (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(b));</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">(2) a regulation that puts plaintiffs\u2019 situation within the definition of \u201cpromotion\u201d (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.202(h)(2));</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">(3) another regulation that says that statutory entitlement of a \u201cpromotion\u201d does not apply to plaintiffs\u2019 situation (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.204(a)); and</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">(4) a regulation that says an agency can pay a \u201cpromoted\u201d employee at his existing rate, or, if he falls between two rates, at the higher rate (i. e., no step-increases) (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.203(c)). The three regulations, apparently contradictory among themselves and with the statute, appear on three consecutive pages in C.F.R. and are all within Part 531, Subpart B of 5 C.F.R.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">The Government attempts to argue that, at least to these plaintiffs, the regulations do not conflict.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">(1) One General Schedule grade to a higher General Schedule grade; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-13\">(2) A lower rate paid under authority other than subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code, to a higher rate within a General Schedule grade.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">Clearly, plaintiffs were promoted under the definition of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.202(h)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-19\">The old rates of all six plaintiffs fell between two GS-11 steps, and they received the higher of the two rates.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, all the plaintiffs <em>in this case </em>received some increase in compensation due to their promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-20\">However, this theory of the Government\u2019s does not explain why the statutory entitlement to two step-increases for a \u201cpromotion\u201d does not apply to plaintiffs since they have received a \u201cpromotion\u201d under the definition used by both plaintiffs and defendant. (See note 5, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-21\">The concept of step-increases for promotions had its origins in section 802 of the Classification Act of 1949, ch. 782, 63 Stat. 954, 969. Section 802(a) of that Act is almost identical to the current 5334(a) (see note 4, <em>supra). </em>Section 802(b) contains language virtually the same as the present 5334(b), except that the earlier statute only provided for one step-increase.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although this 1949 statute is no clearer than its current version, the House Report<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> leaves title doubt to what Congress intended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-22\">Subsection (b) of section 802 provides that any officer or employee who is promoted or transferred to a position in a higher class or grade shall receive basic compensation at the lowest rate of the higher class or grade which is at least one step increase above his existing rate of basic compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-23\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-24\">At present, a promoted employee receives no immediate increase if he is already receiving a rate in the lower grade that also occurs in the higher grade. If he is receiving a rate in the lower grade paid five claimants, then changed its mind, then refused to pay another, reneged on the five, counterclaimed for a refund, and finally moved to dismiss on its own counterclaim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>that falls between two rates of the higher grade, he is promoted at the higher of these two rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">\n<em>In too many cases, accordingly, an employee who is promoted to greater responsibilities or more difficult duties receives no immediate increase in pay. This is not in accord with the commonly accepted principle that a promotion in pay should concurrently accompany a promotion in duties and responsibilities.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\"><em>Subsection (b) of section 802 corrects this situation.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Congress thus intended that a promotion mean additional compensation of at least a certain amount (in 1949 one step; now two steps <em>(see </em>note 9, <em>supra)). </em>Applying 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.203(c), as the Government urges, would, in some instances, leave a promoted employee with no additional pay. The Government argues that that is not this case. However, neither plaintiffs, nor a hypothetical employee with no increase at all, would receive under the Government\u2019s theory the kind of increase in pay that section 5334(b) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Section 5334(a) authorizes the preparation of \u201ca comprehensive, unified set of rules.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> An employee promoted within the GS receives the benefit of two step-increases. An employee promoted within the WS receives a comparable benefit; even an employee promoted \u201ccriss-cross\u201d from GS to WS receives the benefit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See </em>FPM Supplement 532-1, Subchapter S 8, \u00a7 8-3(d); \u00a7 8-2(a)(7). But, surprisingly, promotions from WS to GS (the other criss-cross), the Government argues, give the employee no such benefit. We do not agree, however, that Congress meant promotions to include only certain kinds of promotions,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> nor has defendant cited any statute or case mandating such a mixed result.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">Therefore, we hold that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(b) requires that a GS employee who has been promoted from the WS is entitled to two step-increases.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because the regulations (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.204(a) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.203(c)) as they pertain to promotions are inconsistent with the statute, they cannot, to that extent, stand. <em>See Hart v. United States, </em>218 Ct.Cl. -, 585 F.2d 1025 (1978); <em>Farrell Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>204 Ct.Cl. 482, 499 F.2d 587 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">Accordingly, after careful consideration of all the parties\u2019 submissions, and oral argument, we grant plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied. The case is remanded to our Trial Division for proceedings in accordance with Rule 131(c)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A0_\">. The mechanics of the two step-increase is as follows: If the employee\u2019s rate in his old position was equal to a rate in the new position, he would be paid at the rate two steps above the step which was equal to his old rate.</p>\n<p id=\"Adn\">If the employee\u2019s rate in his old position fell between two rates in the new position, he would be paid at the rate two steps above the <em>higher </em>of the rates that his old rate fell between.</p>\n<p id=\"apa-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Thus an employee receives a minimum of two steps, but it may be more if his old rate fell between two new rates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\">. All six plaintiffs were promoted following application, selection, and appointment under the Department of the Navy Merit Promotion Program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\">. Defendant\u2019s counterclaim has been dismissed on its own motion, which was made after oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b498-10\">. Section 5334(a) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">(a) The rate of basic pay to which an employee is entitled is governed by regulations prescribed by the Civil Service Commission in conformity with this subchapter and chapter 51 of this title when\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-12\">(1) he is transferred from a position in the legislative, judicial, or executive branch to which this subchapter does not apply;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-13\">(2) he is transferred from a position in the legislative, judicial, or executive branch to which this subchapter applies to another such position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-14\">(3) he is demoted to a position in a lower grade;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADV\">(4) he is reinstated, reappointed, or reemployed in a position to which this subchapter applies following service in any position in the legislative, judicial, or executive branch;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"akm-dedup-0\">(5) his type of appointment is changed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8A\">(6) his employment status is otherwise changed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC7c\">(7) his position is changed from one grade to another grade.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"atw-dedup-0\">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. No.95^454, 92 Stat. 1111, substituted the \u201cOffice of Personnel Management\u201d for \u201cCivil Service Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ada-dedup-0\">Although the word \u201cpromotion\u201d does not expressly appear in 5334(a), it seems clear that it falls within one of the seven categories, as the legislative history of an earlier version of this subsection referred to promotion. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep.No.1264, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1949] U.S.Code Cong.Service, pp. 2363, 2374\u2014 75.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b498-26\">. Both plaintiffs and defendant have termed these actions promotions. Furthermore, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.202(h) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-27\">(h) \u201cPromotion\u201d means a change of an employee, while continuously employed, from:</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b499-15\">. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.204(a)(1) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-16\">(1) The requirements of section 5334(b) of title 5, United States Code, apply only (i) to a transfer from one General Schedule position to a higher General Schedule position, and (ii) to a promotion from one General Schedule grade to a higher General Schedule grade.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b499-17\">.

It could be argued that the language in \u00a7 5334(b) which refers to pay exceeding by two step-increases the \u201cgrade from which he is promoted\u201d implies that the employee must have been at a GS grade to be promoted from.
