The Board found that respondent had violated the Act by discharging certain employees for striking over unsafe working conditions. The order of the Board is reported at 227 NLRB No. 132. This case is properly before the court since the alleged unfair labor practice occurred in Old Fort, Ohio, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-23\">Respondent contends that enforcement should be denied because the administrative law judge (ALJ) who heard the case and made recommendations to the Board was biased against respondent\u2019s position. Respondent contends such bias deprived it of its right to a fair and impartial hearing of the issues in this case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-24\">From our review of the administrative record, we find a substantial display of bias on the part of the ALJ which render his determinations of credibility and fact highly suspect. The Board accepted the ALJ\u2019s findings without making a thorough reevaluation of the evidence presented at the hearing. Thus, the validity of the entire administrative process is called into ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>tion. We conclude that the Board\u2019s order must be vacated, and the case be remanded for further proceedings before another ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Accordingly, It is ORDERED that the order of the National Labor Relations Board be and hereby is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings before another ALJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
