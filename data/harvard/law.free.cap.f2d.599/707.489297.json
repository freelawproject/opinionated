Plaintiffs appeal from various pretrial orders of the district court requiring the Association to reveal by proper pleadings the true identities of lawyers A-D and to answer certain defense interrogatories. These interrogatories, among other things, ask the identities of the officers and members of the Association\u2019s governing body and request information respecting the Association\u2019s relationship to SMU. Defendants contend that the trial court\u2019s orders are not appealable, but we conclude that the orders are appealable under the collateral order doctrine and, with the single modification described below, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">\n<em>1. Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">On May 5, 1976, the Association filed a complaint, on behalf of itself, its women members and all women situated similarly to its women members, against Wynne &amp; Jaffe, a Dallas law firm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Association charged that Wynne &amp; Jaffe violated Title VII by discriminating against women in hiring summer law clerks. The law firm answered the complaint on May 26, denying that its summer hiring practices violated the Act. Plaintiff and defendant served interrogatories on each other in July and August. On August 9, the Association filed objections to Wynne &amp; Jaffe\u2019s interrogatories and also moved for a protective order. Plaintiff averred that many of defendant law firm\u2019s interrogatories sought information privileged from disclosure under the, Constitution and Title VII and contended that disclosure would cause \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s officers . . . the women members of plaintiff and the women represented by plaintiff embarrassment, annoyance and economic loss\u201d;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Association also moved, \u201c[i]f the foregoing objections are not sustained in full,\u201d that any information revealed pursuant to Wynne &amp; Jaffe\u2019s interrogatories \u201cshould be available only in confidence to defendant\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a motion for leave to intervene as a party-plaintiff on August 23. Judge Higginbotham issued an order respecting Wynne &amp; Jaffe\u2019s interrogatories on October 12, sustaining the Association\u2019s objection to four of the interrogatories and requiring it to answer the remaining twenty-nine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court also ruled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>defense counsel \u201cshall not communicate Plaintiff\u2019s answers ... to any person other\u201d than two named partners of Wynne &amp; Jaffe and ordered these lawyers not to \u201ccommunicate such answers of Plaintiff to any other person, including without limitation, members, associates and employees of the Defendant law firm, except upon further application to and order of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">On October 26, the Association brought a separate suit against Thompson, Knight, Simmons &amp; Bullion, another Dallas law firm, alleging similar Title VII violations in the hiring of summer law clerks and associates.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thompson, Knight answered the complaint on December 3, denying the charges, and on December 15 the EEOC filed a motion for leave to intervene as a party plaintiff. On February 23, 1977, while the EEOC\u2019s motions to intervene in the two actions were still pending, the cases were transferred from Judge Higginboth-am to Judge Woodward. The Association moved for permission to file amended complaints in both actions on March 15, seeking to add as named plaintiffs the following alleged victims of each firm\u2019s purported discrimination: Lawyer A and Lawyer B in the Wynne &amp; Jaffe suit and Lawyers A-D in the action against Thompson, Knight. On April 13, these anonymous persons and the Association moved for protective orders in each case, asking the court to limit to defendants\u2019 respective counsel pretrial disclosure of \u201cthe identities, or information which reasonably discloses the identities\u201d of the anonymous plaintiffs and the members of the Association.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Judge Woodward issued an order on May 10 granting the EEOC\u2019s motions to intervene in the two actions and the Association\u2019s request for leave to amend its complaints by adding A-D as parties plaintiff, \u201cexcept that the identities of Lawyers A, B, C and D must be disclosed for these complaints and for all further purposes. (Only Lawyers A and B need be named in Wynne &amp; Jaffe).\u201d The trial court reasoned that \u201c[t]he demand of the Association to prevent disclosure of Lawyers A-D is not mandated by the record. This is not a case involving racial strife or labor informants. Present there, but not here, were dangers of physical harm to the protected parties. Here the harm is at the most economic and at the least social. Further, the mechanics of nondisclosure would only further complicate an already complicated set of cases.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">On May 19, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting the district court to amend its May 10 order \u201cso as to permit an interlocutory appeal therefrom pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b)\u201d; the trial judge denied that motion on May 25. Meanwhile, Wynne &amp; Jaffe served plaintiffs with a second set of interrogatories on May 24. Plaintiffs moved for a \u201cprotective and restraining order\u201d to strike certain interrogatories on May 27, objecting to defendant\u2019s queries with respect to the Association\u2019s current membership list and the identities of the women whom plaintiffs alleged were reluctant to join or \u201clabor for the Association in the public eye\u201d and fearful \u201cthat, if they are associated with the Association, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>will be singled out for discrimination by Defendants and other law firms.\u201d In an order entered June 8, Judge Woodward declared that he would grant a defense motion to produce the Association\u2019s current membership list \u201cif same is not voluntarily produced by the plaintiffs\u201d and instructed plaintiffs to reply to the other contested interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">\n<em>II. Appealability of the District Court\u2019s Orders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Plaintiffs urge us to reverse the trial court\u2019s orders compelling disclosure of the identities of A-D and information regarding the Association\u2019s membership. They assert that the four anonymous lawyers and the organization\u2019s members will \u201csuffer economically and socially should their participation in these actions become generally known.\u201d Lawyers A, B and C, in sealed affidavits, express a belief that they would \u201cbe eased out\u201d or \u201cassigned less desirable matters\u201d by their current employers and one of the women suggests \u201cthat her firm would likely lose business should her identity become known.\u201d Plaintiffs further argue that if the identities of A-D and the Association\u2019s members are revealed and these persons \u201cfind it difficult to practice law,\u201d other professionals subjected to illegal discrimination will become reluctant to bring Title VII actions and hesitant to band together \u201cin law and other professional schools to advocate their rights under the civil rights statutes.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 brief on appeal, pp. 25-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">However, before considering the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, we must determine whether the district court\u2019s pretrial disclosure orders are appealable, for as Mr. Justice Jackson observed in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corporation, </em>\u201c[a]ppeal gives the upper court a power of review, not one of intervention. So long as the matter remains open, unfinished or inconclusive, there may be no intrusion by appeal.\u201d 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 empowers the courts of appeal to hear \u201cappeals from all <em>final decisions </em>of the district courts.\u201d (emphasis added) Generally, this means \u201ca decision by the District Court that \u2018ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2457, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978), <em>quoting Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 633, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945). Section 1291 \u201cdisallow[s] appeal from any decision which is tentative, informal or incomplete\u201d and permits no appeal of decisions \u201cwhere they are but steps towards final judgment in which they will merge.\u201d <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corporation, supra, </em>337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225. But courts have long given this statute \u201ca practical rather than a technical construction,\u201d <em>id.; see Gillespie v. United States Steel Corporation, </em>379 U.S. 148, 153, 85 S.Ct. 308, 311, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964); <em>In re Nissan Motor Corporation Antitrust Litigation, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 552 F.2d 1088, 1095; <em>Diaz v. Southern Drilling Corporation, </em>5 Cir., 1970, 427 F.2d 1118, while striving to balance \u201cthe inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review on the one hand and the danger of denying justice by delay on the other.\u201d <em>In re 1975-2 Grand Jury Investigation, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 566 F.2d 1293, 1299; <em>Gillespie v. United States Steel Corporation, supra, </em>379 U.S. at 153, 85 S.Ct. at 311; <em>Freeman v. Califano, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 574 F.2d 264, 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Under the collateral order doctrine announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Cohen, supra, </em>a trial court order is an appealable section 1291 \u201cfinal decision\u201d when it represents \u201ca final disposition of a claimed right which is not an ingredient of the cause of action and does not require consideration with it\u201d and which presents \u201ca serious and unsettled question\u201d of law. 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1226. To fall within the <em>Cohen </em>rule, the trial court\u2019s orders requiring disclosure of the identities of A-D and the information respecting the Association\u2019s membership must fulfill three requirements: (1) they must have fully dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>posed of the disclosure issues raised by plaintiffs, leaving nothing \u201copen, unfinished or inconclusive\u201d; (2) the orders must not have been mere steps toward a final judgment on the merits and the disclosure issues must be \u201ccompletely collateral to the cause of action asserted\u201d; and (3) the district court\u2019s rulings must affect \u201cimportant right[s] which would be \u2018lost, probably irreparably,\u2019 if review had to await final judgment; hence, to be effective, appellate review in [this] . . . special, limited setting [must] ... be immediate.\u201d <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 2040, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977); <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, supra, </em>437 U.S. at 468, 98 S.Ct. at 2458 (1978); <em>United States v. Gurney, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 558 F.2d 1202, 1207; <em>In re Nissan Motor Corporation Antitrust Litigation, supra, </em>552 F.2d at 1094-95.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab6\">The district court\u2019s pretrial disclosure orders pass the <em>Cohen </em>test of appealability. Since there is no \u201cplain prospect that the trial court may itself alter the challenged ruling[s],\u201d we regard them as finished and conclusive. <em>United States v. Gurney, supra, </em>558 F.2d at 1207. Also, the questions whether plaintiffs must reveal the Association\u2019s membership information and the identities of A-D are plainly \u201cindependent and easily separable from the substance\u201d of their allegations that defendants have engaged in illegal sex discrimination. \u201cAscertaining the propriety of the order[s] will not require examining either the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 asserted . . . claims or any possible defenses of the defendants.\u201d <em>In re Nissan Motor Corporation Antitrust Litigation, supra, </em>552 F.2d at 1094, 1095; <em>Abney v. United States, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 658, 97 S.Ct. at 2040; <em>United States v. Gurney, supra, </em>558 F.2d at 1207. Moreover, to postpone review until final judgment would risk irremediable injury to the rights that plaintiffs assert. Under the trial court\u2019s order, if lawyers A-D wish to preserve anonymity, they must abandon their individual claims and rely on other parties to vindicate their Title VII interests; if they decide instead to continue as individual plaintiffs, the four women must face the purported economic and social hazards of disclosure. Whichever course A-D follow, delayed review could not effectively repair any attendant damage to their rights. Similarly, because the identities of the Association\u2019s members, once revealed, could not again be concealed, review following a decision on the merits would come too late to remedy any injury caused by the order to disclose the membership information. Finally, we recognize that plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the trial court\u2019s orders raises \u201cserious and unsettled questions of law . that this court has not previously addressed,\u201d <em>In re Nissan Motor Corporation Antitrust Litigation, supra, </em>552 F.2d at 1095, particularly in the novel contention that Title VII plaintiffs are entitled to bring suit under fictitious names. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\u2019s pretrial disclosure orders are appealable and therefore advance to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\"><em>III. Disclosing the Identities of A </em>\u2014 D</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Plaintiffs have not cited, nor have we found, any prior decisions which recognize or even discuss the right of Title VII plaintiffs to proceed anonymously. Neither the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure nor Title VII itself make provision for anonymous plaintiffs. The rules require that \u201c[i]n the complaint the title of the action shall include the names of all the parties,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(a), and the language of Title VII establishes no exception to the general principle that \u201cthe identity of the parties to a lawsuit should not be concealed.\u201d <em>Doe v. Deschamps, </em>D.Montana, 1974, 64 F.R.D. 652, 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Under certain special circumstances, however, courts have allowed plaintiffs to use fictitious names. \u201c[W]here the issues involved are matters of a sensitive and highly personal nature,\u201d such as birth control,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>abortion,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> homosexuality<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or the welfare rights of illegitimate children or abandoned families,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the normal practice of disclosing the parties\u2019 identities yields \u201cto a policy of protecting privacy in a very private matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the cases affording plaintiffs anonymity all share several characteristics missing here. The plaintiffs in those actions, at the least, divulged personal information of the utmost intimacy; many also had to admit that they either had violated state laws or government regulations or wished to engage in prohibited conduct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Here, by contrast, to prove their case A-D need not reveal facts of a highly personal nature or express a desire to participate in proscribed activities. Furthermore, all of the plaintiffs previously allowed in other cases to proceed anonymously were challenging the constitutional, statutory or regulatory validity of government activity. While such suits involve no injury to the Government\u2019s \u201creputation,\u201d the mere filing of a civil action against other private parties may cause damage to their good names and reputation and may also result in economic harm. Defendant law firms stand publicly accused of serious violations of federal law. Basic fairness dictates that those among the defendants\u2019 accusers who wish to participate in this suit as individual party plaintiffs must do so under their real names.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Plaintiffs argue that disclosure of A-D\u2019s identities will leave them vulnerable to retaliation from their current employers, prospective future employers and an organized bar that does \u201cnot like lawyers who sue lawyers.\u201d In our view, A-D face no greater threat of retaliation than the typical plaintiff alleging Title VII violations, including the other women who, under their real names and not anonymously, have filed sex discrimination suits against large law firms. <em>See, e. g., Kohn v. Royall, Koegel &amp; Wells, </em>S.D.N.Y.1973, 59 F.R.D. 515, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>2 Cir., 1974, 496 F.2d 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Because we find neither an express congressional grant of the right to proceed anonymously nor a compelling need to \u201cprotect[] privacy in a very private matter,\u201d <em>Doe v. Deschamps, supra, </em>64 F.R.D. at 653, we hold that these Title VII plaintiffs may not sue under fictitious names and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order requiring disclosure of A-D\u2019s identities by proper pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">\n<em>IV. Disclosure of the Membership Information</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">In his June 8, 1977 order, Judge Woodward stated that he would grant a motion by defendant Wynne &amp; Jaffe to produce the Association\u2019s current membership list \u201cif same is not voluntarily produced\u201d and instructed plaintiffs to answer certain questions in Wynne &amp; Jaffe\u2019s second set of interrogatories regarding the identities of the women whom plaintiffs claimed were hesitant to join \u201cor labor for the Association in the public eye\u201d and who were afraid \u201cthat, if they associated with the Association, they will be singled out for discrimination by Defendants and other law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>firms.\u201d However, the June 8 order does not determine the extent to which Wynne &amp; Jaffe\u2019s counsel may disclose the information contained in the membership list and the replies to the interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Under Judge Higginbotham\u2019s order of October 12, 1976, dealing with Wynne &amp; Jaffe\u2019s first set of interrogatories, defendant law firm\u2019s counsel may \u201cnot communicate Plaintiff\u2019s answers ... to any person other\u201d than two named partners of the firm, who in turn are forbidden to divulge plaintiff\u2019s responses to any other persons \u201cexcept upon further application to and order of this Court.\u201d We believe that this ruling strikes a sensible balance between Wynne &amp; Jaffe\u2019s need to defend this lawsuit and the Association\u2019s desire to avoid the purportedly adverse consequences of revealing information with respect to its membership. Therefore, we hold that the disclosure limitations announced in the October 12, 1976 order will also apply to the Association\u2019s membership list and plaintiffs\u2019 answers to Wynne &amp; Jaffe\u2019s second set of interrogatories. With that modification, we affirm the order of the trial court dated June 8, 1977.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">MODIFIED AND AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-27\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17 (Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-6\">.
