(Robbins) appeals from the decision of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (board), <em>Questor Corp. v. Dan Robbins &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>199 USPQ 358 (TTAB 1978), sustaining opposition No. 55,579 by Questor Corporation (Questor) against Robbins\u2019 application to register LI\u2019L TINKER and design for children\u2019s books, and dismissing Robbins\u2019 counterclaim for cancellation of Questor\u2019s registration No. 96,175 of TINKERTOY used on games, toys and children\u2019s building blocks. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-11\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-12\">Questor and its predecessors have for many years extensively used and advertised TINKERTOY as a trademark for toy construction sets.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-13\">Robbins approached Questor in 1972, seeking a right to solicit licensees outside the toy field. A resulting agreement acknowledged Questor\u2019s rights in the mark. To aid a licensing program for children\u2019s books, Robbins developed this mark:</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-17\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-18\">Though Robbins\u2019 promotional material claimed that children\u2019s stories about the animated \u201cLi\u2019l Tinker\u201d character would \u201cfurther strengthen the Tinkertoy image\u201d and \u201copen up a whole new dimension in our Tinkertoy licensing program,\u201d he was unable to secure Questor\u2019s permission to use the mark in areas noncompetitive to Ques-tor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-19\">Questor opposed Robbins\u2019 application for federal registration, relying on uncontested prior use of its federally-registered mark TINKERTOY for games, toys and children\u2019s building blocks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Robbins denied likelihood of confusion and petitioned to cancel Questor\u2019s registration, alleging that TINKERTOY had become the common descriptive name of Questor\u2019s construction toys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-20\">On January 6, 1976, Questor deposed Mr. Robbins, president of Robbins, with his attorney present. The reporter did not ask Mr. Robbins to sign the transcript until February 26. On May 28, Questor asked Robbins\u2019 counsel about Mr. Robbins\u2019 availability for signing. The transcript was not filed in the PTO until July 28, when Robbins had not yet received a copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>The board granted Robbins\u2019 motion to strike for noncompliance with Trademark Rule of Practice 125(a), 37 CFR 2.125(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> considering the testimony a discovery deposition. When Questor moved for clarification, the board vacated its order, denied the motion in view of Mr. Robbins\u2019 refusal to cooperate with the reporter, and allowed Questor until February 25, 1977 to make service. The board denied Robbins\u2019 petition for reconsideration. When Questor served the deposition on March 23,1977, after close of the testimony and briefing periods, Robbins again moved to strike, for noncompliance with the board\u2019s deadline. The board denied that motion, in view of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d between Questor and the reporter. Robbins\u2019 petition to the Commissioner was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">Noting that toys and children\u2019s books are sold in the same channels of commerce to the same purchasers, the board sustained the opposition, finding the similarities between the marks and the numerous uses of the word \u201ctinkertoy\u201d and illustrations of interconnected dowels and spools in Robbins\u2019 book \u201csufficient to lead purchasers and prospective purchasers to mistakenly assume that the book emanates from or is in some way associated with the producer of \u2018TINKERTOY\u2019 toys.\u201d (199 USPQ at 366-67). The board dismissed Robbins\u2019 counterclaim, finding it unsupported by evidence and inconsistent with Robbins\u2019 licensing program position. (199 USPQ at 364-66).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">The issues presented are whether the board erred in (1) denying the motion to strike, (2) sustaining the opposition, or (3) dismissing the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">(1) <em>Motion to Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">Jurisdiction over appeals from the board is governed by Section 21(a)(1) of the Lan-ham Act (Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(a)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-12\">[A] party to an opposition proceeding, * * * [or a] party to a cancellation proceeding, * * * who is dissatisfied with the <em>decision </em>of the Commissioner or Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, may appeal to the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals * * *. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1098-15\">Interlocutory decisions are reviewable on appeal of the final judgment only if \u201clogically related\u201d to the basic substantive issues in the case. <em>Palisades Pageants, Inc. </em>v. <em>Miss America Pageant, </em>442 F.2d 1385, 1388, 58 CCPA 1225, 1228, 169 USPQ 790, 792, <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 938, 92 S.Ct. 269, 30 L.Ed.2d 251, 171 USPQ 641 (1971); <em>Hercules Inc. v. National Patent Development Corp., </em>524 F.2d 1227, 1228, 187 USPQ 668, 669 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1975). A purely procedural issue, like that raised by Robbins\u2019 motion to strike for untimeliness, is not sufficiently related to be reviewable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-16\">The basic appealable issues here are likelihood of confusion and descriptiveness of Questor\u2019s mark. Whether the board granted or denied the motion to strike would not determine the outcome or preclude a determination of either issue. The board\u2019s denial of Robbins\u2019 motion to strike was neither a dispositive decision adjudicating a right nor a decision sufficiently related to the merits of the appealable issues to warrant appellate review. Hence Robbins\u2019 appeal, insofar as it relates to the motion to strike, is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-17\">(2) <em>Opposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-18\">In determining likelihood of confusion, consideration is given to the marks, the goods described in the application and registration, and all the circumstances bearing on the marketing environment. <em>Industrial Nucleonics Corp. v. Hinde, </em>475 F.2d 1197, 1199, 177 USPQ 386, 387 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1973); <em>In re E.I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (Cust &amp; Pat.App.1973). The over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>all commercial impression derived from viewing the marks in their entireties is controlling. <em>New England Fish Co. v. The Hervin Co., </em>511 F.2d 562, 563, 184 USPQ 817, 818 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1975). A mark\u2019s fame can influence its breadth of protection. <em>Tiffany &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Tiffany Tile Corp., </em>345 F.2d 214, 215, 52 CCPA 1396, 1397, 145 USPQ 483, 483 (1965). The marks need not be used on directly competing goods, any relation likely to lead purchasers into assuming a common source being sufficient. <em>See Sterling Drug Inc. v. Sebring, </em>515 F.2d 1128, 1132, 185 USPQ 659, 652 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1975). Evidence of the applicant\u2019s intent is probative, but not conclusive where confusion is otherwise unlikely. <em>Kramer Trenton Co. v. Walcutt, </em>408 F.2d 479, 480, 56 CCPA 1026, 1027-28, 161 USPQ 228, 229 (1969); <em>Shoe Corp. of America v. Juvenile Shoe Corp. of America, </em>266 F.2d 793, 795, 46 CCPA 868, 871, 121 USPQ 510, 512 (1959); <em>Lever Brothers Co. v. Riodela Chemical Co., </em>41 F.2d 408, 411, 17 CCPA 1272, 1276-77, 5 USPQ 152, 154-55 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">Questor and its predecessors engaged in substantial advertising and sales of TINKERTOY construction sets. Individuals within the toy industry testified that TINKERTOY is one of the better known trademarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">Robbins\u2019 and Questor\u2019s marks are not without similarity, \u201ctinker\u201d being a common element.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Robbins\u2019 design depicts Questor\u2019s toy construction product. That Questor has no exclusive rights in the shape of those toys<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> does not destroy its right to rely on its registration as evidence of its exclusive right to use TINKERTOY with those or other forms of children\u2019s building blocks and to resist a registration when likelihood of confusion exists. Incorporation of a design depicting another\u2019s product, in a mark including a term similar to that other\u2019s word mark, must in this case be viewed as contributing to a likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-12\">Questor\u2019s games, toys, and children\u2019s building blocks, and Robbins\u2019 children\u2019s books, all have a common marketing environment, being sold generally in toy stores and toy departments of retail stores to the same purchasers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-13\">Robbins was well aware of Questor\u2019s TINKERTOY mark when it adopted its own mark. Like the promotional material Robbins used in the licensing program, Robbins\u2019 mark was created specifically to produce and highlight an association between Robbins\u2019 mark and the TINKERTOY mark. A mark designed to maximize association between entities, as here, is likely to lead to confusion in the absence of a proper license relationship between those entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-14\">We sustain the finding of likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-15\">(3) <em>Cancellation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-16\">Under Section 7(b) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1057(b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> registrations are pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>sumed valid. One seeking cancellation must rebut that presumption by a preponderance of evidence. <em>Massey Junior College, Inc. v. Fashion Institute of Technology, </em>492 F.2d 1399, 1403, 181 USPQ 272, 275 (Cust &amp; Pat.App.1974).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Under Section 14(c) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> registrations of marks that have become common descriptive names can be cancelled. Common descriptive names, being incapable of indicating source, are the antitheses of trademarks. <em>Roux Laboratories, Inc. v. Clairol Inc., </em>427 F.2d 823, 829, 57 CCPA 1173, 1181, 166 USPQ 34, 39 (1970). That a mark includes common English words does not render it incapable of functioning as a trademark, <em>see, e. g., Maremont Corp. v. Air Lift Co., </em>463 F.2d 1114, 59 CCPA 1152, 174 USPQ 395 (1972); <em>In re The Chesapeake Corporation, </em>420 F.2d 754, 57 CCPA 838, 164 USPQ 395 (1970), because marks are considered as a whole. <em>See Tektronix, Inc. v. Daktronics, Inc., </em>534 F.2d 915, 916-17, 189 USPQ 693, 694 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1976). It is enough that purchasers can rely on a mark to distinguish products emanating from different sources, and a mark need not identify a specific source. <em>Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co. v. American Oil Co., </em>405 F.2d 803, 819, 160 USPQ 289, 301 (CA8), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 905, 89 S.Ct. 1745, 23 L.Ed.2d 218 (1969); <em>cf. E.I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Celanese Corp., </em>167 F.2d 484, 35 CCPA 1061, 1067-69, 488-90, 77 USPQ 364, 367-69 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">Whether the relevant purchasing public regards a term as a common descriptive name is a question of fact to be resolved on the evidence. <em>Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co., </em>272 F. 505, 509 (S.D.N.Y.1921) (L. Hand, J.). Purchaser testimony, consumer surveys, and listings in dictionaries, trade journals, newspapers and other publications, are useful evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">We agree with the board\u2019s careful analysis of Robbins\u2019 documentary exhibits (199 USPQ at 365-66) and see no value in reiterating it here. We conclude, as did the board, that \u201cthis material falls ruefully short of establishing that \u2018TINKERTOY\u2019 is devoid of trademark significance.\u201d <em>Questor Corp. v. Dan Robbins &amp; Associates, Inc., supra </em>at 365.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">Robbins\u2019 attempt to analogize the TINKERTOY mark to the CELLOPHANE mark, declared generic in <em>Du Pont Cellophane Co., Inc. v. Waxed Products Co., Inc., </em>85 F.2d 75, 30 USPQ 332 (CA2), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 U.S. 601, 57 S.Ct. 194, 81 L.Ed. 443 (1936), is not supported by adequate proof. The attack made here on the board for an alleged failure to \u201ceven consider the possibility that the fame of TINKERTOY might be as the generic name of the product, not otherwise\u201d borders the irresponsible, the board having expressly determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-11\">This material clearly does not support applicant\u2019s claim that \u2018TINKERTOY\u2019 is a common descriptive name in the toy field and graphically demonstrates what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>alluded to above, namely, that applicant was hardput to come up with any material which could support its position herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">(199 USPQ at 366).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">Relying primarily on argument, Robbins says Questor, as pioneer of a new product, was not concerned with legal \u201cniceties\u201d associated with preserving its trademark. That unsupported statement is completely at odds with the presumption of validity set forth above, as is this attempt by Robbins to improperly shift the burden of proof to Questor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-7\">The fame of \u201cTINKERTOY\u201d was and now is not disputed. However, such is not the slightest indication that it <em>is not a common descriptive name. </em>\u201cTelephone\u201d, \u201cgasoline\u201d and \u201ccellophane\u201d are equally famous. When first adopted, they were not inherently descriptive. But now they are common descriptive names.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">Similarly, the contention that the board required of Robbins too high a burden of proof must fall. The board\u2019s opinion, read as a whole, demonstrates that it simply found Robbins\u2019 evidence so weak as to be inadequate under any reasonable standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">Robbins say the board erred in finding that Questor asserted no exclusive rights in the construction toys sold under its mark, and accuses Questor of using the mark to achieve an \u201cunlimited monopoly\u201d in contravention of the \u201cpublic policy against impeding competition.\u201d The argument begs the question, Robbins having failed to prove that TINKERTOY is the common descriptive name of Questor\u2019s toys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">We sustain the dismissal of the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-12\">Robbins\u2019 appeal, insofar as it relates to the motion to strike, is dismissed. The decisions of the board sustaining Questor\u2019s opposition and dismissing Robbins\u2019 counterclaim for cancellation are <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1097-15\">. In January 1978, Questor sold the assets, including the trademark TINKERTOY, of its Que-stor Education Products Company division, to Child Guidance Playthings, Inc. (CGP), a subsidiary of Gabriel Industries, Inc. (Gabriel). Questor was obligated to complete this <em>appeal. </em>CGP and Gabriel are now owned by CBS Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1097-22\">. Questor having failed to answer a request for admission, abandonment of its federally-registered marks, TOM TINKER, TINKER ZOO, and a dowels-spool caricature design, must be taken as admitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1098-10\">. Rule 125(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-11\">(a) One copy of the transcript of testimony (taken in accordance with \u00a7 2.123(e) through (h) or \u00a7 2.124), together with copies of documentary exhibits, shall be served on each adverse party within 30 days after comple-turn of the taking of such testimony. The certified transcript and exhibits and one copy of the transcript shall be filed in the Patent and Trademark Office as promptly as possible.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">. Robbins\u2019 reliance on third-party registrations of marks containing \u201ctinker\u201d is unpersuasive where, as here, confusion appears likely in view of all the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">. Questor\u2019s utility patents on the toy construction sets, Nos. 1,113,371, 1,198,263, and 1,916,-634, have expired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">. The board improperly emphasized the <em>contents </em>of the book submitted as a specimen. (199 USPQ at 366-67). Likelihood of confusion occurs upon observance of the mark and goods. It need not await a reading of the book. The mark, not the specimen, is submitted for registration. The application was for children\u2019s books generally, not for a particular book. Although consideration of a specimen is appropriate, <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. C. J. Webb, Inc., </em>442 F.2d 1376, 1378, 58 CCPA 1255, 1257, 170 USPQ 35, 36 (1971), and may in a proper case reflect an intent, likelihood of confusion must be decided on the <em>class </em>of goods involved. <em>In re Superior Outdoor Display, Inc., </em>478 F.2d 1388, 1391, 178 USPQ 151;- 153 (Cust. &amp; Pat. App. 1973). For that reason, Robbins\u2019 offer to delete from the specimen book all reference to TINKERTOY is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1099-17\">.

(199 USPQ at 364-65). A preponderance is required, as are caution and careful consideration, in every case. That a preponderance may be more difficult to establish in some cases than in others does not justify a broad difference in decisional approach. <em>Massey Junior College, Inc. v.
