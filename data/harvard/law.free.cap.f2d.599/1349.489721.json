The trial judge found that the United States magistrate issued the warrant to seize a print of the movie without probable cause. As we conclude, however, that probable cause of the film\u2019s obscenity existed, we hold that the district judge erred in his ruling and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-15\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-16\">We take the facts pertinent to this appeal from the affidavit of FBI Special Agent Frank Quijada, which was filed with the United States magistrate in support of Qui-jada\u2019s application for a search warrant. The affidavit read in full as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AfGz\">AFFIDAVIT FOR SEARCH WARRANT</p>\n<p id=\"ANZq\">I, Frank S. Quijada, affiant, being duly sworn deposes and says:</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-17\">1. Affiant is employed as a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United States Department of Justice. Affiant has been assigned to the investigation of the interstate transportation of obscene matter, within the jurisdiction of the FBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>2. Affiant has conducted an investigation of the Sinerama Adult Theatre, 3615 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana, and as a result of my personal participation in the investigation, I have personal knowledge of the facts set out in this affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">3. Affiant, based on the facts set forth in this affidavit, now has reason to believe and does believe that on the premises known as the Sinerama Adult Theatre, further described as a beige colored brick, glass fronted building appearing from the outside to be two stories, with a portico facing Tulane Avenue displaying three signs, one on each of three sides, stating Adult Sinera-ma Theatre. The words Adult and Theatre are written in black and the word Sinerama is in white block letters. The letters S, N, R, and M of Sinerama are on a red background and the letters I, E, A, and A are on a blue background. The Sinerama Adult Theatre is located at 3615 Tulane Avenue, and is bounded on the west side by South Telemachus Street and on the east side by South Genois.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">4. The basis for affiant\u2019s beliefs set forth above are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-6\">5. On July 6, 1976, I observed an advertisement in the movie section of the \u201cTimes-Picayune\u201d newspaper, New Orleans, Louisiana, dated July 6, 1976, for the Siner-ama Adult Theatre, 3615 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana, telephone 488-3731. This advertisement stated that the currently featured movies playing at the Sinerama Adult Theatre were \u201cHullucination of a Lady\u201d plus \u201cBlack Socks.\u201d This advertisement listed the address for the Sinerama Adult Theatre as 3615 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana, and listed the theatre telephone number as 488-3731.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-7\">6. On July 7, 1976, at approximately 11:05 A.M., I called telephone number 488-3731 and a male answered by saying \u201cSiner-ama Theatre.\u201d When I asked what features were currently playing at the Sinera-ma, the individual advised that the features were \u201cIllusions\u201d and \u201cBlack Socks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-8\">7. On July 6,1976,1 contacted Robert E. Parrish of Film Inspection Service, 2411 Edenborn Avenue, Metairie, Louisiana. Parrish provided Film Inspection Service records to me which contained the below-described information:</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-10\">a. Records revealed that the films entitled \u201cIllusions of a Lady\u201d and \u201cBlack Socks\u201d were received by the Film Inspection Service, Metairie, Louisiana, on July 1, 1976, and that the films arrived from Atlanta, Georgia, where they had been shipped under Profit by Air Bill Number 30697741.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-11\">b. Records revealed that the films were given to the Sinerama Adult Theatre, New Orleans, Louisiana, on July 1, 1976, for a play date of July 2, 1976 through July 8, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-12\">c. Records revealed that the film \u201cillusions of a Lady\u201d consisted of eight 1,000-foot reels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-13\">8. On July 7, 1976, Special Agent (SA) Aloysius J. McFall viewed the color movie \u201cIllusions of a Lady\u201d at the Sinerama Adult Theatre, 3615 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana, after paying an admission price of $5.00. The below is a description of the color movie \u201cIllusions of a Lady\u201d as described to me by SA McFall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-14\">a. SA McFall advised me that the credits that appear at the beginning of the film show the title of the film to be \u201cIllusions of a Lady\u201d with two subordinate titles. He further advised that the credits show that the film is a Jonas Middleton Production starring Andrea True.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-15\">b. SA McFall advised me that at approximately 10:15 AM the movie, \u201cIllusions of a Lady\u201d began with a scene showing a white male model kissing the breast, thighs and vagina of a white female model. The male model is shown performing cunnilingus on the vagina of the white female and penetration by the tongue of the white male of the vagina is explicitly shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-16\">c. SA McFall advised me that another scene shows a white female model sitting on a couch and a white male model kneeling in front of the female. The female grabs the head of the male and she pulls it on to her vaginal area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>d. SA McFall advised that the movie contains a scene where a white male model is kissing a white female and that the female then assumes a reclining position on a table and that the male model is observed mounting the female and inserting his penis into her vagina. Sexual intercourse is explicitly shown with penetration from different angles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">e. SA McFall advised me that the movie contains a homosexual scene wherein two white nude females are observed performing the act of cunnilingus on each other with penetration of the tongue of the vagina clearly shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">f. SA McFall advised me that the movie shows a scene where a white female model performs the act of fellatio on a white male model. The scene shows the penis of the male model penetrating into the mouth of the female while the female simultaneously masturbates the penis of the male.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-7\">g. SA McFall advised me that the film contains a scene wherein a white male model is observed to lay out the undergarmets of a female in the relative position as if they where on a woman. The, male is observed fondling each piece of undergarmet and smells the panties before putting them on the rug. The male model fondles his penis and then lays on top of the undergar-mets and performs hip motions as if he is engaged in the act of intercourse with the panties. The male model then dresses himself in the female undergarmets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-8\">h. SA McFall advised me that the movie contains another homosexual scene where two white female models are observed kissing each other on the mouth and then one female model performing the act of cunnilingus on the second female with penetration of the tongue of the vagina clearly shown from different angles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-9\">i. SA McFall advised me that the movie contains a scene wherein a white male model is shown masturbating his penis while at the same time fondling and kissing the heel of a black shoe. The male continues to masturbate until he ejaculates onto some female undergarmets which are in front of his penis. After the male ejaculates on the undergarmets he urinates on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-11\">j. SA McFall advised me that the movie contains a scene of unnatural sexual activity. A white female model inserts a carrot into her vagina and penetration of the carrot into the vagina is clearly shown. While the female inserts the carrot into her vagina she masturbates her clitoris with her other hand. The female then withdraws the carrot from her vagina and licks it with her tongue several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-12\">k. SA McFall advised me that the movie shows another scene of unnatural sexual activity when a white male model masturbates while a white female model holds a spoon in front of his penis. The male ejaculates and semen is shown falling on the spoon. The female then places her right index finger in the semen and then puts the right index finger in her mouth. The female then pours the semen in the spoon into a metal teapot and pours hot water into the teapot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-13\">l. SA McFall advised me that the movie contains a scene of group sex involving three white female models and two white male models. A female model is observed inserting a cucumber into her vagina and subsequently removing it and inserting it into her mouth. A male is observed performing the act of cunnilingus on a female and penetration of the tongue into the vagina is explicitly depicted. A female performs the act of fallatio on a male and penetration of the penis into the mouth is clearly shown. Two females then perform fallatio on the penis of one of the males and insertion of the penis into the mouth of the female is clearly shown as is the kissing of the scrotums by the second female. The male then ejaculates on to the face and semen is clearly shown on the face of one of the females.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-14\">m. SA McFall advised me that the movie contains another scene of group sex wherein two white male models grab a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>white female model and one of the male models performs the act of sexual intercourse on the female with penetration clearly shown. While one male model performs intercourse on the female the second male appears to be striking the female with a black leather strap. After the two males perform intercourse with the female the two males then perform sexual intercourse and cunnilingus with three other females.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">n. SA McFall advised me that the film ended at approximately 11:20 AM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-5\">o. WHEREFORE, your affiant prays that a search warrant be issued to any Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a branch of the United States Department of Justice, authorizing him to conduct a search in the daytime on the premises located at the Sinerama Adult Theatre, 3615 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana; and authorizing him to take from the' premises all such things as described above found anywhere in the premises including but not limited to the currently featured obscene color movie entitled \u201cIllusions of a Lady\u201d, records, waybills, feight bills, bills of lading, invoices, order forms, delivery and/or payment receipts, cancelled checks, statements and other items to the end that same may be dealt with according to law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-6\">s/Frank S.

Johannesen</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-12\">United States Magistrate,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-13\">Eastern District of Louisiana</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1440-14\">On July 8, the United States, magistrate issued a warrant, pursuant to which FBI agents searched the Sinerama and seized the theatre\u2019s copy of \u201cIllusions of a Lady.\u201d A grand jury subsequently indicted defendants, who then filed motions to suppress and return \u201call evidence seized by government agents on the ground[ ] . . . that the search warrant was issued without probable cause.\u201d They contended that Agent Quijada\u2019s affidavit \u201cfails to inform the magistrate whether\u201d the twelve scenes of explicit sex therein described \u201care representative of all portions in the movie\u201d and \u201cwhether the film contains a story line, dialogue, narrative or any portions of a non-sexual nature.\u201d Defendants argued that the magistrate was therefore unable to determine, as <em>Miller v. California </em>dictates, the probable obscenity of the film \u201ctaken as a whole.\u201d 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2615, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-17\">The district judge agreed with that contention and granted the suppression motions. He noted \u201cthe strict standards for obtaining a warrant for material which has presumptive First Amendment protection,\u201d stated that the <em>Miller </em>obscenity test \u201crequire^] examination of the work as a whole,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe description of the film in the affidavit is incomplete on its face and could not have provided the magistrate with an opportunity to \u2018focus searchingly\u2019 upon the issue of obscenity under the definition contained in <em>Miller.\u201d </em>Observing that the \u201caffidavit does not reveal the approximate length of time devoted\u201d to the explicit sex scenes, \u201cso that it is not apparent whether the scenes comprise the entire film or a minute portion of it,\u201d the trial court held \u201cthat the affidavit <em>is insufficient to support a finding that the film is obscene.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-19\">\n<em>II. The District Court\u2019s Failure to Apply the Proper Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-20\">A search and seizure involving material \u201cpresumptively under the protection of the First Amendment\u201d must clear \u201ca higher hurdle in the evaluation of reasonableness\u201d under the Fourth Amendment than must similar actions aimed at mere contraband, \u201cbecause we examine what is \u2018unreasonable\u2019 in the light of the values of freedom of expression.\u201d <em>Roaden v. Ken</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number><em>tucky, </em>413 U.S. 496, 504, 93 S.Ct. 2796, 2801, 37 L.Ed.2d 757 (1973). <em>See Lee Art Theatre v. Virginia, </em>392 U.S. 636, 637, 88 S.Ct. 2103, 2104, 20 L.Ed.2d 1313 (1968); <em>Stanford v. Texas, </em>379 U.S. 476, 485, 85 S.Ct. 506, 511, 13 L.Ed.2d 431 (1964); <em>Marcus v. Search Warrants, </em>367 U.S. 717, 732, 81 S.Ct. 1708, 1716, 6 L.Ed.2d 1127 (1961). To safeguard those values, the Supreme Court has prescribed a \u201cstep in the procedure before seizure designed to focus searchingly on the question of obscenity,\u201d <em>Marcus v. Search Warrants, supra, </em>367 U.S. at 732, 81 S.Ct. at 1716; <em>Lee Art Theatre v. Virginia, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 637, 88 S.Ct. at 2104, so that a warrant is issued after an independent determination by a neutral magistrate, rather than \u201csolely upon the conclusory assertions of the police officer.\u201d <em>Lee Art Theatre v. Virginia, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 637, 88 S.Ct. at 2104; <em>Marcus v. Search Warrants, supra, </em>367 U.S. at 732, 81 S.Ct. at 1716.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1441-10\">The district judge apparently reasoned, given this \u201csearching focus\u201d requirement, that a warrant may not issue unless the underlying affidavit is sufficient \u201cto support a finding that the film is obscene.\u201d To &lt;?ur knowledge, however, no court has ever held that the Government, in order to obtain a warrant in an obscenity case, must show in its affidavit either prima facie evidence of illegality or proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, \u201c[a]t the time the warrant was requested, the question before the magistrate was one of probable cause\u201d that a violation of the obscenity laws had occurred. <em>United States v.

California, supra, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle established in <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957) that the First Amendment does not protect obscene material and announced the following \u201cbasic guidelines for the trier of fact\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>on the issue of obscenity: \u201c(a) whether \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable . . . law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d (citations omitted) 413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615. The Court also gave \u201ca few plain examples of what a statute could define for regulation under part (b) of the standard announced in this opinion . . . : (a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, (b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibitions of the genitals.\u201d <em>Id., </em>413 U.S. at 25, 93 S.Ct. at 2615.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Following <em>Miller, </em>in <em>Jenkins v. Georgia, </em>418 U.S. 153, 94 S.Ct. 2750, 41 L.Ed.2d 642, the Supreme Court stressed again that it is not sexual conduct or nudity alone which renders a film obscene, but rather the manner in which the movie depicts a sexually explicit subject.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-7\">As the district court noted, \u201cboth factors (a) and (c) of the Supreme Court test require examination of the work \u2018as a whole.\u2019 \u201d The FBI agent\u2019s affidavit described in great detail twelve scenes of explicit sex depicted in the film. However, the trial judge held that since it did \u201cnot reveal the approximate length of time devoted to those scenes, . . . [n]or . give any hint as to the context in which the scenes [were] presented,\u201d the affidavit was \u201cincomplete on its face and could not have provided the magistrate with an opportunity to \u2018focus searchingly\u2019 upon the issue of obscenity as required by <em>Marcus </em>and <em>Lee Art Theatre </em>under the definition of obscenity contained in Miller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-11\">We disagree with the district judge\u2019s conclusion. Consistent precedent teaches that officers seeking a warrant to seize an allegedly obscene film need not provide the magistrate with a full screenplay, narrating all the action and dialogue. In this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Bush, supra, </em>for example, an FBI agent appended to his affidavit the cover of a film box that \u201cdepicted not only explicit sex but also contained a 50-word summary of the contents of the film.\u201d 582 F.2d at 1020. Copies of two other film covers also \u201cpresented dauntingly explicit sex\u201d and the allegedly obscene movies \u201cwere found in a carton falsely labeled,\u201d an \u201capparent deception\u201d which \u201calso suggested that wrongdoing might be underway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1021. Though the government agent had not viewed the films, and thus could not relate his own version of their contents in the affidavit, we nevertheless held that \u201cthe magistrate had sufficient probable cause to believe that obscenity laws were being violated.\u201d Id.<footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Ninth Circuit, after considering an affidavit that merely described a magazine as \u201ccontainpng] color photographs of \u2018completely nude males and females engaging in various sexual activities, including sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, oral copulation and other sexually explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>acts,\u2019 \u201d ruled that the document \u201cwas sufficient to allow the magistrate to make his own determination of probable cause\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe issuance of the warrant was proper.\u201d <em>United States v. Sherwin, supra, </em>572 F.2d at 198-99. Similarly, in <em>United States v. Pryba, supra, </em>the D.C. Circuit \u201c[had] no difficulty whatever in accepting . as an adequate foundation\u201d for the magistrate\u2019s finding of probable obscenity an affidavit which simply \u201cstated that the \u2018films depict\u2019 not only \u2018a man and a female engaged in sexual intercourse\u2019 but also \u2018various other sexual activities by males and males\u2019 as well as by \u2018males and females.\u2019 \u201d 163 U.S.App.D.C. at 402, 502 F.2d at 404.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, the Second Circuit held in <em>Perial Amusement Corp. v. Morse </em>that a magistrate \u201chad ample factual support for his conclusion that probable cause existed,\u201d 482 F.2d at 524, in an affidavit which contained an apparently conclusory \u201cdescription of the motion picture as <em>consisting for the most part </em>of a series of scenes vividly depicting discrete and explicit acts of sexual intercourse, homosexuality, sadism, fellatio, and cunnilingus, with closeup \u2018scenes centering on the sexual organs showing penetration and withdrawal with subsequent ejaculation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517 (emphasis added). <em>See United States v.

Tupler, supra, </em>564 F.2d at 1297-98.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1444-12\">The affidavit involved here was far more thorough than those accepted as sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>to support findings of probable cause in the foregoing cases from this and other circuits. Moreover, it is a basic principle that \u201cin judging probable cause issuing magistrates are not to be confined by niggardly limitations or by restrictions on the use of their common sense.\u201d <em>Spinelli v. United States, supra, </em>393 U.S. at 419, 89 S.Ct. at 591; <em>Bastida v. Henderson, supra, </em>487 F.2d at 863. Agent Quijada\u2019s affidavit informed the magistrate that the movie \u201cIllusions of a Lady\u201d was playing at a self-proclaimed \u201cadult theatre.\u201d The film, only 65 minutes long, included twelve scenes explicitly portraying intercourse, oral sex and the most lurid acts of fetishism. The affidavit related these passages in graphic detail, thereby enabling the magistrate \u201cto focus searchingly on the question of obscenity.\u201d Some of these episodes contained successive acts which common sense dictates would require several minutes to perform and thus would consume a substantial portion of the entire film time, negating the concern of the district judge that the scenes might represent but a \u201cminute\u201d part of the movie. This fact, combined with the film\u2019s repetitive emphasis on the genitals during sex acts and its depiction of a panoply of sexual conduct in a manner beyond the acceptable boundaries of <em>Jenkins v. Georgia, supra, </em>satisfies parts (a) and (b) of the <em>Miller </em>test and effectively diminishes any reasonable expectation that the twelve scenes of explicit sex could be fragmented portions of a film which, \u201ctaken as a whole,\u201d had serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value, thus satisfying part (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-5\">Our holding here turns, like every determination of probable cause, on the particular facts of this case. Under the circumstances involved here, by employing his common sense, the magistrate could reasonably find probable cause under all three elements of the <em>Miller </em>standard that the film, taken as a whole, was obscene. Thus, we conclude that the magistrate did not err in issuing the search warrant and therefore reverse the district court\u2019s erroneous order granting defendants\u2019 motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">.

In <em>Marcus, </em>a Kansas City police officer filed sworn complaints stating that \u201c \u2018of his own knowledge,\u2019 \u201d a newspaper distributor \u201c \u2018kept for the purpose of [sale] obscene . . publications.\u2019 \u201d Although the officer included no copy or further description of any publication in the complaint, a state judge issued search warrants that in effect authorized the police to seize all magazines and newspapers they judged to be obscene. The officers seized \u201cApproximately 11,000 copies of 280 publications.\u201d 367 U.S. at 722-23, 81 S.Ct. at 1711. The Supreme Court decried this procedure because it included \u201cno step before seizure designed to focus searchingly on the question of obscenity.\u201d The \u201cwarrants issued on the strength of the conclusory assertions of a single police officer, without any scrutiny by the judge of any materials considered by the complainant to be obscene,\u201d and since they merely tracked the language of the statutes and complaints, \u201cspecifying] no publications,\u201d the warrants \u201cgave the broadest discretion to the executing officers,\u201d resulting in \u201cad <em>hoc </em>decisions on the spot .... with little opportunity for reflection and deliberation.\u201d 367 U.S. at 731-32, 81 S.Ct. at 1716. In the present case, the FBI agent\u2019s affidavit contained a detailed description of the allegedly obscene movie, rather than mere \u201cconclusory assertions,\u201d and the search warrant specified the single film to be seized, thereby ensuring that the executing officers lacked the unfettered discretion that the Supreme Court condemned in <em>Marcus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1441-8\"><em>Lee Art Theatre </em>involved an affidavit supporting a search warrant which \u201cstated only the titles of the motion pictures and that the officer had determined from personal observation of them and of the billboard in front of the theatre that the films were obscene.\u201d The Court held, relying on <em>Marcus, </em>that \u201c[t]he procedure under which the warrant issued solely upon the con-clusory assertions of the police officer without any inquiry by the justice of the peace into the factual basis for the officer\u2019s conclusions was not a procedure \u2018designed to focus searchingly on the question of obscenity.\u2019 \u201d 392 U.S. at 636-37, 88 S.Ct. at 2104. Again, the warrant proceedings in the instant case obviously contrast sharply with the procedure denounced in <em>Lee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ajr-dedup-0\">In <em>Marcus </em>and <em>Lee, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that certain types of warrant proceedings do not afford the necessary \u201csearching focus,\u201d but the Court has never identified as a constitutional requirement any specific alternative procedure. It has expressly declined to hold that a magistrate must personally view a film before issuing a warrant to seize it, <em>id.; Heller v. New York, </em>413 U.S. 483, 488, 93 S.Ct. 2789, 2792, 37 L.Ed.2d 745 (1973), stating instead only the general rule that if \u201ca seizure is pursuant to a warrant, issued after a determination of probable cause by a neutral magistrate, and following the seizure, a prompt judicial determination of the obscenity issue is available at the request of any interested party, the seizure is constitutionally permissible.\u201d <em>Heller v. New York, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 492, 93 S.Ct. at 2795. As we interpret <em>Marcus, Lee </em>and <em>Heller, </em>we must decide on the facts of each case whether the manner in which the magistrate determined probable cause enabled him \u201cto focus searchingly on the question of obscenity.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1442-7\">. The Court made clear in <em>Heller </em>that the \u201csearching focus\u201d required under <em>Marcus </em>and <em>Lee </em>is directed to the question of <em>probable </em>obscenity, declaring that a \u201cseizure is constitutionally permissible\u201d if conducted \u201cpursuant to a warrant, issued after a determination of probable cause by a neutral magistrate, and, following the seizure, a prompt judicial determination of the obscenity issue in an adversary proceeding is available at the request of any interested party . . . 413 U.S. at 492, 93 S.Ct. at 2795. <em>Marcus </em>and <em>Lee </em>did not dictate a showing of more than probable cause, but rather acknowledged the historical lesson \u201cthat the constitutional requirement that warrants must particularly describe the \u2018things to be seized\u2019 is to be accorded the most scrupulous exactitude when the \u2018things\u2019 are\u201d expressive matter, and recognized the \u201cconstitutional impossibility of leaving the protection of [First Amendment] freedoms to the whim of the officers charged with executing the warrant . . . .\u201d <em>Stanford v. Texas, supra, </em>379 U.S. at 485, 85 S.Ct. at 511-12. See footnote 6 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1442-14\">. \u201cIn issuing a search warrant the magistrate must exercise his own judgment as to whether the facts alleged in the affidavit constitute probable cause for issuance of the warrant, he must act on the entire picture disclosed to him, he is entitled to use his common sense, and <em>the courts have gone so far as to say that when this is done his determination is conclusive in the absence of arbitrariness.\" </em>(emphasis added) (citations omitted) <em>Bastida v. Henderson, supra, </em>487 F.2d at 863.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1443-8\">. The <em>Miller </em>test must be applied to a proper determination of whether probable cause exists for the issuance of a warrant as well as to the determination of guilt or innocence upon a trial on the merits. The difference, however, is in the degree of evidence \u2014 less being required for probable cause than for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1443-9\">. In concluding that the film \u201cCarnal Knowledge\u201d was not obscene, the Court pointed out that \u201c[w]hile the subject matter of the picture is, in a broader sense, sex, and there are scenes in which sexual conduct including \u2018ultimate sexual acts\u2019 is to be understood to be taking place, the camera does not focus on the bodies of the actors at such times. There is no exhibition whatever of the actors\u2019 genitals, lewd or otherwise, during these scenes.\u201d 418 U.S. at 161, 94 S.Ct. at 2755.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1443-13\">. We also noted that by placing the picture and 50-word summary on the cover of the film box, \u201cthe distributor was declaring that the sum and substance of the film constituted unmitigated obscenity. The magistrate was entitled to take him at his word.\u201d 582 F.2d at 1020.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1444-5\">. In <em>Pryba, </em>the court stated that \u201c[u]nlike the affidavits in [Marcus] and [Lee], which set forth nothing more than bare conclusory allegations that the materials to be seized were obscene \u2014 the affidavit here describes, though in good taste briefly, what the films depict.\u201d 163 U.S.App.D.C. at 403 n. 89, 502 F.2d at 404 n. 89.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1444-6\">. In <em>Christian, </em>an Oklahoma City police officer said in his affidavit that the film \u201cSexual Customs in Scandinavia\u201d \u201cshowed unnatural copulation and simulated natural sex acts which were filthy, morally foul, polluted, nasty, dirty, vulgar, debasing, having a tendency to corrupt or debauch, indecent, morally offensive and depraving, lascivious, wanton and lustful, lewd, licentious, lecherous, dissolute, debauched, impure, salacious and pornographic, depicting numerous scenes of sexual intercourse male and female, one female masturbating, and unnatural copulation between male and female . . . .\u201d 549 F.2d at 1370. The Tenth Circuit concluded that \u201c[j]udged by any judicial standards, the sexual activities explicitly described in the officer\u2019s affidavit were \u2018hard core\u2019 pornography, obscene, and constituted probable cause for the issuance of the warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1371.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1444-9\">. In <em>Sherpix, </em>the court found that an FBI agent\u2019s affidavit, \u201ca lengthy account of\u201d an allegedly obscene film, \u201cdescribing each scene in detail and with explicit language, but suggesting no conclusions to be drawn from the description,\u201d was sufficient to support the magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause. 168 U.S.App.D.C. at 128-29, 512 F.2d at 1368-69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1444-10\">. In <em>Tupler, </em>which also involved a seizure of allegedly obscene movies, when \u201cthe search warrant was issued neither the FBI agent who wrote the affidavit for the warrant nor the judge who issued the warrant had ever viewed any part of the films.\u201d The affidavit \u201cdescribed in some detail the photographic labels which were affixed to the . . boxes\u201d containing the films, but the Ninth Circuit asserted that \u201clabels may or may not fairly represent the contents of a package\u201d and therefore concluded that the labels, \u201cby themselves,\u201d could not establish probable cause that the movies were obscene. After reiterating the <em>Miller </em>obscenity test, the court reasoned that while \u201c[a] single photographic print or \u2018out take\u2019 from a roll of motion picture film might establish probable cause to believe that the film as a whole\u201d met the first two parts of the test, it \u201ccould never establish probable cause to believe that the film \u2018taken as [a] whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\u2019 \u201d 564 F.2d at 1297.</p>\n<p id=\"A8Y4\">In this regard we suggested in <em>United States v.

However, whether or not the <em>Tupler </em>standard is too rigorous, the affidavit involved here would easily satisfy it. The <em>Tupler </em>majority stressed that it was granting defendants\u2019 suppression motion \u201c[b]ecause the films were seized without an examination of their contents\u201d and declared that \u201c[a] searching focus on obscenity requires the issuing judge or magistrate to base his evaluation of probable cause on direct evidence of the contents of <em>at least a fair sample of the material itself.\u201d </em>564 F.2d at 1298 (emphasis added). In the present case, an FBI agent had viewed the film to be seized in its entirety and his thorough narration of the movie\u2019s porno<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>graphic contents provided the magistrate with \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of far more than a mere \u201cfair sample of the material itself.\u201d <em>See United States v. Sherwin, supra, </em>572 F.2d 196 (this decision, which postdates <em>Tupler, </em>illustrates that the Ninth Circuit does not require a magistrate to supply his own \u201cdirect evidence\u201d by personally viewing the allegedly obscene film before issuing a warrant).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
