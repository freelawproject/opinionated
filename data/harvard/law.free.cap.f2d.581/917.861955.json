Cosmopolitan appeals, arguing that the Commission\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious and not the product of the \u201creasoned decision making\u201d required by <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 175, 182-83, 454 F.2d 1018, 1025-26 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">Cosmopolitan has owned and operated station WHBI since it began broadcasting in 1962. Donald J. Lewis is the controlling stockholder of Cosmopolitan. He is the president, treasurer and director of the corporation, and effectively controls all the activities of WHBI. WHBI is licensed to serve Newark, New Jersey. Lewis had originally intended to develop WHBI as a black-oriented station. When this effort proved commercially unsuccessful, he moved WHBI into the field of foreign language and ethnic specialty programming. By 1969, 114 hours per week or 68% of WHBI\u2019s schedule<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was devoted to ethnic programming broadcast in some 18 foreign languages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-18\">Virtually all of WHBI\u2019s ethnic programming, and a significant portion of its English language programming, is produced and presented by time brokers who pay Cosmopolitan a flat fee for the right to present programs on WHBI in specific time periods. The time brokers may sell commercials within these time periods for their own account, or they may re-sell the time to sub-brokers. Over 75% of WHBI\u2019s air time is sold to time brokers; approximately 20% of the remaining time is sold or given to persons or groups for religious broadcasts, with about 2 minutes per hour reserved by WHBI for station breaks and used mainly for public service announcements and commercial messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-19\">On February 26, 1969, Cosmopolitan applied for a renewal of its license to operate WHBI. The FCC, concerned with Cosmopolitan\u2019s control of its programming, deferred action on its application until further investigation. On December 19, 1972, the Commission issued a Notice of Apparent Liability designating Cosmopolitan\u2019s application for a hearing pursuant to section 309(e) of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(e). There were numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>issues presented, the most important being whether Cosmopolitan had \u201cexercised adequate control and supervision over the programming and other operation of Station WHBI consistent with licensee responsibility.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 2. Upon the motion of Cosmopolitan, an issue was added by the Commission\u2019s Review Board \u201cto determine whether the programming of Station WHBI(FM) has been meritorious, particularly with regard to public service programs.\u201d 39 FCC 2d 698, 699 (1973).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-15\">After a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) an initial decision was released on July 25, 1974. <em>Cosmopolitan Broadcasting Corp., </em>FCC 74D-41, J.A. at 2-57. The ALJ resolved almost all of the substantive issues against Cosmopolitan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He also refused to find \u201cthat the programming of station WHBI(FM) was particular<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>ly meritorious.\u201d J.A. at 54. The ALJ held that the granting of Cosmopolitan\u2019s application for renewal of its license for WHBI(FM) \u201cwould not serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(a). The Commission unanimously affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, 59 FCC 2d 558 (1976), concluding that Cosmopolitan \u201chad operated its broadcast facility so as virtually to relinquish all interest and control over the station\u2019s programming to time brokers, religious broadcasters and commission salesmen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560. In the FCC\u2019s view, the many violations found by the ALJ were a direct result of Cosmopolitan\u2019s abdication of licensee responsibility. <em>Id. </em>WHBI\u2019s programming did not \u201cwarrant any finding of special merit\u201d because Cosmopolitan was not able to substantiate meritorious programming \u201cfrom program logs submitted in evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Cosmopolitan filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the FCC\u2019s decision. In a Memorandum Opinion and Order released on Oct. 14,1976, the Commission reaffirmed its earlier decision. 61 FCC 2d 257 (1976). Cosmopolitan appeals pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">II. LICENSEE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROGRAMMING AND OPERATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">At the heart of this case is the \u201clongstanding bulwark of Commission policy\u201d that \u201clicensees have an affirmative, non-delegable duty to choose independently all programming for broadcast, in light of the tastes and ascertained needs and problems of the community.\u201d <em>Network Broadcasting by Standard (AM) and FM Broadcast Stations, </em>63 FCC 2d 674, 690 (1977). In the Commission\u2019s view, Cosmopolitan has abdicated this duty by operating WHBI \u201cprimarily as a clearinghouse for the sale of program time for use or resale by others.\u201d Brief for appellee at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">The Commission contends that Cosmopolitan manifested its abdication of its duty in three ways. First, Cosmopolitan relinquished its non-delegable programming responsibility to time brokers and other purchasers of air time. Second, Cosmopolitan failed to maintain effective supervisory procedures to ensure familiarity with the content of WHBI\u2019s foreign language programming. Third, as a result of its abdication of control, Cosmopolitan permitted a significant number of violations of Commission rules to occur. Brief for appellee at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">A. <em>Failure to Retain Responsibility for Programming</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">A basic premise of Commission policy is that a licensee is a \u201ctrustee\u201d for the public, and that he must therefore assume the \u201cprimary duty and privilege to select the material to be broadcast to his audience . .\u201d <em>1960 Commission En Banc Programming Inquiry, </em>44 FCC 2303, 2311-12 (1960). <em>See Yale Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>155 U.S.App.D.C. 390, 395-396, 478 F.2d 594, 599-600, <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 914, 94 S.Ct. 211, 38 L.Ed.2d 152 (1973). \u201cThe Commission has always regarded the main tenance of control over programming as a most fundamental obligation of the licensee.\u201d <em>WCHS-AM-TV Corp., </em>8 FCC 2d 608, 609 (1967). The Commission has thus expressed strong disapproval of licensees who have relinquished control over portions of their programming through contractual arrangements, <em>Carol Music, Inc., </em>37 FCC 379, 380, 400 (1964), through excessive \u201cplugging\u201d into national network programming, <em>Allen T. Simmons, </em>11 FCC 1160, 1173 (1947), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>83 App.D.C. 262, 169 F.2d 670, <em>cert. denied, </em>335 U.S. 846, 69 S.Ct. 67, 93 L.Ed.2d 396 (1948),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or, most pertinently for appellant, through excessive time brokerage. <em>Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp., </em>8 FCC 557, 561-64, 570 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>The Commission has defined a time broker as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-4\">one who buys time and then resells it to others. The time is the broker\u2019s to do with as he wishes and the risk is entirely the broker\u2019s since, if he cannot resell the time, he is still responsible for payment to the station of the agreed sum. Normally the broker has the entire responsibility for collection of money from the advertisers to whom he sells.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\"><em>United Broadcasting Co. of New York, </em>4 RR 2d 167, 173 (1965). By engaging the services of time brokers a licensee may abdicate his own non-delegable duty to control the programming content of his station. For this reason the FCC has stated flatly that \u201cany extensive time brokering . may be contrary to the public interest,\u201d <em>In the Matter of Clarifying Paragraph (c) of Section 1.613, </em>33 FCC 2d 653 (1972), and by regulation it has maintained a close scrutiny on time brokerage contracts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Inquiry into Subscription Agreements Between Radio Broadcast Stations and Musical Format Service Companies, </em>56 FCC 2d 805, 809 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">In this case, it is beyond dispute that Cosmopolitan engaged in extensive time brokering. Approximately 75% of WHBI\u2019s air time was sold to time brokers. Cosmopolitan did not seek out these time brokers, nor did it involve itself in their day-to-day programming decisions. All of WHBI\u2019s foreign language broadcasts were time brokered, as was the English-language program \u201cKaleidoscope.\u201d Kaleidoscope was an early morning show broadcast between 3:00 a. m. and 6:00 a. m., Monday through Friday, and from 2:00 a. m. to 3:00 a. m. on weekends. The time broker for Kaleidoscope was, for all practical purposes, Dean Lewis (no relation to Donald Lewis, the principal stockholder of Cosmopolitan). J.A. at 18. Dean Lewis resold Kaleidoscope\u2019s time in five minute segments to whoever would buy it; customers were attracted through advertisements promising them on-the-air \u201ctraining\u201d and the opportunity to produce and host their own radio programs. The ALJ found that Dean Lewis\u2019s customers \u201cwere allotted free reign as to the content of the programs which they prepared for broadcast. They were also free to make whatever sales they could of commercial time within the periods they would program.\u201d J.A. at 48. Donald Lewis had no contact with those who were broadcasting over the air during Kaleidoscope.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">Based on this record, the Commission sustained the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Cosmopolitan had failed to exercise adequate control and supervision over the programming of WHBI, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-10\">The primary reason for Cosmopolitan\u2019s lack of control and supervision over programming and operations is readily apparent: virtually every available minute of broadcast time on WHBI was sold to time brokers, who either provided programming or resold smaller blocks of time to subbrokers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">59 FCC 2d at 560. In its Memorandum Opinion and Order the Commission stated that \u201cCosmopolitan relinquished virtually all control over the station\u2019s programming to time brokers . . . .\u201d 61 FCC 2d at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-13\">Cosmopolitan, however, attacks this conclusion. It argues that Cosmopolitan did in fact maintain control over its programming by selecting time brokers and by specifying basic program formats and languages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>Cosmopolitan cites several FCC decisions for the proposition that the delegation of the day-to-day programming decisions is entirely consonant with Commission policy. <em>See Inquiry into Subscription Agreements Between Radio Broadcast Stations and Musical Format Service Companies, </em>56 FCC 2d 805 (1975); <em>Stern Community Law Firm, </em>34 FCC 2d 483 (1972); <em>Licensee Responsibility to Review Records Before Their Broadcast, </em>31 FCC 2d 377 (1971). Cosmopolitan contends that the Commission was, contrary to its previous policy, in fact ruling against extensive time brokerage <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">We think that Cosmopolitan\u2019s arguments fundamentally misconstrue the Commission\u2019s position. The Commission regarded Cosmopolitan\u2019s time brokerage as evidentia-ry of the legally dispositive question, which was whether Cosmopolitan had abdicated control over the programming of station WHBI. In concluding that this control had in fact been relinquished, the Commission specifically relied \u201con the <em>totality </em>of the licensee\u2019s <em>modus operandi.\u201d </em>61 FCC 2d at 258. This necessarily included the Commission\u2019s analysis of Donald Lewis\u2019s relationship to his time brokers,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the fact that WHBI initiated virtually no programming of its own.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While it is true that \u201c[ljicen-see responsibility does not require . that the licensee . . . choose every record to be played on a particular program,\u201d <em>Stern Community Law Firm, </em>34 FCC 2d 483, 484 (1972), nevertheless a <em>\u201cresponsible </em>public trustee\u201d is \u201ccalled upon to make thousands of programming judgments over his license term.\u201d <em>Licensee Responsibility to Review Records Before Their Broadcast, </em>31 FCC 2d 377, 379 (1971). In all of the cases cited by appellant, the Commission forcefully reiterated its long-standing policy of requiring \u201cbroadcast licensees to be ultimately responsible for programming, regardless of the source.\u201d <em>Inquiry into Subscription Agreements Between Radio Broadcast Stations and Musical Format Service Companies, </em>56 FCC 2d 805, 807 (1975). In this case the Commission concluded that Lewis\u2019s vague relationship to his time brokers\u2019 programming was insufficient to fulfill that responsibility. Although the Commission has permitted the delegation of some day-to-day programming chores, it has never intimated that a licensee can meet his responsibility to the public by merely choosing a general program format and the language in which it is to be broadcast. In this area of mixed legal and factual judgments, \u201cwe defer to the expertise and experience of the Commission within its field of specialty and would reverse only where the Commission\u2019s position is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d <em>West Michigan Telecasters, Inc. v. FCC, </em>130 U.S.App.D.C. 39, 42, 396 F.2d 688, 691 (1968); <em>cf. NLRB v. Local Union No. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number><em>103, International Ass\u2019n of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers, </em>434 U.S. 335, 98 S.Ct. 651, 656 n.7, 54 L.Ed.2d 586 (1978). Since the Commission\u2019s ruling is not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, and since it does not lack the \u201creasoned decision making\u201d we required in <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, </em>147 U.S. App.D.C. 175, 182, 454 F.2d 1018, 1025-26 (1971), we affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">B. <em>Failure to Retain Familiarity with Programming</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">A licensee cannot adequately fulfill his responsibility to maintain control over his programming unless he knows what is actually being broadcast over his station. Normally a station\u2019s engineer will monitor its broadcasts, but in the case of stations that broadcast in a variety of foreign languages retaining familiarity with the content of programming can often prove exceedingly difficult. For example, neither Donald Lewis nor any of WHBI\u2019s regular paid staff understands any of the languages broadcast over WHBI. Nevertheless, the Commission has refused to \u201ccarve out in this area a special exception to licensee responsibility\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-6\">The desirability of foreign-language program service does not ... relieve the broadcaster of his responsibility for his programming, which in turn necessarily depends upon his adoption of reasonable procedures for assuring himself that the programming conforms to his policies and the requirements of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJbA\"><em>Licensee Responsibility To Exercise Adequate Control Over Foreign Language Programs, </em>39 FCC 2d 1037, 1039 (1973) <em>(1973 Policy Statement).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">The Commission made this policy known as early as 1967, when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-12\">Licensee responsibility requires that internal procedures be established and maintained to insure sufficient familiarity with the foreign languages to know what is being broadcast and whether it conforms to the station\u2019s policies and to requirements of the Commission\u2019s rules. Failure of licensees to establish and maintain such control over foreign language programming will raise serious questions as to whether the station\u2019s operation serves the public interest, convenience and necessity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\"><em>Public Notice re Foreign Language Programs, </em>9 RR 2d 1901 (1967) <em>(1967 Policy Statement).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">Concerned with the <em>1967 Policy Statement, </em>Donald Lewis sent the Commission an unsolicited letter on October 25, 1967, describing the procedures he had instituted to monitor WHBI\u2019s foreign language broadcasts. S.J.A. at 6-10. Essentially, Lewis had hired multi-lingual monitors to listen, at random, to at least 15% of the station\u2019s foreign language programming.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The mon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>itors were given a memorandum describing \u201cobjectionable material which must be reported to the station at once.\u201d S.J.A. at 10. The memorandum contained explanations in lay language of obscenity,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> personal attacks,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and exhortations to break the law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition, the monitors were given written forms to fill out describing each monitored program.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The form required the monitor to check if certain kinds of broadcasting were offered during the program (e. <em>g., </em>\u201cnews,\u201d \u201cmusic,\u201d \u201csports,\u201d \u201cpolitical,\u201d etc.), to check the commercials broadcast for length and for sponsor\u2019s name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>against a prepared list, and to check for objectionable material and for dishonest advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">The Commission never acknowledged or responded to Lewis\u2019s letter. On February 20,1968, the Commission sent Cosmopolitan a letter requesting, among other things, information concerning Cosmopolitan\u2019s compliance with the <em>1967 Policy Statement. </em>On April 19, 1968, Donald Lewis responded with a letter referencing the October 25 correspondence and including additional forms regarding the directions Cosmopolitan gave its monitors.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Commission never responded to this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">In affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision, however, the Commission found that Cosmopolitan\u2019s monitoring system was inadequate because monitors failed to \u201cevaluate substantive program content.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> 59 FCC2d at 561. We affirm the Commission\u2019s finding. The purpose of the monitoring reports is to enable a licensee to retain sufficient familiarity with his broadcasts to exercise his responsibility as a public trustee. But this responsibility requires that a licensee be familiar with the actual content of his programming. The fairness doctrine, for example, requires that a licensee provide fair and accurate news reporting, <em>The Handling of Public Issues Under the Fairness Doctrine and the Public Interest Standards of the Communications Act, </em>48 FCC2d 1, 21 (1974), that he make available a reasonable opportunity for the presentation of opposing viewpoints about controversial issues of public importance, <em>id. </em>at 10-17, and that he devote adequate broadcast time to the discussion of public issues, <em>id. </em>at 9-10. The limited information provided on Cosmopolitan\u2019s monitor reports <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> could not possibly have enabled Donald Lewis to know if his foreign language time brokers were fulfilling these obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-13\">Cosmopolitan argues, however, that the Commission\u2019s lack of response to its October 25 and April 19 letters constituted an implicit endorsement of Cosmopolitan\u2019s monitoring system.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We disagree. The adequacy of Cosmopolitan\u2019s monitoring system could have been definitively assessed only in the context of WHBI\u2019s total method of operation. <em>See Wolfe Broadcasting Corp., </em>32 FCC2d 761, 763 (1971). Deficiencies in the monitor reports might have been remedied by supplementary connections between Lewis and his foreign language time bro- \u2022 kers. When it became clear at Cosmopolitan\u2019s license renewal hearing that the monitor reports were virtually Lewis\u2019s sole source of knowledge concerning the day-today foreign language programming of WHBI, their deficiencies for the first time became fully manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-14\">C. <em>Other Violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"AjqL\">The ALJ found that Cosmopolitan had violated numerous FCC regulations.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>The Commission found these violations to be the result of Cosmopolitan\u2019s abdication of responsibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-4\">As a result of its abdication of licensee responsibility, numerous violations of Commission Rules occurred, including (but not limited to) the promotion of a lottery, false and misleading advertising, improper logging, failure to meet filing requirements, and inadequate record keeping. To quote [the ALJ], all this resulted from \u201ca maximum resale of time and a minimum of control over how that time was actually used.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">59 FCC2d at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Cosmopolitan now attempts to characterize many of these violations as \u201cinconsequential.\u201d Reply brief for appellant at 33. This argument fundamentally misconstrues the Commission\u2019s position, which is not that these violations were intrinsically serious, but that they were probative of an underlying abdication of licensee responsibility. See <em>Continental Broadcasting, Inc., </em>15 FCC2d 120, 129-31 (1968), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>142 U.S. App.D.C. 70, 439 F.2d 580 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Cosmopolitan also argues that two of the violations found by the ALJ are not supported by the record. First, Cosmopolitan finds error in the ALJ\u2019s ruling that WHBI failed to fulfill its promise in its 1969 license renewal application that it would broadcast 3 hours of news per week. Cosmopolitan claims to have broadcast 5 hours and 55 minutes of news per week, as evidenced by a composite week drawn from dates during the 1969-72 license term. Reply brief for appellant at 31-32. But Cosmopolitan admits that of this time only 47 minutes consisted of newscasts presented by WHBI\u2019s staff. Three hours and 40 minutes of the remaining time consisted of news produced by time brokers. This latter time cannot be counted as fulfilling Cosmopolitan\u2019s non-delegable duty to present news, since \u201c[i]t is the licensee who must select or be responsible for the selection of the particular news items to be reported or the particular local, State, national or international issues or questions of public interest to be considered . . ..\u201d <em>Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees, </em>13 FCC 1246, 1247 (1949). In addition the ALJ concluded, and we see no reason to disagree, that the remainder of the programming Cosmopolitan designated as \u201cnews\u201d was in fact tapes dealing with current developments made available by various State and public agencies, none of which \u201ccan be counted as news.\u201d J.A. at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">Second, Cosmopolitan argues that there is no evidence in the record, and that the ALJ\u2019s own findings of fact contradict his conclusion that rates charged to political candidates \u201cin a few instances exceeded normal commercial rates for similar time.\u201d J.A. at 51. The ALJ\u2019s findings of fact, however, disclose examples of time brokers charging a political candidate $17.50 per minute for announcements, while at the same time charging commercial advertisers between $5 and $17.50 per minute for comparable air time. J.A. at 32-33. The ALJ did state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-12\">One explanation for the political charges was the fact that the time broker was paid not only for broadcast time but also for his services in preparing and announcing the copy for a political candidate. Nevertheless, there was no separation of charges between services and broadcast time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">J.A. at 51. Unfortunately, the AU did not support his conclusion by citations to the record, and neither did the Commission.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We cannot stress too strenuously the importance of such citations. <em>See Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, </em>176 U.S.App.D.C. 373, 434, 541 F.2d 1, 62 (Bazelon, C. J., concurring), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 941, 96 S.Ct. 2662, 49 L.Ed.2d 394 (1976); <em>Washington Gas Light Co. v. Baker, </em>88 App.D.C. 115, 127, 188 F.2d 11, 23 (1950), <em>cert. denied, </em>340 U.S. 952, 71 S.Ct. 571, 95 L.Ed. 686 (1951); <em>cf. Aqua Slide \u2018N\u2019 Dive Corp. v. Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n, </em>569 F.2d 831, 837-38 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Cooper Laboratories, Inc. v.

We cannot know in their absence precisely upon what evidence the Commission or the ALJ relied in reaching their factual conclusions. Thus we are left without guidance to scour the massive ten volume record in this case for ourselves, to speculate whether or to what extent, if any, the Commission relied upon and appropriately considered any evidence that we may unearth, and to evaluate this evidence without direction from the Commission. This procedure is both wasteful of judicial resources and inconsistent with the proper deference due the Commission. In this case, however, this wasteful procedure may be avoided because Cosmopolitan points to no evidence at all in support of its assertions. Reply brief for appellant, 29-31. Particularly in light of the Commission\u2019s prima facie demonstration of violations, Cosmopolitan must bear the burden of proof, 47 U.S. \u00a7 309(e), and we therefore support the Commission in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">III. THE MERIT OF WHBI\u2019S PROGRAMMING</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">The FCC will at times permit the presentation of evidence as to the past programming of licensees in renewal proceedings involving character qualifications issues. \u201cSuch evidence is allowed on the theory that a meritorious program record may mitigate the significance of adverse findings under those issues.\u201d <em>Medford Broadcasters, Inc., </em>18 FCC2d 817, 818 (1969).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Of course, the addition of the meritorious programming issue does not foreclose the right of parties subsequently to argue as to the weight that should be accorded the evidence adduced. <em>Midwest Radio-Television, Inc., </em>18 FCC2d 1011, 1014 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">At Cosmopolitan\u2019s request, an issue was added to its license renewal hearing \u201cto determine whether the programming of Station WHBI(FM) has been meritorious, particularly with regard to public service programs.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> At the hearing, Cosmopolitan produced testimony and affidavits from scholars like Dr. Margaret Mead, Dr. Mario Pei, and Dr. Gene Weltfish, to the effect that foreign language and ethnic programming was valuable to immigrants and to second and third generation members of ethnic groups. This evidence was for the most part based upon study of general descriptions of WHBI\u2019s programs.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">The ALJ resolved this issue against Cosmopolitan. On appeal the Commission noted that it had \u201cno quarrel with the general proposition that ethnic programming serves an important purpose,\u201d but it stated that it could not conclude \u201cthat foreign language programming is <em>per se </em>meritorious . . . .\u201d 61 FCC2d at 260. The Commission observed that \u201c[wjhile Cosmopolitan alleges some programming responsive to the meritorious programming issue, it was not able to substantiate this claim from program logs submitted in evidence.\u201d 59 FCC2d at 564. Since Cosmopolitan\u2019s English language programming \u201cwas unresponsive to obligations imposed on a licensee\u201d to serve the community of its license, 61 FCC2d at 261, the Commission upheld the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">Cosmopolitan attacks the Commission on several fronts. It argues, first, that the merit of WHBI\u2019s English language programming should not have been assessed in terms of WHBI\u2019s service to Newark, the city of its license. Cosmopolitan contends that it expressly stated in its 1966 license renewal application its intention of operating WHBI primarily as a foreign lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>guage/ethnic specialty station, serving ethnic minorities through the Newark-New York metropolitan area. <em>See </em>J.A. at 109-14. The Commission\u2019s approval of that application, Cosmopolitan argues, is inconsistent with its present evaluation of WHBI\u2019s English language programming.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">We find Cosmopolitan\u2019s argument to be without merit. The issue before the Commission was whether \u201cthe programming\u201d of WHBI had been meritorious, not merely whether its foreign language programming had been especially deserving. That the Commission had implicitly approved Cosmopolitan\u2019s plan to aim much of its programming at ethnic minorities throughout the New York and Newark metropolitan area did not exempt from the requirements of licensee responsibility the remainder of its programming. More than 30% of WHBI\u2019s programming was in English, and the Commission was surely entitled to evaluate this programming according to its customary standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Second, Cosmopolitan condemns as \u201carbitrary, capricious, [and] an abuse of discretion\u201d the Commission\u2019s finding that WHBI\u2019s foreign language programming was without special merit. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Cosmopolitan contends that it presented substantial evidence concerning the meritorious content of its foreign language programming and that the Commission\u2019s requirement that the merit of WHBI\u2019s programming be demonstrated from program logs was irrational, since such logs would at most reflect that certain types of programming had been broadcast and \u201cwould have provided virtually no information as to the substantive content of the programs logged.\u201d Brief for appellants at 65 n.58. <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.282 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">We do not interpret the Commission\u2019s reference to program logs to constitute an implicit rule that no evidence other than program logs will be considered in the determination of program merit. With the guidance of appellee\u2019s brief, we construe the Commission\u2019s point to be that a licensee can receive special merit only if it offers, if not program logs, at least comparable \u201cevidence of the \u2018substantive content\u2019 of its programming,\u201d brief for appellee at 44, and that Cosmopolitan had failed to offer such evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 42-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">We agree with the Commission that program logs would provide evidence of the substantive content of the programs logged. Proper logging requires a licensee to classify its programs by content into, for example, news, entertainment, religious, instructional, political or editorial programs, <em>see </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.282(b)(l)(iii) (1976), and thus provides the Commission precise, reliable evidence of the actual amount of broadcast time in each of these subject areas.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We assume, therefore, that by sustaining the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that WHBI\u2019s foreign language programming lacked special merit, the Commission was implicitly holding that Cosmopolitan had failed to produce evidence of comparably probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-14\">If Cosmopolitan had in fact merely rested its case on the proposition that foreign language programming was meritorious <em>per se, </em>we would more easily tolerate such elliptical reasoning on the part of the Commission. But the Commission\u2019s brief manifestly misrepresents the record when it states that the record \u201cshows that WHBI could present no evidence to support the \u2018merit\u2019 of its foreign language programming, other than the fact that since 1969 it sold air time to time brokers broadcasting in over twenty foreign languages.\u201d Brief for appellee at 44. Even putting aside the expert testimony offered by appellant concerning the value of foreign language programming, Cosmopolitan offered a great deal of evidence concerning the substantive content of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>WHBI\u2019s programming. This evidence ranged from the vague,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> to the anecdotal,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> to the very specific.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Some of the evidence offered by Cosmopolitan provided even more information than would be ascertainable from program logs. In Exhibit 54, for example, Cosmopolitan offered a \u201crepresentative listing\u201d of about 75 prominent guests interviewed on WHBI\u2019s foreign language programs, the appropriate date and duration of the interviews, \u2022 and the principal topics discussed.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-14\">The Commission\u2019s sibylline conclusion that Cosmopolitan had failed to demonstrate programming merit \u201cfrom program logs\u201d entirely ignores this evidence. We thus have no way of knowing whether the Commission even considered this evidence, much less its reasons for finding this evidence insufficient to establish the meritoriousness of WHBI\u2019s foreign language programming. Our function when reviewing the action of an administrative agency, however, is precisely \u201cto assure that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>agency has given reasoned consideration to all the material facts and issues. This calls for insistence that the agency articulate with reasonable clarity its reasons for decision, and identify the significance of the crucial facts, a course that tends to assure that the agency\u2019s policies effectuate general standards, applied without unreasonable discrimination.\u201d <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 393, 444 F.2d 841, 851 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2233, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). Since on this record we cannot be assured that the Commission \u201chas given reasoned consideration to all the material facts and issues,\u201d we cannot affirm its conclusion that WHBI\u2019s foreign language programming lacked special merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">The issue of meritoriousness is of course for the Commission to determine in the exercise of its statutory authority. In such matters a \u201ccourt is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 824, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). We therefore remand this case to the Commission for a more reasoned consideration of this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">On remand the Commission will also have the opportunity to correct what has to date been a serious omission in its deliberations concerning the meritoriousness of WHBI\u2019s programming. The ultimate question to be determined by the Commission is whether the renewal of Cosmopolitan\u2019s license will serve \u201cthe public interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(a). We have long recognized, however, that \u201cit is surely in the public interest, as that was conceived by a Congress representative of all the people, for all major aspects of contemporary culture to be accommodated by the commonly-owned public resources whenever that is technically and economically feasible.\u201d <em>Citizens Committee of Atlanta v. FCC, </em>141 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 115, 436 F.2d 263, 269 (1970). For this reason we have held that \u201c[tjhere is a public interest in a diversity of broadcast entertainment formats.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-9\">The disappearance of a distinctive format may deprive a significant segment of the public of the benefits of radio, at least at their first-preference level. When faced with a proposed license assignment encompassing a format change, the FCC is obliged to determine whether the format to be lost is unique or otherwise serves a specialized audience that would feel its loss. If the endangered format is of this variety, then the FCC must affirmatively consider whether the public interest would be served by approving the proposed assignment .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\"><em>Citizens Committee to Save WEFM v. FCC, </em>165 U.S.App.D.C. 185, 201, 506 F.2d 246, 262 (1974). We stated in <em>Citizens Committee to Save WEFM </em>that \u201cthe public interest implicated in a format change is the interest of the public in the service area, not just the city of license.\u201d <em>Id., </em>165 U.S.App.D.C. at 202, 506 F.2d at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">Although the issue in this case is not that of a format change, we believe that the reasoning of <em>Citizens Committee to Save WEFM </em>is applicable to the question of whether WHBI\u2019s programming deserves special merit. Meritorious programming, after all, is that programming which serves the public intere\u00e1t, convenience and necessity. In determining whether the past programming of WHBI may have mitigated its derelictions of character, the Commission should therefore consider whether denying Cosmopolitan\u2019s application for a license renewal will silence a unique outlet serving \u201ca specialized audience that would feel its loss.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>There is some evidence of the uniqueness of Cosmopolitan\u2019s programming presently in the record. <em>See, e. g., </em>transcript at 1864-65. In addition Cosmopolitan offered as evidence in Exhibit 33 a survey of the foreign language programming broadcast by other stations in its service area. The ALJ, however, refused to accept Exhibit 33, stating that \u201cif the programming relied upon by WHBI is in fact by its nature meritorious, then it is in fact meritorious regardless of whether or not it is aired by any other station. If it is not meritorious, I do not think you can create merit in programming by reason of the fact that no other station carries that particular language.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Transcript at 2575. <em>See id. </em>at 2568-257\u00cd).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This ruling is wrong as a matter of law: where there is a likelihood that a license may not be renewed, determination of the meritoriousness of programming must include consideration of the uniqueness of that programming to a significant segment of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">On remand, we expect the Commission to give due regard to this consideration. We of course express no view as to whether consideration of this factor will affect the Commission\u2019s ultimate determination of the meritoriousness of WHBI\u2019s foreign language programming or as to whether, even if found meritorious, the seriousness of Cosmopolitan\u2019s other violations might be mitigated enough to deserve the imposition of a lesser sanction. <em>See SEC v.

However, as the Commission realizes, the hiring of engineers familiar with all 16 languages broadcast by WHBI would be expensive, impractical, and probably impossible. The procedure WHBI has adopted to maintain knowledge of and control over foreign language programming is the hiring and utilization of monitors familiar with the various foreign languages broadcast by the station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-17\">Station WHBI has hired a number of its regular listeners to monitor at least 15% of the foreign language programming on a formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>written basis. Being regular listeners, far more than that 15% is monitored on an informal, nonwritten basis. Since the performers never know when they are being monitored, and since they may be eliminated from WHBI if they disregard station or Commission requirements, it thus behooves them to always comply. The monitors are paid for their services and certify to their expertise in the particular language involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsuH\">S.J.A. at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"A1h\">.

Any statement telling the public to hate a person, to criticize a person, or to make him look foolish. Any statement that says bad things about a person\u2019s job or business. Any statement which says a person is dishonest or of bad character. Any statement which says a person is immoral or indecent (perhaps relating to sex). Any statement which criticizes the way a person does his work (such as calling a doctor a \u201cquack or butcher\u201d). Any statement in which a person is called a criminal or accused of committing a crime (unless already proved guilty). Any statement which says bad things about a person, several people, a corporation, a product, or even a place or thing which would tend to hurt their reputation; such as saying they are dishonest and lacking in ability, or some such similar words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF0c\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"afg-dedup-0\">.

Also included will be a separate list of commercials for that program. To the right of each sponsor\u2019s name will be numerals indicating the estimated maximum length for each commercial. As you hear each commercial, please put a checkmark beside each sponsor\u2019s name. As for the timing or length, if it is as long as, or shorter than the indicated length, merely put a checkmark next to the correct numerals. That means it is okay. If it is longer than indicated, please tell us this on the monitor report. If you heard commercials that were not on that attached list, or if you heard them more times than listed (listed once but broadcast twice, for example) please also tell us that on the monitor report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acq-dedup-0\">WHBI, Exhibit 25.

The Commission also stated that;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azv-dedup-0\">Cosmopolitan claims it pointed out certain prohibited practices \u2014 use of obscenity, slan- . der and libel, violations of the fairness doctrine, and broadcast of lottery information\u2014 which it felt monitors should be aware of. Yet, by its own admission, it did not instruct prospective monitors in formal Commission requirements, opting instead for a \u201cMemorandum,\u201d in English, containing a simplified summary of \u201cobjectionable material\u201d which should be reported to the station. We believe the record amply supports the Judge\u2019s finding that \u201c . . . evidently none of the monitors [had] direct knowledge of FCC Rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">59 FCC2d at 561-62. Insofar as the Commission\u2019s point is that the simplified summary of \u201cobjectionable materials\u201d was incomplete, omitting, for example, a thorough explanation of the fairness doctrine, we agree with the Commission\u2019s finding. We disapprove, however, the implication in the Commission\u2019s ruling that a licensee cannot translate FCC regulations into plain comprehensible English for its monitors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1018-16\">. <em>See </em>note 16 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1018-17\">. On January 9, 1969, the Commission granted Cosmopolitan\u2019s petition to relocate its main studio from its transmitter site to Riverside Drive in New York City. Cosmopolitan argues that this action also was an implicit ratification of its monitoring system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1018-18\">. <em>See </em>p. - of 189 U.S.App.D.C., p. 921 of 581 F.2d and note 3 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">.

The Commission thus reviews the merits of programming only <em>after </em>a licensee has been found at a hearing to have been guilty of infractions of FCC regulations, and only as a factor that may mitigate the consequences of these infractions. In these circumstances the Commission\u2019s consideration of programming content is not likely to chill licensee programming decisions or to \u201cthreaten [a] licensee with censorship.\u201d <em>Citizens Committee To Save WEFM v.

Cosmopolitan claims that in its 1966 license renewal application it explained to the Commission that these elements were so intermixed in its foreign language programs that they could not be separately logged.

We note, however, that FCC regulations permitted licensees to break down programs into \u201cseparately identifiable program units.\" <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.-282(a)(l)(ii) (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">. In its Exhibit # 6, S.J.A. at 31-58, Cosmopolitan provided an over-all description of its foreign language broadcasts. A representative sample is the discussion of the program Happy <em>Greek Morning:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-5\"><em>Happy Greek Morning </em>(1968-present). This Greek language program is broadcast on Friday mornings between 8:00 and 9:00 a. m. The program\u2019s producer/performer, Demetri-os Vassos, who received an education in law in Greece, presently operates a travel agency. \u201cHappy Greek Morning\u201d features Folk and classical Greek music, community news and information and public service messages. In 1972, Mr. Vassos added to his program approximately 6 minutes of news from Greece and around the world.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">S.J.A. at 43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">. Cosmopolitan introduced testimony by several time brokers describing the content of their respective programs. Some of this testimony was anecdotal in nature as, for example, when Ferenc Koreh, producer of a program entitled American Hungarian Voice, was asked whether the portion of his program devoted to community news and information was broadcast on a regular weekly basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-8\">A. It depends on when our community news is. It usually is on and I give some other information, all the other information that you cannot get from the American radio and newspapers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-9\">Q. Could you give an example of the type of information that they could not get?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"azy-dedup-1\">A. For example, it happened not long ago that some Hungarian tourists and Rumanians were touring the United States and Canada and I gave this information to the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-11\">But there are many such informations. The Hungarian Scouts in Exile are arranging an evening. They are not paying for this. This is a public service. It is an information because I am helping the community and the Scouts at the same time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">Transcript at 1453-54.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">. For example, Elfredo Rendiero, producer of a program entitled \u201cThe Voice of Portugal,\u201d testified that the content of his program consisted of \u201cMusic, news, interviews and items of interest to the Portuguese community\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-16\">Q. Is the music you play Portuguese music?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-17\">A. Portuguese and Brazilian music.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-18\">Q. And is the program broadcast in the Portuguese language?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-19\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-20\">Q. Do you broadcast a news program within the body of the program?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-21\">A. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-22\">Q. And at what time is that broadcast?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-23\">A. 6:00 o\u2019clock. There is one segment at 6:00, and there is another one at 5:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-24\">Q. The segment at 6:00 is how long?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-25\">A. Ten minutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-26\">Transcript at 1223-24. Mr. Rendiero\u2019s testimony was uncontradicted, and contained information of comparable specificity to that which could be obtained from program logs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-27\">Again, I. K. Asghar, producer of a program entitled \u201cPakistani Hour\u201d broadcast in the Urdu language, offered uncontradicted testimony concerning the substantive content of this program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-28\">Q. In the exhibit we were just looking at, Exhibit 6, there\u2019s a news segment in the program. Can you tell us how much of your program prior to December, 1972, was devoted to the news of Pakistan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-29\">A. First of all it depends very much on how many news items we have every week; sometimes we receive a number of items; then we give more time. But, let us say about five to seven minutes is normal, five to seven minutes; but sometimes it happens that the news js more; then we give more time; if the news were less, than it would be about five to seven minutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-30\">Transcript at 1869.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1022-31\">. At the hearing, the Broadcast Bureau objected to Exhibit 54 on hearsay grounds, transcript at 2756, and the ALJ sustained the objection for reasons that are not entirely clear.

Although Cosmopolitan did not carry forward its objection to the ALJ\u2019s ruling, it did present to the Commission an exception to the ALJ\u2019s finding that \u201c[w]e can give Cosmopolitan some credit for its ethnic broadcasts but except for variety, there is no other merit shown.\" In this exception Cosmopolitan argued to the Commission that \u201c[b]y presenting programming in a multitude of foreign languages, <em>many of which are not available on any other radio station within WHBI\u2019s service </em>area, WHBI has been providing a valuable service to the members of numerous foreign language and ethnic groups, residing in Newark and the New York metropolitan area.\u201d Exception 100, Exceptions of Cosmopolitan Broadcasting Corp. to Initial Decision at 90 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1024-10\">LEVENTHAL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AuJW\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">I concur in the opinion of the court, and in its remand to the Commission for reconsideration and clarification of the issue of meritoriousness.
