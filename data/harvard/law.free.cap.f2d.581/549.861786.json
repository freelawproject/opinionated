Young appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the decision by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (\u201cSecretary\u201d) denying plaintiff disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act (\u201cAct\u201d). 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq. </em>Plaintiff asserts that her spinal ailment, arthritis and attendant depression and anxiety constitute a \u201cdisability\u201d within the meaning of the Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and contends that the Secretary\u2019s contrary finding was not based on substantial evidence. Our review of the record shows that the Secretary\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and we therefore affirm the order of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The decision of the administrative law judge stands as the Secretary\u2019s final decision in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge found that a \u201cmild to moderate degree\u201d of degenerative spinal disease made plaintiff \u201cunable to perform medium or heavy labor or work requiring frequent bending, prolonged sitting, or substantial lifting.\u201d However, he concluded that plaintiff\u2019s \u201cresidual physical and mental capacity, age, education and vocational background\u201d left her \u201cable to perform jobs of the type she has performed, is qualified to perform or can readily be trained to perform.\u201d The judge therefore found that plaintiff did not suffer a disability within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In appeals from determinations of disability under the Act, the sole question before the court is whether the Secretary\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>Knott </em>v. <em>Califano, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 559 F.2d 279, 280. In reaching his decision in this case, the administrative law judge weighed conflicting medical opinions with regard to plaintiff\u2019s physical and mental condition. Though two treating physicians asserted that she was disabled, two other doctors who examined plaintiff did not reach that conclusion. One reported that \u201cno real explanation for her cervical spine pain has been elicited.\u201d The other examining doctor found \u201cnothing in her spine that required a myelogram or surgery.\u201d Moreover, this physician observed that plaintiff \u201cis one of these individuals that enjoys having her complaints\u201d and suggested that \u201cprobably until this lady receives her Social Security, nothing is going to benefit her.\u201d In light of the foregoing medical opinions, we cannot say that the Secretary\u2019s decision to deny plaintiff disability benefits is unsupported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order and judgment dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\">. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(d) defines \u201cdisability\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">(1) (A) inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months; .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">(A) an individual . . . shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">(3) For purposes of this subsection, \u201ca physical or mental impairment\u201d is an impairment that results from anatomical, physiological or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-17\">. The administrative law judge issued his decision on February 17, 1977. On April 27, 1977 the Appeals Council of the Social Security Administration informed plaintiff of its conclusion that the judge\u2019s decision was correct and would therefore \u201cstand[] as the final decision of the Secretary in your case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b642-18\">. The Supreme Court has defined \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
