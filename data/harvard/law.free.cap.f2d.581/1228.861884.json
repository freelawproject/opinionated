In our previous decision we held that the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had improperly vetoed issuance of a water pollution permit to petitioner Republic Steel Corporation (Republic) for its Canton, Ohio, mill. <em>Republic Steel Corp. v. Train, </em>557 F.2d 91 (6th Cir. 1977) (hereinafter referred to as <em>Republic Steel I).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> Contra, United States Steel Corp. v. Train, </em>556 F.2d 822, 854-55 (7th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-8\">The Administrator had objected to the permit, originally proposed by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA), on the ground that it improperly waived a July 1, 1977, statutory deadline for compliance with federal effluent standards. Under \u00a7 301(b)(l)(A)(i)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended in 1972 (FWPCA) industrial dischargers were required to comply \u201cnot later than July 1, 1977\u201d with \u201ceffluent limitations for point sources [requiring] the application of the best practicable control technology currently available, as defined by the Administrator pursuant to \u00a7 304(b)\u201d of the Act. At the time of our previous decision EPA had not yet promulgated final regulations defining \u201cbest practicable technology currently available\u201d (BPT) for categories of dischargers including iron and steel manufacturing, despite a requirement in \u00a7 304(b)(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Act that such regulations be published by October 18, 1973.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1322-11\">We reluctantly concluded that EPA\u2019s failure to timely define BPT precluded the Administrator from imposing a July 1,1977, compliance deadline, since Congress had apparently established promulgation of regulations under \u00a7 304(b) as a necessary precondition for imposition of the deadline in \u00a7 301(b)(l)(A)(i). Our decision was designed \u201cto relieve the discharger of the unfair consequences\u201d of being forced to comply with the deadline in the absence of applicable standards for guidance. 557 F.2d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-12\">This Court stayed its mandate in <em>Republic Steel I </em>pending the EPA\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court. Shortly after EPA filed its petition for cer-tiorari, Congress enacted the Clean Water Act of 1977, which substantially revised FWPCA. In the wake of that enactment, the Supreme Court granted EPA\u2019s petition, vacated our judgment in <em>Republic Steel I, </em>and remanded the case to this Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>further consideration in light of the new law. <em>Costle v. Republic Steel Corp., </em>434 U.S. 1030, 98 S.Ct. 761, 54 L.Ed.2d 778 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">We have reviewed the 1977 Act and conclude that its provisions have effectively overruled our previous decision. Although neither \u00a7 301(b)(l)(A)(i), requiring industrial dischargers to achieve BPT no later than July 1,1977, nor \u00a7 304(b), requiring EPA to define BPT by October 18, 1973, were amended by the 1977 Act, Congress did add a new \u00a7 309(a)(5)(B)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> providing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUH\">(B) The Administrator may, if he determines (i) that any person who is a violator of, or any person who is otherwise not in compliance with, the time requirements under this Act or in any permit issued under this Act, has acted in good faith, and has made a commitment (in the form of contracts or other securities) of necessary resources to achieve compliance by the earliest possible date after July 1, 1977, but not later than April 1, 1979; (ii) that any extension under this provision will not result in the imposition of any additional controls on any other point or nonpoint source; (iii) that an application for a permit under section 402 of this Act was filed for such person prior to December 31, 1974; and (iv) that the facilities necessary for compliance with such requirements are under construction, grant an extension of the date referred to in section 301(b)(1)(A) to a date which will achieve compliance at the earliest time possible but not later than April 1, 1979.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">The legislative history of this provision makes it abundantly clear that Congress intended the procedure outlined therein to be the exclusive avenue of relief from the dictates of a mandatory and unconditional July 1, 1977, deadline. The Senate Report expressly rejected the rationale of <em>Republic Steel I:</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-9\">Under existing law there are no circumstances that justify a time for compliance extending beyond July 1,1977. The Administrator can only issue an enforcement order requiring compliance within 30 days or initiate civil or criminal action. Thus, the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <em>Republic Steel Corporation v. Train et a 1. </em>and <em>Williams, </em>557 F.2d 91, (6th Cir. 1977) was an incorrect interpretation of existing law. This amendment responds to the legitimate concern of dischargers who, despite good faith efforts, will not comply with the 1977 requirements. To accommodate this objective, the committee amended section 309(a) of the act to authorize the Administrator in his discretion, to pursue one of two new options with regard to a discharger out of compliance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-11\">The committee believes that a case has been made in our hearings on this bill that some relief from penalties must be granted for those sources which have made a good faith attempt to comply with the deadlines in the statute but for justifiable reasons have been unable to do so. The committee considered but rejected the alternative of providing a case-by-case extension of the deadline set out in the statute. That alternative was rejected because the committee felt that such a case-by-case extension would not only burden the administrative process but that it would provide further opportunity for delay for those sources which are otherwise unable to make a legitimate case for additional time. Consequently, decisions by the Administrator pursuant to this new provision of law should not be the subject of administrative hearings and appeals- but rather, if the Administrator feels he cannot determine that a source meets the requirements of section 309(a)(5)(B) that he will immediately proceed under any of the other enforcement options set out in section 309. This au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>thorization of limited flexibility granted to the Administrator will maintain the pressure for compliance while at the same time enabling the Administrator to use his discretion to grant any justifiable extension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1324-4\">Sen.Rep. 95-370, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. reprinted in 1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4326, 4385, 4387.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">The import of the statute is now plain: the July 1, 1977, deadline cannot be waived by the courts. To the extent that noncompliance occurs despite good faith efforts as defined in \u00a7 309(a)(5)(B), relief is available only via discretionary extension of the deadline by the Administrator.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">Republic urges that mere addition of a new remedial procedure does not change the operation of the rest of the Act as we construed it in <em>Republic Steel I. </em>We are bound, however, to read the amendment together with the original provisions of the Act \u201cas parts of an integrated whole.\u201d <em>Markham v. Cabell, </em>326 U.S. 404, 411, 66 S.Ct. 193, 90 L.Ed. 165 (1945). The unchanged sections and the amendment must generally be given \u201cthe most harmonious, comprehensive meaning possible\u201d so that they do not conflict. <em>Clark v. Uebersee Finanz-Korp., </em>332 U.S. 480, 488, 68 S.Ct. 174, 92 L.Ed. 88 (1947). <em>See also </em>1A Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 22.35 (1972). To insist on adherence to our earlier view would not only render \u00a7 309(a)(5)(B) largely meaningless, but also would defeat Congress\u2019 clearly expressed intent in enacting that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-12\">Moreover, the 1977 Act effectively responds to the concern we expressed in <em>Republic Steel I </em>that a discharger might suffer \u201cunfair consequences\u201d from EPA\u2019s failure to timely promulgate relevant BPT regulations. Under prior law the Administrator had no clear statutory authority to extend the July 1, 1977, deadline and a dis-charger could be subjected to liability without any consideration for the reasons for his noncompliance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The new \u00a7 309(a)(5)(B) clearly permits the Administrator to extend the deadline where noncompliance was caused solely by the lack of BPT guidelines.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>We conclude, then, that the Administrator can properly object under \u00a7 402(d)(2)(B) of the Act to a proposed permit for a point source governed by \u00a7 301(b)(l)(A)(i) if that permit does not require attainment of BPT by July 1, 1977, unless the Administrator has determined that a time extension is warranted pursuant to \u00a7 309(a)(5)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">This does not, however, end our inquiry. We must decide whether the 1977 Act may be applied in the context of this case, which was pending before the Supreme Court at the time the new law took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-6\">The general rule is that \u201ca court is to apply the law in effect at the time of its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.\u201d <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Richmond School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 711, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2016, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974). This principle applies with full force to an appellate court in reconsidering a decision that has been vacated and remanded by the Supreme Court in light of an intervening change in the law. <em>See Fruehauf Corp. v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>566 F.2d 574, 577-79 (6th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-7\">The Clean Water Act of 1977 contains no \u201cstatutory direction or legislative history\u201d militating against application of \u00a7 309(a)(5)(B) to pending cases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To the contrary, the statute is applicable to \u201cany person who <em>is </em>a violator of, or any person who is otherwise not in compliance with, the time requirements\u201d of the Act. \u00a7 309(a)(5)(B) (emphasis supplied). Moreover, the Senate Report indicates that the \u00a7 309 procedure was intended to \u201ccodify\u201d the informal EPA practice already in existence, under which the Administrator stood firm behind the 1977 deadline, but delayed enforcement where the discharger showed the requisite good faith efforts at compliance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Sen.Rep. No. 95-370, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in 1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4326, 4386. The Conference Report likewise indicates that under the 1977 Act \u201cthe existing enforcement policy of the EPA is continued.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 95-830, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in 1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 4424, 4464.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-16\">Nor do we think that application of current law would result in manifest injustice. If Republic has made good faith efforts at compliance with the law that have been delayed only by EPA\u2019s failure to timely promulgate BPT standards, then the company will be eligible for an extension under \u00a7 309(a)(5)(B).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is nothing fundamentally unfair in predicating relief from the deadline on a showing to the responsible agency that the polluter has made a \u201creasonable attempt to comply with the mandates of the law.\u201d Sen.Rep. No. 95-370, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in 1977 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4326, 4386. Indeed, to require anything less would work an injustice on the overwhelming majority of the nation\u2019s major industrial dischargers who followed the law as best they could and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>met the statutory timetable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It would also flaunt the national commitment to attainment of water quality capable of supporting fish, wildlife and recreation by 1983, and the total elimination of pollutant discharges by 1985. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1) &amp; (2). Application of current law is particularly favored where such matters of great national concern are at stake. <em>Bradley, supra, </em>416 U.S. at 719-20, 94 S.Ct. 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">The situation might be different if Republic could claim that its noncompliance was induced by administrative or judicial construction of \u00a7 301(b)(l)(A)(i) to the effect that the July 1, 1977, deadline was waived by EPA\u2019s failure to promulgate BPT guidelines. <em>See generally United States v. Pennsylvania Ind. Chem. Corp., </em>411 U.S. 655, 670-75, 93 S.Ct. 1804, 36 L.Ed.2d 567 (1973). But in the years following enactment of FWPCA, EPA consistently took the official position that the statutory compliance date was absolute and that it was not waived by the absence of BPT guidelines.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The first draft permit for the Canton mill issued by OEPA in June 1974 required compliance by September 1976. EPA\u2019s position as to the Act\u2019s time requirement was not challenged by a court of appeals until our decision in <em>Republic Steel I </em>on June 23, 1977 \u2014 only days before the July 1, 1977, deadline.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Republic can hardly claim that its noncompliance was induced by that decision, since by even the most conservative estimates the necessary equipment would take many months to construct.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nor can the company maintain that it ever had a vested right in the result ordered in <em>Republic Steel I, </em>since our mandate there never took effect, and since the Supreme Court later vacated the judgment altogether. <em>Cf. Bradley, supra, </em>416 U.S. at 720, 94 S.Ct. 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-12\">In any event, Republic does not seriously claim that its noncompliance with the July 1, 1977, deadline is the result of an honest belief that the deadline was invalid. Rather the company maintains that it was unable to meet the deadline despite good faith efforts, because of the absence of BPT guidelines from EPA. If this is true, then the new \u00a7 309(a)(5)(B) procedure can provide any justified relief.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-13\">The petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">. The case initially came before us on a petition for review of the Administrator\u2019s action, pursuant to \u00a7 509(b)(1)(F) of the Federal Water Pollution Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1)(F). The particular action submitted for review was a decision by the Administrator under \u00a7 402(d)(2)(B) of the Act to \u201cobject to,\u201d and thereby veto, issuance of a water pollution permit for the Canton mill as proposed by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has since ruled that \u00a7 509(b)(1)(F) does not convey jurisdiction on the courts of appeals to review permit vetoes by the Administrator under \u00a7 402(d)(2)(B). <em>Washington v. E. P. A., </em>573 F.2d 583, 586-87 (9th Cir. 1978). This Court has already ruled <em>contra, </em>however, <em>Ford Motor Co. v. E. P.

As of oral argument in this case (June 1978), EPA had still not promulgated final BPT guidelines for iron and steel manufacturing. In the absence of general standards, BPT has been determined on a case-by-case basis, either by the Administrator or by the responsible state agency. <em>See, e. g., </em>OEPA regulation EP-31-04(B)(1)(b) (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(a)(5)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1323-8\">.

Prior to the 1977 Act, EPA did provide relief from the 1977 deadline on an informal basis. Under the \u201cEnforcement Compliance Schedule Letter\u201d (ECSL) program, the Administrator would agree to refrain from enforcement of the statutory deadline against certain dischargers who made good faith attempts at compliance. <em>See Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Train, </em>544 F.2d 657, 659-60 (3d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. den., </em>430 U.S. 975, 97 S.Ct. 1666, 52 L.Ed.2d 369 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1324-9\">.

The term \u201cgood faith\u201d is generally understood to mean a reasonable attempt to comply with the mandates of law. <em>Did the discharger attempt to determine what the applicable requirements </em>were? When the required technology was generally known in the industry, but the discharger had some legitimate disagreements with the Agency on other points, did the discharger begin on an abatement program or conversely did the dis-charger delay the abatement program pending the outcome of lengthy administrative procedures? When the required technology was the subject of a legitimate dispute with the Agency, did the discharger take all other measures that it was capable of (such as segregating waste streams, necessary site preparation, and outfall construction) or did it delay these practices pending the outcome of lengthy administrative procedures?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1324-14\">S.Rep. 95-370, 95th Cong., 1st Session, 1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4326, 4386 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-15\">The Ninth Circuit recently held that the Administrator could not veto a proposed permit for failure to require attainment of BPT by the discharger, where the Administrator had not yet promulgated applicable BPT guidelines. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>573 F.2d 583, 589-92 (9th Cir. 1978). The case is distinguishable in that here the Administrator did not object to the substantive effluent limitations in the proposed permit for the Canton mill \u2014 the objection related solely to the compliance schedule.

Similar considerations would preclude any possible applicability of the ex post facto clause to this case. The existence of the July 1, 1977, deadline, as construed by EPA was an \u201coperative fact\u201d sufficient to provide fair warning to Republic. <em>Dobbert v.

The same rationale precludes any claim that noncompliance with the deadline was induced by OEPA\u2019s agreement to a 42 month compliance schedule in the fall of 1975. Republic concedes that its duty to commence compliance measures attached prior to that agreement. <em>See Republic Steel I, </em>557 F.2d at 94.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1326-16\">. We do not mean to suggest that Republic may in any sense be <em>entitled </em>to an extension as a matter of law.
