The summons in question had been directed to an attorney [a third-party recordkeeper under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(a)(3)(E)] and sought information regarding his financial arrangements with a certain client who was the target of the IRS investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-25\">Upon the filing of the government\u2019s petition for enforcement, Judge Chandler directed the entry of an order designating Charles R. Jones, a full-time United States Magistrate, \u201c. . to hear and determine all matters herein\u201d in accordance with the local rules of the district court. A show \u2022cause order was promptly issued and the matter set for hearing. The respondent-attorney answered the government\u2019s petition and, in addition, the taxpayer sought to intervene in the enforcement proceedings as a matter of right under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(b)(1). The taxpayer\u2019s motion to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>tervene was granted and the case proceeded to a full-dress hearing before the magistrate. Evidence was offered both in support of and in opposition to enforcement. At the conclusion of the hearing, the magistrate found that aside from the claim by respondent and intervenor of an attorney-client privilege, the government had made a sufficient showing for enforcement of the summons. Following the submission of briefs on the issue of privilege, the magistrate, by memorandum opinion, rejected that claim and directed the government to prepare an appropriate order. Subsequently, an order purporting to compel compliance with the summons was signed by the magistrate, filed and entered on the district court\u2019s judgment docket. No further orders of any type were entered in the district court. This appeal is taken by respondent and intervenor from the magistrate\u2019s enforcement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">By appropriate motion, the government seeks dismissal of this and other related appeals for lack of appellate jurisdiction. In support of its motion, the government relies on our recent decision in <em>United States v. First National Bank of Rush Springs, </em>576 F.2d 852 (10th Cir. filed May 16, 1978) in which we held that courts of appeal have no jurisdiction to review, directly, an order of a United States Magistrate enforcing an IRS summons and that review of such an order must, in the first instance, be sought in the district court. Appellants strenuously resist the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The jurisdictional problem presented by this appeal is cut from the same fabric as the issue which confronted us in <em>First National Bank of Rush Springs. </em>In these cases, our attention focuses on not so much the role of the magistrate in the conduct of proceedings under \u00a7\u00a7 7402(b) and 7604(a), but rather the effect of a magistrate\u2019s enforcement order and our authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to review it. To resolve these questions, we look to the relevant decisions of the Supreme Court and this court, as well as, the Federal Magistrate\u2019s Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 631 <em>et seq.), </em>the summons enforcement statutes and the district court\u2019s local rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">When the government sought enforcement of the IRS summons, it invoked the jurisdiction of the <em>district court </em>under \u00a7\u00a7 7402(b) and 7604(a). There is no indication that the petition for enforcement was presented directly to the magistrate. Rather, the magistrate\u2019s role was predicated solely on Judge Chandler\u2019s order under \u00a7 636(b)(3) designating him to conduct such further proceedings as were authorized by Rule 31 of the district court\u2019s local rules.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">In pertinent part, Rule 31(3) states: \u201c. . . a magistrate may perform the duties authorized by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b) and Rule 31(1), (g) through (n) and Rule 31(2), supra, <em>upon specific designation by a judge of the court or </em>pursuant to a general order of the court ... In performing such duties the magistrate shall conform to the general procedural rules of this court and <em>the instructions of the judge to whom the case is assigned.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Rule 31(2)(m) authorizes a magistrate presiding in Oklahoma City to: \u201cIssue an attachment or order to enforce obedience to an Internal Revenue Service Summons to produce records or to give testimony. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(b)\u201d. These sections, when read together, give more than ample indication that a magistrate in the Western District of Oklahoma has authority to conduct certain types of proceedings only on the \u201cspecific designation of a judge\u201d and that the judge retains continuing and overall responsibility for the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">Under the Federal Magistrate\u2019s Act, a district court may designate a magistrate to perform certain specific duties and: \u201c. . . such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u201d The Supreme Court has made it clear that a magistrate exercising \u201cadditional duties\u201d jurisdiction is continually subject to the inherent supervisory power of the district judge and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>judge retains the . . ult\u00edmate responsibility for decision making in every instance . . <em>Mathews v. Weber, </em>423 U.S. 261, 270, 96 S.Ct. 549, 554, 46 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976). From the record, it appears that Judge Chandler\u2019s order of designation merely sent the enforcement matter to the magistrate for a limited purpose. Even under the most expansive reading, the judge\u2019s order and the local rules cited therein will not support a claim that the district court\u2019s Article III decisional power had been delegated to the magistrate. In any event, it is doubtful under <em>Mathews </em>whether such would be possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Appellants argue that this court should accept jurisdiction because they have no right of review in the district court. This contention is meritless and we reject it. The district court\u2019s rules clearly and expressly provide that: \u201cAny party may appeal from a magistrate\u2019s determination made under this Rule within ten (10) days after issuance of the magistrate\u2019s order . . .\u201d. Rule 31(l)(h). <em>See also, </em>Rule 31(l)(j). The provisions for review of a magistrate\u2019s determination which are embodied in the district court\u2019s local rules follow closely the appeal procedure set out in \u00a7 636(b)(1). In sum, we conclude that appellate-type review of \u201cany portion\u201d of the magistrate\u2019s order was available to appellants in the district court and, for reasons unknown, they apparently elected to bypass it.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">The question remains: Of what effect is the magistrate\u2019s order and how may it eventually be brought to this court for review? Notwithstanding appellants\u2019 failure to seek review in the district court, the magistrate\u2019s order is probably inchoate under provisions of the district court\u2019s rules and <em>Mathews </em>without the express approval and order of a judge. In relevant part Rule 31(1)(J) provides: . if there are no objections . . . within the time provided by this rule the findings and recommendations of the magistrate <em>shall become final and binding as to all parties upon the approval and order of the judge to whom the case is assigned.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Similarly, Rule 31(l)(n) states: \u201c. The entry of final judgment in <em>any civil case . . . </em>shall be made by a judge . or at the direction of a judge.\u201d (emphasis supplied). These sections of Rule 31, in our view, simply restate the <em>Mathews </em>requirement that the final decision \u201cin every instance\u201d be made by an Article III judge. The appealability of the judge\u2019s order is, of course, governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and Rule 4(a), F.R.A.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">The appeal is dismissed for lack of a final judgment in accord with the views expressed in <em>First National Bank of Rush Springs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"AQB\">RULE 31</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">UNITED STATES MAGISTRATES</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">1.
