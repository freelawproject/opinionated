The suit was dismissed by the district court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Matos appeals from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AWB_\">Title II of the Social Security Act (\u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401 <em>et seq., </em>provides disability benefits to persons who suffer a mental or physical disability within the meaning of the Act if the disability arose prior to the expiration of the claimant\u2019s insured status. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i), 423. On October 15, 1964, appellant applied for disability insurance benefits, alleging disability since July, 1963. The claim was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>based on a problem consisting of a chronic fibromyositis of the lumbar muscles of the back. This claim was denied on March 19, 1965, because her condition was determined not to be disabling within the meaning of the law. She filed a request for a redeter-mination and her claim was again denied on November 13, 1965. Although notified of her right to request a hearing within six months, appellant took no further action on this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Matos filed a second application for disability insurance on June 7, 1968, again alleging disability since July, 1963.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 30, 1969, this claim was denied for reasons similar to the earlier denial. Appellant was notified of her right to seek reconsideration, but she took no further action on the application. The decision became final, within the meaning of the Act, upon appellant\u2019s failure to seek further review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">On February 8, 1973, Matos filed her third and most recent application. She submitted additional medical reports in support of this application, but she was informed on May 31, 1973, that her application was denied because it concerned the same issues as those previously considered in earlier applications. She requested reconsideration, which was denied, and then she filed a timely request for a hearing. The hearing examiner, now Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), issued an order on October 9,1973, dismissing, primarily based on the ground of <em>res judicata, </em>appellant\u2019s request for a hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The AU stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">\u201cThe claimant has not submitted any new or material evidence as to her back impairment on or before June 30, 1968, and the new evidence refers to conditions which did not exist at the time when the claimant met the earnings requirements for entitlement to disability insurance benefits. Therefore, the new evidence on record does not warrant any change in the final determination made on the prior application.\u201d App. 25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">The Appeals Council affirmed the ALJ\u2019s dismissal on February 7,1974, and appellant sued to seek review of the adverse determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Matos alleges that the ALJ did not consider the July 2, 1973, certificate of Dr. Julio E. Frank, Psychiatrist, stating that \u201cpatient is disoriented as to time and place. Memory and intellectual resources handicapped\u201d and she was \u201cunable to manage her funds.\u201d App. 28-29. Appellant argues that the time limitation for reopening a claim for disability benefits should not apply to a mentally disabled person, and the ALJ in his decision should have considered the evidence of Matos\u2019 mental incompetency. She further argues that jurisdiction attaches to review <em>res judicata </em>decisions under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">The question present here is whether \u00a7 205(h) of the Act is an absolute bar to judicial review of a denial, based on either <em>res judicata </em>or a decision not to reopen, of a claim for disability benefits, where the decision was not made after a hearing. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>second question is the effect of Matos\u2019 mental disability on either of these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The Act itself provides, in \u00a7 205(g), for judicial review of administrative decisions in specified instances. It provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">\u201cAny individual, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days after a mailing to him of notice of such decision or within such further time as the Secretary may allow. . . \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The Act limits the availability of judicial review of decisions or findings of fact to the procedure spelled out in \u00a7 205(g). Section 205(h) of the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">\u201cThe findings and decision of the Secretary after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing. No findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided. No action against the United States, the Secretary, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 41 of Title 28 to recover on any claim arising under the subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Since appellant never requested a hearing on her earlier two claims and did not receive a hearing on her third claim, the Act does not provide for judicial review. From the facts of this case we find no additional grounds for jurisdiction available to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">First, appellant\u2019s third claim may have been treated by the AU as a request to reopen an earlier claim. The AU stated that \u201cthe new evidence\u201d did \u201cnot warrant any change in the final determination made on prior application.\u201d App. 25. Assuming this statement is considered to be a decision not to reopen the earlier determinations, jurisdiction for judicial review is not available under the APA. <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>Adames </em>v. <em>Califano, </em>552 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1977); <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Califano, </em>551 F.2d 881 (1st Cir. 1977). The Supreme Court in <em>Sanders </em>determined that \u00a7 10 of the APA did not provide an independent grant of jurisdiction and held that a decision by the Secretary not to reopen a claim for benefits is not judicially reviewable. The Court stated that \u201cthe APA is not to be interpreted as an implied grant of subject-matter jurisdiction to review agency actions.\u201d <em>Sanders, supra, </em>at 105, 97 S.Ct. at 984.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to a final determination in the original claim, appellant could have secured a hearing and judicial review, if she had pursued all her remedies. The holding in <em>Sanders </em>provides, in essence, that a claimant is not given a guarantee of a second hearing and court review if he waives the first opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">Second, the AU explicitly determined that appellant\u2019s third claim was barred by <em>res judicata. </em>The question is whether the administrative determination of <em>res judicata </em>by the AU, without a hearing, is reviewable by the courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Circuit courts in <em>pre-Sanders </em>cases consistently held that an allegedly new claim could be dismissed without a hearing as <em>res judicata </em>even if the earlier decision had become final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>without a hearing. As the Fourth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">\u201c[WJhere a claimant filed an application for disability benefits which was denied on the ground that disability was absent on the terminal date of his insured status and where the claimant failed to exercise his right to reconsideration and to a hearing, the denial was nevertheless res <em>judi-cata </em>of a subsequent application for the same benefits on the same grounds.\u201d <em>Leviner v. Richardson, </em>443 F.2d 1338, 1342 (4th Cir. 1971), referring to <em>Domozik v. Cohen, </em>413 F.2d 5 (3rd Cir. 1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A21\"><em>See Gaston v. Richardson, </em>451 F.2d 461 (6th Cir. 1971). These cases were decided at a time when judicial review was considered to be available under the APA to avoid any abuses of discretion. However, in light of the rationale of the <em>Sanders </em>decision, we conclude that these earlier decisions are still valid, and follow them. To allow judicial review of a <em>res judicata </em>determination would circumvent the holding in <em>Sanders. </em>Under <em>Sanders, </em>if a claimant asked that a claim be reopened, a denial of that claim would not be subject to judicial review. However, if a claimant filed a new claim using the same factual basis as in a request for reopening, then a dismissal as <em>res judicata </em>would be subject to judicial review. This would have the effect of disturbing the finality of decisions \u2014 decisions from which the claimant originally could have made a timely appeal if he had pursued all his remedies. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Sanders:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">\u201c[A]n interpretation that would allow a claimant judicial review simply by filing \u2014 and being denied \u2014 a petition to reopen his claim would frustrate the congressional purpose, plainly evidenced in \u00a7 205(g), to impose a 60-day limitation upon judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s final decision on the initial claim for benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.951 (1976). Congress\u2019 determination so to limit judicial review to the original decision denying benefits is a policy choice obviously designed to forestall repetitive or belated litigation of stale eligibility claims.\u201d 430 U.S. at 108, 97 S.Ct. at 986.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">In light of the rationale in <em>Sanders, </em>we hold that this court is without jurisdiction to examine appellant\u2019s claim which was denied as <em>res </em>judicata.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The result of lack of jurisdiction creates the possibility that in certain situations the Secretary could dismiss a valid administrative claim on the basis of <em>res judicata. </em>Under <em>Sanders, </em>the Secretary likewise arbitrarily could refuse to reopen a claim for which \u201cgood cause\u201d to reopen had been presented by the claimant. Such results seem unfair, but \u201c[t]he right to receive social security benefits does not derive from the common law or the United States Constitution. It came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>into being by Act of Congress\u201d. <em>Gaston v. Richardson, supra </em>at 466. Congress delineates the jurisdiction of the federal courts to hear claims based on the Act, and any change in this court\u2019s jurisdiction must come from Congress.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Finally, the argument arises that <em>res ju-dicata </em>could not be a bar because appellant was incompetent to pursue all her administrative remedies at the time of the 1969 denial of her second application.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Other Circuits in <em>pre-Sanders </em>cases implied that mental illness might destroy the <em>res judica-ta </em>effect of a prior administrative determination. <em>See Wallace v. Weinberger, </em>528 F.2d 700 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>Leviner v. Richardson, </em>443 F.2d 1338, 1343 (4th Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Whether such a claim gives rise to proper jurisdictional grounds for judicial review need not be addressed here. There is no evidence on the record or presented in argument that indicates that appellant suffered from such a mental disability as to make her unable to pursue her administrative remedies at the time she should have sought further remedy. Nothing in the psychiatric report would indicate that she was mentally unfit to pursue administrative remedies. She was suffering from no mental problems in 1965 when she failed to pursue her administrative remedies, and in 1968 her mental condition did not preclude her from filing her second claim. She has presented no evidence that her condition subsequently prevented her from pursuing, at the time of the 1969 denial of benefits, her full administrative remedies. Thus, no basis exists for relieving the appellant from the <em>res judicata </em>determination.</p>\n<p id=\"APg\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\">. Matos continued to meet the earnings requirements for disability purposes until June 30, 1968.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\">. After a claim determination becomes final, a claimant may file a new claim based on new facts or may apply to reopen the original claim. The regulations provide for reopening the agency determination to give additional consideration for claims. A final determination may be reopened as a matter of right within 12 months, or \u201cupon a finding of good cause for reopening\u201d within four years if new, material evidence is provided or if specific errors are discovered. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.957(a), (b), and 404.958.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\">. The regulations provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">\u201cThe presiding officer may, on his own motion, dismiss a hearing request, either entirely or as to any stated issue, under any of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-15\">(a) <em>Res judicata. </em>Where there has been a previous determination or decision by the Secretary with respect to the right of the same party on the same facts pertinent to the same issue or issues which has become final either by judicial affirmance or, within judicial consideration, upon the claimant\u2019s failure timely to request reconsideration, hearing, or review, or to commence a civil action with respect to such determination decision (see \u00a7\u00a7 404.911, 404.918, 404.946, and 404.951).\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.937(a).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\">. Appellant contends that the statute of limitations period for reopening a claim should not apply to her because of her mental disability, a question left open in <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>475 F.2d 466 (1st Cir. 1973). We have no need to address this issue because the ALJ did not apply the statute of limitations, rather he addressed the merits. He determined that no change in the earlier determination was warranted because \u201cthe new evidence refers to conditions which did not exist at the time when the claimant met the earnings requirement for disability insurance benefits.\u201d App. 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b377-15\">. In <em>Sanders, </em>the ALJ determined that a new application was barred by <em>res judicata </em>as well as treating the application as a petition to reopen an earlier claim. However, only the decision to reopen was addressed on appeal. Thus, the Supreme Court has not ruled on the question of the availability of judicial review of <em>res judicata </em>determinations made without a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b378-5\">. If a claimant were to raise a new and different claim, and the Secretary were to refuse to act based on <em>res judicata, </em>the claimant would be denied all opportunity for a hearing unless judicial review were available. Such a result would contravene the provisions of the Act, whereby affected parties must be given \u201creasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing\u201d, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b), and of due process. Our holding does not preclude jurisdiction where a colorable constitutional claim is raised. As stated by the Supreme Court in <em>Sanders:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6n\">\u201cConstitutional questions obviously are unsuited to resolution in administrative hearing procedures and, therefore, access to the courts is essential to the decision of such questions. . . [W]hen constitutional questions are in issue, the availability of judicial review is presumed . . . .\u201d <em>Sanders, supra </em>at 109, 97 S.Ct. at 986.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj9D\"><em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976); <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). Likewise, the extraordinary remedy of mandamus, provided through 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, might be available in those extreme situations where no other remedy was available. As stated by the D.C. Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMk\">\u201c[J]urisdiction on grounds other than Section 1331 has been recognized, albeit cautiously, when <em>no </em>provision for review of the particular claims was made in the Act. The courts generally agree, however, that when review procedures applicable to the claim at issue are provided in the Social Security Act, substitute bases for jurisdiction are not to be allowed.\u201d <em>Association of American Medical Colleges v. Califano, </em>569 F.2d 101, 112-13 (D.C.Cir.1977) (emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuDE\"><em>See Haneke v. Secretary of HEW, </em>175 U.S.App. D.C. 329, 535 F.2d 1291 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\">. In establishing judicial review of agency actions, Congress has wide latitude in establishing the type of, and circumstances for, judicial review. As stated by the Supreme Court in <em>N.L.R.B. v. Cheney Cal. Lumber Co., </em>327 U.S. 385, 66 S.Ct. 553, 90 L.Ed. 739 (1946):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\u201cWhen judicial review is available and under what circumstances, are questions (apart from whatever requirements the Constitution may make in certain situations) that depend on the particular Congressional enactment under which judicial review is authorized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">. Matos\u2019 mental disability occurred in 1968. No evidence was presented that the onset of mental disability affected her eligibility for disability benefits, and the ALJ determined that it did not. However, a mental disability at that time could have affected her ability to pursue her administrative remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b379-19\">. In <em>Leviner, </em>the court found that the record, \u201cwhile containing some suggestions of mental illness, does not show mental illness of an incapacitating degree at the time that claimant\u2019s decisions not to pursue his rights to reconsideration and hearing were made.\u201d 443 F.2d at 1343. Similarly, in <em>Green v. Weinberger, </em>500 F.2d 203 (5th Cir. 1974), the court found no disability approaching the level of mental illness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
