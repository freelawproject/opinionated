Frank Keppard is an employee of International Harvester and a member of the United Automobile Workers. In 1966 he was injured on the job and became unable to work. He sought to return to work in 1971, but International refused to take him back. He thereupon filed a grievance with the union. The grievance went to binding medical arbitration, resulting in an award in his favor. He returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-19\">Keppard next asked the union to press his claim for two years\u2019 back pay for the period between his request to return to work and his actual reemployment. The local union eventually compromised Keppard\u2019s claim, as part of a package resolving a number of grievances during the negotiations for a new contract. When union officials announced the compromise and settlement at a union meeting, Keppard said he would not accept the $2,500 awarded him and said he would hire an attorney. Later, however, he accepted and cashed a check for the compromise amount after being told that the local in ratifying its new contract had agreed to the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-20\">Keppard\u2019s check contained no written notice that it was in full settlement of his claim, and he states that he did not know that accepting the check might preclude him from seeking more through an attorney. He says that he would not have accepted it if he had known.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Keppard did not pursue any intraunion remedies for the local\u2019s handling of his grievance. Instead, he brought this suit against both the union and the company in state court, claiming that the UAW had breached its duty of fair representation and that the company owed him back pay. International removed the suit to federal court. Both defendants moved for summary judgment. The record includes affidavits of all the parties in support or opposition. The district court granted the union\u2019s motion because of Keppard\u2019s failure to exhaust his intraunion remedies and the company\u2019s motion on the ground that Keppard\u2019s acceptance of the check constituted an accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">I. <em>Claim Against the Union</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Keppard is suing under \u00a7 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, which allows actions in federal court to enforce collective-bargaining agreements. A \u00a7 301 suit by an employee has two distinct phases if the agreement has a grievance procedure culminating in arbitration. The employee must first show that the union\u2019s handling of the grievance violated the union\u2019s duty of fair representation. Only after making this showing may the employee avoid the usual finality of the grievance process and sue the company directly on the agreement. <em>Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, </em>424 U.S. 554, 96 S.Ct. 1048, 47 L.Ed.2d 231 (1976); Vaca v. <em>Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967). Federal courts also have \u00a7 301 jurisdiction to decide fair representation claims against the union alone, because the union\u2019s duty of fair representation is part of its obligation to negotiate and administer the contract. <em>Seay v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>427 F.2d 996, 1000-01 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The district court held that, as a matter of law, Keppard\u2019s failure to exhaust his intraunion remedies foreclosed his fair representation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">There is nothing in appellant\u2019s pleadings, answers to interrogatories, admissions, or in his affidavit that would in any way indicate that he was claiming that a further pursuit of remedies <em>would be futile. </em>The question of exhaustion does not end with an allegation of unfair representation by the union. The aggrieved employee must show that he has appealed his local\u2019s decision to higher tribunals within the international union, or show that such an appeal would have been futile. <em>Aldridge v. Ludwig-Honold Manufacturing Co., </em>385 F.Supp. 695, 697 (E.D.Pa.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Moreover, under the provisions of Rule 56(e), Fed.R.Civ.P., the burden was on the appellant to respond by affidavits or' otherwise and set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Here, the appellees by written interrogatories and requests for admissions and answers thereto, gave appellant every opportunity to make a claim setting forth specific facts showing that there was a genuine issue for trial on his present claim that an exhaustion of remedies would have been futile. Instead, in his responses to a request for admissions by the appellees, the appellant admitted that (1) he never appealed his grievance settlement to the Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee; (2) he never instituted proceedings pursuant to the appeals provisions set forth in Article 33 of the UAW Constitution with respect to any of the matters alleged in his complaint; and (3) he never appealed his grievance settlement to the Public Review Board, as permitted under the provisions of Article 32 of the UAW Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">In construing the language of Rule 56(e), our circuit has said that a party cannot rely on the allegations in his pleadings, but is required, by affidavit or otherwise, to set forth specific facts showing that there was a genuine issue of fact for trial. <em>Saxony Products, Inc. v. Guerlain, Inc., </em>513 F.2d 716, 723, n. 20 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>Alladin Plastics, Inc. v. Jerrold Stephan Co., </em>362 F.2d 532, 534 (9th Cir. 1966). In <em>United States v. Gossett, </em>416 F.2d 565, 567 (9th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 961, 90 S.Ct. 992, 25 L.Ed.2d 253 (1970), we emphasized that the obvious purpose of the 1963 amendment to Rule 56(e) was to require a party opposing a summary judgment to set forth specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>facts showing a genuine issue for trial, thus strengthening this procedural tool as a means to eliminate sham issues of fact and, in this manner, avoid otherwise lengthy trials. 416 F.2d at 567. The <em>Gossett </em>interpretation of the rule has been approved as recently as <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Springett, </em>527 F.2d 1090, 1092-93 (9th Cir. 1975). <em>See also California Shipping Co. v. Pacific Far East Line, Inc., </em>453 F.2d 380, 381 (9th Cir. 1971, <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 1066, 92 S.Ct. 1501, 31 L.Ed.2d 796 (1972). There was no error in granting the union\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">II. <em>Claim Against the Company</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">When Keppard accepted and cashed his check, he knew that the company considered it a full settlement of his back-pay claim. He was told at the union meeting that the union had settled his grievance. He took the check after a union official told him that it was a settlement check and that the union in ratifying the new contract had agreed to the settlement of his grievance. The district court considered only these facts, which were in Keppard\u2019s affidavit, and held that his action consummated an accord and satisfaction under California law. In this it was correct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-7\">\u201c[W]here a claim is disputed or unliquidated and the tender of a check or draft in settlement thereof is of such character as to give the creditor notice that it must be accepted \u2018in full discharge of his claim\u2019 or not at all, the retention and use of such check or draft constitutes an accord and satisfaction\u201d. <em>Potter v. Pacific Coast Lumber Co., </em>37 Cal.2d 592, 234 P.2d 16, 19 (1951).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">While International, according to Kep-pard\u2019s version, gave him neither written nor oral warning that the check was in full satisfaction of his claim against it, the surrounding circumstances were sufficient to give him notice of that fact. His subjective failure to understand the effect of accepting the check may reflect upon the UAW performance in advising and representing him, but the employer was still entitled to rely on his objective manifestations and the union\u2019s fulfilling its duty. In contrast to <em>California Metal Enameling Co. v. Wad-dington, </em>74 Cal.App.3d 391, 141 Cal.Rptr. 443 (1977), there was no action by the parties to cast doubt on their belief that they had reached an accord. The summary judgment in favor of both defendants must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
