On behalf of the estate, the Administrator instituted a civil action for wrongful death against the Commonwealth of Kentucky and others in the Circuit Court of Campbell County, Kentucky. In defense of that action, appellee, the Attorney General of Kentucky, contended that the doctrine of sovereign immunity absolutely barred the Administrator\u2019s claim against the Commonwealth. The state court agreed and dismissed the Commonwealth as a defendant in the suit. The Administrator\u2019s appeal, in which he challenges the constitutionality of the sovereign immunity doctrine, is now before the Kentucky Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Shortly after the Attorney General asserted the defense of sovereign immunity in state court, the Administrator filed a civil rights action in United States District Court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the very act of raising the sovereign immunity defense deprived the Administrator of various constitutional rights. The District Court dismissed the suit on the grounds that the Administrator\u2019s claim raised a non-justiciable, political question. We affirm for different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The Administrator\u2019s argument is founded upon his contention that the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity is unconstitutional, a proposition rejected by an unbroken line of Supreme Court opinions since the passage of the Eleventh Amendment. See <em>Monaco v. Mississippi, </em>292 U.S. 313, 54 S.Ct. 745, 78 L.Ed. 1282 (1934). Only two months ago, the Supreme Court rejected the identical claim raised here \u2014 the constitutionality of Kentucky\u2019s sovereign immunity doctrine \u2014 in holding that the issue did not present a substantial federal question. <em>Huffman v. Kentucky, </em>435 U.S. 991, 98 S.Ct. 1641, 56 L.Ed.2d 81 (1978). To the same effect <em>Krause, Admr. </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>409 U.S. 1052, 93 S.Ct. 557, 34 L.Ed.2d 506 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Regardless, however, of our opinion of the sovereign immunity doctrine, it is absolutely clear to us that the Attorney General may not be sued under \u00a7 1983 simply for raising the doctrine as a defense to plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death action. The Attorney General does not infringe any constitutional provision or federal law when he asserts in a lawsuit against the state a defense heretofore recognized for centuries in our law. Moreover, the imposition of a legal defense, whether valid or not, is unquestionably \u201can integral part of the judicial process\u201d and may not be the basis of a civil rights action against the state\u2019s attorney who is immune under \u00a7 1983 for such conduct. See <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">The Administrator\u2019s complaint does not state a claim for which relief may be granted, and the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
