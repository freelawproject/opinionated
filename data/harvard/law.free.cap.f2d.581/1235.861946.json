The Tax Court sustained the Commissioner, <em>Wisconsin Nipple and Fabricating Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>67 T.C. 490 (1976), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Alqb\">In 1960 the taxpayer, Wisconsin Nipple and Fabricating Corporation, sought and obtained from the IRS District Director in Milwaukee a determination letter to the effect that a profit-sharing plan the company proposed to institute for certain of its employees met the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 401(a)(3)(B) and 501(a) of the Code. The plan covered only full-time, salaried employees with at least one year\u2019s employment with the company, the hourly-wage employees having indicated to the company that they preferred to receive the cash bonuses the company had been paying instead of participating in the plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Four employees, who were the company\u2019s four highest paid employees and two of whom were officers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>met the plan\u2019s criteria.' The non-salaried employees ineligible to participate were fifteen in number. The plan was instituted in 1960 following receipt of the IRS determination letter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">In 1962, after amending the forfeiture provisions of the plan,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the taxpayer sought and obtained a second IRS determination letter stating that the plan continued to be qualified. None of the eligibility provisions were changed by the amendment. In 1962 the same four employees remained eligible for benefits under the plan, to the exclusion of fifteen non-salaried employees. The lowest-paid participant, however, by then earned less than one of the non-salaried employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">During an audit in the summer of 1973 of the taxpayer\u2019s returns for the taxable years ending April 30,1972 and 1973, the Internal Revenue Service informed the taxpayer that the qualification of the profit-sharing plan was being reexamined by IRS. This led the company to amend the plan on December 28, 1973, retroactively to May 1, 1973,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to include all full-time employees with one year\u2019s experience, including those paid on an hourly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">During the taxable years 1971 and 1972, six employees met the plan\u2019s eligibility criteria: the four who were originally eligible, the chairman of the board of directors,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and a foreman, who had been continuously employed by the company since the plan\u2019s inception but was not a salaried employee until after the 1962 taxable year. During the 1971 and 1972 taxable years, sixteen employees were ineligible to participate in the plan solely because they failed to satisfy the salaried-only criterion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-8\">On March 27, 1974, IRS informed the taxpayer that it was revoking, retroactively effective to May 1, 1971, its prior determination that the plan, as it stood before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>1973 amendment, was qualified. The reason given for the retroactive revocation was that the plan discriminated in favor of the officers, shareholders, supervisors, and highly-paid employees contrary to \u00a7 401(a)(3)(B).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">The taxpayer filed an action in the Tax Court to set aside the asserted deficiencies. The Tax Court sustained the disallowance of deductions under \u00a7 404(a)(3)(B), while allowing a deduction under \u00a7 404(a)(5), which applies to nonqualified plans, for most of the amount in issue for the second of the two taxable years. The resulting deficiencies amount to about $6,000 for the year ending April 30, 1971 and $500 for the second taxable year.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">The taxpayer does not question the correctness of the Commissioner\u2019s determination that the plan as it existed in the 1971 and 1972 taxable years did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 401(a)(3)(B), a determination which, in view of the statutory phrase \u201cfound by the Commissioner,\u201d should \u201cbe given a shade more than its usual substantial weight,\u201d <em>Commissioner v. Pepsi-Cola Niagara Bottling Co., </em>399 F.2d 390, 393-394 (2d Cir. 1968). Moreover, it is conceded that the Commissioner could properly have determined in either 1960 or 1962 that the plan was not qualified,' which is consistent with the taxpayer\u2019s position that no material changes occurred between 1962 and the end of the 1972 taxable year. In short, the taxpayer\u2019s argument is that the Commissioner changed his legal position when, in 1974, he revoked the earlier approval, and that he could do so only prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-8\">The Commissioner\u2019s argument is that the taxpayer could not reasonably rely upon the 1960 and 1962 determination letters in the light of a later revenue ruling published before the 1971 taxable year, Rev.Rul. 69-398, 1969-2 Cum.Bull. 58, and that in any event there was a material change in the facts, as a result of which the taxpayer could not reasonably rely on the earlier approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-12\">Section 7805(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7805(b), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1329-13\">The Secretary or his delegate may prescribe the extent, if any, to which any ruling or regulation, relating to the internal revenue laws, shall be applied without retroactive effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1329-14\">The explanation for the presumption in favor of retroactivity implied by this statutory language lies in the declaratory theory of jurisprudence on which the statute is predicated. The predecessor of \u00a7 7805(b), enacted in 1921,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was in response to a proposal the Secretary of the Treasury had made in 1919. The provision was sought because administrative rulings were viewed as merely declaring what the statute had meant all along, and therefore necessarily retroactive, and it was thought the Secretary or his delegate should have power to grant relief from retroactivity in appropriate cases. <em>See Comment, </em>\u201cLimits on Retroactive Decision Making by the Internal Revenue Service: Redefining Abuse of Discretion under Section 7805(b),\u201d 23 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 529, 532 (1976). Thus the Supreme Court has said that the provision \u201cconfirmed\u201d the Commissioner\u2019s authority to make a ruling or regulation retroactive and \u201cempowered him, in his discretion, to limit retroactive application to the extent necessary to avoid inequitable results.\u201d <em>Automobile Club of Michigan v. Commissioner, </em>353 U.S. 180, 184, 77 S.Ct. 707, 710, 1 L.Ed.2d 746 (1957). The 1921 provision, after an amendment in 1928 to permit the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>sion to relieve against retroactivity even when the different interpretation resulted from a court decision,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> has since been repeatedly reenacted without substantial change and survives today in \u00a7 7805(b). <em>See Comment, supra, </em>23 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. at 532 n. 21; <em>cf. Dixon v. United States, </em>381 U.S. 68, 71 n. 3, 85 S.Ct. 1301, 14 L.Ed.2d 223 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">The Supreme Court has held that the Commissioner has broad discretion to determine whether a ruling changing a prior ruling is to be applied retroactively. Automobile <em>Club of Michigan v. Commissioner, supra, </em>353 U.S. at 184, 77 S.Ct. 707; <em>Dixon v. United States, supra, </em>381 U.S. at 80, 85 S.Ct. 1301. Both of these cases dealt with retroactivity of changes in the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of a statute, which the Court viewed as correcting earlier \u201cmistakes of law.\u201d In <em>Automobile Club </em>the only test articulated by the Court in stating its conclusion that the Commissioner had not abused his discretion in making his ruling retroactive was whether he had \u201cdealt with petitioner upon the same basis as other automobile clubs.\u201d 353 U.S. at 186,77 S.Ct. at 711.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">In <em>Dixon, </em>after describing <em>Automobile Club </em>as holding \u201cthat the Commissioner is empowered retroactively to correct mistakes of law in the application of the tax laws to particular transactions,\u201d 381 U.S. at 72, 85 S.Ct. at 1304, the Court added that \u201c[h]e may do so even where a taxpayer may have relied to his detriment on the Commissioner\u2019s mistake,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 73, 85 S.Ct. at 1304, citing <em>Manhattan General Equipment Co. v. Commissioner, </em>297 U.S. 129, 56 S.Ct. 397, 80 L.Ed. 528 (1936). The Court went on to say,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-6\">This principle is no more than a reflection of the fact that Congress, not the Commissioner, prescribes the tax laws. The Commissioner\u2019s rulings have only such force as Congress chooses to give them, and Congress has not given them the force of law. Consequently it would appear that the Commissioner\u2019s acquiescence in an erroneous decision, published as a ruling, cannot in and of itself bar the United States from collecting a tax otherwise lawfully due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1330-9\"><em>Dixon v. United States, supra, </em>381 U.S. at 73, 85 S.Ct. at 1304. The absence of notice before the taxable event that the Commissioner had changed his position was insufficient to establish abuse of discretion, because the taxpayer was not justified in assuming the Commissioner would not make such a change. In so holding, the Court relied upon the declaratory principle of jurisprudence indorsed in <em>Manhattan General Equipment, </em>which sustained retroactive application of a change in a regulation, and quoted from that decision the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-10\">The statute defines the rights of the taxpayer and fixes a standard by which such rights are to be measured. The regulation constitutes only a step in the administrative process. It does not, and could not, alter the statute. It is no more retroactive in its operation than is a judicial determination construing and applying a statute to a case in hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1330-11\"><em>Manhattan General Equipment, </em>297 U.S. at 135, 56 S.Ct. at 400, quoted in <em>Dixon, </em>381 U.S. at 74-75, 85 S.Ct. 1301. The Court said in <em>Dixon </em>that \u201c[tjhis reasoning applies with even greater force to the Commissioner\u2019s rulings and acquiescences,\u201d and therefore, even if the acquiescence involved in that case would have relieved the taxpayer from tax liability if it had not been withdrawn, the Commissioner was not precluded \u201cfrom collecting the tax lawfully due under the statute.\u201d 381 U.S. at 75, 85 S.Ct. at 1305 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-12\">Although the Court in <em>Dixon </em>proceeded to indicate its disagreement with the taxpayer\u2019s view that the acquiescence in question would have resulted in non-taxability, it did so in ruling on the taxpayer\u2019s disparate treatment argument; and the holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>summarized above was plainly the basis on which the Court disposed of the detrimental reliance argument and was, at the very least, an alternative ground of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">Apart, therefore, from limitations the Commissioner may have voluntarily imposed on his own authority to determine the effective date of a change in the law, see part III, <em>infra, </em>neither a taxpayer\u2019s reliance to his detriment nor his good faith require the Commissioner to exercise his discretion to make a ruling prospective only.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The jurisprudential concept enunciated in <em>Manhattan General Equipment </em>and given in <em>Dixon </em>as the reason that an IRS acquiescence in a Tax Court decision could not justifiably be relied on by a taxpayer and could be retroactively withdrawn, compels the conclusion that a taxpayer is not justified in relying on an interpretative ruling of the Commissioner, and makes detrimental reliance unavailable to a taxpayer as a ground for avoiding retroactivity unless the Commissioner chooses to make it so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">There remain the questions of whether the Commissioner has limited his own power to determine the retroactive effect of rulings, and if so, whether any limitation he has adopted entitles the taxpayer to relief. The Commissioner\u2019s argument in this court is based on the assumption that he has limited his authority by the issuance of revenue procedures stating the standards by which the continuing effect of a determination letter will be judged. Those standards are in substance as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-12\">1. If a published revenue ruling is issued which is applicable to a previously approved plan, the plan, in order to retain its qualified status, must be amended to conform with that ruling during the taxable year following the one in which the ruling was issued. P.S. 35, 1944 STD. FED. TAX SERV. (CCH) \u00b6 16647, superseded January 3, 1972 by Rev.Proc. 72-6, 1972-1 Cum. Bull. 710. Thus with respect to the approved plan the revenue ruling is not given retroactive effect<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and becomes effective only at the beginning of the next taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-13\">2. If no applicable published ruling affecting the qualification of the plan has intervened between the approval and the revocation of the approval, the revocation will not have retroactive effect in the absence of certain specified circumstances. Rev.Proc. 72-3, 1972-1 Cum.Bull. 698. Because we conclude that there was an intervening revenue ruling making P.S. 35 and Rev.Proc. 72-6 applicable, it is unnecessary to consider Rev.Proc. 72-3.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>The Commissioner argues that an applicable revenue ruling was issued prior to the beginning of the taxpayer\u2019s taxable year ending April 30, 1971, and that the taxpayer was therefore required to amend its plan during that taxable year to comply with the ruling. The ruling relied upon is Rev.Rul. 69-398, 1969-2 Cum.Bull. 58. Based on Judge Friendly\u2019s decision in <em>Commissioner v. Pepsi-Cola Niagara Bottling Corp., </em>399 F.2d 390 (2d Cir. 1968), the ruling describes a profit-sharing plan for the benefit of full-time salaried employees strikingly similar to the one in the case at bar.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Citing the <em>Pepsi-Cola Niagara Bottling </em>case, the ruling held that because \u201call participants except the one who is the lowest paid are highly compensated in this particular company and therefore members of the group in whose favor discrimination is prohibited,\u201d it followed \u201cthat the coverage classification . does not meet the requirements of \u00a7 401(a)(3)(B) of the Code since it results in discrimination in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, supervisors, or highly compensated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">The arguments of the taxpayer in the case at bar that Rev.Rul. 69-398 is distinguishable do not merit discussion in this opinion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is sufficient to say that it seems to us that if the plan described in the ruling did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 401(a)(3)(B), <em>a fortiori </em>the same is true of the plan of the taxpayer here. Compare note 7 with note 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">Thus, the taxpayer was required under P.S. 35 to conform its plan to the requirements of the ruling in the taxable year ending April 30,1971, and the same requirement was imposed by Rev.Proc. 72-6 for the taxable year ending April 30, 1972. Having failed to meet this requirement, the determination letters the taxpayer had received in 1960 and 1962 were no longer effective. Because the taxpayer had failed to take advantage of the grace period the Commissioner had allowed in P.S. 35 and Rev.Proc. 72-6 for compliance with the revenue ruling, the Commissioner\u2019s self-imposed limitations no longer impaired his power to determine the effective date of the revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-7\">In the view we take of the ease it is unnecessary to determine whether, as the Tax Court found and the Commissioner argues before us, the fifty percent increase in employee coverage, with the increase exclusively to members of the suspect class, constituted a material change of facts between the dates of the issuance of the determination letters and the taxable years in question. Such a determination, and hence the applicability of Rev.Proc. 72-3, \u00a7 13.05(2), would be necessary only if we had found that Rev.Rul. 69-398 was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>Apart from the doctrinal underpinnings of the Commissioner\u2019s broad power to determine retroactivity and his compliance with his own self-imposed limitations on that power, we are not convinced that the taxpayer has been unfairly treated in this case. Nothing requires the Commissioner to issue an opinion with respect to the qualification of a taxpayer\u2019s profit-sharing plan. It is not unreasonable for him to charge a taxpayer receiving the benefit of such an opinion with the responsibility of keeping abreast of current developments in the law to be assured that his plan is still in compliance. Moreover, a taxpayer may avoid any uncertainty about whether his plan is qualified by bringing it within the \u201csafe-harbor\u201d provisions of \u00a7 401(a)(3)(A), which unequivocally qualify plans meeting certain percentage requirements. Accordingly, even if we had considerably more supervisory authority over the Commissioner\u2019s exercise of discretion than we do, we would not find that discretion to have been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"aql-dedup-0\">.

The taxpayer relies upon decisions of courts of appeals antedating <em>Dixon </em>for the propositions that taxpayer bad faith is essential before retroactivity may be ordered, <em>Lesavoy Foundation v. Commissioner, </em>238 F.2d 589, 591-592 (3d Cir. 1956), and that a Commissioner is bound by a plan approval issued by his predecessor and cannot withdraw the approval absent a material change of fact, <em>H.S.D. Co. v. Kavanagh, </em>191 F.2d 831, 846 (6th Cir. 1951); <em>Time Oil Co. v. Commissioner, </em>258 F.2d 237, 238 (9th Cir. 1958).

Both P.S. 35 and Rev.Proc. 72-6 avoid any problem of retroactivity with respect to the portion of the taxable year antedating the ruling by making the ruling inapplicable until the following taxable year.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1331-15\">.

The Commissioner does not contend that material facts have been misstated or omitted. The only claimed change in the applicable law is the issuance of a revenue ruling in 1969, which would make P.S. 35 and Rev.Proc. 72-6 applicable rather than Rev.Proc. 72-3 and its predecessor. Condition (4) was met in the case at bar, and there seems to be no question that condition (5) is satisfied.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1332-10\">.
