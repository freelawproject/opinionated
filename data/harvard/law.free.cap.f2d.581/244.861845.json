United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974), Mr. Justice Brennan expressed the foreboding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-22\">The 1958 amendments to \u00a7 1461 constituted the mailing of obscene matter a continuing offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237. The practical effect of this amendment \u2014 intentionally adopted by Congress for that express purpose \u2014 is to permit prosecution \u201cin the Federal district in which [the disseminator] mailed the obscenity, in the Federal district in which the obscenity was received, or in any Federal district through which the obscenity passed while it was on its route through the mails.\u201d . . . Under today\u2019s \u201clocal\u201d standards construction, therefore, the guilt or innocence of distributors of identical materials mailed from the same locale can now turn on the chancy course of transit or place of delivery of the materials. See <em>United States v. Palladino, </em>490 F.2d 499, 503 (CA1 1974) (Coffin, C. J.). National distributors choosing to send their products in interstate travels will be forced to cope with the community standards of every hamlet into which their goods may wander. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>cause these variegated standards are impossible to discern, national distributors, fearful of risking the expense and difficulty of defending against prosecution in any of several remote communities, must inevitably be led to retreat to debilitating self-censorship that abridges the First Amendment rights of the people. For it \u201cwould tend to restrict the public\u2019s access to forms [of sexually oriented materials] which the [United States] could not constitutionally suppress directly a censorship . . . hardly less virulent for being privately administered[, for] [t]hrough it, the distribution of all [sexually oriented materials], both obscene and not obscene, would be impeded.\u201d <em>Smith v. California, </em>361 U.S. 147, 154 [80 S.Ct. 215, 4 L.Ed.2d 205] (1959). Thus, the people of many communities will be \u201cprotected\u201d far beyond government\u2019s constitutional power to deny them access to sexually oriented materials. A construction that has such consequences necessarily renders the constitutionality of amended \u00a7 1461 facially suspect under the First Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 143-45, 94 S.Ct. at 2920-2921 (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The case we have before us today illustrates that the foreboding has turned to reality.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant distributor of published materials resided in Oregon, a state where the \u201ccommunity standard\u201d seems more tolerant of varying personal habits than most.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record does not reflect that defendant ever resided, traveled through, or had any business contacts in the State of Wyoming prior to the time when an Oregon postmaster asked a Wyoming postmaster to use a false name and address to solicit by mail materials distributed by defendant. This communication between postmasters was made for no apparent reason other than a subjective judgment that a Wyoming venire would hold a more restrictive \u201ccommunity standard.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant willingly responded to the mail order requests of Wyoming postal officials. On 17 occasions over a three year period, he mailed advertisements giving information where, how, and from whom allegedly obscene materials could be obtained. On three occasions in the same time period he mailed such materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">Defendant\u2019s only contacts with the State of Wyoming were those initiated and pursued by Federal postal authorities in Wyoming. Based solely on these contacts, defendant was indicted on 20 counts of violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461 (1976) in an action brought in Wyoming Federal District Court. Facing the prospect of prosecution before a Wyoming jury on all 20 counts under Wyoming community standards of obscenity, defendant pleaded guilty to one count and reserved an appeal on the legality of this prosecution. The government dismissed the remaining 19 counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">On appeal defendant complains that the liberal venue provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237 (1976) compounded by the application of local obscenity standards under <em>Hamling </em>deprive him of due process. Yet, so long as <em>Hamling </em>is the law,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> publishers and distrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>utors everywhere<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who are willing to fill subscriptions nationwide are subject to the creative zeal of federal enforcement officers who are free both to shop for the venue from which juries with the most restrictive views are likely to be impanelled and to select for prosecution the materials, publishers and distributors which their subjective judgment dictates.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">WILLIAM E. DOYLE, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">. <em>See United States v. Dost, </em>575 F.2d 1303 (10th Cir. 1978), where the same enforcement and venue shopping technique was used to elect New Mexico substantive law over California law on obscenity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-9\">. For example, Oregon is one of only a handful of states which have decriminalized the possession and use of small quantities of marijuana. 1977 Or.Laws ch. 745, \u00a7 54 repealed Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 167.207(3), 167.217, effective July 1, 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b337-10\">. For example, in contrast to those states which have decriminalized the use of marijuana, Wyoming law continues to make possession and use of small quantities of marijuana a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or a fine of not more than $100, or both. Wyo.Stat. \u00a7 35-347.39 (Supp.1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b337-17\">. The majority in <em>Hamling </em>expressly rejected the arguments of Justice Brennan, although the question of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237 was not directly at issue in that suit brought in the same district from which the nonmailable materials were sent. The majority opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-18\">Our Brother Brennan suggests in dissent that in holding that a federal obscenity case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>may be tried on local community standards, we do violence both to congressional prerogative and to the Constitution. Both of these arguments are foreclosed by our decision last Term in <em>United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, supra </em>[413 U.S. 123, 93 S.Ct. 2665, 37 L.Ed.2d 500], that the <em>Miller </em>standards <em>[Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419], including the \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d formulation, applied to federal legislation. The fact that distributors of allegedly obscene materials may be subjected to varying community standards in the various federal judicial districts into which they transmit the materials does not render a federal statute unconstitutional because of the failure of application of uniform national standards of obscenity. Those same distributors may be subjected to such varying degrees of criminal liability in prosecutions by the States for violations of state obscenity statutes; we see no constitutional impediment to a similar rule for federal prosecutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">418 U.S. at 106, 94 S.Ct. at 2902. In addition to <em>Hamiing, </em>lower federal courts that have spoken to this issue have unanimously concluded that it is both permissible and logical to try a defendant in the district to which he allegedly mailed obscene materials. <em>United States v.
