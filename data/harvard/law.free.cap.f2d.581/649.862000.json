Fernandez went first to the Chicago Economic Development Corporation (CED-CO), funded in part by the federal Model Cities Program and functioning to assist small businessmen in obtaining SBA guaranteed loans through local banks. CEDCO prepared a loan package for Fernandez and submitted it to the First National Bank of Chicago, which then applied to SBA for a 90% guarantee. The loan was an economic opportunity loan \u2014 a special type for economically disadvantaged individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">On August 19, 1975, Arroyo \u2014 a loan officer with SBA<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 received the Fernandez application, for review of its credit worthiness and presentation to his supervisor, who relied upon Arroyo\u2019s recommendations in determining whether an applicant should receive a guaranteed loan. The loan received SBA authorization on August 26, 1975, but Fernandez was not told of that until later.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">On August 27, 1975, Fernandez\u00bb went to see Sanchez, a business counselor at CED-CO, who told Fernandez the bank had approved the loan, but that there would be no money until SBA authorization was received. Sanchez said the only person who could help Fernandez was Arroyo, and arranged for Fernandez to dine with Arroyo the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">On August 28, 1975, Fernandez went to CEDCO to meet Arroyo. Sanchez told Fernandez to pick up Arroyo at his home, giving him the address. Fernandez picked up Arroyo and Arroyo\u2019s son, and the three dined at a restaurant. Arroyo and Fernandez discussed the loan application. When Fernandez asked about the delay, Arroyo repeated several times that Fernandez \u201cdid not have any problems\u201d because \u201che [Arroyo] had it [the loan application].\u201d When Fernandez asked if it would cost him anything, Arroyo told him to see Sanchez the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">On August 29, 1975, Fernandez went to CEDCO and related to Sanchez the previous night\u2019s conversation. When Sanchez asked Fernandez the amount of the loan, Fernandez replied $35,000.\u201d When Fernandez asked how much it would cost, Sanchez said \u201csome of the people had paid different amounts.\u201d Sanchez then mentioned to Fernandez \u201ca different amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">About two or three days later (i. e., on August 31 or September 1), the bank told Fernandez that the SBA had authorized only $5,000. Prior to Christmas, 1975, Fernandez met Sanchez at CEDCO, and Sanchez asked him if he had paid Arroyo $800. When Fernandez replied that he had not because of problems in getting the loan proceeds, Sanchez indicated that' things would be \u201cconvenient or better\u201d if Fernandez paid the $800.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-14\">SBA records indicated a January 8, 1976, disbursement of $20,000 and a February 10, 1976, disbursement of $10,000 to Fernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-15\">On March 15, 1976, Fernandez returned from a trip to Puerto Rico and spoke with Sanchez, who told him Arroyo wanted to speak with him about \u201cthe money\u201d and to collect \u201cthe eight.\u201d Immediately thereafter, Arroyo called Fernandez and said he was going to stop by the next day about 5:00 p. m., \u201cto pick up the money.\u201d Fernandez reported the situation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-16\">On March 16, 1976, FBI agents installed \u2022 sound recording equipment at Fernandez\u2019 place of business, gave Fernandez $500 in marked bills, and waited for Arroyo. About five minutes before Arroyo arrived, Sanchez called Fernandez and said Arroyo was on his way. Arroyo arrived between 5:00 p. m. and 5:30 p. m. Before Fernandez gave Arroyo the $500, a conversation occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-17\">\u201cFernandez: How much do I have to give you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Arroyo: Well, whatever you told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">Fernandez: How much was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">Arroyo: 800.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Acknowledging that $800 was the agreed figure, Fernandez said he could pay only $500 because of business problems and this discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">\u201cFernandez: I have had a million problems here. Well, you know how it is. It is so bad, that you are going to have, you\u2019re going to have to approve another loan of 35,000 pesos for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">Arroyo: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">*******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">Fernandez: How much does people pay up to for around 35,000 pesos?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-11\">Arroyo: It depends on the case my brother, or how much difficulty one has. * * * You must understand, there isn\u2019t, there is no fixed rate, besides, you were the one who set the rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-12\">Fernandez: Yes, no, listen, that * * * it wasn\u2019t me! He set it, Frank [Sanchez] did. No, you must understand how it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-13\">Arroyo: I don\u2019t know. I know only what you told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-14\">Fernandez: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-15\">Fernandez thanked Arroyo for his work on the loan. Arroyo said that if Fernandez wanted additional money, he should see Sanchez and have him prepare another application, because there was an excess of funds at the end of the fiscal year.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-16\">Fernandez gave Arroyo the $500 and Arroyo put the money in his coat pocket. As Arroyo was leaving, Special Agent Gregorio Rodriguez of the FBI arrested him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-17\">SBA records indicated that Fernandez was unable to repay the loan and in May, 1977, the SBA purchased it from the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-18\">\n<em>The District Court\u2019s Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b744-19\">The material portions of the jury charge are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-20\">\u201cAs used in this section [\u00a7 201(c)(1)], the term \u2018official act\u2019 means any decision or act or any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy which may at any time be pending or which may, by law, be brought before any public official in his official capacity or in his place of trust or profit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-23\">*******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-24\">\u201cIn order for the crime of bribery to be committed, it is not necessary that the public official actually have the power to perform the act that he promises in return for the money. What is necessary is that the public official solicit or receive the money on the representation that the money is for the purpose of influencing his performance of some official act.\u201d *******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-25\">\u201c[T]he government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements: One, that the defendant Anthony Arroyo was during the time charged in the indictment a public official as defined in the law; namely, a loan officer of the United States Small Business Administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-26\">\u201cTwo, that the defendant Anthony Arroyo did corruptly ask, demand, exact, solicit, seek, accept, receive and agree to receive money from Orlando Fernandez. And that three, that the defendant Anthony Arroyo represented or caused to be represented to Orlando Fernandez that this money was in return for Anthony Arroyo\u2019s being influenced in his performance of an official act as that term has previously been defined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-27\">\n<em>The Defendants\u2019 Requested Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b744-28\">The district court refused this requested instruction, which paraphrases the language of the court in <em>Woelfel v. United States, </em>237 F.2d 484, 488 (4th Cir. 1956):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-29\">\u201cIf you believe that the defendants\u2019 requests for or solicitations of the gratuity were not made until after the employee had exhausted his power of decision or action in connection with the loan and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>were not made under any prior promise or understanding that a gratuity would be forthcoming, then the defendants\u2019 actions did not constitute a transgression and you must find them not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">\n<em>Appellants' Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AWKh\">Arroyo and Sanchez contend that it is not a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c)(1), <em>supra </em>note 1, to solicit or accept money when the solicitation activity commenced after the public official had completely performed his official action. They quote from <em>Woelfel v. United States, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">\u201cHowever, the defendant was entitled to have the jury instructed on the legal effect of his contention for the evidence\u2014 that if they believed that the request for a gratuity was not made by the accused until after he had exhausted his power of decision or action on the question or matter before him, and was not made under any prior promise -or understanding that a gratuity would be forthcoming, then his request did not constitute a transgression of the statute. This is a sound construction of the act and the District Judge should have so charged the jury. While such a solicitation would be contemptible, it would not be indictable, for it would not be possible for prior \u2018decision or action\u2019 of an employee to be affected by later, unanticipated gifts, however rewarding they might be.\u201d [237 F.2d at 488.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Further, Arroyo and Sanchez assert that Arroyo may have solicited a gratuity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(g) (1976),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but not a bribe, in violation of \u00a7 201(c)(1), quoting from <em>United States v. Brewster, </em>165 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 7, 506 F.2d 62, 68 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"apo-dedup-0\">\u201c3. The bribery section (c)(1) prohibits the receipt of anything of value \u2018in return for: (1) being influenced in his performance of any official act,\u2019 while the gratuity section (g) prohibits the receipt of anything of value \u2018for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by him.\u2019 * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">\u201c4. The gratuity section (g), unlike the bribery section (c), applies to past official acts as well as future ones. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">Whether the district court erred, in denying the motions for acquittal and refusing the requested instruction, turns on the underlying question of whether \u00a7 201(c)(1) is applicable only to bribery solicitations occurring before actual performance of the official act intended to be influenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">We hold that the district court did not err. Further, we hold that the jury instruction given by the district court accurately stated the law. Section 201(c)(1) cannot be limited in every case to bribery solicitations occurring before actual performance of the official act without destroying the intent of the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-17\">Arroyo and Sanchez\u2019 contentions, if accepted, would encourage the very conduct Congress condemned. Under the proffered interpretation, a public official could hurriedly and surreptitiously perform his official act, and then corruptly solicit and en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>courage the bribe, by creating the impression in the potential briber\u2019s mind that his official act had not yet been taken.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">That is what Arroyo did here. Dealing with a loan program for the economically disadvantaged, Arroyo approved Fernandez\u2019 credit worthiness without ever talking with him about the loan and within a few days of receiving the loan application. The loan was authorized on August 26, 1975. Yet on August 28, 1975, when Fernandez asked about the delay of the loan, Arroyo expressly and falsely represented that \u201che had it,\u201d creating the false impression that the application was still pending before him. Fernandez, an unsophisticated immigrant to our shores, and seeking to enter the economic mainstream as a small business entrepreneur, could have gained no other impression. Indeed, the most sophisticated native-born could have gained no other. Then, when Fernandez asked if it would \u201ccost\u201d him, Arroyo did not say, \u201cNo, of course not. You are dealing with the United States Government and we don\u2019t do things that way,\u201d or words to that effect. Arroyo said, \u201cSee Sanchez.\u201d The return-for-being-influenced element of the offense was correctly stated by the district court in its jury charge: \u201cthat the defendant Anthony Arroyo represented or caused to be represented to Orlando Fernandez that this money was in return for Anthony Arroyo\u2019s being influenced in his performance of an official act, as that term has previously been defined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">The operative language of \u00a7 201(c)(1) is \u201c[wjhoever, being a public official * * * corruptly * * * solicits * * * anything of value for himself * * * in return for * * * being influenced in his performance of any official act.\u201d \u201cOfficial act\u201d is defined in \u00a7 201(a), <em>supra </em>note 2, as \u201cany * * * action * * * which may <em>at any time </em>be pending * * * before any public official, in his official capacity * * (Emphasis added.) Congress having used broad language in these provisions, we find no intent to limit their coverage to future acts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Congress did not intend for a public official, who had solicited and encouraged a bribe with a false representation that the official act was <em>in futuro, </em>to escape liability for bribe-solicitation by proving that he had successfully hidden the truth of past performance from the bribe-payer.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">Arroyo and Sanchez seize upon the words \u201cbeing influenced\u201d as indicating that \u00a7 201(c)(1) requires that the bribe be paid to influence a future act, arguing that one cannot be influenced to do what has already been done. The argument is without merit in this case, for it disregards the lead-in phrase \u201cin return for.\u201d That phrase brings into play the purpose of the bribe and thus the mind of the bribe-payer. Though more careful draftsmanship might have added \u201cor apparently being\u201d after \u201cbeing,\u201d the section prohibits solicitation of payment \u201cin return for being influenced.\u201d As illustrated by \u00a7 201(c), the gravamen of the offense lies in the corrupt solicitation, which would fail if the solicitee were told the truth.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Bribes are paid, and solicited, in exchange for what the payer believes he is paying for. The bribe solicitor will always create the impression that the action sought is yet to come and is contingent on the bribe. The solicitation, against which the section is directed, is the same, whether the yet-to-come impression be objectively true or false. Further, \u00a7 201(c)(1), in listing one of the \u201cin return for\u201d elements, speaks of <em>\u201cbeing </em>influenced <em>in </em>his performance of any official act\u201d (emphasis added). It does not speak of \u201cbeing influenced- <em>to </em>perform any official act.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The broad language of the statute, and the purpose it was designed to accomplish,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> preclude the narrow construction sought by Arroyo and Sanchez.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Arroyo and Sanchez\u2019 reliance on <em>Woelfel </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>is misplaced.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Unlike Fernandez here, the person solicited by Woelfel knew of the performance of the official act (a change order in a government contract) at the time of Woelfel\u2019s initial, solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Unlike the situation before us, there was no false representation by the government official in <em>Woelfel </em>that he \u201chad\u201d the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>still in his control, and no belief on the part of the potential bribe-payer that he was being solicited in return for Woelfel\u2019s being influenced to do a future act. Hence <em>Woel-fel </em>is distinguishable on its facts. Further, the distinction highlights the misrepresentation element. The bribe-solicitee in <em>Woel-fel, </em>Potter, gave Woelfel \u201cno answer.\u201d Nor is that reaction surprising. Potter knew that the official act had been performed, and that anything he gave \u201clater on\u201d would necessarily be a gratuity. The solicitation in <em>Woelfel </em>was clearly for a gratuity, which Potter could safely ignore. The solicitation in the case before us was clearly for a bribe, i. e., \u201cfor being influenced in his performance,\u201d which Fernandez was led to believe he could ignore only at peril to his loan. When the official act has actually been performed at the time of the solicitation, the distinction between the facts of this case and those of <em>Woelfel, </em>and the distinction between \u00a7 201(c)(1) and \u00a7 201(g) as well, lies in the nature of the solicitation. Here it was corrupt as the jury found. In <em>Woelfel, </em>it was not. The difference lies in the understanding of Fernandez, created by Sanchez and Arroyo, that the act was yet to be performed, and the understanding of Potter created by Woelfel, that the act had been performed. The opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">\u201cThe prosecution\u2019s case begins in December, 1954, with a proposal initiated by the officer in charge to amend the prime contract so as to substitute wood block flooring for the resilient floor covering originally specified. He directed Woelfel to ascertain the cost of a wood replacement and in this way Woelfel met the representatives, including one Potter, of a wood flooring company of Georgia. On January 3, 1955 Potter brought samples of his employer\u2019s product to Charlotte and discussed them with Woelfel. Satisfied that the wood blocks should make a more serviceable flooring and mean a substantial monetary saving, the officer in charge ordered the defendant to write the Corps of Engineers recommending the change. This Woelfel did on January 5 and promptly the change was accepted by the Engineer Corps. A chronicle of the defendant\u2019s subsequent behavior gives in narrow focus the Government\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">\u201cJanuary <em>7 </em>\u2014 Woelfel <em>by telephone informed Potter, at his residence in Atlanta, that apparently the specification would be changed to wood block flooring, </em>and when Potter commented, \u2018That\u2019s fine,\u2019 Woelfel said, \u2018Yes, but I want something more than \u201cthat\u2019s fine\u201d later on. Do you know what I mean?\u2019 Potter gave him no answer.\u201d [237 F.2d at 485-86, emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Arroyo and Sanchez\u2019 reliance on <em>United States v. Brewster, supra, </em>is equally misplaced. First, the portion of the opinion they quoted (and quoted above) is part of defendant Brewster\u2019s <em>argument to </em>the appellate court. Second, the court did not say in its opinion that it \u201caccepted and agreed with this distinction\u201d as Arroyo and Sanchez maintain. Third, and most significant, <em>Brewster </em>did not involve a misrepresentation that a past official act was <em>in futuro. </em>Arroyo and Sanchez\u2019 attempt to take the quoted portion of the <em>Brewster </em>opinion out of context, and to apply it to a different set of facts, must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">The opinion in <em>Brewster </em>did, however, set forth the many distinctions between \u00a7 201(c)(1) and \u00a7 201(g), pointing out that the primary distinction lies in the requisite degree of criminal intent (165 U.S.App.D.C. at 10, 506 F.2d at 71):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">\u201cThe requisite intent to constitute accepting a bribe is to accept a thing of value \u2018corruptly\u2019 under section (c)(1); the comparable intent under the gratuity section (g) is to accept a thing of value \u2018otherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty.\u2019 On the face of the statute the two comparative clauses are not equivalents. Congress did not use the same language in defining criminal intent for the two offenses. \u2018Corruptly\u2019 bespeaks a higher degree of criminal knowledge and purpose than does \u2018otherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty.\u2019 It appears entirely possible that a public official could accept a thing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>value \u2018otherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty,\u2019 and at the same time not do it \u2018corruptly.\u2019 Congress obviously wished to prohibit public officials accepting things of value with either degree of criminal intent; it did so, but it legislated a difference in the requisite criminal intent and correspondingly in the penalties attached.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai54\">The jury found, and its finding is not contested before us, that the bribe solicitation was here made with the requisite corrupt intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Section 201(c)(1), not \u00a7 201(g), is applicable to the facts of this case.

The solicitation here began within about 24 hours (Sanchez) or 48 hours (Arroyo) after the undisclosed performance of Arroyo\u2019s official act. As discussed in the text, the test is not whether the official act was actually performed one day or one minute before or after the solicitation, but whether the solicitation was corrupt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\">. The dissenting opinion correctly states that criminal statutes must be strictly interpreted. To hold, however, that 201(c)(1) is applicable when the bribe solicitor has hidden the fact that official action is no longer pending does not expand that section beyond its literal meaning. Reading, as we must, the \u00a7 201(a) definition of \u201cofficial act\u201d into \u00a7 201(c)(1), as indicated in the text, makes \u00a7 201(c)(1) applicable to every public official who corruptly solicits anything of value in return for being influenced in his performance of any action which may <em>at any time </em>be pending. The mere presence of the word \u201cperformed\u201d in \u00a7 201(g) cannot be viewed as so limiting \u00a7 201(c)(1) as to immunize from prosecution thereunder the corrupt solicitation of payment for what everyone but the solicitor believes to be a bribe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b746-14\">. The dissenting opinion states that \u201ca bribery statute is designed to prevent official decisions made as the result of corrupt influence.\u201d We view the statute as designed to prevent corrupt solicitation by government officials. The distinction between \u00a7 201(c)(1) and \u00a7 201(g) lies in <em>what </em>is solicited, the former prohibiting solici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>tation of bribes, the latter prohibiting solicitation of gratuities. Whether the solicitation succeed or fail, and whether the official act had been secretly performed, cannot change what was solicited. The dissenting opinion appears to recognize that whether the official act could be influenced is irrelevant in prosecution of a bribe payer under \u00a7 201(b), i. e., that Fernandez (had he not reported to the FBI) could have been prosecuted for paying the bribe sought here, but then suggests that Arroyo could not be prosecuted under \u00a7 201(c)(1) for soliciting the same bribe. The view that \u00a7 201(c)(1) merely seeks to shield <em>decisions resulting </em>from influence, would appear to create an absolute defense for an official, who solicits a bribe before he acts, but who can prove his decision was not influenced because he would have made the same decision in any event, for the official whose bribe solicitation was refused and whose decision favorable to the solicitee could not then have been influenced, and for the soliciting official who (unknown to the briber) has no authority whatever to decide, and does not in fact decide, anything in the premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b747-6\">. If the focus be on the sole fact that the official act has already been performed, it is impossible on that ground alone to distinguish \u00a7 201(c)(1) from \u00a7 201(g), which encompasses solicitation \u201cfor or because of any official act * * * to be performed.\u201d Distinctions between \u00a7 201(c) and \u00a7 201(g) appear in the differing language employed by the Congress. The latter section includes \u201cotherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty\u201d and \u201cfor or because of any official act performed or to be performed by him.\u201d The former includes \u201cfor himself or for any other person or entity\u201d and, of primary importance, the word \u201ccorruptly\u201d (see discussion re <em>Brewster </em>in text, <em>infra </em>).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">.

Obviously no one would give or offer a bribe unless he expected to gain some advantage thereby, and since attempting to gain an advantage by this means is the evil which the statute is designed to prevent, it can make no difference if after the act is done the doer discovers that for some reason or another, be it a mistake on his part or mistake on the part of some officer or agency of the United States, there was actually no occasion for him to have done it.\u201d [235 F.2d at 125.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8c\">The \u201cconsequences of corruption in the public service\u201d are equally evil where, as here, the public <em>official </em>solicits the bribe and the bribe solicitee believes the public official is being influenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b747-12\">. Arroyo and Sanchez cite no legislative history supporting a narrow construction and we have found none. On the contrary, when the present statute was enacted in 1962 (Act of October 23, 1962, Pub.L.

Arroyo\u2019s supervisor concurred in that recommendation on the same day. The loan application was then processed through usual channels and the money eventually paid to Fernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">On August 27 Arroyo\u2019s codefendant, Sanchez, talked to Fernandez and arranged for him to see Arroyo. Fernandez first met Arroyo on August 28, two days after Arroyo had recommended approval of the loan. Thus, Arroyo\u2019s authority to take official action with regard to the loan application had been exercised and terminated before any attempt was made by either Sanchez or Arroyo to solicit a bribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">Two sections of the statute which deal with bribery, sections 201(b) and (c), are parallel provisions which prohibit the request for and giving of bribes. Two other sections, (f) and (g), also parallel provisions, cover the giving and receipt of gratuities. It is most important to distinguish properly between the bribery and gratuity sections, a distinction made in the statute but not in the majority\u2019s opinion. Although both types of activity are prohibited under the statute, bribery is clearly considered to be the more serious offense as evidenced by the difference in penalties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-17\">The bribery sections punish those who would substitute the wishes of an interested party for the \u201cobjective evaluation and unbiased judgment on the part of those who participate in the making of official decisions.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Labovitz, </em>251 F.2d 393, 394 (3d Cir. 1958).

United States, </em>133 F.2d 235 (1st Cir. 1942). Similarly, a public official charged with violating section 201(c) must intend to corruptly solicit something of value <em>in return for </em>being influenced, that is, intend to permit himself to be influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>enced. <em>United States v. Irwin, </em>354 F.2d 192, 195-96 (2d Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>383 U.S. 967, 86 S.Ct. 1272, 16 L.Ed.2d 308 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">In the case at bar, Arroyo\u2019s part in the decision-making process had already been completed at the time it was represented that a bribe might bring about a favorable decision. No evidence was introduced to show that Arroyo could in any way have altered or influenced the decision that had already been made. The matter was completely out of his hands. It therefore follows that he did not have the requisite intent necessary for a conviction under section 201(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In <em>Woelfel v. United States, </em>237 F.2d 484, 488 (4th Cir. 1956), the Fourth Circuit held that where a federal government employee\u2019s requests for a payment \u201cwas not made until after [the employee] had exhausted his power of decision or action on the question or matter before him, and was not made under any prior promise or understanding that a gratuity would be forthcoming,\u201d the request did not constitute a violation of the bribery statute. I would follow the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Both Arroyo and Sanchez misrepresented, implicitly if not explicitly, that the decision on the loan application was still pending, but that misrepresentation was made to Fernandez <em>after </em>the application was approved. I emphasize again that a bribery statute is designed to prevent official decisions made as a result of corrupt influence. Accordingly, when a public official represents to a prospective briber that a decision is still pending when in fact it has already been made, the misrepresentation takes on the character of fraudulent conduct, but it does not constitute solicitation of a bribe as defined by section 201(c)(1). The language of that section is plain and unambiguous. Its literal meaning ought not be expanded by interpretation as the majority has done, for it is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that a criminal statute must be strictly construed. <em>United States v.
