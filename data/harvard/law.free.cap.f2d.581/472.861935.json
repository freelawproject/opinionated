R. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-25\">This appeal marks the second time this case has reached our Court. This Court, sitting <em>en bane, </em>affirmed the June 27,1975, judgment of the District Court. <em>Brown v. Dade Christian Schools, Inc., </em>556 F.2d 310 (5th Cir. 1977) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1063, 98 S.Ct. 1235, 55 L.Ed.2d 763 (1978), <em>discussed in </em>91 <em>Harv.L.Rev. </em>879 (1978).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant now asks us to review the District Court\u2019s denial of a motion which requested both the vacation of the District Court\u2019s June 27, 1975, judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6) and the award of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-26\">In effect, Appellant asks us to <em>reverse </em>the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to va<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>cate the June 27, 1975, judgment and the request for attorney\u2019s fees because of this Court\u2019s <em>affirmance </em>of that same judgment. The District Court\u2019s holding was predicated on a finding that the beliefs underlying Dade Christian\u2019s admissions policy were part of a social policy or philosophy and were not part of the free exercise of religion protected under the First Amendment. <em>Brown v. Dade Christian Schools, Inc., </em>556 F.2d at 311. Appellant now urges that, since a majority (7) of the judges of this Court who considered the issue (12) seemed to disapprove of the District Court\u2019s finding, the District Court abused its discretion in denying the motion to vacate the June 27, 1975, judgment and the request for attorney\u2019s fees, on remand. First, Appellant contends that the disagreement of the majority of those judges of this Court who considered the issue is a \u201creason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment\u201d for which relief is provided in Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). Second, Appellant contends that it qualifies as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988, since the majority of those judges of this Court who considered the issue disagreed with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Appellant\u2019s self-styled \u201cnovel\u201d theory of \u201cfirst impression,\u201d Brief of Appellant at iii, is beyond the threshold of absurdity. What this Court says in the opinions in a particular case is not as important to the particular litigants as what this Court actually <em>does </em>with the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court affirmed the June 27, 1975, judgment of the District Court. <em>Brown v. Dade Christian Schools, Inc., </em>556 F.2d at 314. The fact that this Court could not agree on a unanimous rationale cannot possibly be a reason for later challenging the very judgment affirmed. <em>Cf. Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (Each of five Justices in majority separately concurred with an opinion); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>537 F.2d 227, 228 (5th Cir. 1976) (affirmance by an equally divided Court) and cases cited. Appellant was not the prevailing party, and therefore his claim for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">To state Appellant\u2019s contentions is to refute them. Therefore, the appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-27\">. Here, we need not restate the facts which are well-stated in the <em>en banc </em>opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b565-5\">. <em>See Wilson v. First Houston Investment Corp., </em>566 F.2d 1235, 1244-45 n.l (5th Cir. 1978) (Hill, J., dissenting) (\u201cIt may be that what we do speaks so loudly that no one will hear what we say.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
