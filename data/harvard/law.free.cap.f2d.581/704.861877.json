These charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>arise from Wright\u2019s possession of a single sawed-off Stevens Model 940E .20 gauge shotgun. The weapon was found in a Lincoln-Continental being driven by Wright after the ear was stopped by Waterloo, Iowa police officers who were investigating an armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Prior to trial, Wright moved to suppress the testimony of the police officers and any contraband or evidence seized by them prior to, during, or subsequent to his arrest. In his motion, he contended that there were no reasonable grounds for stopping him and that there was no probable cause for seizure of the weapon. The motion was denied and Wright filed a motion to reconsider. Following the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty, the district court reconsidered its denial of the motion to suppress, reversed its previous position thereon, and granted Wright\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. The United States appealed. After examining the fourth amendment question in detail, a panel of this court vacated the district court\u2019s order granting Wright\u2019s motion to suppress and his motion for judgment of acquittal, reversed the judgment of acquittal, reinstated the jury\u2019s verdict, and remanded the case for sentencing. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>565 F.2d 486 (8th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 974, 98 S.Ct. 1621, 56 L.Ed.2d 67 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">On remand, the district court sentenced Wright to five years on Count I, two years on Count II to run consecutively to the term on Count I, and to three ten year terms on Counts III-V to run concurrently with each other, but consecutively to the sentences imposed on Counts I and II. After sentencing, Wright took this timely appeal. Two issues are presented for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">First, the sole issue raised in the brief filed by Wright\u2019s attorney is that the motion to suppress should have been granted for the same reasons previously found unpersuasive by this court. Our prior decision constitutes the law of the case and relitigation of this issue is precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Second, Wright has filed a pro se brief on appeal, in which he contends that it is impermissible to impose consecutive sentences for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h) and a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(b), (c) and (d), when those violations arise from a common factual basis, because of a congressional intent that these crimes not be cumulatively punished.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although we are of the opinion that Wright\u2019s contention is without merit, it does require some brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Wright does not contend that cumulative punishment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861 violates double jeopardy protections. Any such argument would be unpersuasive in view of <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). In <em>Blockburger, </em>the Court held that \u201c[t]he applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the,other does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182. Under the <em>Blockburger </em>test, there can be no doubt that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h) creates an offense separate and distinct from those defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(b), (c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">As the Supreme Court has recently noted, however, there may be instances where Congress, although constitutionally free to impose cumulative punishments under the <em>Blockburger </em>test, may have expressed its intention not to do so. <em>See Simpson v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 913, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978). It is to this proposition that Wright\u2019s argument is directed. His contention, in essence, is that both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861 were enacted for the purpose of keeping firearms out of the hands of the \u201cgangster\u201d element. From this same \u201cgeneral deterrence,\u201d Wright would have us conclude that Congress did not intend to allow cumulative punishment for violations of these two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>We find Wright\u2019s contention to be without merit. We have examined, in detail, the legislative history of these statutes and we are unable to find any indication that Congress intended to prohibit cumulative punishment for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861. The present case is thus readily distinguishable from <em>Simpson v. United States, supra, </em>and <em>United States v. Eagle, </em>539 F.2d 1166 (8th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1110, 97 S.Ct. 1146, 51 L.Ed.2d 563 (1977), where the legislative history disclosed an affirmative congressional intent to prohibit cumulative punishment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Absent an affirmative expression of legislative intent, our decision is guided by the principles expressed in <em>Gore v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 386, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958). In <em>Gore, </em>the defendant was convicted of six separate\u2019statutory violations, arising from two sales of drugs. Each sale was held to have violated three statutes: (1) sale of drugs not in pursuance of a written order of the purchaser, in violation of \u00a7 4705(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; (2) sales and distribution of drugs not in the original stamped package, in violation of \u00a7 4704(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; and (3) facilitating concealment and sale of drugs with knowledge that the drugs had been unlawfully imported, in violation of \u00a7 2(c) of the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act. The Court affirmed the convictions on the basis of <em>Blockburger. </em>Writing for the Court, Mr. Justice Frankfurter said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">We are strongly urged to reconsider <em>Blockburger </em>by reading the various specific enactments of Congress as reflecting a unitary congressional purpose to outlaw nonmedicinal sales of narcotics. From this the conclusion is sought to be drawn that since Congress had only a single purpose, no matter how numerous the violations by an offender, of the specific means for dealing with this unitary purpose, the desire should be attributed to Congress to punish only as for a single offense when these multiple infractions are committed through a single sale. We agree with the starting point, but it leads us to the opposite conclusion. Of course the various enactments by Congress extending over nearly half a century constitute a network of provisions, steadily tightened and enlarged, for grappling with a powerful, subtle and elusive enemy. If the legislation reveals anything, it reveals the determination of Congress to turn the screw of the criminal machinery \u2014 detection, prosecution and punishment \u2014 tighter and tighter. The three penal laws for which petitioner was convicted have different origins both in time and in design. * * * It seems more daring than convincing to suggest that three different enactments, each relating to a separate way of closing in on illicit distribution of narcotics, passed at three different periods, for each of which a separate punishment was declared by Congress, somehow or other ought to have carried with them an implied indication by Congress that if all these three different restrictions were disregarded but, forsooth, in the course of one transaction, the defendant should be treated as though he committed only one of these offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">357 U.S. at 390-91, 78 S.Ct. at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">We find that rationale equally compelling in this case. Congress, by enacting the statutes in question over a period of thirty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>years,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> has unmistakably indicated its intention to \u201cturn the screw\u201d in an attempt to halt the proliferation of dangerous weapons in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">In conclusion, we find that imposing consecutive sentences for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(b), (c) and (d) is not barred by either applicable double jeopardy principles or any statutory construction based on congressional intent. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-23\">. The Honorable Edward J. McManus, Chief United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-11\">. Wright does not challenge any other aspects of his sentence, and we express no views thereon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b798-6\">. Nor is appellant\u2019s position supported by <em>United States v. Gaddis, </em>424 U.S. 544, 96 S.Ct. 1023, 47 L.Ed.2d 222 (1976), or other similar cases interpreting the federal bank robbery statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113, as prohibiting cumulative punishment for violations of its various subsections. Unlike the bank robbery statute, the firearms statutes in question here do not subdivide firearms offenses into a cohesive series of steps displaying a continuum of increasingly serious criminal conduct with increasing penalties for each more aggravated offense. Rather they are a collection of distinct acts, each of which is declared to be unlawful. In such circumstances, separate offenses may arise out of the same act, so long as each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>579 F.2d 474 at 476-477 (8th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b799-13\">. The provision outlawing receipt of firearms by convicted felons, now codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(1) had its origin in 1938. <em>See </em>52 Stat. 1250 (prohibiting receipt by person convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d), as <em>amended, </em>75 Stat. 757 (1961) (extending prohibition to persons convicted of any crime punishable by a term exceeding one year). Subsections (b) and (d) of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861 originated in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5851, 5854 (1958). Subsection (c) was added by the Gun Control Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 1213, 1234.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
