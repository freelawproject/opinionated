Since we conclude that the allegation here does not establish a wrong for which Section 1983 provides a remedy, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">The facts are not in dispute, and we need not detail all that has happened in order to decide the issue which controls this appeal. Plaintiffs-Appellants, Beker Phosphate Corporation and Beker Industries Corporation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed a complaint against Defendants-Ap-pellees, William A. Muirhead, Larry Rhodes, John M. Saba, Jr., Beverly Clay and Andrew Sandegren, which alleged a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs appeal a summary judgment suffered in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-8\">In October of 1974, Beker Phosphate Corporation purchased approximately eleven thousand acres of real property in Manatee County, Florida for the sole purpose of mining phosphate. Pursuant to the Florida Environmental Land and Water Management Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 380.012-380.12, Beker Phosphate Corporation applied for an approval of a \u201cdevelopment of regional impact,\u201d Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 380.06, which was granted by the Manatee County Board of County Commissioners. In addition, Beker Phosphate Corporation applied for a special exception in Manatee County zoning regulation which also was granted by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-14\">Defendants, the individual members of the Board of County Commissioners of nearby Sarasota County, Florida, filed a Notice of Appeal to the Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission and sought review of both decisions of the Manatee County Board of County Commissioners. This appeal was dismissed for lack of standing since the applicable Florida statute allowed appeals to the Adjudicatory Commission only by \u201cthe owner, developer, an appropriate regional planning agency or the state land planning agency.\u201d Fla.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 380.07(2) (1972). <em>See also </em>Fla.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 380.07(2) (Supp.1978). Defendants then petitioned the First District Court of Appeal of Florida for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to the Adjudicatory Commission. The First District Court of Appeal denied the petition and agreed that Defendants lacked standing to appeal to the Adjudicatory Commission. <em>Sarasota County v. Beker Phosphate Corporation, </em>322 So.2d 655 (1st D.C.A.Fla. 1975). <em>See also Sarasota County v. General Development Corp., </em>325 So.2d 45 (2d D.C.A. Fla.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-15\">Plaintiffs then brought this suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida and alleged that Defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>ants sought to harass Plaintiffs by seeking the two reviews and, as a result, interfered with the lawful use and enjoyment of Plaintiffs\u2019 property since they postponed their project until the two appeals had run their course.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In essence, Plaintiffs asserted first, that they have been deprived of their property rights without due process of law and second, that they have been denied the equal protection of the law in their right to follow the orderly procedures promulgated with regard to the approval of land use. For these allegedly suffered deprivations, Plaintiffs sought damages under Section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">We need not belabor the point. Plaintiffs base their cause of action on the Defendants\u2019 conduct in seeking state administrative review and state judicial review of the land use decision of the Manatee County Board of County Commissioners. We are constrained to hold that Section 1983 does not provide a remedy for such a claim of misuse of legal procedure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">Of course, litigiousness which gives rise to a common law tort action for misuse of legal procedure may be so egregious as to constitute a violation of Section 1983 as well, if the tort-feasor, under color of state law, subjects the tort-victim to a deprivation of Constitutional dimension.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It follows, however, that conduct which merely engenders common law tort liability, without infringing on Constitutionally protected interests, is not a sufficient basis to support a cause of action under Section 1983. Section 1983 simply does not provide a remedy for mere common law torts, even though committed under color of state law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-13\">More specifically the common law tort of misuse of legal procedure, without more, does not rise to the level of Constitutional wrong remedied by Section 1983. In <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Ragan, </em>257 F.2d 449, 450 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 851, 79 S.Ct. 78, 3 L.Ed.2d 85 (1958), this Court held, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-14\">Neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the Civil Rights Acts purported to secure a person against unfounded or even malicious claims or suits in state courts, especially so when the laws and courts of the state are available and furnished adequate remedies to a person aggrieved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-15\">While we sympathize with Appellant\u2019s obvious sincerity, if he has any remedy for the matters complained of, that remedy does not lie within the jurisdiction of the federal courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-16\"><em>See also Yglesias v. Gulfstream Park Racing Association, Inc., </em>201 F.2d 817, 818 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>345 U.S. 993, 73 S.Ct. 1132, 97 L.Ed. 1400 (1953); <em>Lyons v. Baker, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>180 F.2d 893 (5th Cir. 1950); <em>Whittington v. Johnson, </em>102 F.Supp. 352, 353 (N.D.Ala. 1952), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>201 F.2d 810 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>346 U.S. 867, 74 S.Ct. 103, 98 L.Ed. 377 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">This view has been accepted by other Courts,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and we accept this view as controlling Plaintiffs\u2019 assignment of error here.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiffs simply have failed to allege a deprivation of Constitutional dimension. Therefore, the judgment appealed from must be and is</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1280-9\">. \u201cMisuse of legal procedure\u201d is a general term describing at least three separate but related common law torts which protect the interest in freedom from unjustified litigation: (1) malicious prosecution; (2) wrongful civil proceedings; (3) abuse of process. <em>See generally Pros-ser, The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 119-121 (4th ed. 1971). Given our result, we need not decide which, if any, of these common law torts is involved here. For our purposes, the generic term will suffice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1280-10\">.

Plaintiffs inadvertently seem to have pleaded themselves into a \u201cCatch-1983.\u201d If they would show that they postponed their project because Defendants\u2019 two reviews appeared viable, then Plaintiffs detract much from their argument that Defendants\u2019 appeals were wholly without merit and constituted the misuse of legal procedure. If they would show that Defendants\u2019 two reviews were wholly without merit, then Plaintiffs would be hard-pressed to explain why they did postpone their project to their alleged detriment. <em>See </em>Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 380.07(2).
