This court earlier upheld the district court\u2019s finding of liability for intentional segregation in <em>NAACP v. Lansing Board of Education, </em>559 F.2d 1042 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. den. </em>434 U.S. 997, 98 S.Ct. 635, 54 L.Ed.2d 491 (1977). This appeal was submitted to the Court on the briefs and oral arguments of counsel, and the Court has studied the record and is fully advised in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-21\">The Court is of the opinion that the scope of the district court\u2019s remedy was not overly broad. The record discloses that the remedy is tailored to undo the violations of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights found by the district court. While the district court did not specifically make findings on the \u201cincremental segregative effect\u201d of these violations, we conclude that the remedy imposed was only \u201cdesigned to redress\u201d the effect of the violations found. <em>Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, </em>433 U.S. 406, 420, 97 S.Ct. 2766, 53 L.Ed.2d 851 (1977). The district court did not err in including first and second grade children in the desegregation remedy. Nor did the remedy violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974. <em>Brinkman v. Gilligan, </em>518 F.2d 853, 856 (6th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">It is ORDERED that the judgment of the district court be, and it hereby is, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
