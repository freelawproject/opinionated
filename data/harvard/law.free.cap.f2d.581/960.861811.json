Because the construction environment exposes this electrical transmission equipment, as well as the tools themselves, to severe wear and tear, accidental leakages of electricity and resulting electrical shocks, <em>i. </em>e., ground faults, present a significant threat to the safety of construction workers. In order to alleviate such dangers, the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Health and Safety promulgated and, more recently, modified certain \u201cground-fault circuit protection\u201d standards that must be met on all construction sites using temporary electrical systems. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1910.309(c), 1926.400(h) (1977), <em>as modified, </em>41 Fed.Reg. 55703-04 (1976). This petition challenges the recent modifications of those standards. Finding that the modifications were not promulgated according to the statutorily mandated process, we remand the record for at least ninety days to allow for correction of the defect identified hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">By explicit provision in their promulgation notice, the modified safety standards were issued under the authority of two statutes. <em>See </em>41 Fed.Reg. 55696 (1976). The first, the Construction Safety Act (CSA), 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 333, was passed in 1969 and authorized the Secretary of Labor (\u201cthe Secretary\u201d), after <em>mandatory </em>consultation with the advisory committee, and apparently after compliance with the formal rule-making provisions in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 553(c), 556, 557, to establish health and safety standards that every contractor of a federal or federally financed building must meet as a condition of his contract with the government. 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 333(a). <em>See </em>S.Rep.No. 320, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969), <em>reprinted in </em>[1969] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 1073 (\u201cformal hearings\u201d required).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">The other statute is the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651 <em>et seq. </em>This much more comprehensive legislation authorizes the Secretary of Labor to establish workplace standards aimed at improving and preserving the health and safety of all American employees involved in commerce among the several states. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651, 652, 655. The relevant procedural requirements for promulgating and modifying those standards provide first that the Secretary <em>may </em>submit his proposal to an advisory committee. If he does, he is then bound to furnish the committee with certain information and to await its recommendation for a specified time period. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-12\"> The Secretary must, in any event, publish, and accept comments on, the proposal to promulgate or modify a standard. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 655(b)(2). OSHA does not explicitly refer to the APA, and its promulgation procedure is a hybrid of informal and formal rulemaking. Thus, while a pre-promulgation hearing is required if requested, and is reviewable under the substantial evidence rule traditionally applied to formal rule-making, the hearing may be informal <em>(i. e., </em>without cross examination, adversary presentation, and detailed findings).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-13\">As this synopsis of the two statutes suggests, Congress provided similar but not identical promulgation procedures for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>health and safety standards under CSA and OSHA. Under the former, advisory committee consultation at some point is mandatory, and formal rulemaking is apparently required. Under the latter, pre-proposal consultation with an advisory committee is merely elective, and an informal hearing will suffice. Nonetheless, the Secretary has devised a single promulgation process for construction industry standards aimed at satisfying the requirements of both statutes; and it is the Labor Department\u2019s faithfulness to this process that is at issue herein.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZ0f\">Under this procedure, the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>and Health (\u201cAssistant Secretary\u201d) is delegated the <em>mandatory </em>duty of submitting to an Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (\u201cthe Advisory Committee\u201d or \u201cthe Committee\u201d) \u201cany <em>proposal . </em>together with all pertinent factual information available to him . . .\u201d Within an established time period, the Committee may make a recommendation to the Assistant Secretary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Once that period has expired, or the Committee has issued a recommendation, the Assistant Secretary may propose a health and safety standard; if he does, he must solicit public comments and provide an informal hearing thereon. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1911.10, 1911.11(b) (1977). After considering the data presented in written submissions and in any hearing held, the Assistant Secretary must publish either a final rule or notification of his decision not to issue a rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">In order to expedite the implementation of OSHA, the Secretary was authorized during the first two years of the Act\u2019s effectiveness to forego the promulgation procedures discussed above and instead summarily to adopt \u201cnational consensus standard[s]\u201d as health and safety rules.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Using this temporary and summary procedure, Labor Department officials in 1972 adopted the standards in the National Electrical Code (NEC) \u2014 adhered to by the National Fire Protection Association and the American National Standards Institute \u2014 to cover most \u201celectrical installations and utilization equipment. . . .\u201d37 Fed.Reg. 3431 (1972), <em>codified in </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.-308(c)(vi) (1977). These same standards are made explicitly applicable to construction jobsites by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.400(b) (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">As adopted under OSHA, the NEC required a three-wire grounding system for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>protection against ground faults. Under this system, the wiring in all electrical cords, receptacles, and plugs must be trifur-cated, with the third wire serving to drain off any electrical leakage to a low-resistance ground path, thereby preventing dangerous shocks. Although relatively simple and effective when implemented properly, this system will not work if the three-wire system is not electrically continuous from outlet to tool. Hence, any tool, extension cord, or outlet with only a two-wire set-up will destroy the utility of the protective system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">After the Secretary adopted the NEC under OSHA, an amendment to that consensus code went into effect among its private adherents. That amendment required, in addition to the three-wire system, that outlets at construction sites be installed with ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCI\u2019s). This device measures the flow of electricity out of and back into the outlet and breaks the circuit within one-fortieth of a second whenever there is a significant imbalance in the two flows \u2014 as occurs when there is leakage of electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">As part of the NEC, this requirement would have gone into effect on January 1, 1974, under OSHA as well among the NEC\u2019s private adherents, but the Assistant Secretary Issued a notice a few weeks before that date suspending the effectiveness of the GFCI modification. 38 Fed.Reg. 33397 (1973). The Assistant Secretary took this action after the Advisory Committee recommended the suspension pending further study of the practicability of GFCI\u2019s of different \u201csettings\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and designs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-12\">Although the Advisory Committee had recommended that a \u201cstudy committee\u201d pursue the matter further, <em>see </em>note 8 <em>supra, </em>the Assistant Secretary chose instead to suspend the GFCI modification temporarily, in order to solicit public comments and to hold an informal hearing thereon. 38 Fed. Reg. 33983, 35235 (1973).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The notices, comments, and hearings focused primarily on the appropriate settings for GFCI\u2019s and on whether the requirement should extend beyond temporary construction sites to other industrial sites.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-13\">By October 1974, the Assistant Secretary was prepared to propose a GFCI requirement for temporary wiring on construction sites, and he accordingly brought his proposal before the Advisory Committee. Once again, however, the Committee was not prepared to give its support. After extensively discussing the proposal, particularly with reference to the alleged insuffici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>ency of the three-wire grounding system, the Committee rejected, by an 8-5 vote, a motion to recommend against the GFCI requirement, but unanimously passed a motion reiterating the Committee\u2019s recommendation of an impartial study of the need for and workability of GFCI\u2019s. JA at 176, 190. Although expressing some pique that their earlier study proposal had been ignored by the Assistant Secretary, <em>id. </em>at 178, the members clearly understood the nonbinding nature of their recommendations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">As his representative explained to the Committee, the Assistant Secretary was hesitant to conduct the recommended study, due both to insufficient resources and to a desire to follow the statutory notice-comment-and-hearing procedure. JA at 181\u2014 82. Nonetheless, the Assistant Secretary did issue another public notice in April 1975, which mentioned the Committee\u2019s action prefatory to proposing that the NEC\u2019s suspended GFCI requirement be revoked completely. 40 Fed.Reg. 15390 (1977), <em>corrected, </em>40 Fed.Reg. 18468 (1977). This notice summarized the arguments for and against the GFCI requirement, and again invited public comment. It was at this stage that the Assistant Secretary first publicly focused attention on possible alternatives to GFCI\u2019s, including \u201cregularly testing tools [to] insure that [three-wire protection systems] were operational.\u201d 40 Fed.Reg. 15391 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">In a subsequent public notice by the Department in September 1975, the tentative references in the April notice to an alternative \u201cassured grounding\u201d system of regularized equipment testing had flowered into a \u201cpossible requirement\u201d that might be promulgated by the Department under OSHA, and into one of several issues that would be addressed specifically at an informal hearing. The hearing was also slated to consider the GFCI requirement, suggesting that the Assistant Secretary was now having second thoughts about permanently revoking that requirement. 40 Fed.Reg. 40170-71 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">This new round of written comments and oral presentation finally convinced the Assistant Secretary that new standards <em>were </em>necessary to supplement the three-wire ground fault protection system then required under OSHA. In a December 1976 notification, he reviewed the evidence supporting both the need for additional construction site protection from ground faults (including a finding that about 30 deaths occur annually due to the insufficiency of the three-wire system<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>), and the safety-effectiveness, workability, and cost of GFCI\u2019s. This notice also discussed the utility and the necessary elements of an assured grounding system as a back-up to the three-wire system and as a substitute for the GFCI requirement. The Assistant Secretary concluded that the GFCI and assured grounding proposals were equally viable; and both were accordingly promulgated as alternative final standards in the December notice. They became effective on February 22, 1977. 41 Fed.Reg. 55697-704 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-12\">The final standards provide that, in addition to three-wire ground-fault protection systems, construction sites <em>either </em>must install \u201capproved\u201d GFCI\u2019s on all 120-volt, 15- and 20-ampere receptacle outlets, <em>or </em>must institute \u201cassured equipment grounding conductor programs.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.-309(c) (1977). Approved GFCI\u2019s are defined as those \u201cdetermined to be safe by a nationally recognized testing laboratory, such as, but not limited to, Underwriters\u2019 Laborato<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>ries, Inc. [UL] <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the GFCI standard does not adhere to the one in the NEC, and does not provide the exact specifications of acceptable GFCI\u2019s other than by reference to UL\u2019s approval criteria, the Assistant Secretary\u2019s explanation in the Federal Register did consider and find acceptable the settings of GFCI\u2019s that were UL-approved at the time of promulgation. 41 Fed.Reg. 55702 (1976). <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra. </em>The assured grounding program sets forth a rigorous set of (1) tests to be conducted on specified cord sets, attachment caps, plugs, and receptacles as well as of the hand tools themselves, before first use, after repairs, and every three months, and (2) visual inspections to be made daily.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">At no time after October 1974 until the rule was promulgated did the Assistant Secretary consult the Advisory Committee. Hence, the Committee had no opportunity to comment on the assured grounding program alternative, except as its members, on their own, availed themselves of the various comment and hearing opportunities offered the general public between October 1974 and December 1976. This fact was brought home to Committee members on March 30, 1977, when the Assistant Secretary\u2019s desig-nee explained the standards to the Committee <em>after </em>they had gone into effect. The members, after voicing their criticisms of the alternative standards, see note 24 <em>infra, </em>including complaints that their study proposal had been ignored, were told by a Labor Department official that they, like \u201c[a]nybody[,] can petition for amendments or changes to standards.\u201d JA at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">This petition for review under OSHA was brought by the National Constructors Association, whose members perform about one-third of the dollar value of industrial construction work in this nation. The Association, which took an active role in the rule-making proceedings, presses three arguments upon us. First, it argues that the Assistant Secretary erred procedurally in promulgating the modified ground fault protection. Next, the Association claims that the Assistant Secretary, by relying on UL to provide the specifications of an approved GFCI, unlawfully subdelegated authority to private individuals. Finally, the Association contends that the standards do not find substantial support in the record, as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a). <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-15\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-16\">The crux of petitioner\u2019s procedural argument is that the Assistant Secretary did not make proper use of the Advisory Committee in promulgating the modified safety standards. As a preface to our consideration of this argument, we may distill three conclusions from the statutory and regulatory background to this suit discussed above. First, consultation with the Advisory Committee on \u201cany proposal\u201d is a prerequisite to valid promulgation under OSHA of any construction-related safety standard. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1911.10(a) (1970); <em>see </em>note 4 <em>supra. </em>Although, as relevant here, this requirement is a product of the Department\u2019s own regulations, it draws heavily on the legislative policies underlying the Construction Safety Act, <em>see </em>notes 3 &amp; 5 <em>supra, </em>and reflects an established opinion under OSHA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 655(b)(1), 655(b)(2); note 2 <em>supra. </em>Second, while the Assistant Secretary must provide the Committee with the opportunity to issue a recommendation, as well as with whatever information he has that is relevant thereto, he need not await that recommendation indefinitely, but may proceed with rulemaking after a given period of time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>even when the Committee does make a recommendation, the Assistant Secretary need not follow it<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u2014 although the Department\u2019s own practice in this and other cases, as well as the case law, support a requirement that the Department publish the substance of the Committee\u2019s recommendation in its initial notice of proposed action on a standard or modification. <em>Synthetic Organic Chem. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. Brennan, </em>506 F.2d 385, 388-89 (3rd Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 830, 96 S.Ct. 50, 46 L.Ed.2d 48 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">In light of these three conclusions, we may quickly dispose of two procedural arguments made by the Association. Because OSHA\u2019s advisory-committee-consultation option, as well as the Department\u2019s regulation, make clear that the Assistant Secretary need only supply whatever information he has available to him <em>at the time </em>he submits his proposal to the Committee,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and because petitioner does not claim that such information was not supplied, the Assistant Secretary cannot be faulted for failing to provide the Committee with the requisite information \u2014 or, more specifically, for failing to prepare the \u201cimpartial study\u201d twice recommended by the Committee. To hold otherwise would be to require the Assistant Secretary to follow the Committee\u2019s recommendation, which Congress clearly did not intend. <em>See </em>note 15 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-11\">For these same reasons, we are not persuaded that the Assistant Secretary denied the Committee the requisite opportunity to issue a recommendation on the <em>GFCI proposal. </em>With respect to that proposal, Department officials fulfilled their duty to the Committee under the statute and regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-12\">We are left, therefore, with petitioner\u2019s claim that as to the <em>assured grounding proposal, </em>the Assistant Secretary shirked his duty of consultation with the Committee. Although admitting that nothing like the assured grounding program was ever formally presented to or discussed by the Committee prior to its adoption, <em>see </em>note 26 <em>infra, </em>the Department insists that it paid sufficient heed to the Committee by twice presenting it with GFCI proposals. Under the Department\u2019s view of the procedures mandated by OSHA\u2019s advisory committee option and adopted in the Department\u2019s regulations, the rulemaking process has a linear quality such that it begins at one point (the Assistant Secretary\u2019s proposal) and travels in a straight line through several other statutorily mandated points (Advisory Committee consultation, notice of proposed rulemaking, reception of public comments, hearing), and ends at another point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>(final promulgation), without ever turning back and passing through any of the points a second time. Hence the validity of the procedures is tested merely by retracing the linear progress of the proposal from its inception to final promulgation, making sure that the right points were reached in the right order.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">This view of the promulgation process is overly formalistic, and accordingly ignores the purposes of the requisite procedures. The Department officials responsible for adopting the promulgation procedures at issue here presumably expected that every OSHA standard would derive substantial benefit from each step in the prescribed process.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This expectation reflects the same view on the part of the drafters of CSA and OSHA, whose mandatory and optional advisory committee provisions, respectively, were the models for the Department\u2019s regulations. <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra. </em>The legislative history of these two statutes suggests at least three purposes for advisory committee consultation: first, to enable Labor Department officials to take advantage of the expertise of committee members in formulating a wide variety of standards; <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> second, to allow the persons who will be affected by the standards to participate in their promulgation;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and third, to enable those same persons to abide by the standards once promulgated.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> A fourth reason, identified by the Third. Circuit, is that the pre-promulgation recommendations of an advisory committee will have a beneficial organizing and educative effect on the public comment and hearing procedure that follows.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-13\">Because the Department\u2019s exiguous use of the Advisory Committee served none of these four purposes with respect to the assured grounding program alternative, \u201cthe effectiveness of the educational process which Congress intended [OSHA] to provide for agency rulemaking\u201d was \u201cundermined,\u201d and the \u201clatitude for promulgating unwise rules\u201d was accordingly in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>creased.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, the Assistant Secretary never availed himself, or apprised public commentators, of the Committee\u2019s expert views on the question of whether an assured grounding program could provide a useful supplement to the three-wire grounding system or a valuable alternative to GFCI\u2019s <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Even more important, he did not seek its views on how to devise a workable assurance program that would provide for the necessary tests without requiring constructors to commit inefficient amounts of resources to scanning the large quantity of tools and electrical transmission equipment found on many construction sites. Moreover, by promulgating the assured grounding program without bringing it to the attention of the industry and labor representatives on the Committee, the Assistant Secretary deprived industry of an important tier of participation in the formulation of \u2014 and thus of an opportunity better to comprehend and comply with \u2014 the standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">The Department\u2019s linear view of the promulgation process also ignores the language of its own procedural regulation, which in turn utilizes the terms of OSHA itself. Under those provisions, committee consultation must occur as to <em>\u201cany </em>[construction-related] <em>proposal </em>\u201d by the Department under authority of OSHA. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1911.10(a) (1977) (emphasis added), <em>tracking, </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(1). This language has two important consequences. First, it establishes committed consultation as a separate step in the promulgation process, and, as such, goes beyond the dictates of traditional informal rulemaking under the APA. <em>See United States v. Finley Coal Co., </em>493 F.2d 285, 289-90 &amp; n. 4 (6th Cir. 1974). Second, the language places a \u201cstricter\u201d requirement on when, and how often, the agency must utilize the advisory committee procedure than does the APA with respect to public comment during informal rulemak-ing. <em>Shell Oil Co., supra </em>note 23, 574 F.2d 512, 517.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> That is to say, the committee must have \u201csufficient notice of [\u2018any\u2019] proposal to be finally adopted [to allow] comment\u201d thereon. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">The fact that the assured grounding alternative adhered to the APA\u2019s informal rulemaking procedure, because it was a \u201clogical outgrowth\u201d of the notice, public comment, and informal hearing administered by the Department, <em>South Terminal Corp. v. EPA, </em>504 F.2d 646, 659 (1st Cir. 1974), therefore, is of no final consequence in deciding this petition. The alternative assured-grounding proposal, as the Department admits, was never presented to the Committee<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> nor did it grow logically out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>of anything that was presented to, or heard from, the Committee.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Consequently, consulting the Committee as to the GFCI proposal, and allowing public comment on both that proposal and on the assured grounding program, did not satisfy the requirement that the Assistant Secretary bring <em>\u201cany\u201d </em>proposal before the <em>Committee.</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">In sum, we are convinced that under the Department\u2019s own promulgation regulation, as explained by its statutory models, CSA and OSHA, advisory committee consultation should, but in this case did not, consist of something more than a single and brief rest stop on the route between a tentative proposal of one construction health and safety standard, and the final promulgation of another, superficially related, but substantively quite different, standard.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Because the deviation from the requisite procedures is so great, we cannot be sure that the Assistant Secretary would have promulgated the modified ground fault protection standard in its current form had he used the proper process.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Accordingly, the modified ground fault protection standard must be remanded to the Department so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>that it may engage in the appropriate consultation with the Advisory Committee.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">On the other hand, because we do not find that the standard as promulgated is illegal,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> nor, upon our initial review of the record, do we see any glaring deficiencies in the evidence supporting that standard,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> we feel that a minimum ninety-day remand of the record \u2014 during which the regulations shall remain in effect \u2014 will suffice to allow the Committee to be convened and to issue any recommendation it chooses on the assured grounding/GFCI alternative standard.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> If the Committee recommends that the standard should be altered, the Assistant Secretary must reevaluate the final regulation \u2014 although the final decision as to its contents lies with him. <em>See </em>notes 11 &amp; 15 <em>supra </em>and accompanying texts. Should he decide to change the standard, a new round of public comment and a hearing on the change would be required <em>if </em>the change is not a \u201clogical outgrowth\u201d of the public comments already received. <em>See </em>pp. ---of 189 U.S.App.D.C., 970-971 of 581 F.2d, <em>supra. </em>By the same token, should he be inclined not to follow the Committee\u2019s recommendations, he must at least reserve judgment until he has compared those recommendations with the written and oral comments he received from the public during the previous promulgation period: If he decides that the Committee\u2019s recommendations might significantly have refocused the public commentary, he must withhold making a final decision until he has issued a new public notice soliciting public comments on the Committee\u2019s recommendations, and until he has held a new hearing, if one is requested. <em>See </em>pp.-,-of 189 U.S.App.D.C., 959, 969 of 581 F.2d, <em>supra. </em>That is to say, once the Assistant Secretary has convinced himself of the wisdom of a chosen course of action after he has had the benefit of the Committee\u2019s, recommendations, and once he is convinced that further public comment would shed no new light on the matter, he may return the record to this court for entry of an appropriate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">.

We need not decide whether the combined CSA-OSHA promulgation regulation at issue here fits within this rule, however.

Thus, we believe that petitioner\u2019s citation of CSA in its briefs serves the purpose of explaining why certain procedures were written into the combined CSA-OSHA promulgation regulations, without raising the issue of whether those regulations are in fact true to CSA.

Probably [the assurance program] sounds complicated . ., but <em>once you read the standard . . </em>., you will see that it may be less complicated than most people think.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">JA at 865-66 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">The \u201clogical outgrowth\u201d test was developed under the APA to determine how significantly proposals on which public comment have been received may be altered without allowing more public comment. As noted, <em>see </em>note 25 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text, OSHA and its supporting regulations appear to require the Department to return to the Committee procedure even more often than the analogous language in the APA requires with respect to the notice and comment procedure. We need not decide how much stricter the requirement is under OSHA, however, because in this case even the APA\u2019s lower standard was not met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1063-15\">. The statute and regulation require that Department officials themselves bring the proposal before the Committee, This explicit requirement, as well as the obvious value of face-to-face consultation with the Committee, belies any argument that Committee members were provided the necessary opportunity for consultation by their ability along with the rest of the public to submit comments to the Assistant Secretary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1063-16\">. Although the two alternative standards may be related in terms of a common goal, the relationship is virtually one of opposites in terms of the alternative means of reaching that goal. The Assistant Secretary appears to recognize as much. <em>See </em>notes 26 &amp; 27 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1063-17\">. The potential impact of consultation with the Committee is apparent from the record before us. The Assistant Secretary twice proposed <em>GFCI\u2019s </em>to the Committee, twice was denied its endorsement, and thereafter seriously considered dropping the GFCI requirement altogether. Moreover, in his final promulgation notice, the Assistant Secretary went out of his way to respond to the \u201cproper setting\u201d issue, <em>see </em>note 7-8 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text, that had most troubled the Committee about GFCI\u2019s. 41 Fed.Reg. 55702 (1977). Moreover, even when first apprised of the assured grounding program by the Department \u2014 after the requirement had gone into effect \u2014 Committee members immediately perceived deficiencies in the program. JA at 866-67. In light of this background, we cannot confidently conclude that <em>pre </em>-promulgation consultation with the Committee would not have convinced the Assistant Secretary to take a different approach with respect to the assured grounding program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">. Although the defect we have identified taints primarily the assured grounding program, the Assistant Secretary apparently conceived of that program, together with the GFCI alternative, as a package, albeit one affording significantly different alternatives, <em>see </em>note 29 <em>supra. </em>Hence, in remanding part, we feel constrained to remand the whole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">. Petitioner claims that the GFCI part of the safety standard illegally subdelegates authority to a private group \u2014 UL\u2014by defining an acceptable GFCI as one that is approved by that group. <em>See </em>note 13 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text. Whatever the merits of this claim in general, we find it premature on the record before us. Because the Assistant Secretary reviewed and found \u201csuitable\u201d all GFCI\u2019s that then bore the imprimatur of UL approval, <em>see </em>41 Fed.Reg. 55702 (1976), he effectively adopted UL specifications, as they then stood, as his own. As such, he retained control of the process, so that no subdelegation of final authority occurred. Moreover, petitioner concedes that the Department should be able to draw from, and even adopt, the conclusions of any expert body concerned with the health and safety of American workers. What really troubles petitioner is that UL later may change its specifications, and thereby effectively modify the OSHA standard, without any supervision from the Assistant Secretary, and without any opportunity for advisory-committee or public comment thereon. The legality of such an eventuality, however, is not now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1064-14\">. It would be a futile gesture at this point finally to evaluate the evidence favoring standards that may be changed. Nonetheless, we do note that the record appears to contain considerable support for the Assistant Secretary\u2019s conclusions that the three-wire requirement has not prevented many ground-fault-related deaths each year on construction sites, and that either the GFCI or the assured grounding alternatives could do so. Moreover, while the evidence supporting the conclusion that false, or nuisance, tripping, <em>see </em>note 7 <em>supra, </em>will not undermine the actual effectiveness of GFCI\u2019s may be somewhat weaker, we do note that such evidence exists in the record. <em>See </em>JA 4, 461-64, 635, 639. We are also cognizant of the admonition in the House Report on OSHA that the Secretary should not be paralyzed by conflicting technical evidence. <em>Legislative History, </em>at 848.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1064-15\">.
