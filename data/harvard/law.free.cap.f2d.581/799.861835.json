Cul-bert, </em>548 F.2d 1355, and held valid the conviction of Culbert on Count 2 for violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, <em>United States v. Culbert, </em>435 U.S. 371, 98 S.Ct. 1112, 55 L.Ed.2d 349 (1978). The case is again before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">The conviction for robbery in Count 1 is reversed for the reasons set forth in our first opinion, <em>Culbert, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-17\">The conviction in Count 2 for violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">No petition for rehearing will be entertained. The mandate will be issued and spread forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b891-19\">ELY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ah0I\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b891-20\">I respectfully dissent, doing so only because of our court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Snell, </em>550 F.2d 515 (9th Cir. 1977). In the present case, the Supreme Court did not discuss the problem that we resolved in <em>Snell, </em>even though the problem was presented in the brief that Culbert filed in our court. I have no doubt that the Supreme Court\u2019s omission is attributable to a policy that it will not meet undecided issues in a particular case unless those issues have first been openly considered by the inferior court. My tentative opinion is that my Brothers now disregard the teaching of <em>Snell, </em>but even if I am mistaken as to the legal point, I think it is wrong for the majority now to affirm Culbert\u2019s conviction summarily without even a mention of <em>Snell.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
