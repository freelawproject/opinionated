Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b192-23\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b192-24\">Plaintiff-shipper appeals the judgment for defendant-carrier in its suit for dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>ages to a shipment of wire rods. Plaintiff asserts that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law are clearly erroneous \u2014 without adequate evidentiary support and \u201cpartially induced by an erroneous view of the law.\u201d There is ample evidence in the record to support the lower court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Plaintiff shipped a cargo of \u201copen hearth wire rods\u201d from Antwerp, Belgium to Jacksonville, Florida, aboard a vessel chartered by defendant. Two months after defendant discharged the cargo in Jacksonville, plaintiff received a complaint from the company to which it had sold the goods. Plaintiff\u2019s marine surveyor examined the goods on the purchaser\u2019s premises and discovered substantial damage. Plaintiff filed this suit, alleging that the damage had occurred while the cargo was in the defendant\u2019s care and custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Because the bills of lading covering the goods in question incorporated the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (\u201cCOGSA\u201d), that law governs. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1300 <em>et seq. </em>Under COGSA, a shipper establishes a prima facie case of carrier liability for damages by proving that the carrier received the cargo in good condition and discharged it at the destination in a damaged state. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303(3)(c), (4);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., </em>5 Cir., 1975, 511 F.2d 218, 223; <em>Emmco Insurance Co. v. Walleni-us Caribbean Line, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 492 F.2d 508, 512. Plaintiff offered in evidence bills of lading for the cargo, giving rise to a presumption that, when delivered to defendant-carrier at Antwerp, the goods were in the order and condition described in the bills. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303(4); <em>Emmco Insurance Co. v. Wallenius Caribbean Line, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 492 F.2d 508, 513. However, proof that \u201cthe cargo was in a damaged condition when discharged ... is essential to establish a case of prima facie liability,\u201d <em>Otis McAllister Export Corp. v. Grancolombiana (N.Y.) Inc., </em>D. C., E.D.La., 1963, 216 F.Supp. 756, 757, and plaintiff failed to supply adequate proof in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">First, plaintiff did not, as provided by COGSA, give defendant notice of loss or damage within three days after defendant discharged the goods, thereby creating \u201cpri-ma facie evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the bill of lading.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> More importantly, plaintiff\u2019s proof at trial failed to counter this presumption of undamaged delivery. Plaintiff\u2019s case depended upon the testimony of its marine surveyor, who twice examined the shipment of wire rods. After his first inspection, conducted during discharge of the goods from the vessel, he filed a report recommending that \u201cthis entire shipment should be accepted with but a minor claim, if any, received\u201d; he made no reference to any damage of a significant nature. Two months later, he inspected the cargo again, on the premises of the company that purchased the goods from plaintiff. In his second report, the surveyor described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>serious damage, resulting in his opinion from \u201cextreme rough and/or careless handling at some time during the voyage of importation, while in the care and custody of the Steamship Company and may very well be the result of dragging and or pulling the bundles from the stow in the vessel during the course of discharge.\u201d Under cross-examination at trial, however, the inspector defined \u201cvoyage of importation\u201d as \u201cthe travel of the coil from Europe to the premises of the consignee where our final examination was made.\u201d During the final portion of that \u201cvoyage,\u201d the cargo passed from shipper to stevedore to warehouseman to trucker to purchaser. Plaintiff\u2019s inspector conceded that he had no way of knowing at which stage, or in whose hands, the damage occurred and admitted that it could have occurred at some point from discharge onward. In addition, defendant\u2019s marine surveyor testified with regard to his own inspection of the cargo, conducted both on board the vessel and on the pier after discharge. He discovered no damage of the magnitude observed by plaintiff\u2019s inspector two months later and found no harm to the goods of any consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Given the inadequacy of plaintiff\u2019s proof, the trial judge\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-6\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeo\">(3) After receiving the goods into his charge the carrier, or the master or agent of the carrier, shall, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of lading showing among other things\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">(c) The apparent order and condition of the goods .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">(4) Such a bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described in accordance with paragraph [] (3) . . .
