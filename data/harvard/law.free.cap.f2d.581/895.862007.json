The System is administered by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service (sometimes referred to as Service, or FWS).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">Since the commencement of this suit, the FWS has prepared a programmatic environmental statement on the program which covers operation of the NWRS for the next ten years, centering on a projection of a roughly constant level of funding. No challenge has been made to the adequacy of this EIS. Rather, plaintiffs obtained, and now seek affirmance of, the district court\u2019s declaratory ruling that an EIS adequate to then existing circumstances is required with each annual budget request. We reject this <em>per se </em>position and hold that the statement prepared by the Service satisfies its NEPA obligations, subject to any future decision of the agency to reevaluate the program or a drastic change of circumstances affecting the operation of the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">We affirm the district court\u2019s other declaratory ruling that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required to develop procedures to fulfill its NEPA obligations in connection with the Budget process.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b989-17\">A. <em>The National Wildlife Refuge System</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-18\">The National Wildlife Refuge System consists of more than 350 refuges containing more than 30 million acres in 49 of the 50 states. The primary purposes of the NWRS are to preserve endangered species and to sustain populations of migratory birds, particularly waterfowl, by maintaining intact a diverse network of their natural habitats. A secondary purpose of the System is to provide for its educational and recreational use (study, observation, and hunting) by people.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-19\">The System is administered by the Service according to the provisions of several statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Much of the refuge land was acquired during the 1930\u2019s. After a period of little growth during the 1940\u2019s and 50\u2019s, the System has been enlarged during the 60\u2019s and to the present, particularly in the area of wild rivers and of wetlands. (There has recently been increasing recognition of the contribution to the preservation of important wildlife made by wetlands, which have been rapidly depleted.) During this period of territorial growth, new statutory mandates (such as the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1531-1543), and increased public use of the NWRS, the resources devoted to staff and maintain the Refuge System have not kept up with the rate of territorial growth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Between 1973 and 1976, there was a 7% decrease in staffing, while the number of field stations in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>creased by 10 percent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This has led to a substantial ($83 million) backlog of rehabilitation work, as well as unfulfilled construction work, new and replacement, e. <em>g., </em>water control structures, roads, and buildings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Given the policy decision to plan for roughly constant total expenditure (approximately $43 million in 1974 dollars), the FWS focuses on a strategy of increasing the effectiveness of the NWRS in its primary conservation task, while gradually reducing its direct use by the public. The Service\u2019s statement (FES) analyzes the environmental consequences of this proposed strategy, alternatives, and mitigating measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">B. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"ASlL\">Plaintiffs are three environmental organizations. Their standing will be discussed subsequently. They advance two arguments that section 102(2)(C) of NEPA<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> obligates the Service to prepare an EIS on each annual budget request for the System: (a) that past and present proposals to cut down on NWRS operations are \u201cproposals for legislation . significantly affecting the quality of the human environment . . . or (b) that the NWRS is so vital to protection of the environment that the annual proposal on the scope and nature of its operation <em>per se </em>\u201csignificantly affect[s] the quality of the human environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-19\">Plaintiffs further contend that section 102(2)(B) of NEPA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires OMB to develop procedures to assure consideration of environmental factors in the budget process, including identification of which budget requests have significant environmental consequences and what is required of the agencies of the executive branch in submitting these requests to OMB.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-20\">C. <em>District Court Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-EW\">The district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the basis of the <em>per se </em>argument concerning budget proposals for operation of a major environmental program such as the NWRS. The court relied on the guidelines implementing NEPA issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). These guidelines explicitly include \u201crequests for appropriations\u201d within the definition of \u201caction\u201d for NEPA purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court also relied on cases requiring an EIS in connection with the request for appropriations to construct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>or otherwise initiate a specific project.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court took note of the programmatic environmental statement being prepared by the defendants, but held that since it was directed at the long range goals of the NWRS, it would not satisfy the NEPA requirement of an analysis specifically directed to the proposed action in a \u201cfinely tuned\u201d manner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court granted the plaintiffs declaratory relief that the defendants were in violation of NEPA, that an EIS was required on the annual budget proposal for the NWRS, and that OMB was required</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alk-dedup-0\">to develop formal methods and procedures which will, with respect to the Office\u2019s own administrative actions and proposals, identify those agency actions requiring environmental statements to be prepared, considered, and disseminated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">II. STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">The defendants challenge the summary judgment granted to plaintiffs in view of their failure to adduce proof of injury in the face of defendants\u2019 denial of plaintiffs\u2019 standing and assertion of a disputed factual issue as to their injury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that their members use the Refuge System and are affected by the environmental impact of the proposal concerning the operation of the System.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Alternatively, plaintiffs assert that their organizational interests in disseminating the information which NEPA requires the proposing agency to compile and disclose provide standing under <em>SIPI, supra </em>note 8, 481 F.2d at 1087 n. 29. These allegations were not supported by affidavits in plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">There is little doubt in our mind that some of plaintiffs\u2019 hundreds of thousands of nature-oriented members use the Refuge System, so that at least one of them could thereby satisfy the \u201cminimal\u201d standing requirements of <em>Sierra Club v. Morton [Min</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number><em>eral King], </em>405 U.S. 727, 734, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972) and <em>United States v. SCRAP [SCRAP I], </em>412 U.S. 669, 688-90, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Plaintiffs did not file specific affidavits to that effect. On the other hand, one can hardly say that the issue was sharply drawn by the defendants\u2019 pleadings. In their statement of genuine issues opposing summary judgment, the defendants denied that plaintiffs had \u201cbeen injured\u201d by operation of the .Refuge System or budget decisions concerning the System.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, this point was made in the context of defendants\u2019 denial of the allegation that there were plans to reduce the funding of the NWRS with consequent impairment of the Refuge System. Defendants\u2019 pleadings did not specifically contest the proposition that plaintiffs\u2019 members use and are affected by the System and how the FWS proposes to operate it, which was the underpinning of the <em>per se </em>argument accepted by the district court. While we do not minimize the importance of standing requirements, the issue is whether their disposition required a trial to resolve pertinent issues of fact. A trial is not automatically required by a general denial of standing. However, to avoid any possible implication of foreclosure or estoppel, we make it clear that on the remand for further proceedings, if there is a genuine issue as to use of the Refuges by plaintiffs\u2019 members, defendants may raise it in appropriate proceedings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">III. NEPA AND THE BUDGET PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">A. <em>Absolute Positions on NEPA Applicability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 position is simple and logical. NEPA requires \u201call agencies of the Federal Government\u201d to prepare an EIS to accompany \u201cevery recommendation or report on proposals for legislation . significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The EIS guidelines of CEQ, the body established by NEPA to implement that statute, defines an \u201caction\u201d subject to the EIS requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2k\">\u201cActions\u201d include but are not limited to:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">(1) Recommendations or favorable reports relating to legislation including requests for appropriations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>The other prerequisite of an EIS requirement, that the action significantly affect the environment, has been given a broad reading in favor of obtaining the benefits of an EIS in instances of borderline environmental significance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, according to the plaintiffs, an EIS is required in connection with the FWS\u2019s budget proposal for funding the upcoming fiscal year\u2019s operation of a program with great environmental significance, the NWRS.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The defendants counter that the FWS\u2019s proposal to OMB is only an intermediate step in the budget process and that only the actual Budget submitted by the President could be considered a proposal for legislation, and that this presidential submission would be the earliest action possibly triggering NEPA<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Defendants deny that NEPA imposes any obligation on OMB in its preparation of the Budget; they rely on the confidentiality of the budget process, see 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15, 24; and they claim that OMB and FWS are not \u201cagencies\u201d \u2014 either within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1), or under NEPA- \u2014 when they are acting as advisers and staff assistants to the President in making his Budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">A similar issue has arisen in connection with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and its applicability to entities within the Executive Office of the President. In <em>Soucie v. David, </em>145 U.S. App.D.C. 144, 448 F.2d 1067 (1971), without deciding whether the APA definition of \u201cagency\u201d includes the President, we held the Office of Science and Technology (OST) to be an \u201cagency\u201d based on congressional understanding of its role assigned by the reorganization plan in which it was created and in which its position was equated to the Budget Bureau.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Congress added a definition of \u201cagency\u201d in the 1974 FOIA amendments to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-13\">. or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President) . . . <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">The legislative history makes it clear that Congress adopted the <em>Soucie </em>result. The Conference Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-15\">With respect to the meaning of the term \u201cExecutive Office of the President\u201d the conferees intend the result reached in <em>Soucie v. David, </em>448 F.2d 1067 (C.A.D.C. 1971). The term is not to be interpreted as including the President\u2019s immediate personal staff or units in the Executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Office whose sole function is to advise and assist the President.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Preparation of the Budget is an aid to Congress as well as an instrument of presidential policymaking and control over the executive bureaucracy. OMB has a statutory duty to prepare the Budget, in addition to its multitudinous other management, coordination, and administrative functions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Congress signified the importance of OMB\u2019s power and function, over and above its role as presidential advisor, when it provided, also by amendment in 1974, for Senate confirmation of the Director and Deputy Director of OMB.'<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, OMB is not totally exempt from the FOIA by its definition of \u201cagency.\u201d We are equally convinced that OMB is not exempt by definition from NEPA. Exactly what NEPA requires of OMB in the budget process in general is not presented on this appeal and awaits OMB\u2019s response to the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment that it is OMB\u2019s function, at least in the first instance, to delineate the appropriate scope of a NEPA obligation that would be both feasible and meaningful.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">We now turn to the question of what NEPA requires, annually or occasionally, in connection with decisions about the operation of the NWRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">B. <em>Review of NWRS Operations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 logic-based contention <em>(see </em>note 20 and accompanying text <em>supra) </em>leads logically to the conclusion that an EIS would have to accompany every budget request for the annual operation of an environmental-conservation program, or indeed of an agency whose activities may have significant environmental impact.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The principle of <em>reductio ad absurdum </em>is part of the landscape of logic. Plaintiffs have not suggested a limiting principle to their logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-14\">Plaintiffs have put forward as an alternative an escape hatch that would limit the EIS requirement to instances of an alleged cutback in some aspect of NWRS activity, as in the level of NWRS staffing and maintenance, leveling of total expenditure, and lack of acquisition of new refuges.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-15\">The difficulty of limitation still obtains. Every agency has limited resources and has to establish priorities among its programs and activities within a program. Some areas and functions are given new emphasis, others are reduced. Some of these decisions, such as a decision to decline to expand the National Park System, may be of great environmental significance. In general, however, if there is no proposal to change the status quo, there is in our view no \u201cproposal for legislation\u201d or \u201cother major Federal action\u201d to trigger the duty under NEPA to prepare an EIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-16\">It would be absurd to require an EIS on every decision on the management of federal land, such as fluctuation in the number of forest fire spotters. We know of no case pushing NEPA to such extremes. The cases cited on this point by the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>tiffs involve initiation or construction of a new project, or a sale of federal resources.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The cases requiring an EIS in connection with appropriations requests involve proposals for construction or development of a project.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> There is a danger of overburdening NEPA by spreading its mandate too widely. The environmental analysis required by NEPA is governed by the rule of reason, as we have held in determining the scope of realistic alternatives to the proposed action<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and the intensity of the required analysis.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> A rule requiring preparation of an EIS on the annual budget request for virtually every ongoing program would trivialize NEPA. In our view, section 102(2)(C) contemplates a \u201cproposal\u201d for taking new action which significantly changes the status quo, not for a routine request for budget approval and appropriations for continuance and management of an ongoing program.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">We hasten to add the qualification that NEPA may have application to those budget requests that follow or accompany an agency\u2019s painstaking review of an ongoing program. The need is for a reading of NEPA that harmonizes its words, its purposes, and the rule of reason. Hence, a \u201cproposal for legislation,\u201d within \u00a7 102(2)(C), is not applicable when the budget and appropriation process is routine, but is fully applicable when the request for budget approval and appropriations is one that ushers in a considered programmatic course following a programmatic review. A review of such a nature reflects choices that should under NEPA be made in the light of a full consideration of pertinent environmental consequences and alternatives.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>We have no occasion at this time to consider whether, or in what instances, a \u201cnew look\u201d may be required because of vastly changed circumstances, either by NEPA or perhaps by some other provision of federal law. Nor need we now consider whether a court may mandate any such duty to take a new look.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">What we do hold is that an EIS is required when such a new look is had. A new look may be generated periodically and spontaneously as a matter of good management and revitalization of the bureaucracy. It may be a response to external stimulus, as when dramatically changed circumstances cry out for review, or perhaps to accommodate existing programs to changes in the agency\u2019s statutory mandate. It is clear that there is wide discretion in the agency to determine when such review will be conducted. That is the essence of government and administration. It is impossible to have a \u201cnew look\u201d at everything all the time. When there is such a new look the ensuing request for appropriations is a \u201cproposal for legislation\u201d under NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">We need not decide whether this kind of painstaking reappraisal of the NWRS was required at the time plaintiffs brought this lawsuit, because the FWS has since undertaken one. The Programmatic EIS evaluates the environmental consequences of the proposed operation of the NWRS and alternatives thereto over the next decade. The FWS has indicated that it intends to make an analysis from scratch at the end of those ten years; in the meantime it will update the environmental study in light of changed plans and circumstances.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">The Programmatic EIS sets forth the environmental consequences of the FWS\u2019s present plan to operate the NWRS at a roughly constant real level of expenditure with priority given to its conservation mission over public use \u2014 recreational and educational. It also considers the effects of alternate program priorities and expenditures. The adequacy of the EIS for what it is (a long-term strategy and analysis) has not been challenged by plaintiffs on appeal. The controversy presented to this court concerns the district court\u2019s ruling that an EIS is required in the future for each and every annual budget request. We hold to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">C. <em>OMB\u2019s Obligation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">NEPA requires all agencies of the federal government to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a7c-dedup-0\">identify and develop methods and procedures, in consultation with [CEQ], which will insure that presently unquantified environmental amenities and values may be given appropriate consideration in decisionmaking along with economic and technical considerations.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq7A\">This requirement is applicable to OMB as the agency responsible for preparation of the budget and other executive legislative proposals, a conclusion drawn from the Act itself and supported by the legislative history and administrative regulations.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>view that some but not all (and certainly not routine) requests for appropriation are \u201cproposals for legislation\u201d under \u00a7 102(2)(C) underscores a need, on the part of agencies, for guidance in determining when an EIS is required in connection with a budget request.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">These observations clarify the obligation imposed by NEPA and OMB, as the key agency in the executive\u2019s budget formulation process, to give appropriate guidance to the agencies. The district court granted declaratory relief that NEPA requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-6\">Defendant Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop formal methods and procedures which will, with respect to the Office\u2019s own administrative actions and proposals, identify those agency actions requiring environmental statements to be prepared, considered, and disseminated.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">The parties have not focused on this aspect of the district court\u2019s ruling and we might treat it as not appealed. However, the government defendants might argue that it was implicitly subject to further consideration in the light of their main contention. And the rulings we have made on the type of budget and appropriation requests that require an EIS will obviously affect the obligation put on OMB. To avoid uncertainty, we have considered the matter and affirm the ruling that requires OMB to adopt procedures and appropriate regulations to comply with the obligations NEPA imposes on the budget process when it culminates in proposals for legislation under the principles previously discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">This is not an onerous task. Preparation of the Budget is OMB\u2019s central function in helping the President coordinate the policy of the agencies and establish priorities for his administration. As it stands, the declaratory judgment imposes a duty on OMB to initiate the delineation of the procedures required by NEPA in connection with the budget process.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This task will be eased and simplified, we anticipate, by our rulings identifying what types of requests to the legislature for appropriations do and do not require preparation of an EIS, as well as clarifying the bounds of an agency\u2019s discretion in undertaking a reevaluation of an ongoing program.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">OMB will give consideration to how obligations under NEPA can be discharged without violating the principle that holds an agency\u2019s budget requests confidential prior to final review by the President. We do not expand on the problem here. For one thing, it was not developed by the government\u2019s appeal. Furthermore, we anticipate that the OMB will wish to ponder the matter afresh in light of the rulings in this opinion. The matter may be capable of resolution in a manner that presents program proposals in terms that permit an environmental analysis, without disclosure of dollar projections or other betrayal of genuine budget confidence. Since requirement of an environmental impact statement in connection with budget proposals will arise in relatively few instances, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>principles we have set forth, and since proposals for major program reviews and changes can probably be disclosed in general outline, sufficient for impact statement purposes, without undercutting the objectives underlying budget-type secrecy, OMB can fairly be called on to develop a proposal that serves and harmonizes both NEPA and budget processes. Certainly the fact that a proposal is subject to further review by the Executive is no bar to NEPA\u2019s requirement for an environmental statement. On the contrary, NEPA calls for an EIS precisely so that environmental consequences may be taken into account before a final decision is reached by the executive official or agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">NEPA has been salutary in heightening agency attention to environmental values, in part by requiring disclosure of environmental consequences. However, we cannot allow NEPA to be bloated, and indeed enfeebled, by pushing the logic of Section 102(2)(C) to ridiculous extremes. NEPA does not require an annual EIS on routine operation and maintenance of every program with significant environmental ramifications. Its rule of reason does not demand rethinking of everything all the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">The Fish and Wildlife Service has undertaken a re-evaluation of the National Wildlife Refuge System, and has done an analysis of its long term plan for operation of the System. We are not presented with a challenge to the validity of that exercise of discretion. In view of the programmatic EIS it has prepared there is no further obligation under NEPA at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">The judgment obligating defendants to prepare an annual EIS on NWRS operations is reversed. We affirm the judgment declaring OMB\u2019s duty to develop methods and procedures to implement the NEPA obligation to provide environmental impact statements to accompany those proposals on budget and appropriations that are proposals for legislation. This duty, as set forth in this opinion, applies when the request for budget approval and appropriations is one that proposes a considered programmatic course following a programmatic review. OMB will have latitude to propose a method that harmonizes both NEPA and budget processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">The case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-12\">.

The primary purpose of the EIS in the scheme of NEPA is to assure compliance with its mandate that agencies proposing legislation or action give due consideration to environmental factors. However, the EIS also serves the important additional function of informing other parts of the government and the public of the environmental consequences of the decision. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 366, 375, 499 F.2d 502, 511 (1974). Thus, we have held that an organization with an institutional concern with informing both its members and the public on matters of public policy and decisions which fall within the concern of NEPA has a statutory right to the information which NEPA obliges the agency to compile in an EIS. <em>Scientists\u2019 Institute for Public Information v.

In the case of a proposal for legislation \u2014 appropriations in <em>SIPI, </em>quasi-legislative approval by another agency in <em>Jones </em>\u2014 the organization has an interest in getting the environmental consequences of the proposal in the open and before the legislature in aid of its participation in the legislative process.

In my opinion such requirement would be wholly unreasonable in that it would result in an interpretation of the NEPA never intended by Congress. The court\u2019s rejection of the Sierra Club\u2019s position has my concurrence, but because the opinion has attempted to rely on a flexible \u201crule of reason\u201d approach, rather than heeding the straight-forward words of NEPA, its holding in my opinion does not go far enough in rejecting any EIS requirement for annual appropriation requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-13\">The court\u2019s opinion holds that a \u201crule of reason\u201d must be applied limiting the language of the regulation. It bases this conclusion on the plain meaning of CEQ regulation 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.5(a) which states that an \u201caction\u201d subject to the EIS requirement includes \u201crecommendations or favorable reports relating to legislation <em>including requests for appropriations </em>\u201d (emphasis added) and points out that if the contentions of appellee were upheld they would mandate the absurd result that all requests for appropriations would require EISs. The reasonable limitation so imposed is that routine requests for appropriations may be distinguished from intensive \u201cnew looks\u201d at a program\u2019s budget, it being reasonable to require EISs of the latter but not of the former. Actually the only issue before us is the court\u2019s holding with respect to the annual appropriation request for the NWRS and so there is no necessity for any dictum as to the ultimate limits of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>I agree that it would be unreasonable to require EISs for every major budget request. In addition to the unreasonableness of such construction of the statute, the intent of Congress and the uniform precedents from generations of legislative proceedings clearly indicate that Congress has never considered \u201crequests for appropriations\u201d to be either \u201cproposals\u201d or \u201cproposals for legislation or major federal action.\u201d In my opinion the entire budget request process for the NWRS involved here is outside the EIS requirement of NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">As a preliminary issue, I concur in that part of the court\u2019s opinion that directs the lower court on remand to consider the issue of whether or not the Sierra Club has standing. The lower court granted summary judgment for the appellees and in so doing must perforce have determined that they did have standing to bring this suit. The Sierra Club, however, submitted no affidavits indicating either that any of its members or its fellow appellees\u2019 members in fact used the Wildlife Reserves in question, or that their enjoyment of these areas would be in any way affected by the NWRS budget proposals. An organization which does not prove injury to itself or its members has no standing to challenge harm to the environment, <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972) ; Davis, <em>Administrative Law in the Seventies </em>\u00a7 22.19 (1976). Here the complaint of the Sierra Club alleges injury, but these allegations have been denied and are not supported by any evidence of record. Allegations on which standing is premised must be both \u201ctrue and capable of proof at trial,\u201d <em>United States v. SCRAP, </em>412 U.S. 669, 688-689, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973) (SCRAP I). In this case, where plaintiff\u2019s standing allegations are controverted, and particularly in light of the summary disposition effected by the lower court, it is necessary that the facts upon which standing is premised be not only alleged but demonstrated, <em>Northern Great Plains Coal Case, Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. 20, 514 F.2d 856, 869-870 n.20 (1975) , <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>427 U.S. 390, 95 S.Ct. 2718, 49 L.Ed.2d 576 (1976). In this record there is no evidence at all that appel-lees\u2019 allegations are \u201ccapable of proof.\u201d As , the opinion of Judge Leventhal states, there seems little doubt that the Sierra Club can offer proof that some of its members make use of the Wildlife Refuges involved in this case, but appellees must offer proof of that fact, not merely allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">However, even though appellees do prove that some of their members use the Wildlife Refuges, they still must clear what is to my mind a much more difficult hurdle before they can be held to have demonstrated their standing. Appellants strenuously argue that there is no evidence that any of the budget requests submitted by the Department of the Interior and the OMB will result in the curtailment of any identifiable refuge or refuge activity. It may well be true that the staff reductions proposed will not in fact impair the quality of the Wildlife Reserves or their availability. Indeed, one affiant testified that such lands as wilderness areas are best managed by <em>not </em>being managed at all. This argument is not ' devoid of logic. Appellees must demonstrate that some denial of service to them, <em>i. e., </em>the injury which allegedly gives them standing, \u201cin fact results from\u201d the challenged budget requests, <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 42-43, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976) ; <em>see also Linda R. S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 617-18, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973); <em>King\u2019s County Economic Commercial Development Ass\u2019n v. Hardin, </em>476 F.2d 478 (9th Cir. 1973). The seemingly self-evident truth that a decline in funding will result in the decline of the quality of the service provided is overly facile when dealing with areas whose chief value in the environmental scheme lies in being preserved as nature would leave them. Moreover, unless appellees can demonstrate a causal connection between the proposed appropriation and some identifiable decline in one of its member\u2019s use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>wildlife refuge, the Sierra Club is in effect asking this court to litigate not as to a particular injury, but, assuming any injury at all exists, as to a general injury suffered by the public at large, which courts may not be empowered to rectify, <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists to Stop the War, </em>418 U.S. 208, 215-227, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974). On remand, the District Court must consider and require proof concerning these questions relating to standing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">\n<em>Budget Requests as \u201cProposals\u201d?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">The appellees attempt to bring budget requests under the statutory language requiring EISs for \u201cproposals for legislation or other major federal actions.\u201d Since it is my opinion that such requests are not \u201cproposals,\u201d and even if \u201cproposals,\u201d are not proposals for either legislation or major federal action, I find no merit whatsoever in the Sierra Club\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Appropriation requests by departmental units cannot be considered \u201cproposals\u201d until they have achieved at least that degree of finality only attained when the President has formally determined to transmit the departmental request to Congress as part of his budget. <em>See Northern Great Plains Coal Case, </em>427 U.S. 390, 96 S.Ct. 2718, 49 L.Ed.2d 576 (1976) wherein the Supreme Court struck down a decision of the Court of Appeals which held that NEPA empowered a court to require the preparation of an impact statement to begin at some point prior to the formal recommendation or report on a proposal. 427 U.S. at 404, 96 S.Ct. 2718. In finding such action outside the intent of the statute the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV9\">The statute clearly states when an impact statement is required [that is] under the first sentence of \u00a7 102(2)(C) the moment at which an agency must have a final statement ready \u201cis the time at which it makes a recommendation or report on a <em>proposal </em>for federal action.\u201d <em>Aberdeen &amp; Rockfish R.

Judge Leven-thal has referred to the absurd consequences it would entail and I agree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Apart from the patent absurdity of the result suggested by appellee, I also find their claim in this respect to be contrary to the meaning that Congress has traditionally intended when it refers to \u201clegislation.\u201d This conclusion is supported by the precedents in Congress that evidence the distinction in the mind of Congress, as to what does and what does not constitute <em>legislation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Traditionally, Congress has distinguished between \u201clegislation\u201d and an \u201cappropriation.\u201d The congressional practice in this respect is set forth in L. Deschler\u2019s Procedure (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-7\">\u00a7 7. An item contained in a general appropriation bill must be authorized by law. Statutory authority for the appropriation must exist. . . . 119 Cong. Rec. p.-, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., June 5, 1973 [H.R. 8619].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\"><em>Id. </em>p. 266 (emphasis added). It is the law <em>authorizing </em>appropriations that Congress refers to as \u201clegislation,\u201d not the subsequently resulting appropriations. All appropriations must first be authorized by laws which emanate from the select committee having jurisdiction of that function of government, not from the Appropriations Committee. This distinction in meaning is pointedly set forth in the House Rule prohibiting the inclusion of <em>legislation </em>in appropriation bills:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-12\">\u00a7 1.1 The prohibition against inclusion of legislation in general appropriation bills is provided for by House rule. It states: \u201cNor shall any provision in any such bill or amendment thereto <em>changing existing law </em>be in order, except such as being germane to the subject matter of the bill shall retrench expenditures. . . \u201d (Clause 2 Rule XXI.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-14\">\u00a7 1.2 Language in an appropriation bill changing existing law is <em>legislation </em>and not in order. 105 Cong.Rec. 12125, 86th Cong. 1st Sess., June 29,1959 [H.R. 7978].</p>\n<p id=\"afc-dedup-0\">L. Deschler\u2019s Procedure, p. 295 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">While this rule is limited to general appropriation bills, the italicized passages clearly indicates that when Congress refers to \u201clegislation\u201d it means \u201cchanging existing law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-16\">In the same vein, legislation is defined as \u201cthe function of making <em>rules . . </em>.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1291 (3d ed. 1961) (emphasis added). The supply of a sum of money is not the making of a rule. Thus congressional and common English usage make it clear that the furnishing of money for previously authorized purposes is not <em>\u201clegislation.\u201d </em>The congressional precedents that support this interpretation are legion. However some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>courts may have interpreted \u201clegislation,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it is the intent of <em>Congress </em>that controls. And in my view when Congress in the Environmental Protection Act referred to \u201clegislation,\u201d with respect to legislation in Congress, it intended thereby to convey the same meaning as Congress customarily gives to the term when used in its own proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"a8z-dedup-0\">The construction of the Act here in question is controlled by what Congress intended and here as elsewhere Congress distinguished between \u201clegislation\u201d and \u201cappropriations.\u201d For example, Congress also very pointedly makes the same distinction in the criminal code between \u201clegislation or appropriations,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHL\">Congress also distinguishes between \u201clegislation\u201d and \u201cappropriations\u201d in 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2394(c)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A43I\">. any committee of the Congress charged with considering <em>legislation, appropriations </em>or expenditures under this chapter, has delivered . . .

(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT0\">Some courts have also noted the distinction. Justice Harlan in <em>Barenblatt v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 109, 79 S.Ct. 1081, 3 L.Ed.2d 1115 (1959) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHOp\">Since Congress may only investigate into those areas in which it may potentially <em>legislate or appropriate, </em>it cannot inquire into matters which are within the exclusive province of one of the other branches of the Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2FZ\">360 U.S. at 111-12, 79 S.Ct. at 1085 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AEzW\">This court in <em>Nixon v. Sirica, </em>159 U.S.App.D.C. 58, 487 F.2d 700 (1973) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az5\">Congressional control over <em>appropriations and legislation </em>is an excellent guarantee that the executive will not lightly reject a congressional request for information, for it is well aware that such a rejection increases the chance of getting either no legislation or undesired legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3i_\">159 U.S.App.D.C. at 66, 487 F.2d at 778 (emphasis added), quoting from Bishop, <em>The Executive\u2019s Right of Privacy: An Unresolved Constitutional Question, </em>66 Yale L.J. 477, 486 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"A6GT\">In <em>Schneider v. Lansdale, </em>191 Md. 317, 61 A.2d 671 (1948) the court noted that the circuit court had based its decision on the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apcf\">broad general proposition that the making of appropriations is a legislative function. The issue is much more narrow. It is whether the words \u201cenact legislation\u201d <em>as used in Article XIA, Sec. 3 of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number><em>Constitution </em>embrace every exercise of legislative power, in the broadest sense of that term, and specifically such matters as the making of budgets and the appropriation of money for county expenses . which may be, at least in part, legislative functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">61 A.2d at 673-74. The court held that the phrase \u201cenact legislation\u201d in the Maryland Constitution did not encompass the making of budgets and the appropriation of money for county expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">The Supreme Court of Arizona has also ruled similarly. In a case where the State Auditor contended that a general appropriation bill unconstitutionally violated the provision of the state\u2019s constitution restricting each act to one subject, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB6\">\n<em>The general appropriation bill is not in the true sense of the term \u201clegislation\u201d; it is, as the language implies, merely a setting apart of the funds necessary for the use and maintenance of the various departments of the state government already in existence and functioning.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ake-dedup-0\"><em>Sellers </em>v. <em>Frohmiller, </em>42 Ariz. 239, 24 P.2d 666, 669 (1933) (emphasis added). The court continued at 24 P.2d 670:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-6\">If an act which makes appropriations to the various departments of the state contains, <em>in addition to appropriations, legislation </em>of such a nature that its subject must be expressed in the title, this alone would immediately suggest that such legislation could not stand. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">The court sustained the auditor\u2019s position and denied the writ. This distinction between appropriations and legislation was also recognized in <em>Carr v. Frohmiller, </em>47 Ariz. 430, 56 P.2d 644 (1938), but a different result ensued because the bill did not contain more than one subject. This same distinction has been universally recognized by the parliamentary decisions in Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">All precedents in Congress, which in this respect go back as far as 1842, 4 Hinds\u2019 Precedents \u00a7 3811 (1907) (hereafter \u201cHinds\u2019 \u201d), make a distinction between \u201clegislation\u201d and the \u201cappropriation\u201d of money by Congress and prohibit the <em>change </em>of any existing laws (legislation) in any general appropriation bill. 4 Hinds\u2019 \u00a7 381 (1907), \u00a7\u00a7 3812, 3813. The enactment of positive law where none exists is construed as \u201cchanging existing law\u201d within the rule. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3812, 3813, and thus although the initial legislation <em>authorizing </em>a program in need of supply may be \u201clegislation,\u201d subsequent appropriations are not. For the lengthy list of congressional precedents involving decisions as to what constitutes legislation, <em>see </em>9 Cannon\u2019s Precedents, Index, pp. 190-91(72) (hereafter \u201cCannon\u2019s\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">Further support for the position that the intent of Congress was, and is, that \u201clegislation\u201d be restricted to those instances where there has been a \u201cchange of law\u201d is found in the doctrine that limitations upon appropriations are not considered to constitute legislation. 7 Cannon\u2019s \u00a7 1710. Thus, for example, an amendment that proposes to defer disbursements from an appropriation until a departmental regulation has been enforced does not constitute \u201clegislation,\u201d as it is a limitation on an appropriation bill. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 1581. Even when significant interests and policies are affected by such limitations they are still not considered to be \u201clegislation\u201d. For instance, Hinds\u2019 in \u00a7 3987 reports a ruling that it was in order, by a limitation on an appropriation bill, to withhold the appropriations from a designated object even though a <em>contractual obligation </em>of the United States for ocean mail service between the United States and foreign ports may thereby be left unsatisfied. It has also been ruled that a provision in an appropriation bill providing that no sums thereby appropriated for that year may be expended for a reformatory within a radius of ten miles of Mt. Vernon, except the one then located at Occoquan, Virginia, merely amounted to a limitation and was in order in an appropriation bill. 7 Cannon\u2019s \u00a7 1710 (1935). None of these limitations changed the law, <em>i. e., </em>the statute authorizing the appropriation, hence they were not \u201clegislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-12\">With respect to appellants\u2019 claim that a reduction in an appropriation from one year to another constitutes \u201clegislation,\u201d there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>are a number of precedential decisions in Congress specifically holding to the contrary. It has been ruled that action by the House cutting down an appropriation below the amount authorized by law is not considered to be legislation. That decision was made by Congressman Tilson of Connecticut who in ruling stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-5\">\u201cThe reason for that rule of limitation is simply this: The House in Committee of the Whole has the right to refuse to appropriate for any object which it may deem improper, although the object may be authorized by law; and it has been contended, and on various occasions sustained by the Committee of the Whole, that if the committee has the right to refuse to appropriate anything for a particular purpose authorized by law it can appropriate for only a part of that purpose and prohibit the use of the money for the rest of the purpose authorized by law. That principle of limitation has been sustained so repeatedly that it may be regarded as a part of the parliamentary law of the Committee of the Whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"adv-dedup-1\">7 Cannon\u2019s \u00a7 1710 (1935). The foregoing ruling relied upon a prior ruling by Congressman Dingley of Maine reported at 4 Hinds\u2019 \u00a7 3936, p. 632 (1907). Thus, retrenchment is not a change of existing law, i. e., it is not \u201clegislation\u201d as Congress uses that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Important restrictions on the expenditure of appropriated funds may be embodied in an appropriation bill without enacting \u201clegislation.\u201d In considering a bill for the appropriation of funds for the Commission of Fine Arts which provided that no part of such sums shall be expended for traveling expenses, other than those incurred by members of the Commission for actual travel only going to and returning from Washington to attend meetings of the Commission, it was ruled that such provision did not constitute legislation. While the provision would prohibit the use of funds for a purpose authorized by law it was nevertheless construed to be a proper limitation and not legislation. The reasoning underlying this ruling is that a provision refusing to continue appropriations to the maximum extent authorized by law, and for the maximum purposes authorized by law, does not amount of legislation. Cannon\u2019s \u00a7 1656.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">During the Sixty-Eighth Congress, existing law provided that investigations could be conducted upon the request of either House, or upon a concurrent resolution of both Houses. An amendment to an appropriation bill offered by Congressman Newton of Minnesota proposed that \u201cno part of the appropriation . . . shall be expended for investigations . . . except those authorized and directed by the concurrent resolution of both Houses.\u201d The Chair upheld such limitation in ruling \u201cthat Congress may appropriate for one object authorized by law and refuse to appropriate for another object authorized by law,\u201d <em>i. </em>e., without such selective appropriation being considered by Congress to constitute legislation. Cannon\u2019s \u00a7 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">The rule prohibiting legislation, in appropriation bills is also construed strictly in favor of the point of order. Cannon\u2019s \u00a7 1707. This permits any single Congressman easily to enforce the rule merely by raising a point of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">This long history, indicating that Congress, in its uniform practices, does not consider that the appropriation of money constitutes \u201clegislation,\u201d convinces me that when it referred to \u201clegislation\u201d in the Environmental Protection Act it did not intend \u201clegislation\u201d to include requests, for <em>authorized </em>appropriations, when the sums requested do not exceed or vary from the amount Congress has fixed in its <em>statutory authorization. </em>It is also evident that the foregoing precedents demonstrate that Congress did not intend to include the rise and fall of annual appropriations for authorized purposes, and within authorized limits, as being within the ambit of \u201clegislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">While appellees cite the Guidelines of the Council on Environmental Quality, 38 Fed. Reg. 20550, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500 <em>et seq., </em>as expert opinion that Congress in NEPA intended to include budget requests within the scope of the EIS requirement applicable to \u201cproposals for legislation ... or major federal action,\u201d it is my view that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>language of these Guidelines is not inconsistent with interpreting the EIS requirement to apply only to legislation <em>authorizing </em>appropriations, <em>i. e., </em>to alterations in the existing law, not merely annual budget requests.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This conclusion can be reached by comparing the Guidelines\u2019 use of \u201cproposals for legislation\u201d and their reference to \u201cauthorizations.\u201d In any event, the CEQ Guidelines were obviously basing the regulations on the terminology of the statute and \u2014 for the reasons hereinbefore outlined \u2014 this language does not equate requests for <em>appropriations </em>with proposals for <em>legislation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">\n<em>Budget Requests as Proposals for Major Federal Action?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Appellees need not persuade that budget requests are \u201cproposals for legislation\u201d in order successfully to contend that such requests should be subject to the EIS requirement, if it can demonstrate that these requests should be considered as \u201cproposals for major federal action.\u201d Common sense, however, mandates giving short shrift to this leg of appellees\u2019 argument. The NWRS in this case has not proposed any change in budget appropriations, but rather has merely initiated a routine, continuing request for funding. When such requests are made for the first time, thus commencing a new program, or conversely where a decision is made to request no funding at all, thus terminating a program, perhaps such action could plausibly be considered \u201cmajor\u201d; but I cannot agree that a routine, annual budget request within the existing legislative authorization, differing in no major degree from those submitted in the past, can credibly be deemed \u201ca proposal for major federal action.\u201d Congress would never consider such action as \u201cmajor,\u201d and it is the intendment of Congress that is controlling. The continuation of annual funding \u2014 naturally reflecting, in the size of the request, the vicissitudes of economics and elections \u2014 works no change in the law. Far from being an example of \u201cmajor federal action,\u201d it might more properly be considered the result of \u201cfederal inertia.\u201d As has been shown above in refuting the argument that a budget request is a proposal for legislation, supply has traditionally not been deemed to involve a change in the law. Although the CEQ\u2019s regulation, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.5(a), stating that \u201caction\u201d includes \u201crequests for appropriations\u201d is entitled to considerable deference, I find no indication whatsoever that Congress meant to elevate normal annual supply concerns to the dignity of \u201cproposals for . . . major federal actions.\u201d Accordingly, I disagree with the Council\u2019s interpretation of the scope of such term and find EIS requirements inapplicable to the annual budget requests of the NWRS which are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-15\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-16\">\n<em>Requiring an EIS on the Budget Requests and the Traditional Confidentiality of Such Requests</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-17\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 provides that \u201crequests for appropriations which are sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>mitted to the Office of Management and Budget by the head of any department or establishment shall be prepared and submitted as <em>the President may determine </em>in accordance with the provisions of section 11 of this title . . . \u201d This generally calls for various agencies submitting their requests to the President through the OMB. The President reviews all these requests, makes his own decision thereon and then consolidates them in the form of an annual budget which he transmits to Congress. In this connection, pursuant to the authority conferred upon him by the statute that such requests \u201cbe prepared and submitted <em>as the President may determine,\u201d </em>(emphasis added) <em>(Id.), </em>the President has determined, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-6\">3. <em>Restrictions on disclosure of agency estimates. </em>All budget estimates and supporting materials submitted to the Bureau of the Budget are privileged communications. Their confidential nature must be maintained, since they are the basic data and worksheets in the process by which the President resolves budget problems and arrives at conclusions with respect to his recommendations to the Congress. The head of each agency is responsible for preventing disclosure of information contained in such estimates and materials except on request in formal appropriation hearings and when requested by Members of the Congress in connection with their consideration of the budget after its transmittal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">Circular A-10, revised Jan. 18, 1964, Executive Office of the President, Bureau of the Budget, App. 225. The confidential status of such requests is a matter of long standing dating at least from the 1930\u2019s, App. 242, 243, and even after the President has considered budget requests from the various agencies and decided upon the budget he will submit to Congress, the nature and amounts of the appropriations he has determined to request are confidential and are not publicly released until the budget is actually transmitted to Congress. App. 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">This confidentiality of budget requests until they are formally submitted to Congress by the President is irreconcilable with the appellees\u2019 position that these requests should be the subject of Environmental Impact Statements. Congress has been aware of the confidential nature of budget requests, and despite extensive recent legislation concerning the budget process<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> has at no time explicitly suggested that EISs should be filed covering such requests. Perhaps even more significantly, Congress when it so intended has specifically removed the confidentiality of the budget requests submitted by certain agencies. The Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> are examples of agencies whose budget requests have lost the protection of confidentiality. Congress, however, refrained from taking such legislative action with respect to either the Department of the Interior or the OMB.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">Moreover, the amendments Congress enacted to the Freedom of Information Act,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> evince no intent to alter the confidential nature of the communications between the President and units within the Executive Office. The conference report on the 1974 amendments to the FOIA explicitly stated that the term \u201cExecutive Office of the President,\u201d from which disclosure could be required under the Act, \u201cis not to be inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>preted as including the President\u2019s immediate personal staff or units in the Executive Office whose sole function is to advise and assist the President.\u201d It is quite true that, by statute, the OMB gives advice to the Congress as well as to the President,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> so some of its activities would fall outside of the above proviso in the conference committee report, but to the extent that \u201cunits\u201d exist within OMB \u201cwhose sole function is to advise and assist the President,\u201d such activities could be within the proviso. In this connection, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1303.20(b) states that certain units of the OMB do indeed \u201csolely advise and assist the President\u201d and that among these units are those that provide advice and assistance with regard to \u201cthe formulation and preparation of the Federal budget.\u201d This regulation is entitled to deference.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In light of the compelling evidence referred to above that Congress intended budget requests to remain confidential, I would not require an EIS to be submitted with the annual budget request of the NWRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-18\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-19\">\n<em>OMB and NEPA Obligations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-20\">In considering whether the Office of Management and Budget is \u201crequired to develop procedures to fulfill its [alleged] NEPA obligations in connection with the Budget process\u201d concerning the National Wildlife Refuge Service, it is my view that the present regulations of the Department of the Interior and its \u201cprocedures\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>quately comply with the requirements in that respect and therefore I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that the OMB is required to take the action it commands.</p>\n<p id=\"Agz\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"a1s-dedup-0\">In summary, I concur in the holding that the District Court committed error in rendering its declaratory ruling that each annual budget request for the National Wildlife Refuge Service must be accompanied by an Environmental Impact Statement, but I disagree with this court\u2019s conclusion that the Secretary of the Interior is under any legal obligation to prepare a programmatic environmental statement on the NWRS program. As the court\u2019s opinion points out, it would be absurd to construe the Environmental Protection Act and its implementing regulations to require an EIS with each annual budget request. In my view it is even more absurd \u2014 and equally contrary to the language of the statute \u2014 to construe the law and the regulation as requiring that the Agency is under any \u201cobligation\u201d to produce the half-way measure of a \u201cprogrammatic\u201d environmental statement. For the reasons set forth above, I do not feel that an EIS is ever required at the clearly . pre-decisional stage at which the OMB or an agency submits a mere appropriation request which has yet to be formally incorporated into the budget transmitted to Congress by the President. I thus conclude that the OMB is not required to establish any new procedures in order to comply with NEPA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">. Appellees also maintain that as an alternative to demonstrating customary \u201cinjury in fact\u201d standing, they should be given standing because they were denied, by the NWRS and the OMB\u2019s failure to file EISs, \u201cthe information which would be provided by an environmental impact statement and the opportunity to comment on the statement and thereby to participate in the decisionmaking process.\u201d Brief for Appellees at 18.
