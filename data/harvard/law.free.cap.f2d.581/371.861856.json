Section 9-303(4)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-19\">\u201cIn consideration of privileges granted, every private alarm signal system licensee shall pay to the City, on the 15th of each month, 5% of his gross earnings, whether collected or not, during the previous month from the exercise, directly or indirectly, of the privileges granted by special ordinance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-20\">Central alarm station companies <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> furnish fire and/or burglar alarm services by transmitting signals from their customers\u2019 properties to central alarm stations over underground wires. Five such central alarm station companies have obtained, or seek to obtain, a special ordinance from the City of Philadelphia, as required under \u00a7 9-303, to operate their services by contracting for the use of existing underground lines maintained by Bell of Pennsylvania. These five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>central alarm station companies<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> brought suit against the City of Philadelphia<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, challenging the collection of moneys under \u00a7 9-303(4)(a). The gist of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that \u00a7 9-303(4)(a) applies only to licensed central alarm stations and not to other similarly situated users of Bell of Pennsylvania\u2019s underground wires. The central alarm station companies assert in their complaint that exacting fees from them, but not from other purchasers of Bell of Pennsylvania\u2019s services which involve transmissions along underground wires violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Article VIII, Section 1, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the state\u2019s Sterling Act, as amended, 53 P.S. \u00a7 15971(a). The complaint prayed for appropriate declaratory, equitable and legal relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The district court, by bench memorandum and order of July 21, 1977, dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on motion by the defendants on the ground that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (1976), deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">The Tax Injunction Act provides that; \u201cThe district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the district court\u2019s order of dismissal raises two issues of statutory construction: (1) whether \u00a7 9-303(4)(a) of the Philadelphia Code is a tax under State law,\u201d and (2) whether the central alarm station companies are afforded a \u201cplain, speedy and efficient\u201d state remedy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The central alarm station companies argue that amounts payable pursuant to \u00a7 9-303(4)(a) are not taxes under state law and hence suits to restrain their collection are beyond the prohibitory scope of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. The plaintiffs rely on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s characterization of the nature of payments made under a predecessor City ordinance to \u00a7 9-303(4)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201cBut the consideration exacted in the ordinance is neither a tax nor a license fee; it is in the nature of an annual rental to be paid for the privilege of the use of space under the streets . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\"><em>City of Philadelphia v. Holmes Electric Protective Co., </em>335 Pa. 273, 278, 6 A.2d 884, 887 (1939). Plaintiffs contend that this state judicial construction of the predecessor ordinance in the context of determining a municipality\u2019s immunity from the bar of state statutes of limitation should be binding in determining the application of a federal statute which explicitly restricts the subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts. The issue before us is whether Congress intended that the scope of the Tax Injunction Act\u2019s term \u201ctax under State law\u201d be given a uniform construction as a matter of federal law or a variable construction by reference to or incorporation of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals considered precisely this issue in <em>Tramel v. Schrader, </em>505 F.2d 1310 (5th Cir. 1975). In that case the court considered whether 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 barred a suit to enjoin the collection of special street improvements assessments which were alleged to be viola-tive of the plaintiff\u2019s federal constitutional rights. Texas state courts had defined these special assessments as other than \u201ctaxes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314-15. The <em>Tramel </em>court denied any controlling effect to state courts\u2019 distinctions between taxes and special assessments. The court reasoned that \u201c[t]he proper question is not what the Texas courts have said the Texas legislature meant when it used the term [\u2018taxes\u2019] but what Congress meant when it used the term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315 n.7. The <em>Tramel </em>court deemed it particularly inappropriate to draw on state definitions of taxes in contexts wholly different from the context of the Tax Injunction Act. In light of the particular purposes of the Tax Injunction Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the <em>Tramel </em>court concluded that the special street improvements assessments were the type of revenue collection Congress intended to insulate from federal court interference and hence were taxes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">We agree with the approach taken by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Tramel </em>that the meaning of the term \u201ctax under state law\u201d in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 should be determined as a matter of federal law by reference to congressional policies underlying the Tax Injunction Act, rather than by adoption of state tax labels developed in entirely different legal contexts. The <em>Holmes </em>decision, for example, labelled the City\u2019s ordinance as other than a tax in recognition of state policies unrelated to the purposes of the Tax Injunction Act. It is unlikely Congress meant for the federal courts to define the scope of the Tax Injunction Act and their own jurisdiction by adopting state labels from contexts inapposite to application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">Congress has on a few occasions expressly adopted or incorporated state law with recognition of its variable content to serve as the source of substantive, albeit non-uniform, federal law. But in instances of express incorporation, Congress evidences a particular purpose in conforming federal substantive standards of conduct to those which are applicable locally, while preserv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ing the federal nature of the law for subject matter jurisdiction purposes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For example, the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b) (1970), confers exclusive original jurisdiction in federal district courts over negligence actions against the United States, and calls explicitly for the application of the \u201claw of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d Similarly, The Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 (1976), explicitly incorporates state criminal law as the governing federal law in federal enclaves. <em>See United States v. Sharpnack, </em>355 U.S. 286, 78 S.Ct. 291, 2 L.Ed.2d 282 (1958). In both statutes Congress explicitly adopted state law as federal law to preserve federal question jurisdiction by means other than enactment of a comprehensive federal tort or criminal code.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">By contrast, in enacting the Tax Injunction Act, Congress did not intend to conform federal substantive law to state standards of individual conduct. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 is strictly a jurisdictional provision that withholds from federal courts their power to adjudicate certain controversies which might fall within other congressional grants of jurisdiction. The power to withhold from the federal courts original jurisdiction otherwise authorized in Article III is vested in Congress. U.S.Const., Art. Ill, \u00a7 2. Congress\u2019 power to implement or limit federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction is so fundamental that we decline to infer a congressional intent to leave a jurisdictional provision dependent on state law absent an unambiguous and express incorporation by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">We do not believe 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 expressly and unambiguously incorporates state judicial labels as to what are or are not taxes for purposes of state statutes completely unrelated to the policies of federal jurisdiction. The modifying clause \u201cunder State law\u201d should be plainly read to differentiate between state and federal taxes, not to adopt state law labels as to which revenue collections are taxes for state law purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Congress intended that the Tax Injunction Act be uniformly applied, consistent with the principles of federalism, comity and non-interference with state fiscal affairs embodied in the Act. <em>See Tuily v. Griffin, </em>429 U.S. 68, 73, 97 S.Ct. 219, 50 L.Ed.2d 227 (1976). These policies have been previously elaborated upon by this court in <em>Garrett v. Bamford, </em>538 F.2d 63 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 977, 97 S.Ct. 485, 50 L.Ed.2d 585 (1976), and by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Tramel. </em>One jurisdictional purpose of the Tax Injunction Act was to deprive out-of-state corporations of an advantage over state taxpayers in being able to threaten localities with protracted injunctive litigation in federal courts which induced the localities to compromise their tax claims. In-state taxpayers usually had to pay their disputed taxes and sue for a refund in state court. Congress intended that the Tax Injunction Act withdraw access to federal court by foreign corporations relying solely on diversity jurisdiction to resist state and local taxes. <em>Garrett, supra </em>at 66-67; <em>Tramel, supra </em>at 1315-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">In <em>Garrett </em>we identified a broader purpose behind the Tax Injunction Act to embody the judicially developed limits on federal equity jurisdiction articulated in <em>Matthews v. Rodgers, </em>284 U.S. 521, 52 S.Ct. 217, 76 L.Ed. 447 (1932). Before the passage of Tax Injunction Act, the Supreme Court in <em>Matthews </em>had held that federal courts would not grant equitable relief against the imposition of state taxes, even when challenged on federal constitutional grounds, as long as the state provided an adequate remedy. <em>Garrett, supra </em>at 67. Enactment of the Tax Injunction Act was prompted by the readiness of some lower federal courts to assert jurisdiction over state tax challenges despite the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition in <em>Matthews. See </em>90 Harv.L.Rev. 616, 617 n.17 (1977). Congress and the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Court deemed the comity principle inherent in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 especially important to avoid federal judicial interference with states\u2019 revenue raising operations and administration of their tax codes. <em>Garrett, supra </em>at 67, <em>quoting Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. Huffman, </em>319 U.S. 293, 298-99, 63 S.Ct. 1070, 87 L.Ed. 1407 (1943); <em>Trame], supra at </em>1315-16. Recent decisions of the Supreme Court reaffirm the unique strength of the rule that federal courts will not entertain anticipatory adjudication which interferes with state and local tax administration if there is an adequate state remedy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 472, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974); <em>Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., </em>405 U.S. 538, 542 n.6, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972); <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Ledesma, </em>401 U.S. 82, 126-28 &amp; n.17, 90 S.Ct. 2234, 26 L.Ed.2d 790 (1971) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Against the backdrop of the purposes of the Tax Injunction Act and the policies of federal equity practice, the <em>Holmes </em>opinion, relied on by the plaintiffs, is plainly inapposite. In <em>Holmes </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was not concerned with intrusive federal suits but, rather, with applying a state doctrine of municipal immunity from the bar of state statutes of limitation. The effect of the <em>Holmes </em>court\u2019s classification of the City\u2019s ordinance as a rental, rather than a licensee fee or a tax, was to bring the statute of limitation bar down on an action by the City to recover uncollected moneys over a 20-year period. The policies at stake in <em>Holmes </em>were those of repose and sovereign immunity, not the comity objective of restraining federal courts from interfering with state revenue raising. 353 Pa. at 278-81, 6 A.2d at 887-88. Thus, the state court\u2019s label of the City ordinance as a rental, not a tax, need not control our construction of the Tax Injunction Act in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">City ordinance \u00a7 9-303(4)(a) is a revenue raising measure collected annually in a manner similar to other gross receipts levies. From the record it appears that moneys collected are added to the public fisc, rather than applied exclusively to contractual services owed central alarm station companies. Anticipatory federal adjudication will clearly interfere with the City\u2019s collection of its revenues. Hence, we believe \u00a7 9-303(4)(a) is a \u201ctax\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Accordingly, the Tax Injunction Act bars the plaintiffs\u2019 suit if they are afforded a \u201cplain, speedy and efficient remedy\u201d by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\"><em>Garrett v. Bamford, supra, </em>teaches that the \u201cplain, speedy and efficient remedy\u201d requirement of the Tax Injunction Act is no more stringent than the judicially developed equity standard for the \u201cadequacy\u201d of state remedies. Moreover, if the availability of the state remedy be merely uncertain, it is inadequate. 538 F.2d at 67. <em>See Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O\u2019Con-nor, </em>340 U.S. 602, 605, 71 S.Ct. 508, 95 L.Ed. 573 (1951); <em>Township of Hillsborough </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>326 U.S. 620, 624, 66 S.Ct. 53, 90 L.Ed. 415 (1946); <em>Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin, </em>323 U.S. 101, 105-06, 65 S.Ct. 152, 89 L.Ed. 101 (1944); Hart and Wechsler, <em>supra </em>note 7, at 978-79. We must review the adequacy and availability of legal and equitable relief afforded the plaintiff-taxpayers in state court by way of direct action or on an appeal from an administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">The Philadelphia Code offers taxpayers two avenues of administrative relief. Section 19-1702 authorizes individuals to peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>tion the Tax Review Board for review of the Department of Collections\u2019 determination that the taxpayer has incurred liability on <em>unpaid </em>taxes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Alternatively, the taxpayer may pay the challenged tax and petition the Department of Collections for a refund pursuant to \u00a7 19-1703. Refunds may be sought for amounts \u201cpaid under mistake of law or fact, or under an invalid law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Grants or denials of refunds are reviewable by the Tax Review Board. Philadelphia Code \u00a7\u00a7 19-1703(4), (7). There is no dispute in this case that amounts levied under \u00a7 9-303 of the Philadelphia Code are reviewable administratively under both sections 19-1702 and 19-1703.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 19-1706 of the Philadelphia Code authorizes taxpayer appeals from adverse decisions by the Tax Review Board in either a deficiency or refund action to be taken to any court of competent jurisdiction. <em>See City of Philadelphia </em>v. <em>Kenny, </em>28 Pa.Cmwlth. 531, 545\u2014 46, 369 A.2d 1343, 1351, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 923, 98 S.Ct. 401, 54 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977). In <em>Non-Resident Taxpayers Ass\u2019n v. Municipality of Philadelphia, </em>478 F.2d 456, 458 (3d Cir. 1973), this court held that these same provisions for resort to the City of Philadelphia\u2019s Tax Review Board, followed by appeal to the state court, constituted a plain, speedy and effective remedy, barring a federal equity action pursuant to \u00a7 1341. <em>See also City of Houston v. Standard-Triumph Motor Co., </em>347 F.2d 194, 199 (5th Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 974, 86 S.Ct. 539, 15 L.Ed.2d 466 (1966). The <em>Non-Resident Taxpayers </em>case upheld the dismissal of a federal injunctive action challenging the right of the City of Philadelphia to impose a wage tax on nonresidents of the City employed in a federal enclave within the City\u2019s limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">On their face the City of Philadelphia Code\u2019s provisions for administrative action and subsequent judicial review are plain, speedy and efficient remedies adequate to bar a taxpayer\u2019s initial resort to a federal equity action. However, the plaintiffs contend that the remedies available to them are virtually identical to those held inadequate to bar a federal equity action in <em>Garrett v. Bamford. </em>There is no inconsistency between our court\u2019s decisions in <em>NonResident Taxpayers </em>and in <em>Garrett. </em>The circumstances which rendered administrative action and judicial review inadequate in <em>Garrett </em>were not present in either <em>NonResident Taxpayers </em>or in this case. Plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to analogize their position to that of the taxpayer-suitors in <em>Garrett </em>are not convincing. In short, we believe <em>Garrett\u2019s </em>conclusion of an inadequate state remedy is inapposite to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">In <em>Garrett, </em>residents of a predominantly non-white area of Berks County, Pennsylvania, brought a class action in federal district court claiming that the county\u2019s method of assessment was racially discriminatory, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court dismissed the claim for equitable relief. We reversed and held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>available statutory review of administrative proceedings was not a plain, speedy and efficient remedy in those cases where \u201cplaintiffs allege systematic and intentional class-based racial discrimination in tax assessments . . . 538 F.2d at 72.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">In <em>Garrett </em>property taxpayers had available to them a statutory remedy of an action before the local Board of Assessment Appeals, followed by state judicial review of an adverse decision by the Board. This court noted two substantial inadequacies with this remedy for the particular plaintiffs before us in that case. First, the taxpayers were challenging an area-wide pattern of discrimination, rather than individual assessments. However, state law apparently did not permit a class action in state court unless all class members had exhausted their administrative remedies. Such an exhaustion requirement was prohibitively expensive for many of the low income class members who would have had to appeal individually to the Board of Assessment Appeals and present costly expert testimony as to fair market values. Second, the statutory procedure for review of assessments was tailored to providing relief only for <em>one </em>tax year. In light of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of systematic and intentional discrimination, there was a prospect for repetitive constitutional violations. The plaintiff taxpayers would have been forced to bring successive challenges to individual assessments year after year. By contrast to the protracted proceedings made necessary under the state\u2019s statutory remedy, a federal equity court could issue a continuing injunction, effective for the entire class, precluding the need for a multiplicity of suits by each taxpayer over a period of time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">In this case there is simply no comparable inadequacy in the state\u2019s statutory remedy, for there is no prospect of multiple suits, either by similarly situated property owners or in successive suits each year. In <em>Garrett </em>we emphasized that the crux of plaintiffs\u2019 challenge was to the method of assessment, rather than the levy of the property tax itself. In this case, each of the five central alarm station companies challenge the validity of \u00a7 9-303(4)(a). The crux of their challenge is to the alleged discrimination between central alarm station companies who are taxed on their gross receipts and all other purchasers of Bell of Pennsylvania\u2019s services who are not taxed on their gross receipts. Such a claim of discrimination does not require factual inquiry into each individual\u2019s property values or the systematic method of assessment. Nor is there occasion for proof of intent from systematic discrimination. Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection arguments turn solely on the \u201cminimum rationality\u201d of the City\u2019s classification of central alarm station companies as distinct from other purchasers of Bell\u2019s services who, of necessity, use underground wires.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The constitutional core <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint may be effectively litigated by one company in state court for the future benefit of all central station alarm companies. A decision by the Tax Review Board or the state courts in any single proceeding or suit that \u00a7 9-303(4)(a) is invalid will bind the City and accomplish all the relief sought by the five central alarm station companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">We conclude that the central alarm station companies are not in the same position as were the plaintiff-taxpayers in <em>Garrett v. Bamford. </em>In this case the plaintiffs have a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy at state law with which to resolve their complaint that \u00a7 9-303(4)(a) unconstitutionally deprives them of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Finally, the plaintiffs contend that the statutory remedies available to them have not proven plain, speedy or efficient in practice. From the record it appears that only one of the five central alarm station companies, Robinson Protective Alarm Company (Robinson), has resorted to the administrative process. In January 1972, Robinson filed a petition for refund covering payments made under \u00a7 9-303(4)(a) for the period December 1965-December 1971. Since December 1971, Robinson has refused to pay any amounts collectible under \u00a7 9-303(4)(a) on the ground that the ordinance is unconstitutional. By March 1977, when the five central alarm station companies filed their complaint in federal district court, the Tax Review Board had not taken action on either Robinson\u2019s refund or its delinquency suits. There is no evidence in the record to indicate that Robinson\u2019s situation represents anything more than an isolated occurrence of delay attributable to both litigants. In the absence of any evidence in plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits or other submissions that other taxpayers have been disadvantageously delayed in pursuing their administrative remedies, we decline to infer from this litigation by one taxpayer that the statutory remedies available to City taxpayers which are adequate on their face are not generally adequate in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-11\">. In \u00a7 9-303(l)(c) \u201cprivate alarm signal system licensees\u201d are defined as central alarm stations which have obtained a special ordinance granting them the privilege of using underground wires.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-4\">. The five plaintiffs are Robinson Protective Alarm Co., Wells Fargo Alarm Services, Honeywell Protection Services, Burns Electronic Security Services, Inc. and Sheppard Alarm Co., Inc. As of the time of their complaint, Sheppard Alarm Co., Inc. was in the process of applying for a special ordinance to conduct its business in compliance with \u00a7 9-303. The other four plaintiff-companies operated pursuant to the terms of valid special ordinances granted each of them. In this opinion, all five plaintiff-companies will be referred to collectively as the central alarm station companies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b465-5\">. The complaint also named as defendants four City officers charged with enforcement and collection of moneys under \u00a7 9-303.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\">. In particular, the complaint requested the following: declaratory judgments that \u00a7 9-303, as applied to plaintiffs, violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Article VIII, Section 1, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and the Sterling Act; an injunction barring the City\u2019s enforcement of \u00a7 9-303 against the plaintiffs; and refund of all sums paid by plaintiffs pursuant to \u00a7 9-303 within the past six years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\">. The plaintiffs do not contend that suits which couple requests for declaratory and refund relief with a request for an injunction are beyond the scope of the Tax Injunction Act. The fact that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint seeks forms of relief comparable to an injunction in their interference with state and local tax administration renders this suit within the possible reach of the Tax Injunction Act. See <em>Kelly v. Springett, </em>527 F.2d 1090, 1094 (9th Cir. 1975) (\u00a7 1341 applies to suits for refunds as well as to anticipatory relief); <em>28 East Jackson Enterprises, Inc. v. Cullerton, </em>523 F.2d 439, 440 n.2 (6th Cir. 1975), <em>cert, denied, </em>423 U.S. 1073, 96 S.Ct. 856, 47 L.Ed.2d 83 (1976) (\u00a7 1341 applies to complaint which joins requests for injunctive relief with damages and a declaratory judgment). See <em>also Perez v. Ledesma, </em>401 U.S. 82, 127 n.17, 91 S.Ct. 674, 27 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>Township of Hillsborough v.

Garrett, supra, concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201c[A]s a general rule, injunctive or declaratory relief against state taxes can be sought in federal court only when the forums provided by the state are inadequate to the task.\u201d 538 F.2d at 67.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">. In the different context of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952, the Supreme Court declined to mechanically adopt state law labels of covered crimes even though the federal statute expressly incorporated state law. In <em>United States v. Nardello, </em>393 U.S. 286, 89 S.Ct. 534, 21 L.Ed.2d 487 (1969), the Court defined crimes covered by the Travel Act not by strict regard to state classification but by reference to the congressional policies of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><em>. </em>Section 19-1702(1) reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201c(1) Every petition for review of any decision or determination relating to the liability of any person for any unpaid money or claim collectible by the Department of Collections including, but not limited to, any tax, water or sewer rent, license fee or other charge, and interest and penalties thereon, shall be filed with the Tax Review Board within 60 days after the mailing of a notice of such decision or determination to the petitioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">. Section 19-1703(l)(a) reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">\u201c(l)(a) The Department of Collections may grant a refund, in whole or in part, upon determination that a tax, water or sewer rent, license fee or other charge, interest or penalty, or any part thereof, has been paid under mistake of law or fact, or under an invalid law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b469-12\">. A plain reading of \u00a7\u00a7 19-1702 and 19-1703 makes clear that amounts payable under \u00a7 9-303(4)(a) may be challenged by way of either deficiency or refund actions. Even applying the <em>Holmes </em>decision\u2019s labelling of the levy on use of underground wires as a rental, such rentals are surely analogous to water and sewer rents explicitly covered in \u00a7\u00a7 19-1702 and 19-1703. Furthermore, \u00a7 9-303(4)(b) makes amounts due collectible by the Department of Collections, bringing these charges within the express scope of \u00a7\u00a7 19-1702 and 19-1703. As we emphasized in part 1 above, we may refer to amounts payable for use of the underground wires as taxes in the generic sense of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 even if they are not strictly labelled as taxes under the City\u2019s ordinances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b470-5\">. <em>Garrett </em>also relied on the uncertainty of availability of state equitable relief for the plaintiff class.- 538 F.2d at 68-70. The availability of a direct equitable action in state court may be in some cases an adequate remedy, but it certainly is not an exclusive source of an adequate state remedy. Thus, we need not determine in this case whether Pennsylvania equity courts would entertain a constitutional challenge to \u00a7 9-303(4)(a) without prior resort to the statutory remedy of administrative action reviewable in the Pennsylvania courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\">. <em>Garrett </em>concluded that under governing case law Pennsylvania equity courts would not issue an injunction in that case, involving, as it did, a challenge to the method of assessment rather than to the underlying tax statute. 538 F.2d at 68-70.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b470-9\">. In equal protection adjudication courts review economic classifications with only minimum scrutiny, in contrast to the strict scrutiny given racial classifications. <em>Compare New Orleans v. Dukes, </em>427 U.S. 297, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976), and <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., </em>348 U.S. 483, 75 S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955), <em>with Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, </em>- U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978), and <em>Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, </em>383 U.S. 663, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966). Where state tax codes utilize classifications which are constitutionally suspect, triggering strict scrutiny, we may require greater certainty of the adequacy of the state remedy before closing the federal equity courthouse door. However, where state taxpayers\u2019 constitutional challenge necessitates only minimum scrutiny of the rationality of economic classifications, a somewhat less strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>certainty as to the adequacy of state remedies may be sufficient. <em>See </em>Case Comment, \u201cRacial Discrimination and The Tax Injunction Act: <em>Garrett v. Bamford,\u201d </em>90 Harv.L.Rev. 616, 622-26 (1977). In this case plaintiffs\u2019 Fourteenth Amendment contentions require only minimum scrutiny by contrast to <em>Garrett.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
