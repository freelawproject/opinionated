Herzog\u2019s opinion, <em>In Re San Cristobal Development Corporation, </em>17 CBC -(1978). Judge Herzog ruled that by filing the application in the Chapter XI proceedings, the mortgagee did not impliedly consent to the bankruptcy court\u2019s summary jurisdiction over the breach of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tract action, which was commenced after the application was filed. The contract action was therefore dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by Judge Herzog. On appeal to the district court, the judgment of the bankruptcy judge was affirmed. The instant appeal was taken from the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Upon due consideration of the record, briefs, and applicable law, we uphold the district court\u2019s judgment. As we are in agreement with the analysis contained in Judge Herzog\u2019s comprehensive opinion, we affirm on the basis of the reasoning set forth therein.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b397-15\"> The debtor-mortgagor\u2019s conclusory allegations concerning the mortgagee\u2019s conduct at the first meeting of creditors, including the mortgagee\u2019s request that the meeting not be continued and that the Chapter XI proceeding be dismissed, also fail to convince us that the bankruptcy court erred in holding that the mortgagee did not impliedly consent to the court\u2019s summary jurisdiction over the. debtor-mortgagor\u2019s contract action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
