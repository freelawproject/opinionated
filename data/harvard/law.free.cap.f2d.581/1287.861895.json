We hold that it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-8\">On July 15, 1976, Wilbur Kephart commenced an action against the Institute of Gas Technology, alleging that he had been discharged by IGT in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. The district court found, however, that Kephart had failed to comply with the Act\u2019s requirement that notice of intent to sue be filed within 180 days of the \u201calleged unlawful practice,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, on this ground, entered summary judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-9\">At the heart of the trial court\u2019s ruling was its conclusion that the 180 day notice requirement of \u00a7 626(d) is a jurisdictional prerequisite that is not subject to equitable tolling. In recent years, however, courts of appeal have generally taken the opposite view, holding \u00a7 626(d) to be more in the nature of a statute of limitation and therefore subject to equitable modification. <em>See, </em>e. g., <em>Bonham v. Dresser Industries, Inc.,. </em>569 F.2d 187 (3rd Cir. 1978); <em>Gabriele v. Chrysler Corporation, </em>573 F.2d 949 (6th Cir. 1978); <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Company, </em>539 F.2d 1256 (10th Cir. 1976), <em>aff\u2019d </em>by an equally divided court, 434 U.S. 99, 98 S.Ct. 600, 54 L.Ed.2d 270 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-16\">\u25a0 In reaching this result, the courts have relied principally on the \u201cdesign and purposes\u201d of the ADEA, finding both the Act\u2019s legislative history and analogies to Title VII to be of little guidance. Thus, in <em>Bon-ham v. Dresser Industries, </em>for example, the Third Circuit based its conclusion that the 180 day period is not jurisdictional on its recognition that the ADEA is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"art-dedup-0\">\u201cremedial and humanitarian legislation which should be liberally interpreted to effectuate the congressional purpose of ending age discrimination in employment. Circumstances may exist where, notwithstanding plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with the letter of the law, the purposes of the statutory requirement-providing the Secretary of Labor with an opportunity to conciliate while the complaint is fresh and giving early notice to the employer of possible litigation \u2014 have been substantially served. And cases may arise where the employer\u2019s own acts or omissions have lulled the plaintiff into foregoing prompt attempts to vindicate his rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-17\">569 F.2d at 193 (citations omitted). See also <em>Dartt, supra </em>at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-18\">We find this view persuasive, particularly in light of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act Amendments of 1978 (Public Law 95-256, enacted April 6,1978). Significantly, the amended version of the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>retains the 180 day filing requirement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but the \u201cJoint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference\u201d clarifies the requirement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-5\">\u201cThe conferees agree that the \u2018charge\u2019 requirement is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to maintaining an action under the ADEA and that therefore equitable modification for failing to file within the time period will be available to plaintiffs under this Act. See, e. g., <em>Dartt v. Shell Oil Co., </em>539 F.2d 1256 (10th Cir. 1976), <em>aff'd </em>by an evenly divided court, 434 U.S. 99, 98 S.Ct. 600, 54 L.Ed.2d 270 (1977); <em>Bonham v. Dresser Industries, Inc., </em>569 F.2d 187 (3rd Cir. 1977); <em>Charlier v. S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., </em>556 F.2d 761 (5th Cir. 1977).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">Conf. Re. H.R.Rep. No. 95-950, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 12 (1978), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. -. At the very least, this explanation reflects a Congressional understanding that a construction of \u00a7 626(d) which permits equitable tolling is consistent with the larger design and purposes of the Act. We conclude, therefore, that the 180 day notice requirement of the ADEA is not a strict jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court and that it is thus subject to equitable modification when necessary to effect the remedial purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-10\">The question thus becomes whether the plaintiff has alleged facts which, if accepted as true, are sufficient to establish an equitable basis for tolling the time limitations of \u00a7 626(d). In particular, we must decide whether Kephart\u2019s claim that IGT failed to post any notice which advised employees of the existence of the Act would, if proven at trial, provide sufficient equitable grounds for tolling the 180 day requirement. We hold that it would.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-16\">Section 627 of the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-17\">\u201cEvery employer . . . shall post and keep posted . . . upon its premises a notice to be prepared or approved by the Secretary setting forth information as the Secretary deems appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1381-20\">Such notice, moreover, must be posted in a prominent place on the employer\u2019s premises. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 850.10 (1976). It is quite apparent that Congress imposed this requirement on employers to insure that protected employees would be fully informed of their rights under the ADEA. And it is equally apparent that this end would not be realized if employers were free to breach the posting requirement without penalty. It is our conclusion, therefore, that the 180 day notice limitation of \u00a7 626(d) is tolled by the employer\u2019s failure to post conspicuously notice of ADEA rights, and that in such circumstances, the 180 day period will begin to run when the employee either retains an attorney or acquires actual knowledge of his rights under the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-21\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings on the tolling question consistent with the views expressed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-22\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1380-10\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-11\">\u201cNo civil action may be commenced by any individual under this section until the individual has given the Secretary not less than sixty days\u2019 notice of an intent to file such action. Such notice shall be filed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-12\">(1) within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-13\">(2) in a case to which section 633(b) of the title applies, within three hundred days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred or within thirty days after receipt of the individual of notice of termination of proceedings under State law, whichever is earlier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-14\">In this connection, we note our agreement with the district court that the date of the \u201calleged unlawful practice\u201d is not affected by the continued receipt of certain employee benefits <em>after </em>the employee has been removed from the payroll and <em>after </em>he has ceased working for the employer. In this case, the plaintiff received a memorandum in late November, 1974, which informed him of his. termination. He vacated his office in early December, 1974, and received his last pay check on February 21, 1975. In our view, the district court was thus quite correct in fixing the date of the \u201calleged unlawful practice\u201d on February 28, 1975, the date the plaintiff was administratively removed from the payroll.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1381-11\">.
