We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1-\">1. <em>History at the PTO</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ahx\">The original application, serial No. 273, filed on January 2, 1970, had 25 claims. By amendment on May 21, 1971, claims 26-46 were substituted for claims 1-25, claim 26 corresponding to original claim 1. In a second amendment, dated September 28, 1971, claims 26-46 were cancelled<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and claims 47-49 were substituted, corresponding to claims 22, 24 and 25. Claims 47-49 were allowed, and renumbered as 1-3, and issued in patent No. 3,667,590 on June 6, 1972.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-22\">Reissue application serial No. 393,539 was filed August 31, 1973. It broadened claims 1-3 of the patent, and added claims 4 and 5. In response to a rejection for an insufficient reissue declaration, the first declaration by the attorney then of record, Young, was filed on September 16, 1974, setting forth facts concerning when and how the errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>alleged to render the patent inoperative occurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, claim 5 was can-celled, and claims 6-9 added. Claims 1-3 and 6-8 were allowed and claims 4 and 9 rejected.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Subsequently, an amendment filed (but not entered) added claim 10.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In order to continue prosecution of claims 4, 9 and 10, continuation application serial No. 572,357 (the present application) was filed August 25, 1975, including claims 1-5 from the parent application. By preliminary amendment, claim 5 was cancelled, and claims 6-10 from the reissue application added. In response to another rejection of claims 4, 9 and 10 for an insufficient reissue declaration, a second declaration of Young was filed on November 21, 1975 containing statements identical to those of the first. Claims 1-3 and 6-8 were then allowed, but claims 4, 9 and 10 were finally rejected under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cas not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>being for matter which might have been claimed in the original patent,\u201d being directed to an independent and distinct invention not claimed in the original patent such that the patentee had not claimed less than he had a right to claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Appellant argued before the board that: (1) the subject matter of claims 4, 9 and 10 was disclosed in the original patent, and the original specification is clear in its preference for the invention described in those claims; and (2) whether or not the subject matter of claims 4, 9 and 10 is directed to an invention independent and distinct from that claimed in the original patent, applicant had a <em>right </em>to claim the invention of the rejected claims in the original patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In a reply brief refused entry by the Commissioner, appellant further argued that the objective intent to make the rejected claims manifested by the original patent could not be determined from Young\u2019s after-the-fact declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The board sustained the \u00a7 251 rejection in toto, finding, on the basis of Young\u2019s second declaration, that \u201cthe subject matter of the appealed claims was never intended to be claimed in the original patent but rather in a subsequent application,\u201d and therefore, the patent was not inoperative by reason of error. A double-patenting rejection based on Mead patent No. 3,995,738 was withdrawn upon a showing that the claims were not for the same invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">2. <em>History at this court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">On appeal to this court, appellant moved to supplement the record \u201cby insertion of his original patent No. 3,667,590 and its file history, and reissue application serial No. 393,539 (now abandoned) and its filed history * * <em>In re Mead, </em>569 F.2d 1128, 1129, 196 USPQ 811, 812 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App. 1978), alleging \u201c \u2018intent to claim\u2019 was the dispositive issue before the board * Id. at 1130, 196 USPQ at 813. The motion was granted on the basis that those materials \u201cwere required to be \u2018carefully studied\u2019 by the examiner,\u201d and the board, as \u201can integral element\u201d of the PTO \u201chas before it the \u2018evidence produced before the Patent and Trademark Office.\u2019 \u2019' Id. at 1129, 196 USPQ at 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">Appellant now argues that: (1) the original patent and its file history manifested an intent by the patentee to claim the relationship between bristle angle and vibration angle in the vibratory feeder recited in rejected claims 4, 9 and 10, and (2) the objective intent to claim that subject matter, having been manifested by the original patent and file history, is not negated by Young\u2019s later subjective declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">The PTO responds that: (1) the original patent and its file history, including claim 26, were not called to the attention of the examiner or the board, except in the non-entered reply brief, (2) appellant did not contest below the examiner\u2019s or the board\u2019s reliance on Young\u2019s declaration, (3) appellant\u2019s new evidence and arguments are not properly before this court, (4) cancelled claim 26 is substantially identical to claims 4, 9 and 10, and (5) the cancellation of claim 26 must be construed in light of Young\u2019s declaration as a voluntary election by appellant of the independent and distinct invention claimed in the original patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">The issue is whether patent No. 3,667,590 is partly inoperative: (1) by reason of the patentee claiming less than he had a right to claim in the patent, and (2) through statutory error without deceptive intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-16\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b346-18\">The examiner concluded that claims 4, 9, and 10 were directed an an independent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>distinct invention not claimed in the original patent on the basis they \u201crequire a specific vibrating means which the claims of the original patent do not require and the claims of the original patent require fluid dispensing means or two different types of bristles which claims 4, 9 and 10 do not require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The entire disclosure, not just the claims, is considered in determining what the patentee intended to claim and what invention the patent discloses. <em>In re Handel, </em>312 F.2d 943, 948, 50 CCPA 918, 924, 136 USPQ 460, 464 (1963). A review of the record shows that the original and the appealed claims are directed to different embodiments of the invention as disclosed in the specification, not to patentably distinct inventions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, with respect to the subject matter of the appealed claims, the original specification satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 112, first paragraph, such that appellant had the right to claim such subject matter, as required by \u00a7 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The examiner also concluded that the Young declaration negated the possibility that appellant intended to secure protection of the appealed subject matter by the original patent. Such a subjective test, based on \u201cintent to claim,\u201d is not relevant to the determination whether appellant claimed less than he had a right to claim. The proper test is that set forth in <em>In re Rowand, </em>526 F.2d 558, 560, 187 USPQ 487, 489 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1975), requiring \u201can essentially factual inquiry confined to the <em>objective </em>intent manifested by the original patent.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The concept of \u201cintent to claim\u201d originated in <em>Parker and Whipple Co. v. Yale Clock Co., </em>123 U.S. 87, 8 S.Ct. 38, 31 L.Ed. 100 (1887). The governing statute in that case, an infringement suit based on a reissue patent, was \u00a7 53 of the Act of July 8, 1870, c. 230, 16 Stat. 205, Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4916, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-14\">[Wjhenever any patent is inoperative or invalid, by reason of a defective or insufficient specification, or by reason of the patentee claiming as his own invention or discovery more than he had a right to claim as new, if the error has arisen by inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, the commissioner shall * * * cause a new patent for the <em>same invention, </em>and in accordance with the corrected specification, to be issued to the patentee. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">Citing <em>Seymour v. Osborne, </em>78 U.S. 516 (11 Wall.), 20 L.Ed. 33 (1870), the Court stated at 123 U.S. 98-99, 8 S.Ct. 44:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-16\">[T]he court adheres strictly to the view, that, under the statute, the commissioner has no jurisdiction to grant a reissued patent for an invention substantially different from that embodied in the original patent * * *. [T]he things * * * to be included [in the new description and new claims] are only the things which properly belonged to the invention as embodied in the original patent; that what that invention was is to be ascertained by consulting the original patent; and that, while the new description may properly' contain things which are indicated in the original specification, drawings or patent-office model, (though not sufficiently described in the original specification,) it does not follow that what was indicated in the original specification, drawings or patent-office model is to be considered as a part of the invention, unless the court can see, from a comparison of the two patents, that the original patent embod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ied, as <em>the invention intended to be secured </em>by it, what the claims of the reissue are intended to cover. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAP\"><em>Parker </em>was cited by the Supreme Court in <em>United States Industrial Chemicals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corp., </em>315 U.S. 668, 676, 62 S.Ct. 839, 843, 86 L.Ed. 1105, 53 USPQ 6, 9-10 (1942) for the proposition that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">If there be failure of disclosure in the original patent of matter claimed in the reissue, it will not aid the patentee that the matter covered by the reissue was within his knowledge when he applied for his original patent. And it is not enough that an invention might have been claimed in the original patent because it was suggested or indicated in the specification. It must appear from the face of the instrument that what is covered by the reissue was intended to have been covered and secured by the original. [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Thus, \u201cintent to claim\u201d arose from the requirement that the reissue be for the \u201csame invention\u201d as the original, i. e., that it cover what was \u201cintended to have been covered\u201d by the original. In <em>Handel, supra, </em>this court held that, although <em>Parker </em>and <em>Carbide </em>were decided prior to the Patent Act of 1952, which changed the wording of the reissue provision, the rule respecting consideration of the entire disclosure of the original patent remained unchanged. 312 F.2d at 948, 50 CCPA at 924, 136 USPQ at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The broad premise of <em>Carbide </em>was cited by this court in <em>Rowand, supra, </em>in which appellant attempted to obtain by reissue claims to a method of making tubing, the tubing itself being the subject of the original claims. The only description of the method in the patent was one stated to be \u201cin accordance with known practices,\u201d as \u201cappreciated by those skilled in the art.\u201d Id. 526 F.2d at 560, 187 USPQ at 489. We stated there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">Determining what protection appellants intended to secure by their original patent for the purposes of \u00a7 251 is an essentially factual inquiry confined to the <em>objective </em>intent manifested by the original patent. * * * * [T]here is nothing 'in the original patent evidencing that appellants intended to claim a method of making tubing or that appellants considered the method now claimed to be their invention. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARc\">Id. at 560, 187 USPQ at 489. Thus, in <em>Rowand </em>and similar cases, \u201cintent to claim\u201d has little to do with \u201cintent\u201d <em>per se, </em>but rather is analogous to the requirement of \u00a7 112, first paragraph that the specification contain \u201ca written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it.\u201d It is, as appellant urges, synonymous with \u201cright to claim.\u201d The Young declaration, and appellant\u2019s arguments relating thereto, are therefore irrelevant to appellant\u2019s \u201cright to claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The board affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection based on Young\u2019s declaration of appellant\u2019s intent to claim the appealed subject matter in some unspecified subsequent application. Similarly, the PTO\u2019s allegations of lack of error are based on Young\u2019s declaration, which, it is argued, proves that the subject matter of the appealed claims was never intended to be claimed in the original application, and therefore there was no error within the meaning of \u00a7 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Appellant\u2019s attempt on appeal to discredit the Young declaration is futile. The second Young declaration was submitted to specify the facts concerning when and how the errors alleged occurred and were discovered, and was accepted for that purpose by both the examiner and the board. Appellant now cannot complain because the declaration is being used for its intended purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">As is clear from the record, appellant\u2019s first attorney made a conscious choice <em>not </em>to file a continuing application claiming the appealed subject matter of claims 4, 9, and 10 during copendency with the application that matured into patent No. 3,667,590. Had there been copendency, appellant would not be faced with the present predicament. Apparently, the later application was planned to be filed within the one year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u201cgrace\u201d period permitted by the statute, during which time appellant\u2019s own patent No. 3,667,590 could not be cited against him as a statutory bar under \u00a7 102. Clearly, appellant did not know about the Japanese reference at the time the original patent issued. When his attorney made the conscious choice of breaking appellant\u2019s chain of copendency by letting the application issue, with the plan to claim in the subsequent application, he knew, or should have known, that there could exist intervening references (in this case, the Japanese reference) which could defeat patentability of the disclosed but unclaimed subject matter in the original patent. That intentional omission of the appealed subject matter from the original application combined with the plan to claim it in the subsequent application, does not constitute \u201cerror\u201d under \u00a7 251 because to permit appellant to use the reissue statute in this manner would defeat the purpose behind the copendency requirement of $120 of the statute. <em>Cf. In re Ori-ta, </em>550 F.2d 1277, 1281, 193 USPQ 145, 149 (Oust. &amp; Pat.App.1977). Therefore, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-5\">.

Young\u2019s declaration alleged two errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\">The second error, the absence of claims directed to the preferred relationship between bristle orientation and the direction of vibratory movement, was discovered as a result of the prosecution of a corresponding patent application in Japan. A reference, Japanese patent application 29098/69 came to the attention of Mr. Stephens [an earlier attorney of record] a few days before May 14, 1973, when Mr. Stephens wrote to the assignee to confirm a telephone report of May 11, 1973 regarding this Japanese reference. Prior to discovery of the Japanese reference, it was intended to obtain patent protection on the relationship between bristle angle and vibration angle from a subsequent U.S. patent application filed more than one year after the publication date of the Japanese reference. This approach was the reason for accepting the extremely narrow claims in U.S. patent 3,667,590, inasmuch as claims directed to the relationship between inclination angles was a primary focus of the subsequent U.S. patent application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-14\">The mistake which occasioned the specified error was a mistake about the state of the art, in that neither the applicant nor his counsel were aware of the Japanese reference, the existence of which was highly detrimental to the course of action then being pursued.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b345-15\">.
