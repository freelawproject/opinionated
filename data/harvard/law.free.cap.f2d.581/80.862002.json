We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">The evidence showed that Driver was behaving in a generally belligerent manner on the premises of the restaurant where the victim worked. Eventually an employee of the restaurant prevailed on Driver to accept a ride home, but the only available car belonged to the victim. She agreed to take Driver home, and they left in her car accompanied by a male employee of the restaurant. Driver ejected the employee from the car and ordered the victim to drive to a secluded spot where he raped her. After the rape Driver passed out in the victim\u2019s car, and she drove until she met a police vehicle. At trial, Driver\u2019s principal defense was that, because of intoxication, he had no recollection of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has held that testimony concerning a rape victim\u2019s sexual contacts on prior occasions with persons other than the defendant is ordinarily inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 404. <em>McLean v. United States, </em>377 A.2d 74, 77-78 (D.C.App.1977). In this carefully reasoned opinion, Judge Kern canvassed the authorities dealing with this issue, and his discussion supports the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in excluding the evidence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
