After exhausting his state remedies, he petitioned the United States District Court for a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Smith\u2019s habeas petition alleged that the state court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, on the grounds that the evidence was obtained in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment and under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The district court dismissed the petition with prejudice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-16\">Smith was arrested after being involved in a traffic accident on March 2, 1975. Smith was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and driving in violation of a restriction on his driver\u2019s license, and was taken to the Orange County, Florida jail. The arresting officer testified at the suppression hearing that at the time of arrest, Smith was \u201csinging,\u201d \u201chappy-go-lucky,\u201d \u201cwasn\u2019t worried about any possible penalties,\u201d had slurred speech, was flushed and watery eyed, and was incoherent in attempting to describe the accident. At the jailhouse, Smith was given a breathalizer test and scored .30, well above Florida\u2019s statutory presumption of intoxication level of .10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-17\">After Smith had been in his jail cell for about four hours, Deputy Sheriff Michael Wooten began an interview with Smith in Smith\u2019s jail cell. Officer Wooten informed Smith that the purpose of the interview was to obtain Smith\u2019s consent to a search of the truck Smith had been driving at the time of the accident, in order to look for evidence concerning an arson in the area. By the end of Officer Wooten\u2019s interview with Smith, which lasted twenty minutes, Smith had signed the consent to search form. The conduct of that interview is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-18\">Officer Wooten testified at the suppression hearing that Smith did not appear to him to be intoxicated to a point where his capacity to understand or communicate was affected. After he read Smith \u201chis rights\u201d from a standard card, a brief period of conversation concerning the consent form occurred, and then Smith indicated a desire to see his attorney. At that point, the following colloquy took place between the trial court and Officer Wooten:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-19\">THE COURT: Did he say that he wanted to speak to a lawyer, or do you recall exactly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-20\">THE WITNESS: I don\u2019t remember exactly, but he said Mr. Kirkland was his attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>THE COURT: What was your understanding when he mentioned the lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-5\">THE WITNESS: That he wanted\u2014 like to call him and see if he should discuss the form or anything about the form that we had presented to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-6\">THE COURT: Would you say that in your mind it created an idea that the defendant wanted some legal advice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-7\">THE WITNESS: Yes, to an extent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-8\">THE COURT: Why did you continue your questioning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-9\">THE WITNESS: Like I said, I can\u2019t remember who started talking about the form, but the form was brought back up and the form was discussed further.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">Wooten testified that although Smith\u2019s attorney was not called, Smith signed the search consent, and the evidence was seized from the truck. At the suppression hearing, Smith claimed that his consent was not freely and voluntarily given. He argued that once he mentioned his attorney, the interview should have ceased, and that the failure to immediately halt questioning, coupled with his state of intoxication and custody in jail, rendered the consent involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">The trial court denied the motion to suppress. Smith then pleaded nolo contendere, reserving the right to appeal the suppression ruling, and was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal the Florida appellate court affirmed without opinion, with one judge filing a dissenting opinion in which he argued that Smith\u2019s consent was not voluntary. <em>Smith v. State, </em>344 So.2d 867 (Fla.App.1977). Smith withdrew his application for certiorari to the Florida Supreme Court, and brought this federal ha-beas action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">In <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 494, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 3052, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim, a state prisoner may not be granted federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search or seizure was introduced at his trial.\u201d Smith\u2019s request for habeas relief must be denied under <em>Stone </em>unless he can demonstrate that he was not given an opportunity to fully and fairly litigate his claim in the Florida courts. <em>Hedden v. Wainwright, </em>558 F.2d 784 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>O\u2019Berry v. Wainwright, </em>546 F.2d 1204 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-14\">In <em>O\u2019Berry, </em>this court held that <em>Stone\u2019s </em>\u201cfull and fair opportunity to litigate\u201d requirement is satisfied if the state affords a defendant an evidentiary hearing to determine the factual basis for his Fourth Amendment challenge and provides an opportunity for meaningful appellate review by a higher state court. 546 F.2d 1219. <em>O\u2019Berry </em>further noted that <em>\u201cStone </em>only requires that the State provide an <em>opportunity </em>for full and fair adjudication of Fourth Amendment claims. <em>Id. Caver v. State of Alabama, </em>577 F.2d 1188 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-15\">In the case at bar Smith was given a full and fair opportunity to press his Fourth Amendment arguments in the Florida courts. The factual basis of Smith\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim was explored by the state trial judge at the suppression hearing. The arresting and interrogating officers were examined and cross-examined by both attorneys and the trial court. The trial judge discussed the voluntariness issue with counsel and found that the consent was voluntary. On appeal, the dissent was addressed exclusively to the voluntary consent issue, indicating that the appellate court also considered the Fourth Amendment claim. Having twice pressed his Fourth Amendment claim before Florida courts, Smith\u2019s habeas petition runs squarely into the interdiction of <em>Stone.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-16\">This result is-not altered by the fact that Smith\u2019s claim is based largely on the interrogating officer\u2019s failure to cease questioning once Smith mentioned a desire to see his attorney. If Smith\u2019s imprisonment were the result of a <em>confession </em>obtained after he asked to see his lawyer, this court would not be barred by <em>Stone </em>from considering, in this habeas petition, whether the state had violated <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>command that \u201cIf the individual states that he wants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. at 474, 86 S.Ct. at 1628.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No Fifth Amendment rights are at issue here, however. Smith\u2019s conviction is not the result of self-incriminating statements made to police, but the result of physical evidence seized from his truck. As this court stated in <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>496 F.2d 670, 675 (5th Cir. 1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-4\">In a fifth amendment context a defendant\u2019s statements, in and of themselves, present the potential constitutional evil. For purposes of the fourth amendment, however, it is an unreasonable search that must be condemned, not the use of a defendant\u2019s statements proving consent to a search. A search and seizure produces real and physical evidence, not self-incriminating evidence. Our task under the fourth amendment is to test the reasonableness of a search and exclude evidence procured unreasonably.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\"><em>Miranda </em>warnings are not constitutional rights in themselves, but are merely standards designed to safeguard the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Michigan v. Tucker, </em>417 U.S. 433, 444, 94 S.Ct. 2357, 2364, 41 L.Ed.2d 182 (1974). A consent to search is not a self-incriminating statement; \u201c[i]t is not in itself evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lemon, </em>550 F.2d 467, 472 (9th Cir. 1977). <em>See Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 761-64, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 1830, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966); <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 391, 408-14, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">The failure of the police to halt questioning once Smith mentioned his attorney, then is relevant only with regard to the Fourth Amendment issue of whether Smith\u2019s consent to search was voluntarily given. Under <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973), the failure to cease questioning would be a factor to be considered in \u201cthe totality of all [of] the circumstances.\u201d 412 U.S. at 227, 93 S.Ct. at 2048. The Florida courts considered Smith\u2019s request for an attorney in light of the <em>Schneckloth </em>standard. Reconsideration by this court is precisely what <em>Stone </em>forbids. <em>See Hedden v. Wainwright, </em>558 F.2d 784, 786 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">. <em>Nash v. Estelle, </em>560 F.2d 652 (5th Cir. 1977), now pending after reconsideration by this court en banc, is the latest instance in which this court has reviewed, on a petition for habeas corpus, the problem of continued interrogation by police after a suspect in custody has asked for a lawyer. <em>Nash, </em>and prior cases dealing with the problem, involved self-incriminating statements made after the request for an attorney, not consents to search. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Massey, </em>550 F.2d 300 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Priest, </em>409 F.2d 491 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
