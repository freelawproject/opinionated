One through three, in substance, all charged unlawful interference with plaintiff\u2019s outgoing mail by defendant prison officials. Claim 1 charged the interference was deliberate; Claim 2, that it was done in \u201cbad faith\u201d; and Claim 3, that it was done through the officials\u2019 negligence. The gravamen of Claims 4 through 6 was the termination of a law student visitation program in which plaintiff had participated and his removal as prison librarian; and Claims 7 through 9 sought to hold certain of the defendants vicariously liable for the conduct alleged in Claims 1 through 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">The district court granted defendants summary judgment as to Claims 1 through 3 (the mail claims) and dismissed the remaining six claims (Claims 4 through 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">On appeal, we reversed the district court\u2019s disposition of the first six claims, affirmed dismissal of the remaining three, and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Navarette v. Enomoto, </em>536 F.2d 277 (9th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">Defendants sought certiorari, which was granted, but limited solely \u201cto Question 1 presented by the petition.\u201d <em>Enomoto v.
