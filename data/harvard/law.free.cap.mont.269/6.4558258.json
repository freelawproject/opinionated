Credit was given for 239 days time served. The two sentences shall be served consecutively for a total of thirty (30) years.</p>\n<p id=\"ATZ\">On November 19,1993, the Defendant\u2019s application for review of that sentence was heard by the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"ADg\">The Defendant was present and was represented by Patrick Sherlock, Attorney from Kalispell. The State was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"A60\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>to increase it if such is possible. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A5zZ\">DATED this 19th day of November, 1993.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"AbLj\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aun1\">The reason for the decision is the sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct pursuant to Section 46-18-904(3), MCA. The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to deem inadequate or excessive as required to overcome the presumption per Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"A7r\">Hon.
