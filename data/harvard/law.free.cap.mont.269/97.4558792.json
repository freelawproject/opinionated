The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it if such is possible. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence remain the same as originally imposed, however, the Sentence Review Board recommends that it shall be left to the discretion of the Parole Board that the defendant be allowed to receive alcohol and/or drug treatment inside or outside of the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The reason for the decision is because a letter was received from Judge Davis recommending that the defendant be eligible for parole. The Sentence Review Board finds that the sentence imposed was lenient based upon the record, but the Sentence Review Board did not increase the sentence because of Judge Davis\u2019 letter.</p>\n<judges id=\"b564-12\">Hon. G. Todd Baugh, Chairman, Hon. John Warner and Hon. Ted Lympus, Members.</judges>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">The Sentence Review Board wishes to thank Sam Cox, Legal Intern from the Montana Defender Project, for his assistance to the defendant and to this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
