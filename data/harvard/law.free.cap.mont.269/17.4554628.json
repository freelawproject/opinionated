The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it if such is possible. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall remain the same as originally imposed, lb clarify the decision, the defendant is committed to the Department of Corrections for placement in an appropriate correctional institution or community based program. This is an unrestricted commitment and the Department of Corrections and Human Services has the authority to place the defendant in a facility as they deem appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The reason for the decision is the sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct pursuant to Section 46-18-904(3), MCA. The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to deem inadequate or excessive as required to overcome the presumption per Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b484-9\">Hon.
