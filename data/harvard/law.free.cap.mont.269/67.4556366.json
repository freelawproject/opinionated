The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it if such is possible. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence will be modified so as the defendant will receive credit in the amount of 76 days served during house arrest. Restitution will be required in the event that the defendant makes parole. All other portions of the sentence shall remain the same as originally imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The reason for the decision is that the defendant is entitled to receive credit for time served during house arrest.</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-11\">Hon. G. Todd Baugh, Chairman, Hon. John Warner and Hon. Ed McLean, Members.</judges>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">The Sentence Review Board wishes to thank Nik Geranios, Legal Intern from the Montana Defender Project for his assistance to the defendant and to this Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
