This period of incarceration is to be served consecutive to that imposed in Cause No. DC 91-159(B). Credit is given for seventy-eight (78) days.

The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division.

The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to deem inadequate or excessive as required to overcome the presumption per Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"AaK\">Hon.
