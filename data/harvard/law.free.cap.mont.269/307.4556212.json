We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Hatfield\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-18\">2. Whether cumulative error warrants a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-19\">This case was previously before us in <em>State v. Hatfield </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 340, 846 P.2d 1025 <em>(Hatfield I), </em>wherein Hatfield appealed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>convictions of the felony offenses of criminal sale of dangerous drugs and conspiracy to sell dangerous drugs. In <em>Hatfield I, </em>we upheld the conviction for the criminal sale of dangerous drugs, and reversed the conviction for conspiracy to sell dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The facts giving rise to the conviction for criminal sale of dangerous drugs are that Hatfield sold a small amount of marijuana to Hal Turner. Turner had been hired by the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Department as an undercover agent to buy drugs from anyone who would sell them. On the morning of December 30,1990, Hatfield and another individual, Robert Sprague, went to Turner\u2019s apartment, where according to Turner, Hatfield sold him a small amount of marijuana for $30. It is undisputed that, at the time of the sale, the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office was unaware of the transaction and was not supervising Turner; nor was Turner wearing a body wire. After the sale, Turner contacted Detective Klint Gassett, informed him of the transaction and turned the marijuana over to him. Equipped with an electronic monitor, Turner went to Hatfield\u2019s residence that evening in an effort to get a taped conversation with Hatfield concerning the earlier drug transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Hatfield denies selling the marijuana to Turner, and testified at trial that Sprague was the person who sold the marijuana to Turner. Hatfield claimed that Turner gave the $30 to him, rather than Sprague, because Sprague owed Hatfield money. On January 30, 1992, a jury found Hatfield guilty of one count of sale of criminal sale of dangerous drugs, and one count of conspiracy to sell dangerous drugs. Hatfield appealed his conviction to this Court and as stated above, we affirmed the conviction for the criminal sale of dangerous drugs, reversed the conspiracy conviction, and remanded the case to the District Court for resentencing. <em>Hatfield </em>J, 846 P.2d at 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We issued the Remittitur on March 1,1993. Thereafter, on March 8,1993, Hatfield filed a pro se motion for a new trial alleging among other things, that the State failed to disclose the employment contract between Turner and the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Counsel was appointed for Hatfield on October 4,1993, and ahearing on his motion for a new trial was held on November 22,1993. The parties stipulated to the following facts in a document entitled \u201cStipulation Regarding Discovery of Contract of Undercover Agency,\u201d which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">Defendant has moved the court for an Order granting to him a new trial due to newly discovered evidence, discovered following his first trial, to wit, the written contract of employment between the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the undercover agent, Hal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Turner. It is stipulated that defendant\u2019s first attorney, Don Shaffer, did not request the production of that contract from the State when he was representing defendant. The reason for not making that request was that, due to previous rulings (in other cases in which Mr. Shaffer was defending persons accused of selling drugs to undercover agents working for LCSO), Mr. Shaffer believed that such a request would be futile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">At the hearing, the State argued that Turner\u2019s employment contract was not \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d because the defense knew Turner had an employment contract with the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and in fact at trial defense counsel cross examined Turner about the terms of the contract. After considering the arguments of counsel, the District Court denied the motion for a new trial at the conclusion of the hearing, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AEO\">I. NEW TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Hatfield raises three arguments in support of his motion for a new trial. First, he maintains that the State\u2019s \u201csuppression of the employment contract\u201d was a violation of its duty to disclose exculpatory evidence, that the suppression prejudiced Hatfield, and that he is therefore entitled to a new trial. Second, Hatfield contends that Turner violated the terms of the contract, and the State\u2019s knowledge of, and acquiescence in, this violation was government conduct so outrageous that it violated his due process rights. Third, he alleges that he did not discover the existence of Turner\u2019s employment contract with the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office until after trial, and therefore he is entitled to a new trial based on this newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">A district court may grant a criminal defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial \u201cif required in the interest of justice.\u201d Section 46-16-702, MCA. The decision whether to grant or deny a motion for a new trial rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and will not be overturned on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown. <em>State v. Haskins </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 202, 210-11, 841 P.2d 542, 547, citing <em>State v. DeMers </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 273, 278, 762 P.2d 860, 863-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>A. EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Hatfield argues that the employment contract was exculpatory evidence, and therefore, the State had an affirmative duty to disclose the contract according to the rule set forth in <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, and according to the State\u2019s statutory disclosure obligations set forth in \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">According to <em>Brady, </em>\u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d at 218. In addition, \u00a7\u00a7 46-15-322(l)(e), and 46-15-321(2), MCA (1989), provide that the State has an affirmative duly to disclose, upon request, \u201call material or information that tends to mitigate or negate the accused\u2019s guilt as to the offense charged or that would tend to reduce his punishment therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Therefore, according to <em>Brady, </em>and \u00a7\u00a7 46-15-322(l)(e), and 46-15-321(2), MCA (1989), the State would only have an affirmative duty to disclose the contract if: (a) the defense requested the information; Section 46-15-321(2), MCA (1989); and (b) if the contract could be genetically referred to \u201cexculpatory evidence,\u201d \u2014 which we have previously defined as evidence which tends to clear the accused of guilt and vitiate the conviction. <em>State v. Patterson </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 509, 513, 662 P.2d 291, 293; <em>State v. Craig </em>(1976), 169 Mont. 150, 153, 545 P.2d 649, 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Initially, we note that while the defense admitted in the \u201cStipulation Regarding Discovery of Contract of Undercover Agency,\u201d that it did not request production of the employment contract, the State affirmatively represented at the omnibus hearing that it had provided Hatfield with everything which would tend to negate guilt, or tend to reduce his punishment. Therefore, the issue of whether Hatfield actually requested the contract is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Hatfield alleges the employment contract was exculpatory evidence because it would have evidenced Turner\u2019s violation of the contract\u2019s terms. According to Hatfield, if he had been able to impeach Turner regarding his alleged violation of the contract, he could have shown that Turner\u2019s account of the sale was \u201cfalse or susceptible to falsity,\u201d thereby supporting Hatfield\u2019s allegation of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The employment contract provisions which Hatfield claims Turner breached provide that Turner was \u201cnot to handle any drugs at any time unless specifically directed to do so by the investigating officer,\u201d and that he was \u201cnot to participate in any investigations or any criminal activities unless the investigation is being directly supervised by a member of the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\u201d Therefore, according to Hatfield, Turner violated the employment contract because the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office was not supervising Turner at the time of the sale, and because Turner possessed and used marijuana during the sale. Hatfield concludes that if he had known of the contract\u2019s terms before the trial, he could have presented evidence of Turner\u2019s alleged violation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">However, the record does not support Hatfield\u2019s argument. Turner had been directed to purchase drugs from any person who would sell them to him. Turner testified that he was not under the immediate supervision of the sheriff\u2019s office and was not wearing a body wire at the time of the sale because Hatfield and Sprague showed up unexpectedly at his apartment. Turner also testified he contacted Detective Gassett after the sale, and arranged to turn the marijuana over to him. Later that day, Turner went to Hatfield\u2019s residence equipped with a body wire, to verify the sale. In addition, Hatfield was allowed to present his version of events concerning the sale, and the jury apparently believed the State\u2019s account. Accordingly, we conclude that the employment contract would not have tended to negate Hatfield\u2019s guilt or vitiated his conviction. Therefore the State had no duty to affirmatively disclose its existence under the <em>Brady </em>rule or under \u00a7 46-15-322(l)(e), MCA (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Finally, we note that the State had no obligation to disclose the employment contract under the other provisions of \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA (1989), according to our recent opinion in <em>State v. Licht </em>(1994), [266 Mont. 123], 879 P.2d 670. Although <em>Licht </em>addressed \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA, according to its terms under the 1991 Montana Code Annotated, and the 1989 statute applies in this case, the 1991 amendments to \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA, did not substantially change the statute. Therefore, <em>Licht\u2019s </em>reasoning is relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In <em>Licht, </em>we held that the State has the obligation to disclose all evidence whether inculpatory or exculpatory if listed in subsections (l)(a) through (d) and (2)(a) through (c), of that statute, reasoning that it is not up to the State to determine whether any such information is inculpatory or exculpatory. <em>Licht, </em>879 P.2d at 673-74. Here the employment contract is not the type of material or information listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>in \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA, subsections (l)(a) through (d) and (2)(a) through (c), and accordingly, there was no affirmative duty on the part of the State to provide the contract to the defense under those subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">B. OUTRAGEOUS GOVERNMENT CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Hatfield also contends that the State\u2019s knowledge of, and acquiescence in, Turner\u2019s alleged violation of the employment contract, is outrageous government conduct which resulted in a denial of Hatfield\u2019s due process rights. This Court has previously recognized that illegal conduct of law enforcement may violate the due process rights of a defendant. <em>Haskins, </em>841 P.2d at 546. However, having concluded that Turner did not violate the terms of his employment contract, it can hardly be argued that he acted illegally. Therefore, we conclude that this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">C. NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Hatfield maintains that he did not know of the employment contract\u2019s existence until after trial, and that if he had been able to present evidence concerning its terms, and Turner\u2019s alleged violation of those terms, it would have affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">This Court analyzes motions for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence according to a six-part test set forth in <em>State v. Greeno </em>(1959), 135 Mont. 580, 586, 342 P.2d 1052, 1055, and discussed more recently in <em>Matter of J.R. T. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 520, 522, 853 P.2d 710, 711. We need to consider only the first factor: the evidence must have come to the knowledge of the applicant since the trial. We conclude that Hatfield was aware of the employment contract prior to trial and therefore his argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">We base our conclusion primarily on the \u201cStipulation Regarding Discovery of Contract of Undercover Agency,\u201d which stated that Hatfield\u2019s first attorney, Donald Shaffer, did not request the document because he thought it would be futile to do so. In addition, it appears that Hatfield\u2019s counsel at the trial level, David Harman, was also aware of the terms of the employment contract, as he cross examined Turner concerning the compensation terms of his employment, the fact that Turner used marijuana during the investigation, and that Turner did not have an electronic transmitter or body wire at the time Hatfield sold him the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Accordingly, it is apparent that Hatfield had knowledge of the employment contract at the time of the trial, and therefore he cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>now complain that it is newly discovered evidence. <em>State v. Morris </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 311, 320-21, 749 P.2d 1379, 1384-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Having determined that Hatfield was aware of the employment contract before trial, that the State had no affirmative duty to disclose the contract, and that the contract was not exculpatory in any event, we thereby hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hatfield\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">II. CUMULATIVE ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Hatfield argues in passing, that cumulative error occurred because the jury heard evidence of the conspiracy charge, and that conviction was reversed in <em>Hatfield I, </em>and because the State failed to disclose the employment contract. According to Hatfield, this cumulative error entitles him to a new trial. However, given our conclusion that the State had no affirmative duty to disclose the employment contract, we are not persuaded by Hatfield\u2019s cursory argument and hold that he is not entitled to a new trial on the basis of cumulative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b336-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
