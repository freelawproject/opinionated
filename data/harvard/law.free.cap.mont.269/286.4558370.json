We affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion regarding the percentage of damages to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>which Robert Dew is entitled, but reverse and remand for recalculation of the amount of those damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Prior to August 1983, Robert and Sally Dew acquired six tracts of land in a subdivision south of Great Falls, Montana, from the Dowers under six individual contracts for deed. Each tract, consisting of slightly more than twenty acres, sold for $l,000/acre. The Dews entered into a contract for deed for a seventh tract in February 1984. Alice Dower, a licensed real estate broker, represented to Robert Dew that the purchase price was based on plans to upgrade two access roads to \u201ccounty grade\u201d standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">When the Dowers failed to improve the access roads to county grade standards, the Dews and other purchasers brought suit against the Dowers alleging, among other things, fraud. Their allegations of fraud were based on Alice Dower\u2019s representations concerning improvements to be made to the roads. The Dowers moved for a directed verdict at the close of the Dews\u2019 case-in-chief and, at that point, the Dews\u2019 attorney asked the District Court to dismiss Sally Dew\u2019s claims. The court dismissed her claims with prejudice and entered a directed verdict in favor of the Dowers. Robert Dew appealed. We reversed the directed verdict and remanded the case for a new trial, holding that a jury question existed on the issue of whether Alice Dower fraudulently induced Robert Dew into purchasing the tracts. <em>Dew v. Dower </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 476, 480, 774 P.2d 989, 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In 1990, between the first appeal and the second trial, Sally Dew quitclaimed her one-half interest as co-tenant in the seven tracts to Robert Dew, resulting in his one hundred percent ownership of the tracts. On remand, the District Court found that Alice Dower had defrauded Robert Dew and awarded him one hundred percent of the damages. The Dowers appealed, arguing that Dew was not entitled to one hundred percent of the damages because he had owned only a one-half interest in the total fraud claims before the District Court. We reversed the District Court and remanded for recalculation of damages for plaintiffs who were before the court. <em>Dew v. Dower </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 114, 128, 852 P.2d 549, 558 <em>(.Dew II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">On remand, the District Court concluded as a matter of law that Robert Dew, by virtue of his one-half interest in the property, was entitled to one-half of the damages resulting from Alice Dower\u2019s fraud. The District Court offset the balances owing on the individual contracts for deed by the corresponding damages and prejudgment interest. Robert Dew appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Robert Dew\u2019s first assertion of error relates to the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law that Robert, the sole owner of the property at the time of judgment against the Dowers, was entitled to only fifty percent of the damage award. Dew argues that, as the sole owner of the property at the time of judgment, he is entitled to one hundred percent of the damages resulting from Dower\u2019s fraud. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The District Court\u2019s conclusion that Robert Dew was not entitled to one hundred percent of the total damages was premised on two bases. First, because Sally Dew had withdrawn her claims against the Dowers and the court had dismissed those claims with prejudice during the first trial, she retained no right to damages and, thus, the quitclaim deeds did not result in Robert Dew acquiring Sally\u2019s right to claim damages. Second, the court relied on our decision in <em>Van Ettinger v. Pappin </em>(1978), 180 Mont. 1, 588 P.2d 988, in concluding that Robert had acquired Sally\u2019s interest in the properly knowing of the claimed fraud and, as a result, had waived the right to bring an action for damages based on that interest. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether it is correct. <em>Pacificorp v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 387, 397, 838 P.2d 914, 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Regarding the first basis for the District Court\u2019s conclusion, Robert Dew argues that although Sally Dew was not defrauded, she had not relinquished her right to transfer ownership interest in the property to Robert Dew. Therefore, when Sally Dew quitclaimed her interest in the property to Robert Dew, he obtained the right to recover one hundred percent of the property damages arising from the fraud. Robert Dew misunderstands our holding in <em>Dew II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Our decision in <em>Dew II </em>included the implied, if not direct, holding that this was an action for personal damages, not property damages, arising from Alice Dower\u2019s fraud. We specifically stated that \u201c[wlithout deciding whether a single co-tenant may sue for tort damages for injury to the property itself and recover the entire amount, we hold that the court in this case erred in awarding damages for <em>injury to the personal interests of per sons who were not plaintiffs </em>at the time of judgment.\u201d <em>Dew II, </em>852 P.2d at 557 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Sally Dew\u2019s fraud claims were the same as those brought by Robert Dew and were in the nature of a personal action. <em>See Dew II, </em>852 P.2d at 557. On dismissal of Sally Dew\u2019s claims with prejudice, however, the District Court lost jurisdiction over her interest in the property. <em>Dew II, </em>852 P.2d at 557; citing Rule 41(a), M.R.Civ.P., and <em>Miller v. Northern Pac. Ry. </em>(1904), 30 Mont. 289, 296, 76 P. 691, 694. That dismissal had the same effect as if the District Court had rendered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>judgment against Sally Dew on the merits of her fraud claim. <em>See Higham v. City of Red Lodge </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 400, 403 ,807 P.2d 195, 197. Accordingly, any interest that Sally Dew had for personal damages as a co-tenant ceased to exist at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Furthermore, Sally Dew\u2019s lack of an interest in personal damages effectively prevents her from transferring such an interest to Robert Dew via quitclaim deeds. It is axiomatic that a \u201cquitclaim deed transfers and is designed to transfer only such title and interest as the grantor had when [the grantor] delivered the title.\u201d <em>Lodge v. Thorpe </em>(1947), 120 Mont. 226, 229, 181 P.2d 598, 599-600. When Sally Dew quitclaimed her interest in the seven parcels to Robert Dew, she possessed a fifty percent ownership interest in the property, but no longer possessed any right to sue for personal damages arising from Alice Dower\u2019s fraud. We conclude that while Robert Dew succeeded to Sally Dew\u2019s fifty percent ownership interest in the tracts, he did not, and could not, succeed to her nonexistent right to sue for personal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Robert Dew also asserts error in the District Court\u2019s alternative reason for denying him one hundred percent of the damages, namely, that he had acquired Sally Dew\u2019s interest in the property with the knowledge that it was tainted by fraud. Because of our resolution of Robert Dew\u2019s first asserted error, we need not address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Dew also argues that the District Court\u2019s determination that he is entitled to one-half of the damages arising from Alice Dower\u2019s fraud is inequitable. His argument is based on our decision in <em>Dew II, </em>wherein we stated that the District Court may act as a court of equity and authorize the setting-off of the purchase price of the individual land contracts in an amount equal to the damages sustained. <em>Dew II, </em>852 P.2d at 588. Dew again misinterprets that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Areview <em>ofDew II </em>clarifies that our discussion regarding the equity power of the District Court was confined solely to its ability to set-off the principal balances on the contracts for deed against the damages Robert Dew sustained. Indeed, we specifically stated that \u201c[t]he power to allow a set-off of debts by a court of equity exists independent of statute where grounds for equitable interposition are shown, such as fraud or insolvency.\u201d <em>Dew II, </em>852 P.2d at 588. Contrary to Robert Dew\u2019s assertion, this language \u2014 limited as it is to the use of set-offs\u2014 does not invest the District Court with broad equitable power to award him one hundred percent of the personal damages attributable to Alice Dower\u2019s fraud when he is not entitled by law to such an award. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not err as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>law in concluding that Robert Dew is entitled to fifty percent of the damages arising from Alice Dower\u2019s fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"Acv\">Dew\u2019s final argument regarding the District Court\u2019s judgment relates to the manner in which the District Court calculated his damages. On remand following <em>Dew II, </em>the District Court set off the principal balances due on each contract for deed, including interest accrued from March 27, 1992, to the date of its order, by the $5,000 damage award and prejudgment interest from August 1,1983 to the date of its order. Dew argues that this calculation ignored the fact that judgment was entered on March 27,1992, and that any recalculations should have been made as of that date. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In <em>Dew II, </em>we stated that \u201c[t]he District Court acted within its equitable authority when it offset the principal amounts due under the contracts with <em>the judgment in this case\u201d Dew II, </em>852 P.2d at 558 (emphasis added). \u201cThe judgment in this case\u201d refers to the District Court\u2019s judgment entered on March 27, 1992, and clearly obligated the District Court to offset the damage award, complete with prejudgment interest, against the principal balances owing on the contracts on March 27,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Accordingly, the District Court should have calculated damages in the following manner. First, the District Court should have determined the principal balance due on each contract for deed as of March 27, 1992. Next, the District Court should have determined Robert Dew\u2019s damages as of March 27,1992. According to the District Court\u2019s judgment of March 27, 1992, Robert Dew\u2019s damages would amount to one-half of the $10,000 damage per tract. <em>Dew II, </em>852 P.2d at 555. The District Court would add to that per tract damage amount prejudgment simple interest at ten percent per annum for the period from August 1983 \u2014 the time when Alice Dower\u2019s fraud became certain \u2014 to March 1992, for six of the contracts and from February 1984, to March 1992, for the remaining contract. <em>Dew II, </em>852 P.2d at 557. The District Court would then set-off Robert Dew\u2019s damages for each tract against the principal balance owing on the corresponding contract as of March 27,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Finally, the Dowers request an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees against Robert Dew as a sanction for bringing a frivolous appeal. \u201cIf [this Court] is satisfied from the record and the presentation of the appeal... that the same was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds, such damages may be assessed on determination thereof as under the circumstances are deemed proper.\u201d Rule 32, M.R.App.P. After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 arguments and given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>necessity of the remand, we cannot conclude that Robert Dew\u2019s appeal was unreasonable. Therefore, we decline to award costs and attorney\u2019s fees on appeal to the Dowers.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the District Court for recalculation of damages.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HARRISON, NELSON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b314-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AU5\">dissenting in part and specially concurring in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">For the reasons set forth in my dissent to the majority\u2019s decision in <em>Dew v.
