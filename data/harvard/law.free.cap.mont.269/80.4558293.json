The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-19\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it if such is possible. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to request a continuance until he had time to secure counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-20\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that a continuance is granted. The hearing will be scheduled for the next Sentence Review date and there will be no further delays after that time.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-23\">Hon. G. Todd Baugh, Chairman, Hon.
