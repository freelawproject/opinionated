The respondents, Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission and the Secretary of Labor, filed a motion to correct the decision previously issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-13\">The petition for rehearing is granted, and the original panel opinion dated April 17, 1981, is withdrawn. The following opinion is substituted in lieu thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-14\">Cleveland Consolidated, Inc. (hereinafter the Company) petitions this court to review the order of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (hereinafter the Commission) entered against it on September 10, 1979, finding it in serious violation of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereinafter the Act). The petition challenges the findings of the Administrative Law Judge (hereinafter ALJ) that the company violated 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-105(a), a regulation requiring the use of safety nets when workers are exposed to heights of over 25 feet and cannot use other means of safety protection, and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.450(a)(5), a regulation requiring safety features on \u201cfixed ladders.\u201d Finding substantial evidence in the record to support the decision of the ALJ, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-19\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-20\">Cleveland Consolidated, Inc., a corporation engaged in the business of steel construction and erection, contracted with Georgia Power Company to construct a balanced draft conversion as an environmental control at the power plant in Hammond, Georgia. This 110-foot structure was to be built of hundreds of tons of ductwork and supporting structural steel constructed around two smokestacks at the power plant. The construction method utilized by the Company was to build the structure in 30-foot layers, installing vertical columns and their supporting diagonal and horizontal beams to a height of 30 feet and then installing the required ductwork within the center of the structure to the same height. The builders repeated this process of construction with some minor variations for each additional 30 feet of elevation. The construction process was a difficult one, complicated by certain physical structures<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> existing on the construction site that created obstacles to construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>The Company provided safety belts for the workers and required that they be worn by the stationary ironworkers erecting the steel structure. However, two of the iron-workers, known as connectors, were unable to use safety belts for fall protection because their work required substantial mobility. For short periods of time, these connectors worked without any fall protection other than their own skill at the job. On September 20, 1977, during the latter phases of construction, one of the connectors fell approximately 65 feet to his death. In response to the fatal accident, a compliance officer from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (hereinafter OSHA) conducted an inspection of the work site. The officer issued citations against the Company, alleging, <em>inter </em>alia,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> serious violations of Section 5(a)(2) of the Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and more particularly, violations of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.105(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-450(a)(5).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The citation alleged (1) that the Company had failed to provide safety nets under the ductwork and supporting steel where ironworkers were moving about at up to 110 feet above the ground without fall protection and (2) that a 100-foot access ladder had areas of more than 90 degree pitch and did not have a cage, well, safety climbing device or landing platforms. For these violations, penalties were assessed in the amounts of $720.00 and $604.00 respectively. The Company filed a timely notice of contest to the citations, and the Secretary responded with a formal complaint. A three-day hearing before Administrative Law Judge David G. Oringer began on November 28, 1978. After the presentation of evidence and the filing of briefs, the AU issued his decision, affirming both citations and proposed penalties. In his decision the AU found that fall protection was not provided, but under the method of construction utilized by the Company, none could have been used. However, the judge determined, based on testimony of the Secretary\u2019s expert witness, that an alternative method of construction could have been used that would have permitted the use of safety nets. Thus, compliance was commanded under the Act. In regard to the \u201cfixed ladder\u201d violations, the ALJ found that the ladder in question was indeed a \u201cfixed ladder\u201d within the meaning of the regulation and that it did not comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>the ANSI standards<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> mandated by the Act. In addition, the judge denied the Secretary\u2019s motion to amend the pleadings under Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to include a violation of Section (5)(a)(l) of the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">The Company filed a timely petition for discretionary review with the Commission; however, no Commissioner directed review and the decision of the ALJ became the final order of the Review Commission on September 10, 1979. The Company now seeks review of that order in this court pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a), permitting judicial review of a final order of the Commission. Concerning the safety nets violation charged under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.105(a), the Company\u2019s petition challenges 1) whether alternative methods of construction other than those actually employed can be required under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.105(a), 2) whether, if alternative methods are required, the testimony of the Secretary\u2019s expert as to alternative methods of construction was admissable, 3) whether the fact that complete compliance cannot be achieved requires the application of the affirmative defense of impossibility, and 4) whether the evidence as a whole justified the decision of the ALJ. Regarding the \u201cfixed ladder\u201d violations under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.450(a)(5), petitioner does not question the fact that the violations existed, but rather challenges, as below, whether the ladder in question was a \u201cfixed ladder\u201d within the meaning of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">II. THE SAFETY NETS VIOLATION</p>\n<p id=\"AzX\">As indicated above, petitioner raises several issues in regard to the safety nets violation. Before we consider the merits of any of these issues, however, we must address the Secretary\u2019s argument that this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the claim of the Company that alternative methods of construction are not required under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.105(a). The Secretary, citing <em>McGowan v. Marshall, </em>604 F.2d 885 (5th Cir. 1979), urges that the argument was not adequately raised before the Commission, and therefore cannot be decided by this court. Specifically, the Secretary argues that the precise issue raised by the petitioner before the Court of Appeals was not addressed in its petition for review to the Commission, and therefore cannot be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-10\"><em>McGowan, </em>along with similar cases in other circuits,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> stands for the proposition that a petitioner to the Court of Appeals must first petition the Commission for administrative review or at least assist the Commission in its review before the court has jurisdiction to consider its appeal. The court in <em>McGowan </em>found support for its position within the language of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which requires that objections be urged before the Commission before they may be considered by a court. The court construed the language of section 660(a) to mean that objections must be urged before the Review Commission itself as well as the ALJ, stating \u201cthat proceedings targeted toward a Commission, not those before the</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>administrative law judges, are the predicate to judicial review.\u201d <em>McGowan v. Marshall, supra, </em>609 F.2d at 890. That language, along with other language indicating the importance of review by the Commission to ensure consistent and expert administration, tends to support the Secretary\u2019s position. However, we need not require as a general rule under <em>McGowan </em>that an issue must be specifically addressed in the petition for review before it can be heard. <em>McGowan </em>requires simply that the Commission be alerted to the issues and have the opportunity to pass on them before a court begins its review of the administrative process. Broad language in a petition for review might be sufficient to satisfy this requirement, and indeed even less has been recognized by the Commission as sufficient. <em>See Hullenkremer Constr. Co., </em>1978 OSHD \u00b6 22,568 (1978); <em>Genco, Inc., </em>1978 OSHD \u00b6 23,061 (1978). Where an issue is evident from the record below, this court will retain its jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">In two recent cases the Commission, relying on 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2209.92(c), refused to reach issues not specifically raised in the petition for review or directed for review by the Commission. <em>See Gannett Rochester Newspaper Corp. and Rochester Newspaper Pressman\u2019s Union No. 36, </em>3 Empl. Safety and Health Guide (CCH) 125,323 at p. 31,-383, n. 4 (1981), <em>Austin Bldg. Co., </em>1980 OSHD 124,839 at p. 30,621, n. 1 (1980). The cited regulation provides that \u201c[wjhen a petition for discretionary review is granted, review shall be limited to the issues specified in the petition, unless the order for review expressly provides differently.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.92(c). The Secretary suggests that the regulation requires a ruling by this court that issues not specifically raised in the petition are waived. However, we refuse in this case to apply the Commission\u2019s regulation to prohibit review. The regulation allows for discretion by the Commission to direct review of an issue not specified in the petition, and thus when the Commission grants review it may reach any issue found in the record below. However, when the Commission denies review, the Secretary\u2019s position would require that an issue not specifically raised in the petition is forever lost. At the time of the Company\u2019s petition for review in this case, the Commission maintained a policy of liberal interpretation of petitions for review, and in apparent reliance on that policy, the Company deemed its petition sufficient to preserve the issue. Because the issue is contained in the record below, we will assume for purposes of this appeal that the .issue was sufficiently raised, and so assuming, we turn to the merits of the issue \u2014 whether alternative methods of construction are required under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.105(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">In support of its position the Company relies on language by the Commission in <em>Issacson Structural Steel Co., </em>1974-1975 OSHD \u00b6 19,592 (1975), stating that \u201cneither \u00a7 1926.28(a) nor \u00a7 1926.105(a) requires an alternative means of performing the work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at p. 23,298. On the basis of other Commission cases which indicate that alternative methods may be required in order to comply with OSHA regulations, however, we find that this statement in <em>Issacson </em>is not an accurate statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-8\">A prima facie violation of section 1926.105(a) is established if the Secretary can show that employees were subject to falls of twenty-five feet or more and none of the safety devices listed in the standard were utilized. <em>Havens Steel Co., </em>1978 OSHD \u00b6 22,689 (1978), <em>aff\u2019d. </em>607 F.2d 493 (D.C. Cir. 1979). After the Secretary establishes a prima facie case, the \u201cemployer may affirmatively defend by establishing that it is impossible to erect safety nets, that safety nets would make performance of the work impossible or result in a greater hazard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at p. 27,385. The issue in this case involves the employer\u2019s burden when raising the affirmative defense of impossibility. That issue was addressed in <em>Ace Sheeting &amp; Repair v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>555 F.2d 439 (5th Cir. 1977), where the court held that, when dealing with a specific regulation, the employer rather than the Secretary bears the burden of showing that compliance with the regulation was not feasible under the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>ticular circumstances.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although indicating that the employer had the burden, the decision did not clearly indicate whether this burden extended to countering any feasible suggestions by the Secretary, and that is the precise issue which we must now consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">In <em>Taylor Bldg. </em>Assoc., 1977-78 OSHD \u00b6 21,592 (1977), the Commission reversed a finding by the ALJ that it was impossible to comply with regulation 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.750(b)(l)(ii) requiring safety nets on multi-story steel erection over twenty-five feet, and still perform the construction. In that case the Commission held that alternative procedures of construction, i. e., using a derrick instead of a crane, may be required in order to comply with the OSHA regulations. Under circumstances similar to the present case, a witness for the Secretary \u201ctestified that respondent could have used an erection derrick instead of a crane, and that as the job progressed, a net could have been installed after the erection of each vertical column . ... \u201d Id. at p. 25,910. The Commission went on to say that \u201c[wjhile this process would have probably added to the cost and difficulty of performing the work, and would have required a change in working techniques, it would not have made the work impossible.\u201d Id. Thus, in a case with facts much like the present case the Commission interpreted a regulation strikingly similar to \u00a7 1926.105(a) to require alternate work techniques. See <em>also Martin-Tomlinson Roofing Co., </em>1980 OSHD \u00b6 24,167 (1980), where the Commission held that compliance with regulation 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.28(a) was not impossible where the employer failed to counter the Secretary\u2019s suggestion of alternative feasible methods of compliance. This case and the general trend of other Commission cases seem to indicate that the Commission at this time requires alternative methods of construction if necessary, and possible, to comply with the OSHA regulations. Although the Commission is required to explain any change in policy,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cone inconsistent precedent does not entitle an agency litigant to demand that the board ignore prior and subsequent holdings which have followed a uniform approach.\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. v. Sunnyland Packing Co., </em>557 F.2d 1157, 1160 (5th Cir. 1977). The statement in <em>Issacson, supra, </em>was issued without explanation, and the petitioner has cited no other cases which follow its language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">Although the Commission has never expressly set out the reasons why alternative methods of construction may be required, those reasons are implicit in the decisions and inherent in the nature of the specific regulations. The regulation in question, 1926.105(a), specifically dictates the employer\u2019s duty to supply fall protection. The duty to consider alternative methods of construction which permit compliance with the regulation is merely a corollary of the duty to comply. The petitioner has attempted to characterize this duty as a burden requiring changes in methods of construction; however, that characterization ignores the employer\u2019s initial responsibility to comply with the OSHA regulations. If an employer were permitted to choose any method of construction, and subsequently argue that compliance with OSHA regulations was impossible because of the method of construction chosen, then the regulations could be undermined in many instances. The broad, remedial purposes of the Act prohibit such a result. <em>See Brennan v. Southern Contractors Serv., </em>492 F.2d 498, 501 (5th Cir. 1974) If the Secretary establishes a prima facie violation, and the employer asserts the af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>firmative defense of impossibility, the Secretary may certainly counter that defense by suggesting alternative methods of construction by which compliance with the regulation would have been possible. The ALJ\u2019s determination of whether compliance was indeed possible is a factual decision that must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">As to the remaining claims of the Company pertaining to the safety nets violations, we are bound by the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact, including his judgments of credibility supporting those facts, if they are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>See, e. g. Marshall v. West Point Pepperell, Inc., </em>588 F.2d 979 (5th Cir. 1979). The findings of fact must be upheld if properly supported even if this court would reach a different result <em>de novo. See H. B. Zachry Co. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n., </em>638 F.2d 812, 815 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Accu-Namics, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>515 F.2d 828, 834-35 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 903, 96 S.Ct. 1492, 47 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">Concerning the admissibility of the Secretary\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony, the ALJ specifically found in his decision that the Secretary expert\u2019s, a safety construction engineer, was sufficiently qualified \u2014 indeed very well qualified \u2014 to testify as to alternative methods of construction. Substantial evidence in the form of the expert\u2019s resume and his testimony concerning his experience support the finding that he was qualified to testify. The Company additionally argues that the witness did not take into consideration restrictions of space affecting the actual construction site. The record reveals that the expert visited the construction site, observing the procedures utilized by the Company. Evidence of this visit supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the witness adequately considered the obstacles present at the construction site. Expert testimony offered by the Company need not be accepted by the agency,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination in favor of the Secretary\u2019s expert over the Company\u2019s witnesses cannot be overturned in this instance. <em>See N. L. R. B. v. Dixie Gas Co., </em>323 F.2d 433 (5th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-9\">In a third claim the Company argues that it established as an affirmative defense to the violation the defense of impossibility of compliance. In this argument the Company assumes the feasibility of the Secretary\u2019s expert\u2019s method of construction, but argues that even under his method, the Company could not absolutely comply with the regulation. This argument is without merit in light of the remedial purposes of the Act. Although the impossibility defense certainly remains viable, it should not be applied in such a manner as to permit an employer to avoid the use of any protection available. A technical defense, where some means of protection is available, is not an excuse for disregarding safety precautions. The Secretary\u2019s view, shared by the Commission, requires limited compliance where it furnishes some protection, even if exact compliance is not possible. <em>See Martin-Tomlinson Roofing Co., Inc., </em>1980 OSHD \u00b6 24,167 at pp. 29,381-382 (1980); <em>J. P. Conway, Inc., </em>1979 OSHD \u00b6 23,869 at p. 28,955 (1970); <em>Kelly Constr. Serv. </em>1976-77 OSHD \u00b6 20,925 at p. 25,131 (1976); <em>See also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651; <em>Marshall v. Southwestern Ind. Contractors &amp; Riggers, Inc., </em>576 F.2d 42, 45 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Brennan v. Southern Contractors Serv., supra, </em>492 F.2d at 501. This view is entitled to substantial deference by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">The Company\u2019s fourth and final argument regarding the safety nets violation raises an impossibility of performance claim. However, the Company bears the heavy burden of establishing that substantial evidence did not exist to support the finding of the AU regarding the alternative method of construction proposed by the Secretary\u2019s expert. As noted previously, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>the Commission specifically found against the Company on these factual issues based on his determinations of credibility. These findings are binding on the court in the absence of \u201cuncontrovertable documentary evidence of physical facts\u201d which refute them. <em>N. L. R. B. v. Dixie Gas, Inc., supra, </em>323 F.2d at 437. Substantial evidence existed to support the findings of the ALJ, and the agency was not required to accept the testimony of the Company\u2019s witnesses. <em>See United States Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>537 F.2d 780, 783 (3rd Cir. 1976); <em>Minnesota Mining and Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Berwick Indus. Inc., </em>532 F.2d 330 (3d Cir. 1976.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">III. THE \u201cFIXED LADDER\u201d VIOLATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">The Company argues in regard to the \u201cfixed ladder\u201d violation that their ladder in question was not a \u201cfixed ladder\u201d within the meaning of the ANSI A14.31956, Safety Code for Fixed Ladders, as adopted by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.450(a)(5). Again, the standard on review is whether the finding of the ALJ is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. We find that the AU did not err in deeming the ladder a \u201cfixed ladder\u201d within the meaning of the regulation. Although the Company offered as its witness the head of the ANSI Fixed Ladder Committee to testify as to the meaning of the provision, the ALJ refused to credit his testimony. Because an agency may decline to accept the testimony of an expert, his action was permissible. The standard pertains to ladders that are \u201cpermanently attached,\u201d and the Secretary suggested that a ladder welded to the structure, even if temporarily welded, was such a ladder. The ALJ agreed with the interpretation of the Secretary, and where the Secretary and the Commission agree on a reasonable interpretation, the courts owe substantial deference to that interpretation. <em>Floyd S. Pike Electrical Contractor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>576 F.2d 72, 75, n. 4 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Clarkson Const\u2019n., Inc. </em>v. <em>Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>531 F.2d 451, 457 (10th Cir. 1976); <em>Budd Co. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>513 F.2d 201, 205 (3d Cir. 1975). Furthermore, the determination by the ALJ that the ladder was permanently affixed, i. e., welded to the structure, may be viewed as a factual finding supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-7\">Based on the foregoing reasons, the decision of the ALJ and its adoption by law by the Commission is</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1214-15\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651 <em>et seq., </em>specifically section 5(a)(2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2). A serious violation is defined in section 17(k) of the Act, 29 U.S.C, \u00a7 666(j), as existing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APz\">if there is a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a condition which exists, or from one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes which have been adopted or are in use, in such place of employment unless the employer did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1214-22\">. The construction site included two smokestacks, one of which was 850 feet in height, around which the ductwork and structural steel was to be erected. In addition, there were two permanent buildings, power lines running from the power plant to utility poles, a road next to the construction site, liquid storage tanks, and a concrete platform adjacent to one section of the project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">. The officer initially charged in a second citation two non-serious violations of the Secretary\u2019s standards. However, prior to trial the Secretary moved to reduce the allegation of a non-serious violation under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-550(a)(8) to a de <em>minimis </em>violation. The respondent moved to withdraw his notice of contest to the allegation of violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.152(e)(2). Both motions were granted, thus disposing of the non-serious violations. The parties stipulated that if the serious violations were proved, the penalties proposed were reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">Duties of Employers and Employees (a) Each employer</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">(1) shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees;</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-9\">(2) shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this chapter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1215-10\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.105(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-11\">Safety nets shall be provided for work places of more than 25 feet above the ground or water surface, or other surfaces where the use of ladders, scaffolds, catch platforms, temporary floors, safety lines, or safety belts is impractical.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1215-14\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.450(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-15\">Fixed ladders shall be in accordance with the provisions of the American National Standards Institute, A14.3 \u2014 1956 Safety Code for Fixed Ladders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-16\">The pertinent provisions of the ANSI standards provide as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-17\">Section 6.2 LANDING PLATFORMS.

The motion was for the purpose of allowing testimony concerning the failure to use temporary floors as safety precautions. The ALJ ruled that the pleadings specifically stated that the use of temporary floors and other safety precautions was impractical, and because amendment after trial would be unfair to the defense of the respondent, the ALJ denied the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">. <em>Keystone Roofing Co., Inc. v.
