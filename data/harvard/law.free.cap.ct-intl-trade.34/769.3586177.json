U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCustoms\u201d) classified these goods under HTSUS Heading 8419, which includes \u201cmachinery, plant or laboratory equipment . . . for the treatment of materials by a process involving a change of temperature\u201d as well as \u201cparts thereof.\u201d Plaintiff Applied Biosystems (A Division of Applera Corporation) (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019) argues that these goods should instead be classified under HTSUS Heading 9032, which includes \u201c[a]utomatic regulating or controlling instruments and apparatus\u201d as well as \u201cparts and accessories thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a).

These reactions occur in a liquid mixture comprising the subject DNA, primers, an enzyme known as DNA polymerase, nucleotide precursors, and a buffer solution. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 21. In the first step (denaturation), the mixture is initially heated (typically to 94\u00b0C) so that the single strands of each DNA double helix unwind. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 22. In the second step (annealing), the mixture is then rapidly cooled so that a primer binds to the target segment of each strand. <em>See id. </em>In the third step (synthesis), the mixture is again heated (typically to 72\u00b0C) so that the DNA polymerase forms a new complementary DNA segment for each target segment. <em>See id. </em>These three steps are repeated for each cycle. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 23.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the subject DNA contains the target segment and each reaction is perfect, then 20 cycles will produce more than a million copies of each such segment and 30 cycles will produce more than a billion copies. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">As its name suggests, a thermal cycler automates this thermal cycling. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 42. The apparatus fits on a countertop and has four pertinent elements:</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">1) A sample block into which tubes containing the reaction mixture are inserted;</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">2) A means of heating and cooling the sample block;</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>3) Sensors that measure the temperature of the sample block; and</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">4) A computer that calculates temperatures and directs the heating and cooling.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\"><em>See </em>U.S. Patent No. 5,475,610 at 243 \u00b6 1; Plaintiff\u2019s Fact Statement \u00b6\u00b6 45, 66, 86-92, 95, 108, 112 \u2014 13; Exhibits 2-7, Deposition of Douglas Gr\u00fcnewald (April 30, 2009) Confidential Exs. 2-6, Annex E, Plaintiff\u2019s Motion; <em>see also </em>U.S. Patent No. 5,038,852 (August 13, 1991) at 38 \u00b6 1; U.S. Patent No. 5,333,675 (August 2, 1994) at 60-61 \u00b6 1; U.S. Patent No. 5,656,493 (August 12, 1997) at 55-56 \u00b6\u00b6 1-4; U.S. Patent No. 7,133,726 B1 (November 7, 2006) at 14 \u00b6 1.

[articles of chapter 90.\u201d HTSUS Section XVI Note l(m). However, \u201c[w]here a machine ... consists of individual components ... intended to contribute together to a clearly defined function covered by one of the headings in chapter 84 or chapter 85, then the whole falls to be classified in the heading appropriate to that function.\u201d HTSUS Section XVI Note 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">A thermal cycler qualifies as both \u201cmachinery\u201d and \u201claboratory equipment.\u201d \u201cMachinery\u201d means \u201cmachines as a functioning unit.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (2002). A \u201cmachine\u201d is, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201can assemblage of parts that are usufally] solid bodies but include in some cases fluid bodies or electricity in conductors and that transmit forces, motion, and energy one to another in some predetermined manner and to some desired end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A \u201claboratory\u201d is \u201ca place devoted to experimental study in any branch of natural science or to the application of scientific principles in testing and analysis or in the preparation usufally] on a small scale of drugs, chemical, explosives, or other products or substances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEquipment\u201d refers to \u201cthe implements (as machinery or tools) used in an operation or activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">The task, operation, or activity performed by a thermal cycler is \u201cthe treatment of materials by a process involving a change of temperature,\u201d HTSUS Heading 8419 (2000-2002). The PCR method of amplification described by Plaintiff necessarily involves temperature change. <em>See supra </em>Part II.B. More specifically, denaturation of the DNA involves heating, annealing of the primers to their complementary DNA segments involves cooling, and synthesis of the new strands may involve reheating. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">A thermal cycler effects these precise temperature changes. <em>See id. </em>It does nothing more. <em>See id. </em>Plaintiff has not suggested, and it is not reasonable to infer, that a thermal cycler as imported contains any of the reagents necessary for a PCR to occur. <em>See </em>Complaint; Plaintiff\u2019s Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and in Support of Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Deny Defendant\u2019s Motion and Set a Date for Trial (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Memo\u201d). A thermal cycler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>does not add these reagents to the reaction mixture, it does not stir that mixture, and it does not analyze that mixture for any purpose other than achieving and verifying the target temperature. <em>See supra </em>Part II.B; Plaintiffs Fact Statement. Indeed, if an efficient PCR could occur regardless of temperature, a thermal cycler would have no utility other than as an overly complex receptacle for sample tubes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">The specialized nature of a thermal cycler does not preclude its classification under HTSUS Heading 8419. The language of this heading includes examples of specialized processes, \u201csuch as . . . distilling, rectifying, sterilizing, [and] pasteurizing.\u201d HTSUS Heading 8419 (2000-20002). The Explanatory Notes also support such a classification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">Machinery and apparatus of a kind covered by [Chapters 84 and 85] remain classified in the Section <em>even if specialised </em>for use in laboratories or in connection with scientific and measuring instruments, provided they do not constitute nonindustrial dem-onstrational apparatus of heading 90.23 nor measuring, checking, etc., instruments of Chapter 90. For example, small furnaces, distillation apparatus, grinders, mixers, electrical transformers \u25a0 and capacitors, for use in laboratories, remain classified in this Section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Explanatory Note IV to Section XVI (unchanged from 2000-2002) (emphasis modified). Moreover:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">[Heading 8419] further includes <em>specially designed laboratory apparatus </em>and equipment, generally small in size (autoclaves, distilling, sterilising or steaming apparatus, dryers, etc.), but it excludes demonstrational apparatus of heading 90.23, and measuring, checking, etc.,' apparatus more specifically covered by Chapter 90.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Explanatory Note VII to Heading 84.19 (unchanged from 2000-2002) (emphasis modified).

Automatic controllers and regulators \u201ccontinuously measure 0 the value of a variable quantity or condition and then automatically actO on the controlled equipment to correct any deviation from a desired preset value.\u201d McGraw-Hill Scientific Dictionary at 169 (defining \u201cautomatic controller\u201d), 171 (defining \u201cautomatic regulator\u201d); <em>see also </em>Van Nostrand\u2019s Scientific Encyclopedia, Ninth Ed.

For example, a thermostat controls, but does not encompass, the mechanical equipment that actually heats or cools. <em>See </em>McGraw-Hill Scientific Dictionary (defining \u201cthermostat\u201d as \u201c[a]n instrument which measures changes in temperatures and directly or indirectly controls sources of heating and cooling to maintain a desired temperature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The Explanatory Notes support the conclusion that HTSIJS Heading 9032 refers to the apparatus that determines and issues directions but not to the complementary apparatus that actually carries out those directions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">Automatic control apparatus for liquids or gases and apparatus for automatically controlling temperature form part of complete automatic control systems and consist essentially of the following devices:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">(a) A device for measuring the variable to be controlled (pressure or level in a tank, temperature in a room, etc.). . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-8\">(b) A control device which compares the measured value with the desired value and actuates the device described in (C) below accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-9\">(c) A starting, stopping or operating device. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">[Such] [instruments and apparatus . . . are connected to an appliance which carries out the orders (pump, compressor, valve, furnace burner, etc.) which restores the variable (e.g., liquid measured in a tank or temperature measured in a room) to the prescribed value, or which, in the case of a safety system, for instance, stops the operation of the machine or apparatus controlled. This appliance, generally remote controlled by a me<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>chanical, hydraulic, pneumatic or electric control, is to be classified in its own appropriate heading .... If the automatic control apparatus is combined with the appliance which carries out the orders, the classification of the whole is to be determined under either Interpretative Rule 1 or Interpretative Rule 3 (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Explanatory Note 90.32(1) (unchanged from 2000 to 2002) (emphasis modified).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">A thermal cycler combines \u201cthe automatic control apparatus . . . with the appliance which carries out the orders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The automatic controller includes the sensors that measure the temperature of the sample block and the computer that calculates temperatures and directs the heating and cooling. <em>See supra </em>Part II.B. The controlled equipment includes the sample block into which tubes containing the reaction mixture are inserted and the means of heating and cooling that sample block. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">By its terms, HTSUS Heading 9032 describes the elements of a thermal cycler that direct heating and cooling but does not describe the elements that actually heat and cool. This heading therefore provides an incomplete description of a thermal cycler under GRI 1. Conversely, HTSUS Heading 8419 provides a complete description of a thermal cycler under GRI 1. <em>See supra </em>Part IV.B.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Accordingly, recourse to GRI 3(b) or to any other GRI or ARI is neither necessary nor proper. <em>See </em>GRI 1; HTSUS Section XVI Note 4; <em>cf. Wagner Spray Tech Corp. v. United States, </em>31 CIT 676, 681-84, 493 F. Supp. 2d 1265 (2007) (rejecting a classification that incompletely described the goods at issue in favor of a classification that completely described those goods). Customs properly classified the thermal cy-clers under HTSUS Heading 8419.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">The Parties Have Stipulated To The Nature Of The Thermal Cycler Parts</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">This action also includes certain thermal cycler parts imported by Plaintiff. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 5, 12, 15-16; Plaintiff\u2019s Response to Defendant\u2019s Fact Statement \u00b6 6. Defendant\u2019s Motion does not address these parts. <em>See </em>Defendant\u2019s Fact Statement \u00b6 6; Defendant\u2019s Memorandum in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment at 1 n.l; Defendant\u2019s Reply at 3, (\u201cThis case involves a single question \u2014 the proper classification of thermal cyclers.\u201d). However, the parties stipulated at oral argument that these parts are of a kind that should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>classified under the same HTSUS heading as the thermal cyclers. <em>See </em>June 22, 2010 Oral Argument at 00:5:20-30 (Defendant: \u201cI think we can actually stipulate that whatever parts are at issue should follow the classification of the machines.\u201d), 00:05:30-35 (Plaintiff: \u201cWe do stipulate that.\u201d).
