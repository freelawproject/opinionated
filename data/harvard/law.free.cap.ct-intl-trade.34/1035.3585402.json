Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">In 2007, Avisma and USM requested a review of an antidumping order covering imports of pure and alloyed magnesium from the Russian Federation for the period from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2007.See <em>Notice of Antidumping Duty Order: Magnesium Metal from the Russian Federation, </em>70 Fed. Reg. 19,930,19,930 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Apr. 15, 2005). On May 30, 2007, Commerce commenced the review, <em>Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews and Request for Revocation in Part, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 29,968, 29,968 (Dep\u2019t Commerce May 30, 2007), and nearly a year later published its preliminary results. <em>Magnesium Metal from the Russian Federation: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 24,541 (Dep\u2019t Commerce May 5, 2008). At this point Avisma and USM submitted briefs proposing, <em>inter alia, </em>changes to the Department\u2019s methodology for determining the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>of chlorine gas. Commerce rejected a portion of Avisma\u2019s brief because it contained new factual information: an affidavit from accounting expert Professor George Foster (\u201cFoster Affidavit\u201d). <em>See </em>Pis. Br. App. Tabs 8-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">On September 10, 2008, Commerce issued th\u00e9 final results of the subject administrative review. <em>Magnesium Metal from the Russian Federation: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 52,642 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Sept. 10, 2008) <em>{\u201cFinal Results\u201d). </em>To determine the normal value of the subject merchandise,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Department employed a method of constructing a value for chlorine gas which severed Avisma\u2019s production process at the point where raw magnesium and chlorine gas emerge from the carnallite refinement process. Pis. Br. App. Tab 14 <em>{\u201cFinal Results Issues and Decision Memorandum\u201d) </em>at 10. Commerce then constructed the value of Avisma\u2019s chlorine gas by taking a bulk quantity market value of liquid chlorine and adjusting it for transportation costs between facilities and for the estimated cost of converting the liquid chlorine to chlorine gas. <em>Final Results Issues and Decision Memorandum </em>at 18-19. The Department then allocated this cost among the co-products of the carnallite refinement process. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Commerce justified this methodology by claiming that because the Department perceived a clear split-off point at the carnallite refinement process, it was reasonable to ignore the parts of Avisma\u2019s operation subsequent to that process and to treat raw magnesium as one of Avisma\u2019s primary products. <em>Id. </em>at 14; <em>see also Redetermination Results </em>at 6. The Department additionally claimed, without explanation, that determining the value of chlorine gas by taking into account Avisma\u2019s entire operation would result in a value for chlorine gas too high relative to the value that Avisma obtains from it. <em>Final Results Issues and Decision Memorandum </em>at 14; <em>see also Redetermination Results </em>at 5. Because the normal value of the subject merchandise necessarily bears an inversely proportional relationship to the value of chlorine gas, its co-product in the carnallite refinement process, an \u201cunreasonably\u201d high value for chlorine gas would result in an unreasonably low normal value for the subject merchandise. <em>See Redetermination Results </em>at 13. A lower normal value for the subject merchandise, in turn, would lead to a lower antidumping duty rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">Plaintiffs and USM filed suit in this Court to contest the <em>Final </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number><em>Results. </em>Avisma claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that Commerce employed an erroneous method to allocate joint costs between raw magnesium and chlorine gas, and that Commerce inappropriately rejected the portions of its case brief containing the Foster Affidavit. <em>PSC VSMPO Avisma Corp. v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 09-120, 2009 Ct. Int\u2019l Trade LEXIS 127, at *5 (Oct. 20, 2009). USM also contested the Department\u2019s method for allocating joint costs between raw magnesium and chlorine gas. <em>Id. </em>In its decision, the court instructed Commerce to admit the Foster Affidavit to the record, citing concerns over the determination\u2019s accuracy given that the case presents an issue of first impression, and remanded the proceedings so that the Department could consider the affidavit\u2019s arguments. <em>Id. </em>at *22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\">On March 30, 2010, Commerce issued its remand results, which left the methodology for constructing the value for chlorine gas unchanged. <em>Redetermination Results </em>at 4. Avisma again contests the Department\u2019s chlorine gas valuation methodology, arguing that the methodology inappropriately truncates the production process at Avisma\u2019s facilities and thereby ignores the intertwined nature of Avisma\u2019s operations. Pis. Br. 2-7. USM supports the <em>Redetermination Results </em>\u201cin large part,\u201d but disagrees with the Department\u2019s method of constructing the value for chlorine gas. Def.-Int. Resp. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">Because of the \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201ctechnical\u201d nature of the Department\u2019s determinations, Commerce\u2019s expertise in determining these matters entitles it to great deference. <em>Fujitsu Gen., Ltd. v. United States, </em>88 F.3d 1034, 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The court must sustain Commerce\u2019s determination so long as the determination is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence on the record\u201d and is \u201cotherwise in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">\u201cSubstantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Novosteel SA v. United States, </em>25 CIT 2, 6, 128 F. Supp. 2d 720, 725 (2001) (quotation marks &amp; citation omitted). This evidence must consist of \u201cmore than a scintilla\u201d but need not constitute a preponderance. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 128 F. Supp. 2d at 725 (citation omitted). To determine whether the Department supports its determination with substantial evidence, the court must take into account the entire record, including anything that detracts from the weight of the evidence that Commerce employs to make its determination. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951). Commerce must supply a \u201csatisfactory explanation\u201d for its determination, including a \u201crational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>(1983) (internal quotation marks &amp; citation omitted). The court may not supply a \u201creasoned basis\u201d for the Department\u2019s decision that Commerce itself did not give. <em>Id. </em>Even if it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence on record, it does not mean that Commerce did not support its findings with substantial evidence. <em>Thai Pineapple Pub. Co. v. United States, </em>187 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">To determine whether Commerce\u2019s findings are in accordance with law, the court applies the two-part test articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council. </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984). The court first must determine whether Congress has spoken directly to the issue in question; if so, the court must ensure that the Department\u2019s methods comport with \u201cthe unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843 (footnote omitted). If Congress is silent on the issue, the court must determine whether the methods that the Department employed to reach its conclusion are \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The court must defer to Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the statute so long as it is reasonable and \u201cmay not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by\u201d Commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">How to value co-products in an antidumping case where the manufacturer in question produces one product the subject merchandise simultaneously with a second product that serves as a catalyst in the production of a third product is an issue of first impression for the Court. When Commerce uses a constructed value as the normal value of the subject merchandise, Congress instructs the Department to take into account \u201cthe cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind employed in producing the merchandise . . . <em>in the ordinary course of </em>business.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(1) (emphasis added). The \u201cordinary course of business\u201d means \u201c[t]he transaction of business according to the common usages and customs of . . . the particular individual whose acts are under consideration.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1098 (6th ed. 1990); <em>see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>404, 1209 (9th ed. 2009).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> From a thorough examination of the record, the court finds that the Department\u2019s chosen chlorine gas valuation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>methodology in the <em>Redetermination Results </em>fails to take into account Avisma\u2019s ordinary course of business and, therefore, does not accord with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\">Avisma is primarily a producer of titanium sponge, and its business structure reflects this focus. Pis. Br. App. Tab 2 at 3 (\u201cVSMPO-AVISMAis a titanium manufacturer and AVISMA\u2019s Berezniki facility supports that production.\u201d); <em>2006 Avisma Annual Report </em>8. To that end, Avisma strives to produce raw magnesium and chlorine gas only in the quantities necessary to enable its overarching titanium operation. Pis. Br. App. Tab 2 at 6. The subject merchandise, pure and alloyed magnesium, is an ancillary product of the overall production process. Pis. Br. App. Tab 5 at 8; <em>see also </em>Pis. Br. App. Tab 2 at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">The subservient nature of magnesium production to titanium production becomes apparent from an examination of Avisma\u2019s finances. Titanium products account for 78 percent of Avisma\u2019s sales revenue, while only four percent comes from the subject merchandise. <em>2006 Avisma Annual Report </em>8, 10, 17. This figure puts subject merchandise on par with ferrotitanium, aluminum and its alloys, and \u201cother goods and services\u201d in terms of Avisma\u2019s sales revenue, demonstrating its comparatively minor role. <em>2006 Avisma Annual Report </em>10. In addition, the <em>2006 Avisma Annual Report </em>reveals that Avistan allocated 29% of its investments that year toward improvements in titanium sponge production, with only three percent going toward \u201cother primary production areas.\u201d <em>2006Avisma Annual Report </em>22; <em>see also 2006 Avisma Annual Report </em>23 (noting that \u201cmajor modernization project in magnesium processing\u201d geared toward increasing titanium sponge production). From a financial standpoint, Avisma\u2019s ordinary course of business places titanium in a preeminent position. Claiming that it is reasonable to treat magnesium as a primary product of Avisma, Commerce disregards the vast majority of Avisma\u2019s financial activity. <em>Compare Final Results Issues and Decision Memorandum </em>at 14 (truncating production process at carnallite refinement <em>stage),.with </em>\u00a7 1677b(e)(1) (directing Commerce to take into account entity\u2019s ordinary course of business when using constructed value as normal value).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Avisma\u2019s treatment of its raw magnesium production capabilities following its 2005 merger with titanium producer VSMPO underscores the subsidiary nature of the subject merchandise production in Avisma\u2019s ordinary course of business. Pis. Br. App. Tab 5 at 3. Even prior to the merger, Avisma planned to gradually reduce its raw magnesium output to the level minimally sufficient to produce the chlorine gas necessary for its titanium output projections. Pis. Br. App. Tab 5 at 3 (\u201cIt was understood that this merger would shift <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>AVISMA\u2019s production focus <em>more </em>squarely into the production of . . . titanium sponge.\u201d (emphasis added)), 6-7. To achieve' this goal, Avisma planned and carried out a gradual reduction in raw magnesium output [\u00b6] ]].<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pis. Br. App. Tab 5 at 5-6. Over the course of the following three years, raw magnesium output and therefore the output of its co-product chlorine gas dropped [[significantly]]. From the second quarter of 2006 to the first quarter of 2007 alone, raw magnesium output fell from [\u00b6] many ]] metric tons to [\u00b6] fewer ]] metric tons. Pis. Br. App. Tab 6 Ex. 2SD-2. By the end of 2006, raw magnesium production fell to the level minimally sufficient to produce Avisma\u2019s desired amount of chlorine gas. Pis. Br. App. Tab 2 at 4-5 (\u201c[P]roduction of magnesium was limited to the amount unavoidable under the existing technology and because of supply issues.\u201d). Commerce\u2019s chlorine gas valuation methodology effectively disregards the ample record evidence that shows that Avisma\u2019s raw magnesium production is completely subservient to'titanium production. Pis. Br. App. Tab 2 at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">Avisma\u2019s attempts to increase technical-quality magnesium production are further indicative of its desire to avoid production of subject merchandise to the extent possible. <em>See </em>Pis. Br. App. Tab 5 at 4. During the period of review, Avisma made steps toward increasing its output of technical-quality magnesium specifically to use in the titanium tetrachloride separation process so that Avisma could limit further its output of raw magnesium, and thus subject merchandise, to the amount necessary for Avisma to obtain chlorine gas in the quantities that it needs to make titanium. Pis. Br. App. Tab 5 at 4. The record evidence shows that subject merchandise production clearly does not lie at the heart of Avisma\u2019s business plans or operations; rather, it is an incidental product of Avisma\u2019s titanium production. Treating subject merchandise otherwise does not reflect the costs incurred in Avisma\u2019s ordinary course of business as the statute requires. \u00a7 1677b(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>Despite the financial and operational cohesiveness of Avisma\u2019s titanium operations, the Department nevertheless belittles the integrated nature of Avisma\u2019s facility to justify its severing of Avisma\u2019s production process in its chlorine gas valuation methodology. For example, the Department claims that the quantities of materials that travel between segments of the production process are too small to warrant considering the facility an integrated whole. <em>Redetermination Results </em>at 8. The Department claims that it is therefore reasonable to truncate its consideration of the production process at the carnallite refinement stage and calculate the value for chlorine gas considering only the outputs of that stage. In reality, however, the record shows that the production process depends entirely on the movement of materials between stages. Avisma primarily uses the chlorine gas produced from carnallite in the ilmenite catalyzation process. Pls.Reply Br. App. Tab 18 at 3. The raw magnesium produced jointly with chlorine gas not only becomes subject merchandise, but also plays a fundamental role in the titanium tetrachloride separation process. Pis. Br. App. Tab 5 at 4. In addition, Avisma takes the chlorine gas that it recovers along with technical-quality magnesium following the titanium tetrachloride separation process and recycles it into the ilmenite catalyzation process. Pis. Br. App. Tab 2 at 5-6. Although the raw magnesium and chlorine gas produced at the car-nallite refinement stage serve crucial purposes throughout the chain of production, Commerce insists on employing a methodology that turns a blind eye to this undeniable fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">The 2006 mine collapse suffered by Avisma\u2019s carnallite supplier further highlights the interdependent nature of Avisma\u2019s operations. Pis. Br. App. Tab 5 at 5; <em>see also 2006Avisma Annual Report </em>33. After the accident, Avisma could not procure carnallite and, therefore, was unable to produce the raw magnesium and chlorine gas needed to run its operations. Pis. Br. App. Tab 5 at 5. This threat of a production collapse forced Avisma to purchase outside chlorine to continue its production of titanium. Pis. Br. App. Tab 5 at 5. Commerce characterizes Avisma\u2019s production facility as a series of discrete, independently-operating processes, but the events following the mine accident demonstrate that the processes cannot operate independently. The lack of carnallite threatened to halt not only the carnallite refinement process, but all of Avisma\u2019s production.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>The court finds nothing in the record to legitimize Commerce\u2019s characterization of Avisma\u2019s production process. <em>Cf. Thai Pineapple Pub. Co., </em>187 F.3d at 1365 (\u201cEven if it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from evidence contained in the record, this does not mean that Commerce\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d). Commerce claims that its method for valuing chlorine gas more closely comports with \u201ceconomic reality\u201d than other methods. <em>Redetermination Results </em>at 12. But Commerce may not substitute its own definition of \u201ceconomic reality\u2019 for the standard which Congress has mandated. In other words, Commerce must calculate the value of the subject merchandise, including \u201cthe cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind employed in producing the merchandise,\u201d by taking into account Avisma\u2019s ordinary course of business. \u00a7 1677b(e)(1). The Department cannot take into account Avisma\u2019s ordinary course of business while basing its methodology to calculate the cost of chlorine gas in its overall determination of the normal value of the subject merchandise on a misapprehension of the company\u2019s production process. Because Commerce has failed to take into account Avisma\u2019s ordinary course of business in calculating the value for chlorine gas, its methodology does not accord with law. <em>See id.; Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>467 U.S. at 842-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-3\">IV.

Br. App. Tab 5 at 3. An immediate cessation of magnesium production would have subjected Avisma to disposal costs and workforce downsizing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-7\">Once a decision has [sic] been made to [[restrain]] [raw] magnesium production above a certain level (that need [sic] to produce chlorine), there were logical economic reasons for switching somewhat gradually in reducing production of magnesium. Generally, each electrolytic cell is budgeted to serve for [[many]] months between capital repairs. These are expensive repairs . . . and an abrupt stoppage would have resulted in [\u00b6] undesirable consequences ]]. This would have been in addition to the loss of whatever material was loaded in the cells at the time of the stoppage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">Pis. Br. App. Tab 5 at 7-8.

The Department severs the carnallite refinement process from the rest of the titanium production while claiming that the goal of its chlorine gas valuation methodology is to arrive at a price that accurately reflects the benefit Avisma obtains from chlorine gas. <em>Final Results Issues and Decision Memorandum </em>at 14-15. But Avisma obtains value from chlorine gas precisely as a means to produce titanium. The only other product that Avisma produces with chlorine gas is calcium chloride de-icer, which it sells at a loss as a way of disposing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>excess chlorine gas.
