On October 1, 2007, AASPS also requested that Commerce conduct an administrative review related to the Antidumping Duty Order. Id. In response to these requests, Commerce initiated the first administrative review of the Antidump-ing Duty Order on certain lined paper products from PRC on October 31, 2007. <em>See Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews, </em>72 Fed.

This is because the administrative record contains all information which was presented to, or obtained by, Commerce during the course of the administrative review. <em>See e.g., Camp v. Pitts, </em>411 U.S. 138, 142, 93 S. Ct.1241, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973); <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S.420, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971).

AASPS\u2019s Motion at 4. AASPS\u2019s Motion is denied because: (1) Sundaram\u2019s 2006-2007 annual report was not timely filed by AASPS during the administrative proceeding, <em>infra </em>Part IV. A; (2) Sundaram\u2019s 2006-2007 annual report was publicly available during the administrative proceeding, <em>infra </em>Part IV, B; and (3) AASPS has not demonstrated that the existing administrative record is so incomplete as to frustrate meaningful review by this court, <em>infra </em>Part IV. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\"><em>AASPS </em>Was <em>Not Timely In Its Request To Supplement The Administrative Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">AASPS did not submit in a timely fashion the Sundaram 2006-2007 annual report it now seeks to add to the administrative record. Commerce\u2019s regulations provide detailed deadlines for the submission of factual information during an antidumping proceeding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301(b)(2). Specifically, \u201c[f]or the final results of an administrative review,\u201d \u201ca submission of factual information is due no later than: . . . 140 days after the last day of the anniversary month.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, because the anniversary month was September 2006,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the deadline for AASPS to submit the Sundaram 2006-2007 annual report to Commerce was February 17, 2008. AASPS did not comply with this deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Lian Li submitted the Sundaram Financials to Commerce on April 1, 2008. Lian Li\u2019s April 1, 2008 Letter. While this date is past the February 17, 2008 deadline for information submissions mandated by 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301(b)(2), AASPS could have still submitted additional information to rebut the Sundaram Financials by asking Commerce for permission to submit information. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301(c)(1). 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301(c)(1) sets the time limits for certain submissions for rebuttal, clarification, or correction of factual information. Id. (\u201cAny interested party may submit factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information submitted by any other interested party at any time prior to the deadline provided ... for submission of such factual information.\u201d). AASPS did not submit any factual information related to the 2006-2007 Sundaram annual report throughout the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">While AASPS discussed the Sundaram Financials in its March 6, 2009 case brief, it neither sought to admit any information related to the 2006-2007 Sundaram annual report nor provided any factual evidence to rebut the Sundaram Financials. <em>See Association of American School Paper Suppliers, Certain Lined Paper Products from the People\u2019s Republic of China: Case Brief, </em>Inv. No. A-570-901 (March 6, 2009) C.R. 35, at 49-55. Indeed, AASPS admits that it did not make any attempt to obtain Sundaram\u2019s annual report during the administrative review, \u201cbecause <em>it was not in its interest to do so.\u201d </em>Letter from Timothy Brightbill, Wiley Rein, to Hon. Evan J. Wallach, U.S. Court of International Trade, Re: Availability of 2006-2007 Annual Report of Sundaram Multi Pap Ltd (December 22, 2009) (\u201cAASPS\u2019s December 22, 2009 Letter\u201d) at 1 (emphasis added). AASPS did not timely submit the 2006-2007 Sundaram annual report to Commerce and cannot supplement the administrative record with that information now that the submission period and general investigation are completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\n<em>AASPS Has Not Demonstrated That Supplementation Of The Record Is Necessary Because The Information AASPS Seeks To Add To The Administrative Record Is Not New And Circumstances Have Not Changed Since The Administrative Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">This court has in certain unique factual situations recognized various circumstances in which parties are allowed to supplement the administrative record certified by the agency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A party may supplement the administrative record in the following circumstances: when at the time that supplementation of the record is sought, there is new, changed, or extraordinary information available that was not available during the investigation, <em>see Beker Indus. Corp. v. United States, </em>7 CIT 313, 318 (1984); and when the party makes a strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior by agency decision makers. <em>See F.l: De Cecco di Filippo Fara San Marino S.p.A. v. United States, </em>21 CIT 1124, 1126, 980 F. Supp. 485 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">AASPS argues that supplementation of the administrative record is warranted on the basis of changed or new information.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> AASPS\u2019s Motion at 4. Specifically, AASPS argues that Sundaram\u2019s 2006-2007 annual report should be admitted to the administrative record as new information for the purpose of showing that material information was misrepresented to the agency and that the final determination was improperly based on information that it was not what it was claimed to be. <em>Id. </em>However, AASPS concedes that this information was publicly available online during the entire investigation period. <em>See Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> AASPS admits that \u201c[t]he file for Sundaram\u2019s 2006-2007 annual report was first created on September 29, 2007.\u201d <em>See </em>AASPS\u2019s December 22, 2009 Letter at 1, Ex. 1. AASPS further states that it \u201cbelieves that the [Sundaram 2006-2007 annual] report was publicly available from September 29, 2007 onwards.\u201d Id. at 2. Accordingly, because the information AASPS seeks to admit is not new, supplementation on this basis is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">This court has repeatedly held that judicial review must be based solely upon the administrative record made during the particular review proceeding which resulted in the determination subject to judicial review. <em>See e.g. Beker, </em>7 CIT at 313-18 (Plaintiff sought to add information and documents from proceedings before or during the review in question; this court denied the request because Plaintiff could have sought access to most, if not all, of this information and attempted to introduce it into the record at the agency level.); <em>Nakajima All Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>2 CIT 25 (1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The scope of the record for purposes of judicial review must be based upon information which was \u201cbefore the relevant decision-maker\u201d and was presented and considered \u201cat the time the decision was rendered.\u201d <em>Beker, </em>7 CIT at 315 (quotation omitted.) \u201cThis information, which constitutes the formal record is the only information upon which the factual findings and legal conclusions underlying the challenged determination could have been based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316. \u201cAn attempt to supplement the record now in the fashion attempted by plaintiff is tantamount to seeking <em>de novo </em>review through the back door.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">In this case, AASPS has offered no evidence that the Sundaram 2006-2007 annual report qualifies as \u201cnew . . . information.\u201d <em>See </em>AASPS\u2019s Motion at 4. Because AASPS has made no showing that it could not have taken steps to place the Sundaram 2006-2007 annual report before the administrative decision-maker, \u201cthe court should not allow it belatedly to expand the record with this information.\u201d <em>Beker, </em>at 318. Accordingly, as in <em>Beker, </em>supplementation of the existing administrative record is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\n<em>AASPS Has Not Made A Sufficient Showing That The Existing Administrative Record Is Incomplete So As To Frustrate Meaningful Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">AASPS claims that Commerce \u201chas relied on data that was materially misrepresented and/or potentially or actually submitted under false pretenses.\u201d AASPS\u2019s Motion at 4. According to AASPS, throughout the course of the administrative review, AASPS \u201cclearly and plainly alleged on numerous occasions that the document was not what Lian Li said it was.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. AASPS asks the court to admit the Sundaram 2006-2007 annual report because it alleges: (1) Commerce misrelied on the information submitted by Lian Li <em>id. </em>at 1; (2) this information \u201ccompromised the accuracy of the proceedings,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 5 (quotation omitted); and (3) that inclusion (of the report) is necessary because it \u201cmay influence the court\u2019s own determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. AASPS provides no record support for these particular arguments. <em>See </em>AASPS\u2019s Motion 2 \u2014 5. This court has held that when a party does not demonstrate that an administrative record was so incomplete as to \u201cfrustrate meaningful review\u201d supplementation of the administrative record is not warranted. <em>Ammex Inc. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 1811, 1812 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The existing administrative record before this court is clearly not so incomplete as to \u201cfrustrate meaningful review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>During the administrative review proceedings, Commerce conducted on-site verifications of Lian Li\u2019s submitted financial information from January 12 to January 16, 2009. <em>See </em>Memorandum from Cindy Robinson and Victoria Cho, Case Analysts, Office 3, U.S. Department of Commerce, to the File, Re: the First Administrative Review of Certain Lined Paper Products from the People\u2019s Republic of China: Verification of the Sales and Factors of Production Responses of Shanghai Lian Li Paper Products Co., Ltd.

AASPS\u2019s Deficiency/Rebuttal Comments, which are part of the existing administrative record, clearly state AASPS\u2019s allegations against Lian Li.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the existing record is not so incomplete as to required supplementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Supplement Administrative Record is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-10\"> On December 1, 2009, the court denied as moot AASPS\u2019s motion for oral argument. Oral argument was held on December 7, 2009 and no motion was necessary</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-10\"> The standard applied by the court to review factual findings made by Commerce during the course of antidumping proceedings is whether those findings are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i). Even though the arbitrary and capricious standard requires a different level of scrutiny than the substantial evidence standard, <em>see KYD Inc. v. United States, </em>613 F. Supp. 2d 1371,1375 n. 4, 31 ITRD 1261, CIT (2009), the Federal Circuit\u2019s rationale in <em>Murakami </em>applies here as well. This is because the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of review like the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard, does not permit the court to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review; there is no absence of substantial evidence simply because the reviewing court would have reached a different conclusion based on the same record.\u201d <em>Cleo Inc. v.

This court agreed with Defendant and Defendant-Intervenor that the granting of such a motion would be contrary to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a which provides that determinations in antidumping proceedings are reviewed upon the administrative record. <em>Id. </em>at 25-26. This court also noted that this scope of review, predicated solely upon the basis of the administrative record, is in accord with general principles of judicial review of administrative action. <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\"> MPF and Sent\u00edan are two producers of merchandise that Lian Li purchases. <em>See Section A: Response of Shanghai Lian Li Paper Product Co., Ltd. </em>ITA Case No. A570-901, (December 6, 2007) CR at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\"> From December 6, 2007, to January 9, 2009 (the first day of Commerce\u2019s on-site verification), Commerce and Lian Li corresponded sixteen times regarding submission of Lian Li\u2019s data: (December 6, 2007 (CR 2); December 13, 2007 (CR 3); January 4, 2008 (CR 5); January 10, 2008 (CR 6); January 22, 2008 (CR 8); January 23, 2008 (CR 9); February 6, 2008 (CR 11); February 27,2008 (CR 12); March 6,2008 (CR 12); April 1,2008 (CR 15); April 11, 2008(2) (CR 17, CR 18); April 23, 2008 (CR 20); October 2, 2008 (CR 25); October 16, 2008 .(CR 26); and January 6, 2008) (CR 30).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b61-10\"> From December 6, 2007, to January 9, 2009, AASPS wrote to Commerce nine separate times regarding the inadequacies of Lian Li\u2019s data submissions: (January 17, 2008 (CR 7); January 31, 2008 (CR 10); March 12, 2008 (CR 14); April 8, 2008 (CR 16); April 15, 2008 (CR 19); May 1, 2008 (CR 21); October 27, 2008 (CR 27); December 17, 2008 (CR 29); and January 9, 2009 (CR 31).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b61-11\"> <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
