Reg. 10,545 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Mar. 11, 2009) <em>(\u201cFinal Determination\u201d). </em>On remand, the court instructed the U.S. Department of Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d or \u201cthe Department\u201d) to reconsider two aspects of its antidumping duty calculation: (1) \u201cwhether Commerce corroborated the adverse facts available rate upon which it relied in calculating the separate rate\u201d in its determination and (2) \u201cwhether Commerce used the proper financial ratios and the proper surrogate value for Phosphorous Trichloride and steam in calculating the adverse facts available rate Commerce used as a basis for the separate rate.\u201d <em>Changzhou Wujin Fine Chem.

Commerce adjusted this average unit value to account for an industry-standard seven percent sales commission deduction to produce the U.S. price. <em>Id. </em>It subsequently compared this price to the weighted-average normal value calculated for the mandatory respondent, resulting in a new AFA rate of 30.94%. <em>Id. </em>Because the revised AFA rate relied on information obtained during the investigation, the Department determined that it did not require corroboration. <em>Id. </em>Commerce then calculated a revised separate rate by averaging the revised AFA rate and the zero rate calculated for the mandatory respondent in the <em>Final Determination, </em>producing a rate of 15.47%. <em>Id. </em>at 7.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Plaintiffs Changzhou Wujin Fine Chemical Factory Co., Ltd., and Jiangsu Jianghai Chemical Group Co., Ltd., (together, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) contest the <em>Remand Results </em>on several grounds.

First, they claim that Commerce inappropriately recalculated the U.S. price, because no party challenged its accuracy during the administrative process and because the <em>Remand Order </em>\u201cdid not provide the Department the leeway to reconsider\u201d the figure. Pis. Comments 4. Plaintiffs next assert that Commerce improperly adjusted BWA\u2019s average unit value to account for an industry-standard seven percent commission, an adjustment that affected the value of the new U.S. price. Pis. Comments 6-7. Finally, Plaintiffs contend that the Department acted contrary to law when it used only the average unit value of BWA to recalculate the U.S. price. Pis. Comments 7-13. For the reasons stated below, Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">The court grants \u201ctremendous deference\u201d to Commerce\u2019s final anti-dumping determinations due to the \u201ctechnical\u201d and \u201ccomplex\u201d economic and accounting decisions involved, for which the Department \u201cpossess[es] far greater expertise them [the Court].\u201d <em>Fujitsu Gen. Ltd. v. United States, </em>88 F.3d 1034, 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (quotation marks &amp; citation omitted); <em>accord Thai Pineapple Pub. Co. v. United States, </em>187 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The court only will disturb a determination \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Substantial evidence on the record constitutes \u201cless than a preponderance, but more than a scintilla.\u201d <em>Novosteel SA v. United States, </em>25 CIT 2, 6, 128 F. Supp. 2d 720, 725 (2001) (quotation marks &amp; citation omitted), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>284 F.3d 1261 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The requisite proof amounts to \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d in light of the entire record, including \u201cwhatever fairly detracts from the substantiality of the evidence.\u201d <em>Atl. Sugar, Ltd. v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (quotation marks &amp; footnote omitted). This standard necessitates that the Department thoroughly examine the record and \u201carticulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quotation marks &amp; citation omitted); <em>accord Bando Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 133, 136-37, 787 F. Supp. 224, 227 (1992). That the court may draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not preclude Commerce from supporting its determination with substantial evidence. <em>Thai Pineapple Pub. Co., </em>187 F.3d at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>To evaluate whether a Commerce determination accords with law, the court applies the two-step test articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council. </em>467 U.S. 837 (1984). First, the court determines whether Congress has spoken directly to the issue at hand; if Congress\u2019s intent is clear, the court and the Department must \u201cgive effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843 (footnote omitted). If the court finds the relevant statute ambiguous or silent with respect to the specific issue, it must defer to the Department\u2019s interpretation as long as it is reasonable. <em>See id. </em>This deference extends to technical methodologies that Commerce may apply to fulfill its statutory mandate. <em>Thai Pineapple Pub. </em>Co., 187 F.3d at 1365 (\u201cThe methodologies relied upon by Commerce in making its determinations are presumptively correct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">A. Whether Commerce Lawfully Recalculated the U.S. Price</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Plaintiffs contend that Commerce exceeded the bounds of the <em>Remand Order </em>when it recalculated the U.S. price during its review of the contested AFA rate. Pis. Comments 3-6. According to Plaintiffs, the <em>Remand Order </em>permitted Commerce to consider <em>only </em>whether Commerce corroborated the AFA rate upon which it relied in calculating the separate rate. Pis. Comments 5. Consequently, Plaintiffs assert that the Department \u201cshould have continued to use the U.S. price provided by petitioner in the petition.\u201d Pis. Comments 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">Plaintiffs mischaracterize the scope of the <em>Remand Order. </em>In the antidumping context, an antidumping duty margin, including one calculated on the basis of AFA, is the difference between the normal value of the subject merchandise and the U.S. price. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673. After the Department determined that it could not corroborate its initial AFA rate on remand, it acted in accordance with law when it used other sources in this case data collected from BWA during the investigation to calculate a new U.S. price in order to produce a revised AFA rate. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1677e(b); <em>Gallant Ocean (Thailand) Co. v. United States, </em>602 F.3d 1319, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <em>PAM S.p.A. v. United States, </em>582 F.3d 1336, 1339-40 &amp; n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that \u201cCommerce is permitted to use the information available to it in choosing and supporting an AFA value\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Ta Chen Stainless Steel Pipe, Inc. v. United States, </em>298 F.3d 1330, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (same); <em>F.Lli de Cecco di Filippo Fara S. Martino S.p.A. v. United States, </em>216 F.3d 1027, 1032 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (same); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.308(c). To interpret the <em>Remand Order </em>as circumscribing Commerce\u2019s ability to choose the proper methodology for its AFA calculation would place an impermissible restraint on the agency\u2019s authority. <em>Shakeproof Assembly Components Div. of Ill. Tool Works, Inc. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 1516, 1526, 412 F. Supp. 2d 1330, 1339 (2005) (\u201c[T]he Federal Circuit has disfavored limited remands which restrict Commerce\u2019s ability to collect and fully analyze data on a contested issue.\u201d) (citing Am. <em>Silicon Techs. v. United States, </em>334 F.3d 1033, 1038-39 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). The court therefore sustains Commerce\u2019s decision to recalculate the U.S. price.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">B. Whether Commerce Erred by Adjusting the U.S. Price for a Sales Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Plaintiffs also claim that Commerce inappropriately adjusted the U.S. price in its revised AFA rate calculation to reflect a purported industry-standard [\u00b6] ]] sales commission. Pis. Comments 6-7. Specifically, they point to two factors that they believe invalidate the Department\u2019s recognition of the commission: (1) that the only individually investigated entity did not pay this commission and (2) that \u201c[t]he only evidence of the existence of Commissions .. . was set forth in the Antidumping Investigation Initiation Checklist\u201d and linked to two subject importers \u201ccontrolled by petitioner.\u201d Pis. Comments 6-7. Accordingly, Plaintiffs insist that no evidence on the record supports Commerce\u2019s finding that the commission exists as an industry practice. Pis. Comments 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">Substantial evidence on the record demonstrates that this contention lacks merit. Although the Department found that the only individually investigated entity did not pay the commission during the period of review, <em>see Remand Results </em>at 19, that finding neither speaks to industry practice as a whole, nor nullifies the record affidavit provided by the petitioner from an industry source stating that \u201ca 7% commission rate is typical . . . <em>for the industry.\u201d </em>Pis. Pub. App. Tab 3 at 2 (quotation marks omitted) (ellipses in original) (emphasis added). Moreover, Plaintiffs point to nothing on the record that undermines the affidavit\u2019s veracity. The court therefore finds that Commerce supported the commission adjustment to its U.S. price calculation with substantial evidence. <em>See Atl. Sugar, Ltd., </em>744 F.2d at 1562.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">C. Commerce\u2019s Use of BWA\u2019s Average Unit Value to Calculate the Revised AFA and Separate Rates</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">Finally, Plaintiffs offer a host of reasons to show that Commerce acted contrary to law when it used the average unit value from a single uncooperative respondent, BWA, to calculate the revised AFA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>and separate rates. First, they aver that the Department erroneously chose BWA\u2019s data solely to obtain a positive separate rate and, instead, should have used data from another uncooperative respondent, which would have produced a separate rate of zero. Pis. Comments 7-9. Second, Plaintiffs insist that BWA\u2019s \u201caberrational and unreliable\u201d data \u201cdo[] not reflect commercial reality.\u201d Pis. Comments 9. More specifically, they argue that the \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d numbers in BWA\u2019s responses appear inaccurate, especially because the Department could not verify the figures due to BWA\u2019s failure to cooperate. Pis. Comments 10-11. Finally, Plaintiffs state that if the court' finds that Commerce did not err in using BWA\u2019s data, Commerce also must use data from another uncooperative respondent so that \u201cthe data will reflect commercial reality.\u201d Pis. Comments 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments have no basis in law. When Commerce used BWA\u2019s data, rather than that of another uncooperative respondent, it complied with the law and its longstanding accepted methodologies for determining AFA and separate rates. Commerce customarily selects \u201cthe highest rate on the record of [a] proceeding\u201d in this case BWAto calculate the AFA rate so that a \u201cparty does not obtain a more favorable result by failing to copperate than if it had cooperated fully.\u201d <em>Remand Results </em>at 15 (citing <em>Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Brazil: Final Results and Partial Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 39,940, 39,942-43 (Dep\u2019t Commerce July 11, 2008); <em>Brake Rotors From the People\u2019s Republic of China: Final Results and Partial Rescission of the Seventh Administrative Review; Final Results of the Eleventh New Shipper Review, </em>70 Fed. Reg. 69,937, 69,939-40 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Nov. 18, 2005)) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see PAM S.p.A., </em>582 F.3d at 1339-40 &amp; n.2; <em>F.Lli de Cecco di Filippo Fara S. Martino S.p.A., </em>216 F.3d at 1032; <em>Mannesmannrohren-Werke AG v. United States, </em>23 CIT 826, 851, 77 F. Supp. 2d 1302, 1323 (1999). Likewise, Commerce followed its customary practice when it calculated the separate rate by averaging the revised AFA rate with the zero rate of the mandatory respondent. <em>Remand Results </em>at 7; <em>see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(B) (\u201cIf the estimated weighted average dumping margins established for all exporters and producers individually investigated are zero or de minimis margins . .., the [Department] may use any reasonable method to establish the estimated all-others rate . . . <em>,\u201d);see also KYD, Inc. v. United States, </em>607 F.3d 760, 768 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <em>Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Light-Walled Rectangular Pipe and Tube From the Republic of Korea, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 5794, 5800 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Jan. 31, 2008). Moreover, Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints about the reliability and accuracy of BWA\u2019s data suggest that Commerce had a duty to corrobo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>rate the firm\u2019s submissions. The Department has no such duty. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677e(c) (\u201cWhen [Commerce] . . . relies on <em>secondary information rather than on information obtained in the course of an investigation </em>or review, [Commerce] ... shall, to the extent practicable, corroborate that information ....\u201d); \u00a7 351.308(c)-(d). Because the agency acquired the data contained in BWA\u2019s questionnaire and response during the investigation, the Department properly used the uncorroborated information to calculate the AFA rate. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677e(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Finally, Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate that the BWA data does not reflect commercial reality. BWA\u2019s average unit value represents approximately [[a large portion]] of all subject merchandise sales in the United States during the period of investigation. <em>Remand Results </em>at 18. Because this value substantially reflects the market of the subject merchandise, the court cannot find BWA\u2019s data to lie outside the realm of commercial reality, let alone instruct the Department to use unverified data from an additional uncooperative respondent to make its calculations. <em>See Ta Chen Stainless Steel Pipe, Inc., </em>298 F.3d at 1339-40; <em>see also KYD, Inc., </em>607 F.3d at 765-67. In sum, the court sustains the Department\u2019s use of BWA\u2019s average unit value in its AFA and separate rate calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">For the reasons stated above, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">ORDERED that the Department\u2019s <em>Remand Results </em>are SUSTAINED; it is further</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">ORDERED that Plaintiffs shall submit their reply brief for the case-in-chief no later than August 20, 2010; and it is further</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">ORDERED that in their reply brief, Plaintiffs shall concisely explain what active claims remain in their Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record. More specifically, Plaintiffs must note which issues have not been rendered moot by the <em>Remand Results </em>and this opinion, citing to the relevant statutory and jurisprudential authorities.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b987-6\"> Commerce presumes that all companies in a non-market economy operate under state-control. However, a company that demonstrates de jure and de facto independence from government control may qualify for a \u201cseparate rate\u201d from that of the country-wide rate assessed against other firms operating within the non-market economy. <em>Royal United Corp. v.
