Defendant United States moves the court for summary judgment, arguing that Customs classified the subject merchandise under the appropriate provisions of the HTSUS. Plaintiff LeMans Corporation (\u201cLeMans\u201d or \u201cPlaintiff\u2019) contests the classification and cross-moves the court for summary judgment, alleging that subheadings within Chapter 95 of the HTSUS covering sports equipment most accurately describe the subject jerseys, pants, and jackets. In view of the applicable General Rules of Interpretation (\u201cGRIs\u201d) and for the reasons explained below, the court grants Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and denies Plaintiff\u2019s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">A. The Subject Merchandise</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">LeMans imported the subject merchandise into the United States through the ports of Chicago and Los Angeles between July 20, 2004 and September 17, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summons 3-4. The merchandise consists of \u201chighly specialized\u201d jerseys, pants, and jackets \u201cdesigned, engineered, and produced exclusively for use while participating in motocross activities and other power sports riding.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. to Def.\u2019s First Interrogs. &amp; Reqs. for Produc., Def. Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. C at 5 (\u201cPI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs.\u201d). The dual purposes of the goods \u201cprevent injury to the rider from abrasion and impacts with motorcycle parts and the surrounding elements, as well as ... provide optimal fit and comfort while participating in the sport.\u201d PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Synthetic, abrasion-resistant mesh and ventilated knit patterned fabric, which also wicks away moisture, makes up the five motocross jerseys at issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 6. \u201cThe jerseys have padded elbows for abrasion and impact protection\u201d and \u201cform an integrated protection system\u201d with the use of \u201ca tacky silicon print on the lower back to keep the jersey tucked into the motocross pant when riding.\u201d PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 6. An oversized, multi-panel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>cut allows for a non-binding fit so that other safety equipment, which if permanently affixed in the good would result in improper fit and inadequate safety,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may be worn under the jersey. Pl. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Six different models comprise the subject pants,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and riders generally use the goods off-road on motocross tracks, supercross tracks, or on other off-road courses. Dep. of Jeffrey T. Hart, Def. Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. B at 12:12-16 (\u201cHart Dep.\u201d). Heavy-duty nylon provides riders with impact and abrasion protection, and the pants contain additional comfort features, such as \u201cmesh panels for venting, heat resistant inner leg areas (made of leather or man[-]made fibers) to prevent burns from the engine and exhaust pipe, and spandex and stretch panels to allow freedom of movement and a non[-]binding fit in the legs, seat, and crotch area.\u201d PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 5. To ensure freedom of movement, the pants also include [\u00b6] ]] hip padding instead of alternative rigid protective elements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Finally, the LeMans motorcycle jackets at issue are the Super Duty, Merc, Tarmac, and the Airtex Sport.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Compl. \u00b6 9. Heavy-duty materials provide protection to the rider on the public street from impact and abrasion injuries \u201cwhich may result from a crash or fall, including the initial impact and the sliding contact with the pavement.\u201d PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 6. Internal armor pads, constructed of [\u00b6] special material ]], appear in the shoulders and elbows, \u201cthe highest impact areas in the event of crashes or falls.\u201d PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 6. The jackets also feature a [\u00b6] ]] back pad for added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>protection. PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 6. LeMans designed the jackets to fit closely to the rider\u2019s body and tapered the sleeves snugly around the wrist \u201cto keep the jacket in proper position while riding or during a crash.\u201d PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 6. The jackets also accommodate a rider\u2019s posture with a cut that has longer sleeves and fuller shoulders, with zippered vents or mesh providing \u201cairflow into the jacket for various riding conditions.\u201d PI. Resp. to Def. First Inter-rogs. 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">In summary, all the subject merchandise are readily recognizable as articles of clothing albeit with certain specialized protective features, some minimal, some more significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">B. The Subject Classification</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Customs classified the subject merchandise under five subheadings within Chapters 61 and 62 of the HTSUS.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The agency entered the relevant motocross jerseys as \u201cSweaters, pullovers, sweatshirts, waistcoats (vests) and similar articles, knitted or crocheted: Of man-made fibers: Other\u201d under subheading 6110.30.30 of the HTSUS at a duty rate of 32% <em>ad valorem. </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 20. Customs classified the subject motocross pants as \u201cGarments, made up of fabrics of heading 5602, 5603, 5903, 5906 or 5907: Other men\u2019s or boy\u2019s garments: Of man-made fibers: Other\u201d under subheading 6210.40.50 of the HTSUS at a duty rate of 7.1% <em>ad </em>valorem.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11,19. Finally, Customs found that the various motorcycle jackets fit within three separate provisions of Heading 6201, HTSUS, and classified and liquidated the Airtex Sport and Merc models under subheading 6201.93.30 at a duty rate of 7.1% <em>ad valorem, </em>the Tarmac jacket under 6201.93.35 at a rate of 27.7% <em>ad valorem, </em>and the Super Duty model under 6201.92.15 at a rate of 6.2% <em>ad </em>valorem.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 21; Answer \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Subject Matter Jurisdiction &amp; Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The Court has exclusive jurisdiction over all civil actions commenced under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515 that contest Customs\u2019s denial of a protest. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a). An action before the court warrants summary judgment \u201cif the pleadings, discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d USCIT R. 56(c); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). A genuine issue of material fact exists only when the court could resolve a factual element under the applicable law in favor of either party. <em>See Marriott Int\u2019l Resorts, L.P. v. United States, </em>586 F.3d 962, 968 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-49 (1986)). If no dispute over a material fact would impact the outcome of the suit and the action focuses solely on the proper classification of the merchandise, as in this case, the court may grant summary judgment. <em>See Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc. v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1363, 1365 (Fed Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The court applies a two-step analysis when determining whether Customs properly classified the imported merchandise. <em>Pillowtex Corp. v. Unites States, </em>171 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc., </em>148 F.3d at 1365). The court first must ascertain the meaning of the terms within the relevant tariff provision and subsequently determine whether the subject merchandise fits within those terms. <em>Id. </em>The first step presents a question of law, <em>Franklin v. United States, </em>289 F.3d 753, 757 (Fed. Cir. 2002), while the second concerns issues of fact. <em>Pillowtex Corp., </em>171 F.3d at 1373. Normally, the factual component of the Customs classification garners a presumption of correctness. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2639(a)(1). However, that presumption does not apply to Customs\u2019s decision when no factual disputes surround the subject merchandise. <em>Intercontinental Marble Corp. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 654, 655 n.3, 264 F. Supp. 2d 1306, 1309 n.3 (2003), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>381 F.3d 1169 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">A. The General Rules of Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The GRIs govern the classification of goods under the HTSUS. <em>Boen Hardwood Flooring, Inc. v. United States, </em>357 F.3d 1262, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court applies the GRIs in numerical order and once a particular rule provides proper classification, the court may not consider any subsequent GRI. <em>See Mita Copystar Am. v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 710, 712 (Fed. Cir. 1998). The products in this case are subject to classification pursuant to the first rule, GRI 1, which holds that \u201cclassification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.\u201d GRI 1; <em>see also Orlando Food Corp. v. United States, </em>140 F.3d 1437, 1440 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Absent contrary legislative intent, the court must construe HTSUS terms \u201caccording to their common and commercial meanings.\u201d <em>Carl Zeiss, Inc. v. United States, </em>195 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citation omitted). The Explanatory Notes (\u201cEN\u201d) that accompany each Chapter of the HTSUS provide persuasive assistance to the court in ascertaining the correct classification of the merchandise, though the explanations do not constitute legally binding authority. <em>See Lonza, Inc. v. United States, </em>46 F.3d 1098, 1109 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Once it determines that the particular heading controls the analysis, the court must look to the subheadings to find the correct classification for the merchandise. <em>See Orlando Food Corp., </em>140 F.3d at 1440. Therefore, under GRI 1, determining the most appropriate classification for the merchandise involves a \u201cclose textual analysis of the language of the headings and the accompanying explanatory notes.\u201d <em>Bauer Nike Hockey USA, Inc. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 1645, 1652, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1345, 1351 (2003), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>393 F.3d 1246 (Fed. Cir. 2004) <em>(\u201cBauer\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>B. The Classification of the Subject Merchandise</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">While Defendant maintains that it correctly classified the merchandise under Chapters 61 and 62 of the HTSUS, Def. Mot. for Summ. J. 8, 21-28, LeMans argues that two provisions under Heading 9506 (subheading 9506.91.00, at a duty rate of 4.6% <em>ad valorem, </em>or in the alternative 9506.99.60, at a rate of 4% <em>ad valorem) </em>best describe the subject jerseys, pants and jackets.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> PI. Mot. for Summ. J. 3-23. Moreover, Plaintiff contends that \u201cthe specialized nature and purpose of [its] goods preclude them from classification in [C]hapters 61 or 62.\u201d PL Mot. for Summ. J. 23. The central question in this case is whether the subject merchandise constitute \u201cother sports equipment\u201d classifiable under Chapter 95 or whether Customs correctly classified the goods in the first instance as certain apparel under Chapters 61 and 62. Because the motocross jerseys, motocross pants, and motorcycle jackets are described by the terms of the respective headings in Chapters 61 and 62, and are wearing apparel, the court agrees with Customs\u2019s classification of the subject merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">1. The Motocross Jerseys <em>&amp; </em>Pants</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The subject motocross jerseys constitute a knitted \u201csweater\u201d under the plain language of Heading 6110. Neither the HTSUS nor the legislative history defines the term sweater. Under the common meaning of those terms, <em>see Carl Zeiss, Inc., </em>195 F.3d at 1379, a sweater describes \u201ca knitted or sometimes crocheted elastic jacket or pullover made in various styles and of various materials and usu[ally] having ribbing around the neck, cuffs, and lower edge,\u201d and a pullover comprises \u201ca garment (as a sweater, shirt, or blouse) that is put on by being pulled over the head and is usu[ally] made without a placket or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>similar opening.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1840, 2308 (2002). A garment typifies \u201can article of outer clothing (as a coat or dress) usu[ally] exclusive of accessories,\u201d and clothing means a \u201ccovering for the human body or garments in general: all the garments and accessories worn by a person at any one time.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>428, 936 (2002); <em>see also H.I.M./Fathom, Inc. v. United States, </em>21 CIT 776, 781, 981 F. Supp. 610, 615 (1997) (citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>428, 936 (1993)). In relevant part, the EN to 6110 adds that the heading covers \u201ca category of knitted or crocheted articles . . . designed to cover the upper parts of the body (jerseys, pullovers, cardigans, waistcoats and similar articles).\u201d EN 61.10. The jerseys consist of synthetic, knit-patterned fabrics cut in assorted designs and made with various mesh and ventilated materials that cover the human body at a particular time, i.e., while engaging in motocross activities and other power sports riding. PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 5-6. Each of the jerseys has a small placket, and an individual must pull the article over his head to wear it. <em>See, </em>e.g., Men\u2019s Core S5 Jersey, PI. Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 12. This description fits closely with the terms of Heading 6110, and because the goods are wearing apparel, <em>see Admiral Craft Equip. Corp. v. United States, </em>82 Cust. Ct. 162, 164 (1979) (not reported in F. Supp.), the court upholds Customs\u2019s classification of the jerseys under subheading 6110.30.30 of the HTSUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Similarly, using the HTSUS-defined meaning of relevant terms and the common understanding of \u201cgarment,\u201d <em>see Carl Zeiss, Inc., </em>195 F.3d at 1379, the language of Heading 6210 controls the classification of the motocross pants. As a garment, the pants cover the human body, and an individual wears the article of outer clothing at a particular time \u2014 when she rides on motocross tracks, supercross tracks, or other off-road courses. Hart Dep. at 12:13-16. Moreover, the pants include certain textile fabrics that fall under Headings 5903 and 5906,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Note 1 to Chapter 59, HTSUS, in that the articles consist of some combination of the following: heavy-duty nylon mesh, heavy-duty ballistic woven nylon fabric, heavy-duty woven polyester, heavy-duty polyester, and Keprotec\u00ae.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Pl.\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 40; Def.\u2019s Resp. to Pl.\u2019s Statement of Undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Material Facts \u00b6 40. These man-made fibers form the \u201cmesh panels for venting, heat resistant inner leg areas,\u201d and the stretch panels \u201cin the legs, seat, and crotch area.\u201d'PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 5. The pants also conform to the relevant EN to Heading 6210. EN 62.10 (stating that heading covers \u201call garments made up of . . . textile fabrics (other than knitted or crocheted fabrics) of heading 59.03, 59.06 or 59.07\u201d) (emphasis removed). The description of the pants situates the article squarely within the terms of Heading 6210 and the class of goods used as wearing apparel. <em>See Admiral Craft Equip. Corp., </em>82 Cust. Ct. at 164. Therefore, the court also upholds Customs\u2019s classification of the pants under subheading 6210.40.50 of the\u2019 HTSUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\">2. The Motorcycle Jackets</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The common definition of an \u201covercoat\u201d encompasses the subject motorcycle jackets and, therefore, the plain text of Heading 6201 covers these articles. A word not defined by the HTSUS or in legislative history, an overcoat connotes \u201ca coat worn over a suit or other clothing,\u201d and \u201ccoat\u201d indicates \u201can outer garment (as a raincoat) usu[ally] with long sleeves, a collar, and a single-breasted or double-breasted front opening made of fabric, fur, or plastic and varying in length and style according to fashion and use.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>433, 1607 (2002). An individual wears the jackets over other clothing and at a particular time, such as when he rides on the public street. PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 6. The jackets also vary in length and style to accommodate a rider\u2019s posture, with a cut that has longer sleeves and fuller shoulders. PI. Resp. to Def. First Interrogs. 6-7. LeMans designed the Men\u2019s and Boys\u2019 articles to consist of a combination of the following materials: heavy-duty polyester knitted and mesh fabrics; Dynax nylon; and a heavyweight waxed cotton chassis. Pl.\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts at \u00b6 82; Def.\u2019s Resp. to Pl.\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts at \u00b6 82. The jackets do not amount to \u201cMen\u2019s or boys\u2019 suits, ensembles, suit-type jackets, blazers, trousers, bib and brace overalls, [or] breeches and shorts (other than swimwear)\u201d under Heading 6203.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In finding that the description of the jackets conform with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>text of Heading 6201 and identify with wearing apparel, <em>see Admiral Craft Equip. Corp., </em>82 Cust. Ct. at 164, the court upholds Customs\u2019s classification of the garments under subheadings 6201.92.15, 6201.93.30, and 6201.93.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">C. The Subject Goods Are Not Eligible for Classification Under Chapter 95 of the HTSUS</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">After providing what it understands as the controlling definition for \u201cequipment,\u201d PL Mot. for Summ. J. 3-4, LeMans avers that the jerseys, pants, and jackets constitute \u201csports equipment\u201d under Heading 9506. PI. Mot. for Summ. J. 5-23. In the event that the subject goods are classifiable both as other sports equipment under Chapter 95 and apparel in Chapters 61 and 62, LeMans argues that GRI 3(a) compels the court to find that Chapter 95 more specifically describes the subject merchandise. PI. Mot. for Summ. J. 29-30. The court is not persuaded by either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The EN to Heading 9506 demonstrates that the subject merchandise is of a different nature and character than those classifiable as \u201csports equipment\u201d under Chapter 95. To qualify as \u201cequipment\u201d for a sport, the good should generally provide \u201cwhat is necessary, useful, or appropriate.\u201d <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>768 (2002) (defining \u201cequipment\u201d as \u201cthe equipping of a person or thing\u201d and \u201cequip\u201d as \u201cto provide with what is necessary, useful, or appropriate\u201d); <em>see also Rollerblade, Inc. v. United States, </em>282 F.3d 1349, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (explaining that \u201cdefinition offered for \u2018equipment\u2019 includes those articles that are necessary and specifically designed for use in athletics and other sports\u201d). While the subject merchandise arguably constitutes useful, if not necessary, articles to motocross and motorcycle riding, Subsection B of EN 95.06 distinguishes the subject merchandise from articles typically classified under Heading 9506.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The examples listed in Subsection B center on non-clothing articles and do not describe apparel like the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>merchandise. Although Example 13 suggests that some apparel-like items might fall under Heading 9506, those examples consist almost entirely of certain internal guards or pads pieced together by minimal textile components, a description that does not fit the subject merchandise. <em>See </em>PL Mot. for Summ. J. Exs. 7-17. In fact, the type of merchandis\u00e9 represented in Example 13 more accurately describes the products that riders typically will attach directly to their body, with the subject merchandise worn over those hard guards and braces. Pl.\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6\u00b6 18, 58, 120; Def.\u2019s Resp. to Pl.\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6\u00b6 18, 58, 120; Hart Dep. 10:4-23, 13:13, 14:19, 19:7-13, 27:24, 29:11, 40:1, 43:20. That riders rely on hard protection worn underneath the jerseys, pants, and jackets illustrates the nature of the subject goods as apparel and not sports equipment. Moreover, Note 1(e) to Chapter 95 provides additional support for the conclusion that goods like the subject merchandise do not constitute sports equipment. Chapter 95, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Note 1(e), HTSUS (explaining that Chapter 95 does not cover, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[s]ports clothing or fancy dress, of textiles, of [C]hapter 61 or 62\u201d). Thus, Heading 9506 does not control the classification of the subject merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">LeMans does not convince the court that the Federal Circuit meant to provide an authoritative definition of \u201cequipment\u201d in <em>Bauer, </em>or that the analysis therein governs the classification of the subject merchandise in this case. 393 F.3d 1246.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In that case, Customs had classified ice hockey pants \u2014 constructed primarily of an exterior nylon or polyester textile shell and an interior assembly of hard nylon plastic guards and soft polyurethane, polyethylene, or polyester foam padding attached to a belt \u2014 under subheading 6211.33.00 of the HT-SUS,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> a classification upheld by this Court. <em>Bauer Nike Hockey USA, Inc., </em>27 CIT at 1651-61, 305 F. Supp. 2d at 1351-59. On appeal, Plaintiff Bauer Nike Hockey USA, Inc. alleged that its merchandise was more appropriately classifiable under subheading 9506.99.25.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Bauer, </em>393 F.3d at 1250. The Federal Circuit disagreed with how this Court construed the term \u201cequipment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1250-51, but in so doing did not give its opinion on what constituted a controlling definition of that term. <em>See id. </em>The Federal Circuit explained that \u201cequipment\u201d defines \u201cthe equipping of a person or thing\u201d and that \u201cequip\u201d means \u201cto provide with what is necessary, useful or appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1251 (citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>768 (1993)) (quotation marks omitted). The Federal Circuit noted that the definition for equipment \u201cprovides no support for the Court of International Trade\u2019s conclusion that an item must be necessary to be equipment because the definition uses the disjunctive, \u2018or,\u2019 in the definition of \u2018equip,\u2019 not the conjunctive, \u2018and.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, in finding that Chapter 95 covered the merchandise at issue in <em>Bauer, </em>the Federal Circuit reached its decision using GRI 3(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1252-53. In this case, the court bases its decision on GRI 1 and finds no need to resort to an analysis under GRI 3. Therefore, the court finds that <em>Bauer </em>does not control its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The Customs classification of certain gear after the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Bauer </em>further demonstrates that the subject goods are distinct from those classifiable under Heading 9506. In 2005, Customs classified under Heading 9506 a shin-guard made of hard plastic with an ethylene-vinyl acetate foam backing permanently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>encased in a specially-fitted polyester sock, noting that the \u201chard protective guard is specially-fitted to the polyester sock in which it is encased and it is not removable.\u201d [\u00b6] 967738 (Sept. 21, 2005). However, later that year, Customs determined that knitted polyester and cotton shorts and pants with high-density foam padding designed for soccer goalkeepers did not constitute sports equipment under Heading 9506, but instead classified the soccer pants and shorts under Heading 6114, HTSUS. [\u00b6] 967957 (Dec. 9, 2005). Customs reasoned that while the articles contained various protective features, the padding appeared \u201cin isolated areas where goalkeepers are most likely to make contact with the ground. Th[at] padding is insubstantial, offering only some cushioning from the ground and protection against ground abrasions.\u201d /\u00bf..Similar to the soccer pants and shorts, the subject merchandise incorporates limited padding to isolated areas of the article, and they do not contain nor are predominantly comprised of hard plastic like the shin-guards in [\u00b6] 967738 or the ice hockey pants in <em>Bauer. See </em>PI. Mot. for Summ. J. Exs. 7-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Finally, as previously noted, the terms of the relevant headings within Chapters 61 and 62 describe the subject merchandise. Because GRI 1 resolves this classification inquiry, the court need not consider any subsequent GRI. <em>See Mita Copystar Am., </em>160 F.3d at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Using GRI 1, the court upholds Customs\u2019s classification of the subject merchandise under the relevant provisions of Chapters 61 and 62 of the HTSUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-10\"> Entry Nos. 279-9313291-2, 279-9313582-4, 279-9313588-1, 279-9313790-3, 279-9313997-4, 279-9316067-3, 279-9316419-6, 279-9317228-0, 279-9317410-4, 279-3205158-7, 279-3205173-6, 279-3205154-6.
