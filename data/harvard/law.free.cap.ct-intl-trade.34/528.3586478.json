(\u201cKYD\u201d) challenges determinations made by the U.S. Department of Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d) in the 2006-07 administrative review of that order. <em>See </em>Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand: Final Results and Partial Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 74 Fed. Reg. 2,511, 2,511 (January 15, 2009) (\u201cFinal Results\u201d). The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c). In moving for judgment on the agency record pursuant to U.S. Court of International Trade (\u201cCIT\u201d) Rule 56.2, KYD argues that the application of adverse inferences with respect to its relevant entries and the selection of a particular antidumping duty rate for those entries are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record and otherwise not in accordance with law. <em>See </em>Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record Pursuant to Rule 56.2 of the Rules of the U.S. Court of International Trade (\u201cKYD\u2019s Motion\u201d); Memorandum in Support of Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record Pursuant to Rule 56.2 of the Rules of the U.S. Court of International Trade (\u201cKYD\u2019s Brief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">KYD\u2019s Motion is GRANTED to the extent described below. Commerce\u2019s determination of the assessment rate for KYD\u2019s relevant entries is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record. Commerce determined that assessment rate without regard to the information submitted by. KYD even though it made no finding under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) that KYD had failed to cooperate and no finding under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e) that it could decline to consider KYD\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>information. Accordingly, this matter is REMANDED to the agency for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In 2004, Commerce published an antidumping duty order on certain polyethylene retail carrier bags (\u201cPRCBs\u201d) from Thailand. <em>See </em>Antidumping Duty Order: Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand, 69 Fed. Reg. 48,204 (August 9, 2004) (\u201cAD Order\u201d). Before the third anniversary of the AD Order, Commerce provided notice of the opportunity to req\u00faest an administrative review for the period of review from August 1, 2006 to July 31, 2007 (\u201cthe POR\u201d). <em>See </em>Anti-dumping or Countervailing Duty Order, Finding, or Suspended Investigation; Opportunity to Request Administrative Review, 72 Fed. Reg. 42,383, 42,383 (August 2, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">During the POR, KYD had imported merchandise subject to the AD Order from King Pac Industrial Co., Ltd. (\u201cKing Pac\u201d) and Master Packaging Co., Ltd. (\u201cMaster Packaging\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Memorandum from Barbara E.

KYD and Defendant-Intervenors Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bag Committee, Hilex Poly Co., LLC, and Superbag Corporation requested an administrative review with respect to King Pac. <em>See </em>Letter from David J.

KYD notified Commerce that it would \u201cmonitor the submission of questionnaire responses\u201d and provide necessary information if any of its suppliers failed to submit an adequate response. Letter from David J. Craven, Riggle &amp; Craven, to Carlos M. Gutierrez, Secretary of Commerce, Re: Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand; A-549-821; Request to Extend Deadline for Submission of Factual Information (December 28, 2007), PR 27 at 2. KYD subsequently submitted information to Commerce \u201cin a form resembling a response to Section C of [Commerce\u2019s] standard questionnaire for U.S. sales and included copies of its relevant purchase orders and supplier invoices. Additionally, KYD explained the sales, shipping, and payment terms associated with its purchases.\u201d Preliminary Results, 73 Fed. Reg. at 52,291; <em>see </em>Letter from David J.

KYD\u2019s Submission at 3 n.2, 13; KYD\u2019s Resubmission at S-3 n.2, S-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">As part of its submission, KYD also provided evidence that King Pac \u201chas apparently arranged for all of its U.S. export business to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>supplied by\u201d Master Packaging. KYD\u2019s Submission at 4; KYD\u2019s Resubmission at S-4.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant-Intervenors responded that \u201cKYD\u2019s submission raises serious new issues which were \u2014 from [Defendant-Intervenors\u2019] perspective \u2014 entirely unexpected\u201d and urged Commerce to investigate the relationship between King Pac and Master Packaging. Letter from King &amp; Spalding to Carlos M. Gutierrez, Secretary of Commerce, Re: Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand (February 4, 2008), CR 14 at 2. Commerce subsequently added Master Packaging as an additional mandatory respondent. Memo from Richard Rimlinger, Program Manager, AD/CVD Enforcement, Office 5, U.S. Department of Commerce, to Laurie Parkhill, Office Director, AD/CVD Enforcement, Office 5, U.S. Department of Commerce, Re: Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand: Selection of Master Packaging as a Mandatory Respondent (March 27, 2008), PR 79 (\u201cMaster Packaging Selection Memo\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">King Pac and Master Packaging did not fully participate in the administrative review. King Pac responded to Commerce\u2019s initial request for information but failed to respond to the antidumping questionnaire, even after Commerce notified King Pac that it was extending the deadline for a response. <em>See </em>Letter from Pattida Jul-sasaksrisakul, Managing Director, King Pac Industrial Co., Ltd. to Office of AD/CVD Operations, U.S. Department of Commerce, Re: Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand (October 19, 2007), PR 11; Preliminary Results, 73 Fed. Reg. at 52,289; Letter from Laurie Parkhill, Office Director, AD/CVD Enforcement, Office 5, U.S. Department of Commerce, to King Pac Industrial Co., Ltd. (January 16, 2008), PR 39 (\u201cExtension Letter\u201d). Master Packaging responded to both the initial request for information and the antidumping questionnaire but failed to respond to a supplemental questionnaire. <em>See </em>Letter from Suthep Dansiriviroj, General Manager, Master Packaging Co., Ltd., to Office of AD/CVD Operations, U.S. Department of Commerce (October 22, 2007), PR 12; Preliminary Results, 73 Fed. Reg. at 52,289-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Because Kang Pac and Master Packaging failed to provide the information that Commerce requested, Commerce preliminarily concluded that the use of facts available was required with respect to each of them. <em>See </em>Preliminary Results, 73 Fed. Reg. at 52,290. Furthermore, because each of these suppliers \u201cfailed to cooperate by not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>acting to the best of its ability,\u201d Commerce preliminarily concluded that \u201cthe use of an adverse inference [was] warranted with respect to\u201d each of them. <em>Id. </em>Commerce \u201cpreliminarily assigned King Pac and Master Packaging the highest [transaction-specific] rate found in the less-than-fair-value investigation, which was 122.88 percent.\u201d Id.; <em>see also </em>Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigations: Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from The People\u2019s Republic of China, Malaysia, and Thailand, 68 Fed. Reg. 42,002, 42,004 (July 16, 2003) (\u201cBased on comparisons of export price to normal value\u201d provided in the 2003 petition, \u201cthe estimated dumping [rates] for PRCBs from Thailand range from 34.84 percent to 122.88 percent.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">For the purpose of corroboration, Commerce preliminarily concluded that the assigned dumping rate was reliable and relevant. Preliminary Results, 73 Fed. Reg. at 52,290. As to reliability, Commerce stated that the rate had been \u201ccalculated from source documents included with the petition\u201d and had been found reliable in the investigation. <em>Id. </em>As to relevancy, Commerce stated that the rate had been calculated from a price quotation that \u201creflected commercial practices of the particular industry during the period of investigation,\u201d had not been contested in the investigation, and had been applied to King Pac in the previous administrative review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Commerce explicitly declined to calculate an importer-specific assessment rate for KYD and implicitly declined to use the information that KYD provided. <em>Id. </em>at 52,291. Commerce noted that KYD had proposed using \u201cdata collected from other respondents as a surrogate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, Commerce concluded that it did \u201cnot have all of the information that is necessary to calculate an accurate margin for the supplier(s) from which KYD purchased subject merchandise during the POR.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Following publication of the Preliminary Results, KYD and Defendant-Intervenors submitted administrative briefs to Commerce. <em>See </em>Case Brief of KYD, Inc., Case No. A-549 821, U.S. Department of Commerce (October 15, 2008), PR 184 (\u201cKYD\u2019s Administrative Brief\u2019); Petitioners\u2019 Case Brief, Case No. A-549-821, U.S. Department of Commerce (October 15, 2008), PR 185. KYD also requested, and Commerce held, an administrative hearing. <em>See </em>Transcript of Hearing, U.S. Department of Commerce, Administrative Review of the Antidumping Duty Order on Polyethylene Bags from Thailand (October 29, 2008), PR 189; Letter from David J. Craven, Riggle &amp; Craven, to Carlos M. Gutierrez, Secretary of Commerce, Re: Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand; A-549-821, Request for a Hearing (September 16, 2008), PR 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The Final Results mirrored the Preliminary Results with respect to all issues relevant to this action. <em>See </em>Final Results, 74 Fed. Reg. 2,511, 2,511-12; <em>see also </em>Final Results Memo. Commerce announced that it had relied on \u201ctotal adverse facts available to establish the dumping [rates] for King Pac and Master Packaging\u201d and that it would accordingly \u201cinstruct [U.S. Customs and Border Protection] to apply [an antidumping duty assessment rate] of 122.88 percent to all entries of subject merchandise produced and/or exported by these companies.\u201d Final Results, 74 Fed. Reg. at 2,512. With respect to entries supplied by the two other mandatory respondents, Commerce calculated importer-specific assessment rates and reported weighted average dumping margins of 32.67 percent and 8.94 percent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">KYD subsequently commenced this action under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2). <em>See </em>Summons (January 26, 2009); Complaint (February 5, 2009). Defendant-Intervenors intervened as a matter of right pursuant to CIT Rule 24(a). <em>See </em>February 6, 2009 Order. KYD moved for judgment on the agency record pursuant to CIT Rule 56.2. <em>See </em>KYD\u2019s Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The court will hold unlawful a determination by Commerce resulting from an administrative review of an antidumping duty order if that determination is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i); <em>see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">A determination is supported by substantial evidence if the record contains \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Cleo Inc. v. United States, </em>501 F.3d 1291, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S. Ct. 456, 95 L. Ed. 456 (1951)). While the court must consider contradictory evidence, \u201cthe substantial evidence test does not require that there be an absence of evidence detracting from the agency\u2019s conclusion, nor is there an absence of substantial evidence simply because the reviewing court would have reached a different conclusion based on the same record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Am. <em>Silicon Techs. v. United States, </em>261 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <em>U.S. Steel Group v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <em>Universal Camera, </em>340 U.S. at 487-88).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">To determine whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation and application of an antidumping statute at issue is otherwise \u201cin accordance with law,\u201d the court must conduct the two-step analysis articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>(1984). Under the first step of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, the court must ascertain \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Wheatland Tube Co. v. United States, </em>495 F.3d 1355, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">The court reaches the second step of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis only \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843). Under this second step, the court must evaluate whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation \u201cis based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843. The agency\u2019s construction need not be the only reasonable interpretation or even the most reasonable interpretation. <em>See Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 443, 450, 98 S. Ct. 2441, 57 L. Ed. 2d 337 (1978) (citations omitted). The court must defer to Commerce\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute even if it might have adopted another interpretation had the question first arisen in a judicial proceeding. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Jurisdiction is available under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) to review KYD\u2019s claims. KYD argues that Commerce\u2019s application of adverse inferences and selection of a particular antidumping duty assessment rate are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record and otherwise not in accordance with law. At this point it is sufficient to conclude that substantial evidence does not support Commerce\u2019s selection, in disregard of information submitted by KYD, of a total adverse facts available assessment rate for KYD\u2019s relevant entries.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Relevant Statutory Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In an administrative review, Commerce is required to \u201cdetermine \u2014 (i) the normal value and export price (or constructed export price) of each entry of the subject merchandise, and (ii) the dumping margin for each such entry.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A); <em>see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677b (defining \u201cnormal value\u201d), 1677a (defining \u201cexport price\u201d). The \u201cdumping margin\u201d is \u201cthe amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price or constructed export price of the subject merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u201c [I]f there is a significant volume of sales of the subject merchandise or a significant number or types of products,\u201d then Commerce is authorized, but not required, to \u201cuse averaging and statistically valid samples\u201d to determine export price, constructed export price, or normal value and to \u201ccarryO out\u201d the administrative review. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(a). The \u201cpreferred methodology\u201d in an administrative review is to compare \u201cexport prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions to the weighted average price of sales of the foreign like product.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(2); Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, H.R.

SAA at 870, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4199. The Federal Circuit had concluded that this statutory standard permitted Commerce to presume that \u201cthe highest prior margin is the most probative evidence of current margins because, if it were not so, the importer, knowing of the rule, would have produced <em>current </em>information showing the margin to be less.\u201d <em>Rhone Poulenc, Inc. v.

Indeed, Commerce did not determine the export price, the normal value, or the dumping margin of KYD\u2019s entries as directed by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a). Instead, it resorted to \u201ctotal adverse facts available\u201d and selected a uniform antidumping duty rate of 122.88 percent. <em>See </em>Preliminary Results, 73 Fed. Reg. at 52,289-90; Final Results, 74 Fed. Reg. at 2,512.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Commerce\u2019s explanation of its resort to total adverse facts available is at odds with the plain meaning of 19 \u00da.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A). <em>See </em>Final Results Memo. Commerce concluded that it was \u201cnot authorize [d]\u201d to \u201ccalculate an importer-specific assessment rate that is based on anything other than the dumping margins [Commerce] determines and applies to King Pac and Master Packaging for the period of review.\u201d Final Results Memo. However, Commerce is not directed to determine dumping margins at an exporter level. Rather, it is directed by Congress to determine the normal v\u00e1lue and export price of \u2014 and the dumping margin <em>for </em>\u2014 \u201ceach <em>entry of </em>the subject merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A) (emphasis added). As Commerce\u2019s own regulation states, Commerce \u201cnormally will calculate an assessment rate for each importer of subject merchandise covered by\u201d an administrative review and \u201cnormally will calculate [that] assessment rate by dividing the dumping margin found on the subject merchandise examined by the entered value of such merchandise for normal customs duty purposes.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.212(b)(1); <em>see also </em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties, 62 Fed. Reg. 27,296, 27,314 15 (May 19, 1997) (justifying Commerce\u2019s prior shift from an entry-specific assessment method to an importer-specific assessment method); Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties, 61 Fed. Reg. 7,308, 7,316-17 (February 27, 1996) (\u201cTo the extent possible, these assessment rates will be specific to each importer, because the amount of duties assessed should correspond to the degree of dumping reflected in the price paid by each importer.\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>An additional regulation reflects Commerce\u2019s recognition of the statutory propriety of entry- and importer-specific determinations. 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402(f) requires each importer to certify whether its suppliers have agreed to pay or reimburse antidumping duties for each of its subject entries, permits Commerce to presume reimbursement if no such certification is filed, and directs Commerce to reduce the export price to negate actual or presumed reimbursement. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402(f); <em>see also </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.26 (1989); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.55 (1981); <em>Hoogovens Staal BV v. United States, </em>22 CIT 139, 140-41, 4 F. Supp. 2d 1213 (1998). In other words, Commerce correctly believes that it is authorized to determine specific export prices, and hence specific dumping margins, for entries and for importers.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">It was in the context of this regulation that this court previously rejected arguments similar to those now raised by Defendant and Defendant-intervenors. In the administrative review challenged in <em>Valley Fresh Seafood, Inc. v. United States, </em>31 CIT 1989 (2007), Commerce found that an exporter had entered into a reimbursement agreement with an importer other than the plaintiff. <em>See Valley Fresh, </em>24 CIT at 1992. Commerce then made an adverse inference that the exporter \u201chad entered into such agreements with all of its U.S. importers,\u201d and it accordingly increased the assessment rate for all of these importers, including the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff challenged this adverse inference, and the United States and the defendant-intervenors unsuccessfully moved to dismiss. <em>See id. </em>at 1997. The United States contended that \u201c[a]bsent certain exceptions which do not apply here . . . , the law does not provide for importer rates which are separate from the producer/exporter rates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The defendant-intervenors likewise contended that \u201cwhen Commerce applies facts otherwise available and adverse inferences to a foreign producer or exporter that has failed to cooperate to the best of its ability, that same rate applies equally to all of the importers for that producer or exporter regardless of the expectations or specific actions of the importers involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Because this court found no merit in these arguments, particularly in light of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A), it declined to dismiss the action. <em>Id. </em>at 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>These arguments \u2014 including Defendant\u2019s augmentation of Commerce\u2019s administrative analysis with selectively quoted statutory language \u2014 are no more persuasive in the instant action.

Otherwise, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a) directs Commerce to \u201cdetermine . . . the dumping margin for each . . . entry,\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A), and establishes this determination as \u201cthe basis for the assessment of . . . antidumping duties on entries of merchandise covered by the determination and for deposits of estimated duties,\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(C).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">This court has previously recognized that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a) entitles a cooperative party \u201cto have its margin determined accurately and according to the relevant information on the record of the administrative review.\u201d <em>SKF USA, Inc. v.

Consideration of KYD\u2019s information pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e) would obviate this paradoxical result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\"> 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2) provides an exception authorizing, but not requiring, Commerce to limit the examination to, <em>inter alia, </em>certain \u201cexporters and producers.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673e(c)(3), from which Defendant also quotes, applies only to \u201c[s]ecurity in lieu of estimated duty pending early determination of duty.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673e(c); <em>see </em>Defendant\u2019s Response at 10 (quoting 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673e(c)(3)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\"> In the administrative review challenged in <em>SKF, </em>Commerce used an inference adverse to an exporter based on a finding that a supplier unaffiliated with the exporter had failed to act to the best of its ability. <em>SKF, </em>2009 Ct. Int\u2019l Trade LEXIS 154 at *4, *23-24. This court concluded that Commerce lacks \u201cauthority under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) to use an inference that is adverse to a party to the proceeding absent a factual finding that such party.\u2018failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *26-27 (citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b)). Although this court.found that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) is \u201csilent or ambiguous on the precise question\u201d of whether \u201cthe non-cooperating party against whom an inference is drawn [must] also be a party to the proceeding,\u201d it could not accept as reasonable \u201ca construction of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) under which the party who suffers the effect of the adverse inference is not the party who failed to cooperate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>*27-28 (citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843), *31.

That construction, this court stated, \u201cmakes a mockery of any notion of fairness\u201d by permitting an \u201cabsurd result\u201d that contravenes the \u201cfundamental purpose of the antidumping law,\u201d which is to \u201cdetermin[e] current margins as accurately as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *30 (quoting <em>Rhone Poulenc, </em>899 F.2d at 1191) (citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)), *32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b565-13\"> Commerce can continue to ensure that King Pac and Master Packaging do \u201cnot obtain a more favorable result by failing to cooperate than if [they] had cooperated fully.\u201d SAA at 870, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4199. Remand in this action is limited to KYD\u2019s entries of the subject merchandise during the POR \u2014 entries which have already occurred and for which KYD alone is required to pay duties pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673g(b)(4). Commerce need not revisit the assessment rate for entries not imported by KYD or the cash deposit rate for entries subsequently exported by King Pac and Master Packaging. KYD\u2019s information would not appear to provide a \u201creliable basis\u201d for these determinations, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e)(3), as they involve entries by importers other than KYD. Finally, it is premature to decide whether Commerce may use inferences that are adverse to KYD, either in the determination of the normal value of KYD\u2019s entries or in the renewed application of \u201ctotaladverse facts available.\u201d On remand, Commerce could conceivably determine that the use of adverse inferences is unwarranted by the facts even if such use is authorized by the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
