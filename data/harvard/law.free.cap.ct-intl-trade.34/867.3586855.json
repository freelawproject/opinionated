After the initial determination, Commerce must perform annual reviews of outstanding countervailing duty orders.

EPCGS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>provides for a reduction or exemption of customs duties and excise taxes on imports of capital goods used in the production of exported products.

In this calculation, Commerce included the GOI Special Additional Duty (\u201cSAD\u201d). <em>See </em>Memorandum from Stephen J.

MTZ Case Brief at 4-6, 24-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">In December 2008, Commerce rendered its final determination in the subject administrative review. <em>Final Results, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 75,672. Although Commerce made certain revisions to the rate calculations for MTZ, inclusion of SAD in the EPCGS benefit calculation and application of AFA remained from the <em>Preliminary Results.

(December 5, 2008), P.R. 93; <em>Decision Memo </em>at 4-14, 41.

It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Aimcor v. United States, </em>154 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States, </em>750 F.2d 927, 933 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). \u201c[T]he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Matsushita,750 F.2d at 933 (quoting <em>Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S. Ct. 1018, 16 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">In determining the existence of substantial evidence, a reviewing court must consider \u201cthe record as a whole, including evidence that supports as well as evidence that \u2018fairly detracts from the substanti-ality of the evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>Huaiyin Foreign Trade Corp.

While the court must consider contradictory evidence, \u201cthe substantial evidence test does not require that there be an absence of evidence detracting from the agency\u2019s conclusion, nor is there an absence of substantial evidence simply because the reviewing court would have reached a different conclusion based on the same record.\u201d <em>Cleo Inc. v.

Pfennig, </em>541 U.S. 232, 239, 124 S. Ct. 1741, 158 L. Ed. 2d 450 (2004). If instead Congress has left a \u201cgap\u201d for Commerce to fill, the agency\u2019s regulation is \u201cgiven controlling weight unless [it is] arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">MTZ does not prevail on either of its challenges to the <em>Final Results, </em>because Commerce, lawfully and with the support of substantial evidence, included SAD in calculating the EPCGS benefit conferred on MTZ, <em>infra </em>Part IV.A and applied AFA to MTZ for the export financing program, <em>infra </em>Part IV.B. These Commerce determinations are not invalidated by a verification of MTZ during the prior POR, <em>infra </em>Part IV.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">\n<em>Commerce Properly Included SAD In The Benefit MTZ Received Under EPCGS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">MTZ does not challenge Commerce\u2019s premise that benefits conferred by EPCGS are countervailable. <em>See Preliminary Results, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 45,961-62 (\u201cthe Department determined that import duty reductions provided under the EPCGS are a countervailable export subsidy\u201d); MTZ Case Brief at 3-19 (arguing that \u201cThe Benefits Received By MTZ Under the ECPGS [sic] Programs Are Grossly Overstated\u201d). MTZ also does not challenge Commerce\u2019s stated general approach to calculating the benefit received under EPCGS. <em>See </em>MTZ\u2019s Motion at 6-11 (citing <em>Decision Memo </em>at 14). Rather, the sole issue concerning EPCGS is whether Commerce properly included SAD in calculating the benefit MTZ received. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">GOI in March 2008 informed Commerce that \u201c[a]ny article which was imported into India was liable to a special additional duty.\u201d Letter from Umesh Kumar, Second Secretary (Commerce), Embassy of India, to Secretary of Commerce, Re: First Supplemental Questionnaire Concerning the Countervailing Duty Administrative Review of [PET Film] from India (March 28, 2008), P.R. 26 (\u201cGOI Supp. Response\u201d), at 8. GOI further quoted its 1975 Customs Tariff Act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-10\">Any article which is imported into India shall ... be liable to a duty (hereinafter referred to in this section as [SAD]), which shall be levied at a rate to be specified by the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, having regard to the maximum sales tax, local tax or any other charges for the time being leviable on a like article on its sales purchase in India: Provided that until such rate is specified by the Central Government, [SAD] shall be levied and collected at the rate of eight per cent of the value of the article imported into India.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b897-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Based on this GOI information, Commerce preliminarily included the non-collection of SAD in the benefit received by MTZ under EPCGS. <em>See Decision Memo </em>at 22-24. MTZ challenged this decision, contending that SAD \u201cdid not apply to the importations made under the license and were not part of the duty foregone by [GOI], and thus the amount of the duty savings for MTZ.\u201d MTZ Case Brief at 4-5. MTZ claimed support for this proposition from correspondence from GOI. <em>Id. </em>at 5 (citing Letter from Paul Fernandes, DY Commissioner of Customs, to M/s.MTZ . . . , Foregone of Customs Duty . . .

In response, GOI once more informed Commerce that \u201c[a]ny article which is imported into India is liable to a special additional duty\u201d and again quoted its 1975 Customs Tariff Act that, absent specification by GOI, SAD \u201cshall be levied and collected at the rate of eight per cent of the value of the article imported into India.\u201d Letter from Banhashri B Harrison, Minister (Commerce), Embassy of India, to U.S. Department of Commerce, Re: Fifth Supplemental Questionnaire concerning the Countervailing Duty Administrative Review of [PET Film] from India (August 29, 2008), PR. 65 (\u201cGOI 5th Supp. Response\u201d), at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Commerce asked MTZ to clarify aspects of SAD. 5th Supp. MTZ Questionnaire Att.

Provide supporting documentation for your response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 10. MTZ\u2019s response included the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>\u2022 \u201cMTZ did not report any [SADs] for [one EPCGS license] as it was not subject to these duties.

I at 5-6, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Not persuaded by MTZ\u2019s response, Commerce continued to include SAD in its benefit calculation for the <em>Final Results. See Decision Memo </em>at 24. Commerce declined to interpret the GOI Customs Duty Foregone Letter as setting forth the maximum benefit conferred to MTZ under EPCGS. <em>Id. </em>Instead, Commerce explained that the document \u201crefers to the customs duty foregone only, and not to any other duties levied by the GOI on imports. Thus, the document issued by the GOI cannot be considered to be representative of all duties foregone by the GOI under this program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Commerce further found MTZ\u2019s response to be inadequate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-7\">MTZ did not explain in its response under what circumstances . . . the SAD . . . applies] to imports to India; MTZ also did not explain or discuss the applicability of the SAD to any other EPCGS license it obtained. MTZ failed to provide any documentary evidence of its claim that it was not liable for these duties and made no application to be exempted from these duties as they did not apply. In fact, GOI statements contradict this claim by MTZ. . . . Therefore, in the absence of any documentary evidence to the contrary, we continue to determine that the SAD applied to all of MTZ\u2019s imports under the EPCGS program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">Commerce properly included SAD in calculating the benefit received by MTZ under EPCGS. The repeated and unequivocal GOI statements that the SAD applied to \u201c[a]ny any article which is imported into India\u201d provided a reasonable basis for Commerce to presume inclusion. GOI Supp. Response at 8; GOI 5th Supp. Response at 5. The lone GOI document cited by MTZ indicates only the customs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>duty foregone. <em>See </em>GOI Customs Duty Foregone Letter; <em>Decision Memo </em>at 24. It \u201cprovides only an amount and does not explain how [GOI] calculated the \u2018duty saved.\u2019\u201d Defendant\u2019s Response to Plaintiff\u2019s Rule 56.2 Motion for Judgment Upon the Agency Record (\u201cDefendant\u2019s Opposition\u201d) at 11. MTZ\u2019s reliance on the GOI Customs Duty Foregone Letter, <em>see </em>MTZ Motion at 7; October 6, 2008 Transcript at 13, is undercut because the percentage of the duty saved that the letter sets forth is greater than that asserted by MTZ as the percentage comprising all GOI duties foregone. <em>Compare </em>GOI Customs Duty Foregone Letter (stating a \u201cDuty Saved\u201d that is approximately 38 percent of the \u201cCIF Value\u201d stated) <em>with </em>MTZ Response Ex. 12 (asserting that 35 percent is the \u201cDuty Rate Absent the [EPCGS] Program\u201d); <em>see </em>October 6, 2008 Transcript at 13. For these reasons, Commerce was not required to construe the GOI Customs Duty Foregone Letter as conclusively establishing the inapplicability of SAD.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">MTZ\u2019s statements and omissions support Commerce\u2019s EPCGS benefit calculation. When asked after the <em>Preliminary Results </em>to clarify SAD,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> MTZ not only confirmed the general applicability of SAD, but provided inconsistent statements about both the SAD percentage and whether SAD applied to MTZ. <em>See </em>MTZ 5th Supp. Response Att. I at 5-6, 7. MTZ in fact conceded the applicability of SAD, although not the percent. <em>See id. </em>Att. I at 7. Moreover, MTZ did not include any record support despite being asked to \u201cprovide supporting documentation for your response.\u201d 5th Supp. MTZ Questionnaire Att. I \u00b6 10; <em>see </em>MTZ\u2019s 5th Supp. Response Att. I at 5-8. Without such evidence, MTZ did not rebut the presumption of SAD applicability based on the GOI responses,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and it did not support its claim that \u201c[t]here was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>evidence that this was an unpaid duty under the license,\u201d MTZ\u2019s Motion at 10. Defendant-Intervenors are correct that MTZ \u201cfails to cite any GOI laws or regulations showing this to be the case, or, at a minimum, to explain how a duty applicable to \u2018any article ... at a specified rate\u2019 did not apply to the capital goods MTZ imported under the license.\u201d Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record Pursuant to Rule 56.2 by Defendant-Intervenors ... at 7 (quoting GOI Supp. Response at 8) (emphasis removed).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">. These GOI and MTZ statements about SAD provide \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\u201d Commerce\u2019s calculation of the benefit MTZ received under EPCGS. <em>Aimcor, </em>154 F.3d at 1378 (quoting <em>Matsushita, </em>750 F.2d at 933). That Commerce could have alternatively construed the GOI Customs Duty Foregone Letter as supporting the exclusion of SAD does not negate support of the calculation by substantial evidence. <em>See Cleo, </em>501 F.3d at 1296 (citing <em>Universal Camera, </em>340 U.S. at 487-88).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">\n<em>Commerce Properly Applied AFA To MTZ</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AKN-\">\n<em>1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\"><em>AFA </em>Overview</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Commerce is permitted in certain circumstances to render determinations through the application of AFA. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e. The statute provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-9\">(a) In general. If\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-10\">(1) necessary information is not available on the record, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-11\">(2) an interested party or any other person\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-12\">(A) withholds information that has been requested by the administering authority . . . under this title,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-13\">(B) fails to provide such information by the deadlines for submission of the information . . . ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-14\">(C) significantly impedes a proceeding ... , or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-15\">(D) provides such information but the information cannot be verified . . . , the administering authority . . . shall. . . use the facts otherwise available in reaching the applicable determination ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-16\">(b) Adverse inferences. If the administering authority... finds that an interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information from the administering authority . . . , the administering authority ..., in reaching the applicable determination under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>this title, may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\"><em>Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>337 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003), clarifies this statute. There, the Federal Circuit explained that the adverse-inference provision focuses on the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-6\">respondent\u2019s failure to cooperate to the best of its ability, not its failure to provide requested information.... To conclude that an importer has not cooperated to the best of its ability and to draw an adverse inference under section 1677e(b), Commerce need only make two showings. First, it must make an objective showing that a reasonable and responsible importer would have known that the requested information was required to be kept and maintained under the applicable statutes, rules, and regulations. Second, Commerce must then make a subjective showing that the respondent under investigation not only has failed to promptly produce the requested information, but further that the failure to fully respond is the result of the respondent\u2019s lack of cooperation in either: (a) failing to keep and maintain all required records, or (b) failing to put forth its maximum efforts to investigate and obtain the requested information from its records. An adverse inference may not be drawn merely from a failure to respond, but only under circumstances in which it is reasonable for Commerce to expect that more forthcoming responses should have been made; i.e., under circumstances in which it is reasonable to conclude that less than full cooperation has been shown. While intentional conduct, such as deliberate concealment or inaccurate reporting, surely evinces a failure to cooperate, the statute does not contain an intent element. \u201cInadequate inquiries\u201d may suffice. The statutory trigger for Commerce\u2019s consideration of an adverse inference is simply a failure to cooperate to the best of respondent\u2019s ability, regardless of motivation or intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1381-83 (citation omitted) (emphasis removed).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Commerce is by statute afforded discretion in applying adverse inferences. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b). \u201cCommerce\u2019s special expertise in administering the anti-dumping law entitles its decisions to deference from the courts.\u201d <em>Nippon Steel, </em>337 F.3d at 1379 (citations omitted). \u201cCommerce\u2019s discretion is particularly great in the case of uncooperative respondents.... \u2018Commerce\u2019s discretion in these matters, however, is not unbounded.\u2019\u201d <em>Gallant Ocean (Thailand) Co. v.

This request included the following program description: \u201c[RBI], through commercial banks, provides pre-shipment financing or \u2018packing credits,\u2019 to exporters.

The term \u201cpacking credits\u201d have previously been defined by the Department as being those credits which were expressly provided by [RBI]....

Given Commerce\u2019s position carried over from the previous review that the program was countervailable, <em>see </em>Initial Questionnaire at III-6, \u201ca reasonable and responsible [exporter] would have known that the requested information was required to be kept and maintained,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number><em>Nippon Steel, </em>337 F.3d at 1382.

I at 3, Att. II; 4th Supp. MTZ Questionnaire Att. I \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2; <em>Preliminary Results, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 45,958-61; 5th Supp. MTZ Questionnaire, Att.

Commerce in September 2007 conducted a verification of MTZ as part of the previous review of the <em>CVD Order, </em>covering the calendar year 2005 POR. <em>See </em>Memorandum from Elfi Blum &amp; Toni Page, International Trade Compliance Analysts, to Thomas Gilgunn, Program Manager, AD/CVD Operations, Office 6, U.S. Department of Commerce, Countervailing Duty Administrative Review of. . . PETO Film from India, Verification of the Questionnaire Responses Submitted by MTZ . . . (December 7, 2007), MTZ 5th Supp. Response Ex. SSSS-4(d), MTZ Case Brief Ex.

Reg. 43,607 (August 6, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">During that verification, Commerce \u201cdiscussed MTZ\u2019s usage of the EPCGS program with company representatives.\u201d Verification Report at 10. Commerce reviewed the two MTZ EPCGS licenses at issue in the 2006 POR <em>CVD Order </em>review. Id.; MTZ 5th Supp. Response Att. I at 5-6. Commerce at that time \u201crequested and MTZ provided infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>mation on the duty rates the company would have paid absent the program.\u201d Verification Report at 10. MTZ claims that Commerce\u2019s acceptance of the information provided at that time \u201cestablishes . . . the correct amount... for duty foregone by [GOI] and saved by MTZ. This, in turn, represents the upper limit of the EPCGS benefit.\u201d MTZ\u2019s Motion at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">Commerce did not address the prior review verification in rendering the <em>Final Results. See Decision Memo </em>at 1, 11-14. MTZ contends that \u201cCommerce did not make any explanation for its change from its prior decision.\u201d MTZ\u2019s Motion at 11. According to MTZ, Commerce erred because the <em>Decision Memo </em>\u201cis silent on the impact of the verification and silent as to any reasons why Commerce changed its calculation from the prior review to this review.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">During that verification, Commerce also established that MTZ did not receive benefits under the export financing program during the 2005 POR. <em>See </em>Memorandum from Stephen J. Claeys, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, to David M. Spooner, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Issues and Decision Memorandum in the Final Results of the Countervailing Duty Administrative Review of [PET Film] from India (February 4, 2008) at 6, MTZ 5th Supp. Response Ex. SSSS-3. MTZ contends that this finding as to the 2005 POR demonstrates that MTZ did not receive benefits under the program in the 2006 POR. <em>See </em>MTZ 5th Supp. Response Att. I at 1-2 (citing Verification Report); MTZ\u2019s Motion at 11-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Commerce Sufficiently Explained Its Bases For The Challenged Determinations</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">\u201cMTZ does not disagree with the basic statement of law,\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Reply to Responses Submitted by the Defendant and Defendant-Intervenors to Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record Submitted Pursuant to Rule 56.2 of the Rules of the United States Court of International Trade (\u201cMTZ\u2019s Reply\u201d) at 3, \u201cthat the Department has the authority to reach a differing determination in separate reviews,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 4-. MTZ recognizes that Commerce can collect new information and reach a different determination in the 2006 POR than in the prior POR that included verification. <em>See </em>MTZ\u2019s Motion at 8 n.2 (MTZ stating that an Education Cess exemption was properly excluded from the EPCGS benefit calculation for the 2006 POR despite its inclusion in the 2005 POR); <em>Decision Memo </em>at 22. Defendant is correct that prior POR determinations are \u201cnot at issue in this dispute.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Motion at 12, 20 (\u201cWhether or not Commerce found that MTZ benefitted from [the export financing] program based upon different shipments of subject merchandise and different loans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>in a prior review is not relevant to whether Commerce properly determined that MTZ received packing credits on shipments of subject merchandise in this [POR].\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Precedent from this court establishes that \u201cCommerce may adapt its views and practices to the particular circumstances of the case at hand, so long as the agency\u2019s decisions are explained and supported by substantial evidence on the record.\u201d <em>Save Domestic Oil, Inc. v. United States, </em>26 CIT 1380, 1395, 240 F. Supp. 2d 1342 (2002) (citing <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 42-43, 103 S. Ct. 2856, 77 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1983); <em>Asociacion Colombiana de Exportadores de Flores v. United States, </em>22 CIT 173, 184-85, 6 F. Supp. 2d 865 (1998)), <em>aff\u2019d </em>357 F.3d 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The Federal Circuit instructs that \u201cif Commerce has a routine practice for addressing like situations, it must either apply that practice or provide a reasonable explanation as to why it departs therefrom.\u201d <em>Save Domestic Oil, </em>357 F.3d at 1283-84 (citing <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs., </em>463 U.S. at 42-43).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Commerce\u2019s not having addressed the 2005 <em>CVD Order </em>verification in the <em>Decision Memo </em>does not invalidate the challenged determinations. The one-time, record-specific verification of MTZ\u2019s EPCGS benefit and export credit financing program participation (or lack thereof) from the prior POR does not approximate \u201ca routine practice\u201d obligating Commerce to justify its \u201cdeparture] therefrom,\u201d <em>Save Domestic Oil, </em>357 F.3d at 1283-84. The verification not being addressed here is therefore distinguishable from the cases where Commerce was required to explain its reversal. <em>See, e.g., CINSA, S.A. de C.V. v. United States, </em>21 CIT 341, 347, 349, 966 F. Supp. 1230 (1997) (plaintiff provided information that was \u201cexactly the same for the previous three administrative reviews\u201d and Commerce improperly \u201cchange [d] its methodology without explanation.\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">MTZ\u2019s reliance on the previous <em>CVD Order </em>review \u201cis misplaced. Even assuming Commerce\u2019s determinations at issue are factually identical, as a matter of law a prior administrative determination is not binding on other reviews before this court.\u201d <em>Alloy Piping Prods., Inc. v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 09-29, 2009 WL 983078, at *6 (CIT April 14, 2009) (holding that Commerce properly granted a constructed export price offset to a respondent despite not having done so in the previous administrative review). The challenged determinations here need only be supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i).
