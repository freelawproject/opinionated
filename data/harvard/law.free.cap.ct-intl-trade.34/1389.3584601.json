As Commerce explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-4\">TPBG\u2019s reported COP and CV data indicate considerable cost disparities among products with similar physical characteris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>tics.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> . . . TPBG explained that, because the Rayong facility is more efficient than the Sampran facility, the per-kg costs at the Rayong facility are lower than the costs at the Sampran facility. . . .TPBG explained that it produces more home-market products at the Sampran facility and more export products at the Rayong facility.... TPBG explained that priority is given to U.S. production runs over home-market production runs. Specifically, TPBG explained that U.S. production runs are run on a continuous basis whereas home-market production runs are often interrupted for priority export runs. TPBG explained that the stop and go for domestic production results in greater production inefficiencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1414-5\">[I]t is unreasonable to attribute the starts and stoppages, and associated inefficiencies, mainly to the home-market products. By TPBG\u2019s own admission, the cause of the stoppages is management\u2019s own internal decision concerning the export and home-market production runs and not due to production activities or requirements of the domestic product. Accordingly, we determine that the cost differences created by TPBG\u2019s methodology are not attributable to the physical differences between the home-market and U.S. products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1414-6\">[19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.411] states, \u201c{t}he Secretary will not consider differences in [COP] when compared merchandise has identical physical characteristics.\u201d In <em>[Stainless Steel Bar from, the United </em>Kingdom<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> ] and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum at Comment 1, we reaffirmed our policy that we would determine whether cost differences may affect the accuracy of the margin calculation, when such cost differences are attributable to factors beyond physical characteristics (such as situations where the merchandise is produced at separate facilities or the cost differences are high even though the physical differences appear small). In such instances, we have adjusted costs to address the distortion. <em>See, e.g., [Hot-Rolled Flat-Rolled Carbon-Quality Steel Products From Japan</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>at Comment 22; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number><em>Small Diameter Circular Seamless Carbon and Alloy Steel, Standard, Line and Pressure Pipe From </em>Brazil<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> ] at Comment 2.

Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-4\">We disagree [with petitioners/Defendant-intervenors] . .. that we should use TPBG\u2019s reported costs for the purposes of the sales-below-cost test and the calculation of constructed value. Normally, the product costs a respondent reports should reflect cost differences attributable to the different physical characteristics we define to ensure that the product-specific costs we use for the below-cost test reflect the corresponding product\u2019s physical characteristics accurately without hiding extraneous factors that may affect differences in costs. In addition, [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(6)(C)(ii)] requires that we account for and adjust for any differences attributable to physical differences between subject merchandise and foreign like product if similar products are compared. For this purpose, [19 C.F.R. \u00a7351.411(b)] directs us to consider differences in variable costs associated with the physical differences in the merchandise, i.e., the difference-in-merchandise adjustment. Normally, we use a respondent\u2019s product-specific costs (that reflect cost differences attributable to our defined physical characteristics as described above) for the below-cost test. <em>See </em>[19 U.S.C.\u00a7 1677b(b)(l)] . Similarly, the product-specific costs should incorporate differences in variable costs associated with the physical differences in the merchan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>dise in accordance with [19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.411(b)] and be used for the difference-in-merchandise adjustment. In contrast, where a respondent\u2019s reporting methodology results in cost differences extraneous to our identified physical characteristics, we may not rely on a respondent\u2019s reported methodology. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-4\">In the less-than-fair-value investigation of PRCBs from Malaysia, we calculated different costs of production to use for the below-cost test and the difference-in-merchandise adjustment. <em>See </em>Malaysia PRCBLTFV and accompanying I&amp;D Memo at Comment 5. We do not consider our decision in that investigation to be consistent with our normal practice of calculating a single cost of production for both the sales-below-cost test and the difference-in-merchandise adjustment, even in cases in which we revised material costs to neutralize the cost differences resulting from extraneous factors other than differences in the physical characteristics. See, e.g., <em>[Stainless Steel Bar from the United Kingdom, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 43,598 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Aug. 6, 2007) (final results of AD administrative review) (\u201cUK SSB\u201d), and accompanying I&amp;D Memo at Comment 1].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\"><em>Decision Mem. </em>at 3-4 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">Finally, Commerce reasoned that \u201calthough TPBG might have used its actual [period of review (\u201cPOR\u201d)] and production records that it maintains in its normal course of business as a basis for allocating its conversion costs, TPBG has acknowledged that its allocation methodology, which was developed for dumping purposes, is a departure from its normal cost-accounting system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5. Thus, Commerce concluded, \u201c[Commerce\u2019s] adjustment does not represent a departure from TPBG\u2019s normal books and records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-7\">As a consequence of its determinations, Commerce assessed an AD margin of 21.99 percent for TPBG for the fourth administrative review. <em>Final Results, </em>74 Fed. Reg. at 65,752.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-8\">II. Legal Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-9\">In calculating the normal value of subject merchandise originating from a market economy country, such as Thailand, Commerce must follow the rules laid out in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)-(b), (d)-(f).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Pursuant to this statutory instruction, Commerce must first attempt to determine a \u201cprice\u201d to use as a normal value, more specifically, \u201cthe price at which the foreign like product is first sold ... for consumption in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>the exporting country, in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade, and, to the extent practicable, at the same level of trade as the export price or constructed export price.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(B). As indicated above, in order to ascertain this \u201cprice,\u201d Commerce tries to match the subject merchandise to \u201cforeign like product [s].\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">A. Sales Below Cost</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">In its calculation of the price of the foreign like product, Commerce will discard certain of a respondent\u2019s reported sales. Relevant to this matter, if Commerce determines that sales of the foreign like product \u201cwere made at less than cost of production,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> it will disregard these sales. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1677b(b)(l).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As noted above, in certain circumstances, Commerce will not use the price of the foreign like product and will, instead, calculate a CV to input as the normal value. For example, after Commerce disregards respondent\u2019s sales as less than the COP, if no foreign like product sales remain, \u201cnormal value shall be based on the [CV] of the merchandise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1677b(b)(l).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>-</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-6\">According to statute and regulations, Commerce uses the same method to calculate \u201ccosts\u201d for both COP and CV. Commerce also uses the respondent\u2019s records, provided that these records meet certain requirements.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>Commerce must attempt to calculate COP and CV as accurately as possible and, to this end, Commerce is authorized to make adjustments to cost allocations. Commerce\u2019s regulations instruct that \u201c[i]n determining the appropriate method for allocating costs among products, [Commerce] may take into account production quantities, relative sales values, and other quantitative and qualitative factors associated with the manufacture and sale of the subject merchandise and foreign like product.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.407(c). <em>Accord </em>AD Manual 71 (\u201cWe review various qualitative and quantitative factors to determine whether a <em>representative </em>measure of the materials, <em>labor, overhead </em>and other costs have been allocated to the foreign like product. We should specifically review the <em>allocation methods </em>(e.g., production quantities and relative sales values) to determine whether an appropriate portion of common costs have been allocated to the product.\u201d) (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>SAA at 834-35, reprinted in 1994 U.S.C. C.A.N. at 4172. Specifically, if Commerce \u201cdetermines that costs [as submitted by a respondent. . . have been shifted away from production of the subject merchandise, or the foreign like product,\u201d then \u201c[Commerce] will adjust costs appropriately, to ensure they are not artificially reduced.\u201d SAA at 835, reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4172.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-4\">B. DIFMER Adjustment to Price</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">Once Commerce computes price or CV, Commerce must then make certain \u201cadjustments\u201d pursuant to statute. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(6), (8). Relevant here, the \u201cprice\u201d \u201cshall be\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>increased or decreased by the amount of any difference (or lack thereof) between the export price or constructed export price and the price . . . that is established to the satisfaction of the administering authority to be wholly or partly due to\u2014 ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9k\">(ii) the fact that [nonidentical] merchandise ... is used in determining normal value [ ] . . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1420-3\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(6)(C).

First, TPBG contends that Commerce improperly applied the \u201cphysical differences\u201d test, associated with the DIFMER adjustment, to the sales-below-cost test and the constructed value calculation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Second, TPBG asserts that, assuming Commerce\u2019s use to adjust TPBG\u2019s submitted numbers with substantial evidence.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-14\">The court will address each of Plaintiffs\u2019 challenges in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>A. Legality of Commerce\u2019s Adjustment Pursuant to its \u201cPhysical Characteristics\u201d Test</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-3\">Plaintiffs\u2019 \u25a0 argument on this issue is barred by judicial estoppel. \u201c[W]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him.\u201d <em>New Hampshire v. </em>Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749 (2001) (quoting <em>Davis v. Wakelee, </em>156 U.S. 680, 689 (1895)). <em>See also Trs. in Bankr. of N. Am. Rubber Thread Co. v. United States, </em>593 F.3d 1346, 1353-54 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <em>Scarano v. Cent. R. Co., </em>203 F.2d 510, 513 (3d Cir. 1953).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">The Federal Circuit has made it clear that \u201c|j]udicial estoppel applies just as much when one of the tribunals is an administrative agency as it does when both tribunals are courts.\u201d <em>Trs. in Bankr. of N. Am. Rubber Thread Co., </em>593 F.3d at 1353-54 (citing <em>Lampi Corp. v. Am. Power Prods., Inc., </em>228 F.3d 1365, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (\u201cThe [judicial estoppel] doctrine also applies to administrative proceedings in which a party obtains a favorable order by making an argument that it seeks to repudiate in a subsequent judicial proceeding.\u201d)) (\u201cTurning to the remaining issue, we find that NART is precluded by the doctrine of judicial estoppel from arguing in the CIT in favor of a revocation date of October 1, 1995, given its earlier successful argument to Commerce that a revocation date of October 1, 1995, was in appropriate.\u201d). Thus, judicial estoppel applies here, where the court is reviewing an agency decision rather than a decision of a lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">Three non-exclusive factors frame the application of judicial estop-pel. <em>New Hampshire, </em>532 U.S. at 750-51. First, \u201ca party\u2019s later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 750 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Second, the court considers whether a party has \u201csucceeded in persuading a court to accept that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>party\u2019s earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled [.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and quotation marks omitted). Third, the court considers \u201cwhether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 750-51 (citations omitted). <em>See also Scarano v. Cent. R. Co., </em>203 F.2d 510, 513 (3d Cir. 1953) (\u201cA plaintiff who has obtained relief from an adversary by asserting and offering proof to support one position may not be heard later in the same court to contradict himself in an effort to establish against the same adversary a second claim inconsistent with his earlier contention. Such use of inconsistent positions would most flagrantly exemplify that playing \u2018fast and loose with the courts\u2019which has been emphasized as an evil the courts should not tolerate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-4\">Application of the Supreme Court\u2019s three factors weighs in favor of applying judicial estoppel in this case. First, TPBG\u2019s position before this court is \u201cdirectly\u201d and \u201cclearly\u201d contrary to its position before Commerce during the administrative review. Below, Plaintiffs argued that the same concerns \u2014 the need for cost differences to be based upon physical differences \u2014 underlie the DIFMER, the sales below cost, and the CV calculations. Pls.\u2019s Rebuttal Br. at 1-4, 6. This argument was made directly in response to the petitioners\u2019 request that Commerce use TPBG\u2019s reported costs for COP and CV, while using adjusted costs for DIFMER. <em>Decision Mem. </em>at 3. Currently, before the court, Plaintiffs argue that Commerce improperly \u201capplied the wrong legal standard in making [its] decision [that TPBG\u2019s costs were \u2018distorted\u2019 for purposes of the sales below cost test and CV] (i.e., Commerce applied the DIFMER \u2018physical differences\u2019 test).\u201d (Mem. in Supp. Of Pis.\u2019 Mot. for J. on the Agency R. (\u201cPis.\u2019 Mem.\u201d) at 2.) But before the agency, Plaintiffs claimed that if the agency revised costs for DIFMER purposes, it must do so for all purposes, including COP and CV. Basically, before the court, TPBG argues that Commerce cannot take physical differences into account when determining whether to accept reported costs for the purposes of COP and CV, and may only address those physical differences in the DIFMER adjustment; at the same time, TPBG argued before Commerce that when calculating COP, CV, and DIFMER, Commerce should use the same costs adjusted to reflect cost differences attributable to physical differences in the merchandise.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus, in the administrative proceeding, Plaintiffs argued for the same across the board adjustments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>costs for each purpose; here Plaintiffs argue against such adjustments. These two positions are not reconcilable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">Second, Plaintiffs succeeded in its argument before Commerce. <em>See Decision Mem. </em>at.3-4 (\u201cWe disagree with petitioners\u2019 argument, however, that we should use TPBG\u2019s reported costs for the purposes of the sales-below-cost test and the calculation of constructed value. . . . Therefore, for the final results, to limit the distortive effect of cost differences that are unrelated to differences in physical characteristics, we have continued to . . . use the adjusted cost for the sales-below-cost test, the [DIFMER] adjustment, and constructed-value calculations.\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">Third, TPBG would \u201cderive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment\u201d on the government if allowed to switch their position on this issue here. For these reasons, Plaintiffs claim on this issue is barred.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">B. Evidence Supporting Commerce\u2019s Rejection of Plaintiffs\u2019 Reported Costs Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(f)(l)(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-7\">TPBG argued below that Commerce should use TPBG\u2019s reported costs because (1) TPBG has been using the same cost system from Thailand since 2004 and even the European Commission has verified the costs, and (2) \u201cTPBG based its reported costs on actual cost and production records maintained in the ordinary course of business,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>i.e., TPBG\u2019s reported cost methodology \u201ccorrectly allocates additional costs to those products which require additional time to process, with products which require less time to process having fewer costs allocated to those products.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Case Br. at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-4\">But Commerce rejected, in part,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> TPBG\u2019s reported cost allocations, as the record indicated that \u201cTPBG has acknowledged that its allocation methodology, which was developed for dumping purposes, is a departure from its normal cost-accounting system.\u201d <em>Decision Memo </em>at 4-5. In addition, \u201cTPBG\u2019s reported conversion costs resulted in product-specific cost differences which were unrelated to differences in physical characteristics,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 3, but rather were based, by TPBG\u2019s admission, on management\u2019s internal decision \u201cconcerning the export and home-market production runs and not due to production activities or requirements of the domestic product.\u201d <em>Preliminary Mem. </em>at 4. Absent proof of physical differences, Commerce was compensating for a price distortion through a reallocation of costs to more accurately describe the cost structure. These conclusions follow from a reasonable reading of the record and are therefore supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>458 F. 3d 1345, 1350-51 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">C. TPBG\u2019s Remaining Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">The remaining arguments in Plaintiffs\u2019 brief before the court include: (1) \u201csubstantial evidence does not support Commerce\u2019s factual finding that physically similar products have significant cost differences,\u201d Pis.\u2019 Br. at 12-16, and (3) \u201cCommerce wrongly concluded that Plaintiffs\u2019 cost differences are not attributable to the physical differences of the merchandise.\u201d <em>id. </em>at 20-23. The government argues, and the court agrees, that, because Plaintiffs did not make these arguments in their case briefs before Commerce, the arguments are not appropriately reviewed here because of the preference for administrative exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-7\">The relevant statute reflects this preference. In civil actions challenging AD determinations, \u201cthe Court of International Trade shall, where appropriate, require the exhaustion of administrative remedies.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2637(d). \u201cSiinple fairness to those who are engaged in the tasks of administration, and to litigants, requires as a general rule that courts should not topple over administrative decisions unless the administrative body not only has erred but has erred against objection made at the time appropriate under its practice.\u201d <em>United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, </em>344 U.S. 33, 37 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>Exhaustion is \u201cgenerally appropriate in the antidumping context because it allows the agency to apply its expertise, rectify administrative mistakes, and compile a record adequate for judicial review-advancing the twin purposes of protecting administrative agency authority and promoting judicial efficiency.\u201d <em>Carpenter Tech. Corp. v. United States, </em>30 CIT 1595, 1597, 464 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1349 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-3\">Generally, parties are \u201cprocedurally required to raise the[ir] issue before Commerce at the time Commerce [is] addressing the issue.\u201d <em>Dorbest Ltd. v.

If Respondents \u201cbelieved that the ... issue was relevant to the Final Results\u201d following the adverse decision by Commerce in the Preliminary Results, they \u201cneeded to include that issue in [their] case brief, as required by the regulation.\u201d <em>Dorbest Ltd. v.
