Final Results for Pohang Iron &amp; Steel Company, Ltd. and Pohang Coated Steel Company, Ltd. (collectively, \u201cPOSCO\u201d), foreign manufacturers/exporters of the subject merchandise. <em>See generally </em>Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record under Rule 56.2 (\u201cPl.\u2019s Brief\u2019); Reply Brief in Support of Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record Filed by Plaintiff United States Steel Corporation (\u201cPl.\u2019s Reply Brief\u2019). Specifically, U.S. Steel contends that Commerce erred by calculating indirect selling expenses using the \u201cpayroll methodology\u201d (an alternative methodology proposed by POSCO), rather than using Commerce\u2019s default methodology, known as the \u201crelative sales value methodology.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 1, 7-8, 19; Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 1-3, 15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">U.S. Steel\u2019s motion is opposed by the Government, which maintains that Commerce\u2019s allocation of indirect selling expenses in the Final Results was both based on substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law. The Government therefore urges that U.S. Steel\u2019s motion be denied, and that Commerce\u2019s Final Results be sustained in all respects. <em>See generally </em>Defendant\u2019s Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Rule 56.2 Motion for Judgment Upon the Agency Record and Appendix (\u201cDef.\u2019s Brief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The Defendant-Intervenors \u2014 collectively, POSCO \u2014 also oppose U.S. Steel\u2019s motion. Like the Government, POSCO asserts that Commerce\u2019s treatment of its indirect selling expenses was based on substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>agency\u2019s Final Results should be sustained in all respects. <em>See generally </em>Memorandum of Defendant-Intervenors, POSCO and POCOS, in Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Rule 56.2 Motion for Judgment Upon the Agency Record (\u201cPOSCO Brief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Jurisdiction lies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) (2000).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the reasons detailed below, U.S. Steel\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">U.S. antidumping laws require that antidumping duties be imposed upon imported merchandise that \u201cis being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value .. .,\u201d and results in material injury or the threat of material injury to a domestic industry. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673. The antidumping duty is equal to the \u201camount by which the normal value exceeds the export price [\u201cEP\u201d] (or constructed export price [\u201cCEP\u201d]) for the merchandise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Normal value is defined as \u201cthe price at which the foreign like product is first sold ... in the exporting country . . . . \u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(1)(B)(i). When normal value exceeds the price at which the merchandise is first sold to an unaffiliated purchaser in the United States, a sale is considered \u201cdumped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">This case involves Commerce\u2019s calculation of the constructed export price (\u201cCEP\u201d), which is the first sale by a seller affiliated with the producer to an unaffiliated purchaser in the United States. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(b). The statute requires Commerce to adjust the reported constructed export price, in order to properly assess the amount by which normal value exceeds that price. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1673, 1677a(c), 1677a(d)(1). Adjustments are necessary because the reported prices \u201crepresent prices in different markets affected by a variety of differences in the chain of commerce . . . ,\u201d and must be adjusted to \u201creconstruct the price at a specific, \u2018common\u2019 point in the chain of commerce, so that value can be fairly compared on an equivalent basis.\u201d <em>See SKF USA Inc. v. INA Walzlager Schaeffler KG, </em>180 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 1999) <em>(citing Smith-Corona Group v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 1568, 1572-73 (Fed. Cir. 1983)). The adjustments thus permit an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparison between the price of the subject merchandise sold in the United States and the price of the foreign like product sold in the home market.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>A. <em>Overview of Indirect Selling Expenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Among the adjustments that Commerce must make to the constructed export price is. the deduction of \u201cU.S. indirect selling expenses\u201d (\u201cindirect selling expenses\u201d or \u201cISEs\u201d), which are the focus of U.S. Steel\u2019s challenge to the Final Results at issue here. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(1)(D).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indirect selling expenses are those expenses incurred by a respondent (or, as in this case, a respondent\u2019s U.S. affiliate) which are related to the sale of subject merchandise but which cannot be directly tied to any particular sale \u2014 in other words, expenses that \u201cwould be incurred by the seller regardless of whether the particular sales in question are made,\u201d including common expenses such as rent payments, and telephone charges that \u00e1 company incurs in selling subject merchandise but which cannot be directly connected to a specific sale. <em>See Koenig &amp; Bauer-Albert AG v. United States, </em>22 CIT 574, 580, 15 F. Supp. 2d 834, 843 (1998), <em>aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>259 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Antidumping Manual, Glossary of Terms (Dept. of Commerce Oct. 13, 2009) (noting that \u201c[c]ommon examples of indirect selling expenses include inventory carrying costs, salesmen\u2019s salaries, and product liability insurance.\u201d); <em>see generally </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 2, 9; Def.\u2019s Brief at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">For example, companies typically do not calculate an amount of office rent based on how much rent was incurred in making any particular sale. Instead, companies generally report to Commerce the total amount of rent paid during the relevant period. In order to account for rent incurred in selling subject merchandise (so that an appropriate sum can be included in the agency\u2019s antidumping calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>lations), Commerce must allocate to sales of subject merchandise a portion of the total rent paid by the company. In doing so, Commerce must allocate the total rent (as well as other total indirect selling expenses) between the company\u2019s sales of subject merchandise and the company\u2019s other activities, including sales of non-subject merchandise. Indirect selling expenses may also include, for instance, salaries paid to employees who sell subject merchandise, since salaries normally are paid without regard to whether the employees sell subject merchandise or non-subject merchandise, or \u2014 for that matter \u2014 whether the employees actually sell any merchandise at all, during the relevant period. <em>See generally </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 2; Def.\u2019s Brief at 8-9; Transcript of Oral Argument (\u201cTr.\u201d) at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The antidumping statute directs that, in calculating net U.S. prices using the CEP price methodology, Commerce is to deduct \u201cany . . . expenses generally incurred by or for the account of the producer or exporter, or the affiliated seller in the United States, in selling the subject merchandise (or subject merchandise to which value has been added)....\u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d); <em>see also id. </em>at \u00a7 1677a(d)(1)(D). Thus, the statute includes a general provision for the deduction of selling expenses in the CEP price calculation, but is entirely silent as to <em>how </em>Commerce is to calculate those expenses (including indirect selling expenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Commerce\u2019s regulations similarly include general provisions concerning the calculation of expenses. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(g). Commerce\u2019s stated preference is for the calculation of expenses on a transaction-specific basis. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(g)(1). However, where expenses cannot be ascertained on a transaction-specific basis, the agency\u2019s regulations permit expenses (including indirect selling expenses) to be allocated, provided, first, that the allocation is on \u201cas specific a basis\u201d as possible, and, second, that the methodology \u201cdoes not cause inaccuracies or distortions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">(1) In general. The Secretary may consider allocated expenses and price adjustments when transaction-specific reporting is not feasible, provided the Secretary is satisfied <em>the allocation method used does not cause inaccuracies or distortions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">(2) Reporting allocated expenses and price adjustments. Any party seeking to report an expense or a price adjustment on an allocated basis must demonstrate to the Secretary\u2019s satisfaction that the allocation is <em>calculated on as specific a basis as is feasible, </em>and must explain why <em>the allocation methodology used does not cause inaccuracies or distortions.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(g) (emphases added)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; <em>see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(1)(D).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Like the statute, Commerce\u2019s regulations are entirely silent as to <em>how </em>Commerce is to calculate indirect selling expenses. <em>See NSK Ltd. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 1, 17-18, 358 F. Supp. 2d 1276, 1290-91 (2005), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>162 Fed. Appx. 982 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Under these circumstances, Chevron accords Commerce great discretion as to the methodology used in the calculation of indirect selling expenses. <em>See generally Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984); <em>see also </em>section II, <em>infra. </em>Indeed, this court has previously underscored \u2014 in the context of calculating indirect selling expenses \u2014 that \u201c[b]oth 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d), the relevant statute, and the regulation, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(g), give little direction on allocation methodology, and thus <em>Commerce enjoys discretion in choosing its methodology.\u201d See NSK, </em>29 CIT at 17-18, 358 F. Supp. 2d at 1291 (emphasis added) <em>(citing Timken Co. v. United States, </em>26 CIT 590, 598-99, 209 F. Supp. 2d 1373, 1381 (2002); <em>NSK Ltd. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 56, 109-110, 245 F. Supp. 2d 1335, 1378-79 (2003)). Moreover, in light of Commerce\u2019s broad discretion in calculating indirect selling expenses, this court has observed that it \u201cmust accept Commerce\u2019s methodology if that methodology is reasonable.\u201d <em>See Koenig &amp; Bauer-Albert AG, </em>22 CIT at 580, 15 F. Supp. 2d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In the exercise of its ample discretion, Commerce has developed a standard, baseline practice known as the \u201crelative sales value methodology,\u201d which calculates indirect selling expenses by using the ratio of sales of subject merchandise to total sales. <em>See Micron Technology, Inc. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 55, 61, 44 F. Supp. 2d 216, 222 (1999) (noting that Commerce \u201ctypically . . . requires indirect selling expenses to be allocated on a sales value basis\u201d). Specifically, under this default methodology, Commerce calculates the ratio of subject merchandise sales to total sales, and then applies that ratio to the total indirect selling expenses reported for the period at issue, to calculate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the indirect sales expenses attributable to sales of subject merchandise. Thus, for example, if sales of subject merchandise constitute half of the value of a company\u2019s total sales for the period of review, then \u2014 under the relative sales value methodology \u2014 half of the company\u2019s indirect selling expenses are allocated to sales of subject merchandise. <em>See generally </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 4-5 &amp; n.2; Def.\u2019s Brief at 9; Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 1 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">As even U.S. Steel concedes, however, \u201cit is not [Commerce\u2019s] policy to require allocation of indirect selling expenses' based upon relative sales value in every instance.\u201d <em>See </em>Dynamic Random Access Memory Semiconductors of One Megabit or Above From the Republic of Korea; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 61 Fed. Reg. 20,216, 20,217 (May 6,1996); <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 11; Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 3-4. Commerce has broad discretion to use a different methodology where the agency determines that the alternative methodology is reasonable and non-distortive. <em>See NSK, </em>27 CIT at 109-10, 245 F. Supp. 2d at 1378-79; <em>see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 351.401(g). Exercising its discretion, Commerce permits respondents that are calculating indirect selling expenses to segregate expenses that can be demonstrated to be unrelated to the sales of subject merchandise. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">B. <em>The Facts of This Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In reporting its data for the period covered by the administrative review here at issue (in response to Commerce\u2019s original questionnaire, as well as two supplemental questionnaires), POSCO proposed that Commerce use an alternative methodology \u2014 the \u201cpayroll methodology\u201d \u2014 to allocate the indirect selling expenses incurred by POSCO\u2019s U.S. sales affiliate, POSCO American Corporation (\u201cPOSAM\u201d), in re-selling to unaffiliated U.S. customers subject merchandise that POSAM had purchased from POSCO. Specifically, POSCO used payroll data to divide POSAM\u2019s payroll expenses and other common expenses into the three distinct categories of POSAM\u2019s activity during the relevant period: (1) POSAM\u2019s sales of subject merchandise (purchased from POSCO); (2) POSAM\u2019s sales of non-subject merchandise; and (3) POSAM\u2019s non-sales-related activity (in particular, POSAM\u2019s management of two subsidiaries). <em>See generally </em>POSCO Brief at 2,13,15-16; <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 2-3; Def.\u2019s Brief at 3, 11-13; Tr. at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">For purposes of calculating the indirect selling expenses ratio, POSCO first identified the actual payroll expenses of each of the POSAM employees engaged in each of the three categories of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>POSAM\u2019s activity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> POSCO then allocated POSAM\u2019s common expenses \u2014 rent, depreciation, travel, etc. \u2014 to each of the three categories in direct proportion to the percentage of the total actual payroll expenses expended on each category. Finally, POSCO identified the sales revenue for the period of review for each of the three categories of activity. <em>See generally </em>POSCO Brief at 3, 13, 15-16; <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 2-4; Def.\u2019s Brief at 3, 9-10, 11-13; Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 1 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">In calculating the indirect selling expenses ratio, POSCO included only those expenses and sales revenues associated with the first category of activity (i.e., POSAM\u2019s sales of subject merchandise). POSCO reasoned that the calculation of indirect selling expenses is \u2014 by definition \u2014 intended to capture expenses related to <em>sales </em>of <em>subject merchandise. </em>POSCO therefore excluded expenses related to the second category of POSAM\u2019s activity (i.e., sales of non-subject merchandise), because those expenses did not concern sales of <em>subject merchandise. </em>And POSCO excluded expenses related to the third category of POSAM\u2019s activity (i.e., POSAM\u2019s management of its investments), because those expenses concerned a non-selling activity, and thus did not concern <em>sales </em>of any merchandise (subject or not). Using this methodology, POSCO derived an indirect selling ratio, which it then applied to the reported gross unit prices to calculate the per-unit indirect selling expenses which POSCO reported to Commerce. <em>See generally </em>POSCO Brief at 3, 10-11; <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 4-5; Def.\u2019s Brief at 3, 9-11; Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 1 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In the Preliminary Results, Commerce did not use the payroll methodology that POSCO advocated, because \u2014 at that early stage of the proceedings \u2014 the agency was unsure of the accuracy of POSCO\u2019s proposed methodology. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 3-4,11. Instead, Commerce used the agency\u2019s default \u201crelative sales value methodology,\u201d dividing POSAM\u2019s company-wide payroll and other common expenses by POSAM\u2019s <em>total sales revenue </em>for the period of review, and thus deriving a higher indirect selling expenses ratio than that which POSCO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>had calculated using its proposed payroll methodology.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Commerce calculated an overall dumping margin of 0.48% for POSCO in the Preliminary Results. <em>See </em>Certain Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products from the Republic of Korea: Notice of Preliminary Results \u00f3f Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 71 Fed. Reg. 53,370, 53,376 (Sept. 11, 2006) (\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In the briefing that followed Commerce\u2019s issuance of the Preliminary Results, POSCO further explained, in detail, the basis for its proposed payroll methodology. With the benefit of that further explanation, as well as additional time to analyze POSCO\u2019s proposed methodology, Commerce determined that the evidence supported POSCO\u2019s claims, and therefore concluded that POSCO\u2019s proposed methodology was reasonable, accurate and not distortive, given the specific facts of this case. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 3-4, 11-13. Accordingly, Commerce calculated its Final Results using the indirect selling expenses ratio derived from POSCO\u2019s payroll methodology. Commerce explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">In the Preliminary Results, we recalculated the POSCO Group\u2019s [indirect selling expenses] because the POSCO Group had not adequately explained the basis for its exclusion of certain expenses in its reported [indirect selling expenses] calculation. Specifically, we recalculated the POSCO Group\u2019s [indirect selling expenses] by including all indirect selling expenses incurred in the United States, including expenses related to POSAM\u2019s sales of non-subject merchandise and its non-selling activities during the [Period of Review], However, <em>the POSCO Group provided evidence showing that the POSCO Group correctly calculated its [indirect selling expenses] by excluding expenses related to [1] POSAM\u2019s sales of non-subject merchandise and [2] its non-selling activities. </em>. . . Thus, the Department will change the [dumping] margin program in the final results to reflect the POSCO Group\u2019s original [indirect selling expenses] ratio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Decision Memorandum at 45 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). In the Final Results, Commerce recalculated POSCO\u2019s dumping margin at 0.35%. <em>See </em>Final Results, 72 Fed. Reg. at 13,087; <em>see also </em>Decision Memorandum at 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">In the instant action, U.S. Steel challenges Commerce\u2019s Final Results solely as to the agency\u2019s use of POSCO\u2019s payroll methodology to calculate POSAM\u2019s indirect selling expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">A final determination by Commerce in an antidumping case must be sustained, except to the extent that it is found to be \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i); <em>see also NMB Singapore Ltd. v. United States, 557 </em>F.3d 1316, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla\u201d; rather, it is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. v.

On the other hand, the mere fact that it may be possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from evidence in the record does not prevent Commerce\u2019s determination from being supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Am.

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837 (1984) is applied. <em>See, e.g., Wheatland Tube Co. v. United States, </em>495 F.3d 1355, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The first step of a Chevron analysis requires a determination as to \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842. \u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842-43; <em>see also Corus Staal BV v.

However, \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue\u201d in question, the analysis proceeds to Chevron step two, where \u201cthe question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>U.S. at 843; <em>see Wheatland Tube, </em>495 F.3d at 1359 (\u201cThis court reaches step two of Chevron only \u2018if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue.\u2019\u201d <em>(quoting Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843)).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Under the second step of a <em>Chevron </em>analysis, \u201c[a]ny reasonable construction of the statute is a permissible construction.\u201d <em>Timken Co. v.

In addition, U.S. Steel asserts that Commerce impermissibly switched methodologies between prior administrative reviews and the review at issue here, as well as between the Preliminary Results and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Final Results in the instant review. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 5-6,11-13. Each of U.S. Steel\u2019s arguments is analyzed in turn below, and for the reasons detailed there, must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Given the particular facts of this case, Commerce\u2019s use of the payroll methodology in the Final Results allocated POSAM\u2019s indirect selling expenses to sales of subject merchandise on a more specific basis than would have the relative sale value methodology that U.S. Steel advocates. Commerce\u2019s use of the payroll methodology therefore was more consistent with the agency\u2019s regulations, which require the allocation of expenses \u201con as specific a basis as is feasible.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(g)(2); <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 18-19; POSCO Brief at 1-2, 13, 18-19; Tr. at 25, 27, 54, 60; <em>see also </em>POSCO Brief at 19 (emphasizing that use of relative sales value methodology in this case would have been distortive and inaccurate, because it would have included \u201cexpenses associated with sales of <em>non-subject </em>merchandise and <em>non-selling </em>activities\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 13,17 (same); Def.\u2019s Brief at 19 (same); Tr. at 25-28, 60, 64 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Moreover, the exercise of Commerce\u2019s ample discretion may permit it to select from among several reasonable methodologies in a given case. Here, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the relative sales methodology would have been a reasonable choice, Commerce\u2019s use of the payroll methodology cannot be said to have been unreasonable, and so must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">A. <em>U.S. Steel\u2019s Claims Contrasting POSAM Data and Commerce\u2019s ISE Allocations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">U.S. Steel first argues that, \u201cby adopting the payroll methodology in the Final Results, [Commerce] grossly distorted, and thereby <em>incorrectly </em>allocated, POSAM\u2019s [indirect selling expenses]\u201d (\u201cISEs\u201d). <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 14; <em>see generally id. </em>at 13-17; Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 2 \u2014 5. Significantly, U.S. Steel does not contend that any of the data that POSCO submitted are inaccurate. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 14. In attempting to prove its case, U.S. Steel does little more than state the results of Commerce\u2019s use of POSCO\u2019s payroll methodology, compare those results to POSAM\u2019s sales or other data, and assert that \u2014 <em>ipso facto </em>\u2014 a distortion exists. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 14-15, 16; <em>see generally </em>POSCO Brief at 17-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">U.S. Steel emphasizes, for example, that POSAM\u2019s sales of subject merchandise constituted a certain percentage of its total sales, contrasting that figure with the percentage of total indirect selling expenses allocated to sales of subject merchandise, and asserting \u2014 with little or no explanation or analysis \u2014 that the difference between those two figures illustrates a \u201cgross distortionD.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Brief at 14-15 &amp; Figure 1; <em>see also id. </em>at 4; Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 2 (asserting that contrast between the two figures alone \u201cshows that the payroll methodology is patently and unlawfully distortive\u201d), 3; Def.\u2019s Brief at 14-15; POSCO Brief at 17.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Focusing on the flip side of the same coin, U.S. Steel highlights the fact that POSAM\u2019s sales of non-subject merchandise constituted only a certain percentage of its sales \u2014 a figure which U.S. Steel contrasts sharply with the percentage of total indirect selling expenses that were allocated to those sales in the Final Results. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 14 &amp; Figure 1; Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 3; <em>see generally </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 15; POSCO Brief at 17.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">U.S. Steel\u2019s attempts to prove distortion simply by pointing to contrasting figures \u2014 with no supporting rationale or analysis whatsoever \u2014 is not valid legal argument. <em>See, e.g., U.S. Ass\u2019n of Imps. of Textiles &amp; Apparel v.

U.S. Steel argues that, like accounting and human resources, \u201cactivities [such as investment management] benefit the corporate entity \u2014 i.e., POSAM \u2014 and properly belong in the pool .of [indirect selling expenses] to be allocated.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 12; <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 9; Tr. at 12. U.S. Steel concludes that Commerce \u201cshould <em>not </em>have excluded POSAM\u2019s investment management expenses in the calculation of the company\u2019s [indirect selling expenses],\u201d citing <em>Ara-mide </em>for the proposition that it is Commerce\u2019s practice \u201cto <em>include </em>[in the calculation of indirect selling expenses] the general and administrative (\u201cG&amp;A\u201d) expenses, such as expenses associated with investment management, that are incurred in support of the respondent\u2019s U.S. sales affiliate.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 6-7 <em>(citing Aramide Maatschappij V.o.F. v.

In <em>Aramide, </em>a parent company provided \u201cvarious corporate-level administrative support services that at a minimum . . . were indirectly related to . . . [the] selling functions\u201d of the U.S. selling affiliate of a foreign producer. <em>See Aramide, </em>19 CIT at 1101-02, 901 F. Supp. at 360. Noting that Commerce generally includes G&amp;A expenses incurred by a U.S. selling affiliate in the agency\u2019s calculation of indirect selling expenses, the <em>Aramide </em>court sustained Commerce\u2019s decision to \u201cinclude!] a proportionate share of [the administrative, accounting and finance service] expenses in the calculation of [the foreign producer\u2019s] indirect selling expenses.\u201dSee <em>id., </em>19 CIT at 1101, 901 F. Supp. at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">U.S. Steel misstates the rule of <em>Aramide, </em>and \u2014 in addition \u2014 misapplies the decision given the facts of this case. According to U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Steel, <em>Aramide </em>requires that \u201c[all] G&amp;A expenses of a respondent\u2019s U.S. sales affiliate\u201d be included \u201cin the pool of [indirect selling expenses] to be allocated because they are indirectly related to selling <em>regardless of their classification by the respondent.\u201d See </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 8 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). U.S. Steel therefore concludes that \u201cPOSAM\u2019s investment management expenses should have been allocated to, rather than excluded from, the pool of [indirect selling expenses] because <em>[the investment management expenses </em>] <em>were indirectly related to selling.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">As a threshold matter, Commerce\u2019s exclusion of POSAM\u2019s investment management expenses from the agency\u2019s calculation of indirect selling expenses was based on the specific, somewhat unusual facts of this case (discussed below) \u2014 <em>not </em>on the classification of those expenses by the respondent, POSCO. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 8; Tr. at 29 (U.S. Steel argues that treatment of POSAM\u2019s \u201cinvestment management\u201d expenses should not be based on their characterization by POSCO).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Further, <em>Aramide </em>cannot possibly be read as broadly as U.S. Steel suggests, to require that <em>all </em>G&amp;A expenses must necessarily be included in the calculation of indirect selling expenses, <em>in every case. </em>Such a reading would inherently conflict with the very concept of \u201cindirect selling expenses,\u201d which implicitly contemplates the exclusion of all expenses that relate to sales of non-subject merchandise, as well as the exclusion of all non-selling expenses (i.e., all expenses that are entirely unrelated to sales). <em>See generally </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 9-11, 18-19; POSCO Brief at 19 (distinguishing between indirect selling expenses associated with sales of subject merchandise (which should be included in calculating indirect selling expenses) <em>versus </em>indirect selling expenses associated with sales of non-subject merchandise, and indirect selling expenses associated with non-selling activities (which should be excluded from the calculation of indirect selling expenses)). As the Government points out, when \u201can expense is demonstrated to be unrelated to the sale of subject merchandise . . . , that expense may be removed from the indirect selling expense calculation.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 12.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The Government also distinguishes <em>Aramide </em>from this case on its facts. Commerce concluded that the investment management function in this case was totally unrelated to sales of subject merchandise, \u201cin contrast to the situation in <em>Aramide </em>..., relied upon by U.S. Steel, where the respondent attempted to remove financial services expenses from the calculation of indirect selling expenses solely because they were \u2018of a corporate-wide administrative nature.\u2019\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 12-13 <em>(quoting Aramide, </em>19 CIT at 1101, 901 F. Supp. at 360).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">U.S. Steel disputes Commerce\u2019s determination that the investment management function here lacks even an <em>indirect </em>relationship to POSAM\u2019s sales, and does not belong in the pool of expenses used to calculate the indirect selling expenses ratio. <em>See generally </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 12-13; Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 7, 9, 10-11; Tr. at 11-12, 28-29, 34, 39-40, 66-68, 89-92. However, U.S. Steel has pointed to nothing to cast doubt on the agency\u2019s finding that POSAM\u2019s investment management function is wholly distinct from POSAM\u2019s sales function and does not support or confer a benefit on sales, and thus should be excluded from the calculation of indirect selling expenses (unlike G&amp;A expenses \u2014 such as human resources and accounting \u2014 which, in fact, do support or benefit sales).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">As POSCO explained, and as Commerce concluded, the critical, distinguishing fact here is that POSAM is not only a sales organization. Unlike the typical U.S. selling affiliates in other, similar cases, POSAM comprises two entirely separate and distinct business units, which perform two entirely separate and distinct business functions. <em>See </em>POSCO Brief at 2, 11; Tr. at 19, 22, 24, 42-43, 76, 79. POSAM\u2019s first business function is its sales function, which involves the sales of subject and non-subject steel products. <em>See </em>POSCO Brief at 2, 15; Def.\u2019s Brief at 9, 11; Tr. at 19, 22, 79. POSAM\u2019s second, entirely distinct and discrete business function \u2014 the so-called \u201cinvestment management\u201d function \u2014 is devoted exclusively to the management of two POSAM subsidiaries. <em>See </em>POSCO Brief at 2, 11; Def.\u2019s Brief at 12-13; Pl.\u2019s Brief at 3, 12; Tr. at 19-21, 41, 44, 46-47, 56, 69, 79, 91-92.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>POSAM\u2019s investment management function provided no conventional \u201cinvestment management\u201d services, generated no sales revenue whatsoever, did not \u2014 either directly or indirectly \u2014 support POSAM\u2019s sales function, and, indeed, had no relationship whatsoever with POSAM\u2019s sales function (direct or indirect), except that the two otherwise separate and distinct business units shared certain common expenses, including expenses for, <em>inter alia, </em>supervisory and administrative support personnel, rent, travel, communications, and depreciation. <em>See </em>POSCO Brief at 11-12, 17, 18; Def.\u2019s Brief at 12; Tr. at 19-20, 22-23, 23-24, 26, 41-42, 44, 46, 60, 78, 80, 91-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">As the Government notes, U.S. Steel is correct that \u201cthe managing of a company\u2019s investments is an activity that can be included as an indirect selling expense.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 12 <em>(citing </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 12). But the \u201cinvestment management\u201d function here is a very different animal. And investment management expenses should be excluded from the pool of indirect selling expenses where \u2014 as here \u2014 the investment management function is \u201cunrelated to <em>the sale of subject merchandise.\u201d See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 12 (emphasis added) <em>(citing NSK, </em>29 CIT at 17-18, 358 F. Supp. 2d at 1291) (additional citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">U.S. Steel claims at one point in its briefs that POSAM\u2019s investment management expenses should be included in the pool of indirect selling expenses to be allocated simply because the function \u201cbenefit[s] <em>the corporate entity </em>\u2014 i.e., POSAM.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 12 (emphasis added). Contrary to U.S. Steel\u2019s assertion, however, not every expenditure that may ultimately indirectly benefit or enhance a company\u2019s overall \u201cbottom line\u201d is to be included in the calculation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>of indirect selling expenses. Instead, indirect selling expenses are intended to capture only those expenditures that indirectly support or benefit the function of <em>sales of subject merchandise. </em>The function of POSAM\u2019s investment manager \u2014 who was devoted solely to the management of two POSAM subsidiaries \u2014 did not support or benefit POSAM\u2019s sales of subject merchandise (or, in fact, any sales at all). POSAM\u2019s so-called \u201cinvestment management\u201d expenses were therefore properly excluded from Commerce\u2019s calculation of indirect selling expenses in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">In its final challenge to Commerce\u2019s exclusion of POSAM\u2019s \u201cinvestment management\u201d expenses in the agency\u2019s calculation of indirect selling expenses, U.S. Steel \u2014 in the course of oral argument \u2014 challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. U.S. Steel contends, in essence, that the record is devoid of evidence to support Commerce\u2019s conclusions about the actual function of the investment manager and the absence of any benefit to POSAM\u2019s sales function. According to U.S. Steel, there is no evidence here that POSAM\u2019s investment management function differs in any way from the investment management functions at typical U.S. selling affiliates in other, similar cases (where investment management expenses are generally treated as part of G&amp;A expenses, and included in the pool of indirect selling expenses for allocation to sales of subject merchandise). <em>See </em>Tr. at 11-12, 39-40, 66-68, 89-91; <em>cf. </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 12-13 (arguing that \u201cvirtually every company has employees dedicated to \u2018managing investments\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">U.S. Steel is simply wrong. The evidence on POSAM\u2019s \u201cinvestment management\u201d function may be somewhat thin, and a bit cryptic. But that evidence is also undisputed, and \u2014 under the circumstances \u2014 more than sufficient to constitute \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to support Commerce\u2019s decision to exclude \u201cinvestment management\u201d expenses from the pool used to calculate POSAM\u2019s indirect selling expenses. <em>See </em>POSCO Letter to Commerce (Aug. 4, 2006) (Conf.

Commerce\u2019s exclusion of POSAM\u2019s \u201cinvestment management\u201d expenses from the calculation of indirect selling expenses therefore was not unreasonable. <em>See generally </em>Decision Memorandum at 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">In addition to its criticism of Commerce\u2019s exclusion of investment management expenses from the calculation of indirect selling expenses, U.S. Steel also attributes some of the alleged \u201cdistortion\u201d to the use of payroll \u201cto allocate [common] expenses that bore no relationship whatsoever to payroll.\u201d <em>See </em>Tr. at 14; <em>see also, e.g., </em>Tr. at 30-31, 33-34. Thus, for example, U.S. Steel contends that \u2014 because \u201cactivities other than sales of subject merchandise\u201d constituted only a certain percentage of total sales \u2014 Commerce erred by allocating to those activities a disproportionate share of the payroll expenses for executive and administrative staff. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 14-15.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">But U.S. Steel\u2019s analysis is inherently flawed. As discussed above, U.S. Steel ignores the fact that, as Commerce found, POSAM\u2019s investment management function generated no sales revenue, and did not even indirectly support or benefit POSAM\u2019s sales of merchandise (whether subject or not). <em>See generally </em>POSCO Brief at 11-12, 17-18; Def.\u2019s Brief at 12; Tr. at 19-20, 22, 26, 44, 46, 91-92. Further, because POSAM\u2019s executives and administrative staff support and have responsibility for <em>all </em>personnel, Commerce reasonably concluded that it was appropriate to allocate the payroll expenses for executive and administrative personnel in direct proportion to the salaries of the employees that they supervised and/or supported \u2014 including those employees who were responsible solely for the sales of non-subject merchandise, as well as the individual devoted exclusively to non-selling (\u201cinvestment management\u201d) activities, who had nothing to do with sales of any merchandise, subject or not. <em>See </em>POSCO Brief at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">U.S. Steel launches similar attacks on Commerce\u2019s allocation of assorted other \u201ccommon expenses.\u201d <em>See generally </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>15-17.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But, again, the payroll methodology began with the specific assignment of payroll expenses based on the individual responsibilities of POSAM\u2019s personnel. Under these circumstances, it was not unreasonable for Commerce to allocate POSAM\u2019s common expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>(which are not otherwise segregated in the company\u2019s normal accounting records) in direct proportion to the actual activities of each of POSAM\u2019s employees. <em>See </em>POSCO Brief at 18. U.S. Steel\u2019s arguments to the contrary are lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In a typical case, the U.S. sales affiliate is dedicated solely to sales of merchandise (whether both subject and non-subject merchandise, or subject merchandise alone). <em>See, e.g., </em>Tr. at 75. In such a case, it is generally reasonable to use the relative sales value methodology to allocate indirect selling expenses to, <em>inter alia, </em>sales of subject merchandise. <em>Id. </em>at'75-76. But \u2014 as discussed herein \u2014 this is not a typical case; so application of the relative sales value methodology here made little sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In this case, the U.S. sales affiliate, POSAM, is also engaged in non-selling activity \u2014 specifically, the management of two POSAM subsidiaries, a function that did not support and conferred no benefit on POSAM\u2019s sales activities. As such, as discussed above, it was necessary to exclude from the calculation of indirect selling expenses the expenses associated with POSAM\u2019s management of its subsidiaries \u2014 a non-selling activity. Those expenses included not only the salary of POSAM\u2019s \u201cinvestment manager,\u201d but also the investment manager\u2019s share of the common expenses for administrative support and other services that he shared with the POSAM sales staff (who sold subject, as well as non-subject, merchandise).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Commerce had no choice but to use some other methodology to properly account for the expenses associated with POSAM\u2019s non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>selling function, because the relative sales methodology was not designed to do so. Under the circumstances, it was neither illogical nor unreasonable to begin with another fact that makes this case somewhat unusual \u2014 the fact that POSAM\u2019s relatively small staff and the discrete nature of each staffer\u2019s responsibilities made it possible not to <em>allocate </em>(as in the typical case) but, in fact, to <em>specifically assign </em>personnel salaries to three categories, depending on individuals\u2019 responsibilities: (1) sales of subject merchandise; (2) sales of non-subject merchandise; and (3) non-selling activities (i.e., management of POSAM\u2019s two subsidiaries). Commerce then excluded the salaries of those engaged in the sales of non-subject merchandise, as well as the salary of the \u201cinvestment manager\u201d who managed POSAM\u2019s subsidiaries, because the activities of those individuals either did not relate to sales of <em>subject </em>merchandise or did not relate to <em>sales </em>of merchandise (whether subject or not), and thus were not properly included in the calculation of the indirect selling expenses ratio for subject merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The specific assignment of salaries (discussed above) disposed of a significant percentage of POSAM\u2019s total expenses, another somewhat distinctive fact. What remained to be accounted for were the \u201ccommon expenses.\u201d Commerce could not properly treat those common expenses as though they related exclusively to sales of subject and non-subject merchandise, because they were shared (i.e., consumed in part) by POSAM\u2019s investment manager. To determine the amount of common expenses attributable to the sales of subject merchandise, Commerce had no choice but to determine some means of accounting for the common expenses consumed by the investment manager (as well as the common expenses consumed by those individuals who sold non-subject merchandise). Particularly given the fact of the specificity with which personnel salaries were assigned in this case, it was neither illogical nor unreasonable for Commerce to decide to allocate POSAM\u2019s common expenses in accordance with the first step of the process \u2014 that is, in proportion to the very specific <em>assignment </em>of the salaries of individual POSAM personnel to the company\u2019s three activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">While U.S. Steel criticizes Commerce\u2019s use of payroll to allocate common expenses in this case, a certain measure of imprecision is inherent in the allocation process; common expenses are allocated for the very reason that they \u2014 by definition \u2014 cannot be precisely assigned. Further, it is a fact that a number of major common expenses, such as rent, are fixed. Moreover, as discussed herein, in a number of instances where U.S. Steel argues that some particular common expense does not necessarily vary in proportion to salary, it is equally true that the expense does not necessarily vary relative to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>sales. The relative sales value methodology that U.S. Steel advocates thus would be no more specific than the payroll methodology that Commerce used. The bottom line is that there is no record evidence here \u2014 <em>none </em>\u2014 to indicate that POSAM\u2019s common expenses were incurred in proportion to sales val\u00fae. <em>See, e.g., </em>Tr. at 85. And, even assuming that there were some common expenses that would, logically, necessarily vary in proportion to sales (but not in proportion to payroll) \u2014 a matter which is not documented on the evidentiary record \u2014 it would nevertheless have been well within Commerce\u2019s discretion to use the payroll methodology, given the specific circumstances of this case. U.S. Steel\u2019s objections to Commerce\u2019s use of the payroll methodology therefore cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">B. <em>U.S. Steel\u2019s Factors Assertedly Used to Evaluate Alternative Methodologies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">U.S. Steel maintains that its claims of distortion are supported not only by the specific examples addressed above, but also by three factors which U.S. Steel contends are \u201cnormally considered and applied by [Commerce] itself in determining the appropriateness of an alternative allocation methodology.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 17; <em>see also id. </em>at 17-18; Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 2, 5-14.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As set forth below, however, U.S. Steel again fails to show that Commerce\u2019s determination was not supported by substantial evidence or was otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">1. <em>Results of Relative Sales Value Methodology versus Alternative Methodology</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">U.S. Steel points to the \u201cdifference in results between the relative sales value methodology and the alternative methodology in question\u201d as one factor that Commerce has considered in the past in determining whether an alternative methodology is distortive. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 17 <em>(citing </em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Administrative Review of Gray Portland Cement and Clinker From Mexico \u2014August 31, 2001 through July 31, 2002, 2003 WL 24153862 (Sept. 16, 2003)) (\u201cClinker from Mexico\u201d), at comment 15; <em>see also </em>P\u00cd.\u2019s Reply Brief at 2-3, 5-6. U.S. Steel characterizes the difference in the results of the two methodologies in this case as \u201csignificant.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 17.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But U.S. Steel\u2019s argument is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>As the Government points out, U.S. Steel does not identify any flaw or error in POSCO\u2019s reported data. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 15-16. Nor does U.S. Steel do anything to explain <em>why </em>a difference in results between the two methodologies demonstrates distortion \u2014 much less why it means that <em>the payroll methodology </em>was distortive. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 15-16. Instead, U.S. Steel simply states the ratio that results from each of the two methodologies, and summarily concludes that \u201cthe payroll methodology is distortive.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The Government notes that it should come as no surprise that different methodologies produce different results, and states that different results do not necessarily mean that one methodology is distortive. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 16. The Government pointedly observes that there would be little point in seeking to use a <em>new </em>methodology if that methodology could be used only if its results mirrored those of Commerce\u2019s default methodology. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 16. In sum and substance, U.S. Steel is arguing that the results produced by the payroll methodology are different from those produced by the relative sales value methodology. But that the results are different does not necessarily mean that they are wrong. As the Government puts it, \u201cU.S. Steel\u2019s reliance upon expected differences r-ather than pointing out flaws in POSCO\u2019s methodology is not a valid argument.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">U.S. Steel\u2019s invocation of Clinker from Mexico is also unavailing. In Clinker from Mexico, Commerce concluded that a particular alternative methodology was not distortive, because it produced results similar to those produced by the agency\u2019s default \u201crelative sales value\u201d methodology. <em>See </em>Clinker from Mexico, 2003 WL 24153862, at comment 15. But, contrary to U.S. Steel\u2019s claims, it does not logically follow that a difference in results between methodologies automatically renders an alternative methodology distortive. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 16. Otherwise, \u201cthere would be no purpose in allowing alternative methodologies.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Obviously, Commerce was aware of the difference in results between the payroll methodology that it used in the Final Results and the relative sales value methodology, which was used in the Preliminary Results. As outlined above, Commerce\u2019s decision to use the payroll methodology cannot be said to have been unreasonable. By using the payroll methodology here, Commerce properly sought to exclude from the calculation of indirect selling expenses those payroll and common expenses that were attributable to POSAM\u2019s sales of non-subject merchandise, as well as its management of investments (its non-selling activities). In contrast, if Commerce had used, the relative sales value methodology here, the calculation of indirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>selling expenses would have included both expenses related to sales of non-subject merchandise and expenses related to POSAM\u2019s non-selling activities. <em>See generally </em>POSCO Brief at 18-19</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\">To be sure, POSCO\u2019s indirect selling expenses ratio would have been higher had it been calculated using the relative sales value methodology, as U.S. Steel advocates. But U.S. Steel has advanced no argument or evidence to indicate that the mere difference in results between the methodologies renders the payroll methodology distor-tive in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">2. <em>Disproportionate Allocation of ISEs to Non-Subject Merchandise</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">According to U.S. Steel, \u201c[t]he fact that the payroll methodology allocates [indirect selling expenses] disproportionately to [non-subject merchandise] is another factor that illustrates its distortive nature.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 17-18 (final alteration in the original) <em>0citing </em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Spain \u2014 March 5, 1998 through August 31, 1999, 2001 WL 171180 (Feb. 21, 2001) (\u201cWire Rod from Spain\u201d), at comment 2 (stating that \u201csatisfactory explanations to questions regarding possible distortions are particularly important given that [the alternative methodology] allocates indirect selling expenses disproportionately between [subject] and non-subject merchandise\u201d)).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Specifically, U.S. Steel contends that \u2014 because sales of non-subject merchandise constituted only a certain percentage of POSAM\u2019s total sales \u2014\u2022 the extent of the indirect selling expenses allocated to those sales by Commerce was disproportionate, indicating that the payroll methodology is distortive. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 17-18; Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 2-3, 5, 10 \u2014 11.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, U.S. Steel again fails to demonstrate that-the different results from the payroll methodology are impermissible or erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">As the Government points out, U.S. Steel\u2019s reliance on Wire Rod from Spain is simply misplaced. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 17; Pl.\u2019s Brief at 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>(quoting </em>Wire Rod from Spain, 2001 WL 171180, at comment 2). The facts of that case are very different from the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In Wire Rod from Spain, a respondent based its proposed allocation methodology upon the hours that its employees worked. <em>See </em>Wire Rod from Spain, 2001 WL 171180, at comment 2. However, the respondent could not verify that the hours that it had reported to Commerce were correct. <em>See id. </em>Because Commerce concluded that those data were \u201cat the heart of [the respondent\u2019s] allocation methodology,\u201d and because Commerce found them to be inaccurate, Commerce rejected the respondent\u2019s proffered methodology. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In contrast, as the Government observes, here there is no claim \u2014 by U.S. Steel, or anyone else \u2014 that POSAM\u2019s payroll data are in any way inaccurate. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 17. Nor has U.S. Steel identified any particular flaw in the payroll methodology as it was used in this case, except to assert generally that the results of that methodology appear to be disproportionate. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 17. Unlike Wire Rod from Spain, Commerce in this case was satisfied that POSCO\u2019s alternative allocation methodology \u2014 using POSAM\u2019s uncontested payroll data- \u2014 was not distortive. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 17; <em>see also </em>sections III. A &amp; III.B.2, <em>supra </em>(analyzing and rejecting, on the merits, U.S. Steel\u2019s claim of distortion based on the mere fact that POSAM\u2019s sales of non-subject merchandise constituted only a certain percentage of its sales, a figure that U.S. Steel seeks to contrast sharply with the percentage of indirect selling expenses allocated to those sales). U.S. Steel\u2019s criticisms thus cast no doubt on either Commerce\u2019s methodology or the Final Results in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">3. <em>Relationship Between Nature of Expenses and Their Allocation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The third and final factor which U.S. Steel contends is \u201cnormally considered and applied by [Commerce] itself in determining the appropriateness of an alternative allocation methodology\u201d is whether common expenses are allocated in \u201cdirect relation to the manner in which [they were] incurred.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 18 <em>(quoting Micron Technology, </em>23 CIT at 62, 44 F. Supp. 2d at 223 (approving alternative allocation methodologies where each bore \u201ca direct relation to the manner in which the common expense [was] incurred\u201d)); <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 2-3, 5, 12-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">U.S. Steel argues that, in using the payroll methodology here, Commerce\u2019s allocation of POSAM\u2019s common expenses \u201cbears no relation to the manner in which such expenses were incurred.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 18; <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 2-3, 12, 14. In an attempt to illustrate its point, U.S. Steel singles out one particular type of expense included among POSAM\u2019s common expenses, and argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\u201cnothing in the administrative record even remotely suggests\u201d that this particular type of expense \u201cincreased as POSAM\u2019s payroll increased.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 12; <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 18.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> But, significantly, U.S. Steel does not contend that Commerce\u2019s default methodology \u2014 the relative sales value methodology \u2014 would allocate that particular type of expense in \u201crelation to the manner in which such expenses were incurred.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 18. Nor could U.S. Steel honestly make such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Although it is true that \u2014 as U.S. Steel asserts \u2014 the particular type of expenses that U.S: Steel cites as an example does not necessarily directly \u201cincrease [ ] as . . . payroll increase [s],\u201d the same thing can be said of relative sales value: The particular type of expenses that U.S. Steel cites as an example also does not necessarily increase as sales increase. In short, the asserted infirmity that U.S. Steel highlights in the payroll methodology plagues the relative sales value methodology as well (and, indeed, is an issue that is largely inherent in the nature of common expenses and in the process of allocation). U.S. Steel thus has failed to identify a flaw specific to the payroll methodology, or its use in this case, which would be cured by the use of the methodology that U.S. Steel advocates.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Even more fundamentally, there is no truth to the basic premise of U.S. Steel\u2019s argument \u2014 that is, U.S. Steel\u2019s claim that an alternative allocation methodology is legally permissible only if all indirect selling expenses are allocated in a way that bears \u201ca direct relation\u201d to the nature of those expenses. In support of that proposition, U.S. Steel points to <em>Micron Technology, </em>23 CIT at 62, 44 F. Supp. 2d at 223. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 18; Pl.\u2019s Reply Brief at 12. But U.S. Steel misinterprets the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The Micron Technology court concluded that the three allocation methodologies proposed by the respondent during the administrative review there at issue were \u201cmore appropriate\u201d than Commerce\u2019s default methodology, because each of the alternative methodologies bore \u201ca direct relation to the manner in which the . . . expense [at issue was] incurred.\u201d <em>See Micron Technology, </em>23 CIT at 62, 44 F. Supp. 2d at 223. As the Government here explains, however, \u201c[t]his does not mean that a methodology that does not bear a direct relationship with the way an expense is incurred is distortive. Indeed, under U.S. Steel\u2019s interpretation, any alternative methodology, other than a methodology that allocates <em>each type of expense in a separate manner according to the way in which that expense was incurred, </em>would be distortive.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Brief at 17-18 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>U.S. Steel thus engages in the same sort of faulty logic that characterized its analysis of Clinker from Mexico, discussed in section III.B.l, above. That the alternative methodologies at issue in Micron Technology bore \u201ca direct relation to the manner in which . . . [the expenses at issue were] incurred\u201d may have been <em>sufficient </em>to warrant the approval of those methodologies in <em>the specific case </em>there before the court. But that is not to say that such a \u201cdirect relation\u201d is <em>necessary </em>in <em>this case, </em>much less <em>all cases, </em>as U.S. Steel maintains. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 18 <em>(quoting Micron Technology, </em>23 CIT at 62, 44 F. Supp. 2d at 223).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In sum-, like the other two factors which U.S. Steel contends are \u201cnormally considered and applied by [Commerce] itself in determining the appropriateness of an alternative allocation methodology,\u201d this third and final factor \u2014 the relationship between the nature ofexpenses and their allocation \u2014 also does not advance U.S. Steel\u2019s case.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>C. <em>Commerce\u2019s Change of Methodology</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Lastly, U.S. Steel faults Commerce for changing the methodology used by the agency to allocate POSAM\u2019s indirect selling expenses. <em>See generally </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 11-12, 13. U.S. Steel emphasizes that Commerce used the relative sales value methodology in prior administrative reviews involving POSCO, and, indeed, that POSCO itself advocated the use of that methodology in the tenth administrative review. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 11-12. In addition, U.S. Steel seeks to make much of the fact that Commerce used the relative sales value methodology in the Preliminary Results in the administrative review at issue here. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 13. U.S. Steel argues that Commerce \u201cchanged allocation methodologies between the preliminary and final results not based on any new evidence, but based on documents that were provided to the [agency] well before the preliminary results,\u201d and that the documents therefore cannot justify Commerce\u2019s decision to change methodologies for the Final Results. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 13; <em>see also id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Contrary to U.S. Steel\u2019s implication, the mere fact of Commerce\u2019s use of the relative sales value methodology in prior administrative reviews did not obligate the agency to continue to use that methodology for all future reviews. <em>See generally </em>POSCO Brief at 19-20. It is well-established that Commerce is required to calculate antidumping duty margins as accurately as possible in each segment of a proceeding. <em>See, e.g., Rhone Poulenc, Inc. v. United States, </em>899 F.2d 1185, 1191 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Moreover, there is no requirement that Commerce use the same methodologies in every segment. <em>See, e.g., Huvis Corp. v. United States, 570 </em>F.3d 1347, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (rejecting argument that \u201claw of the proceeding\u201d obligated Commerce to apply methodology as it had been applied in three previous administrative reviews; \u201cCommerce need only show that its methodology is permissible under the statute and that it had good reasons for the new methodology\u201d). Commerce\u2019s regulations expressly mandate that the agency calculate allocated expenses on as specific a basis as possible, which was the goal of POSCO and Commerce in using the payroll methodology to calculate POSAM\u2019s indirect selling expenses forpur-poses of the Final Results in the twelfth administrative review, at issue here. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(g)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Further, there was a key change in POSCO\u2019s operations between the periods covered by prior administrative reviews and the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>covered by this review. <em>See </em>POSCO Brief at 20.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Particularly given the different facts in the twelfth administrative review, it was not unreasonable for Commerce to use a different allocation methodology, to seek to achieve a more specific and more accurate indirect selling expenses ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">U.S. Steel\u2019s complaint that Commerce switched methodologies between the Preliminary Results and the Final Results in this administrative review is no more well-founded. <em>See generally </em>POSCO Brief at 20-21. It has long been recognized that Commerce is not bound by the positions taken or the methodologies employed in its preliminary determinations. <em>See, e.g., Peer Bearing Co. v. United States, </em>22 CIT 472, 481-82, 12 F. Supp. 2d 445, 456 (1998) (explaining that \u201cCommerce is allowed flexibility to change its position from the preliminary determination to the Final Results, as long as Commerce explains the basis for the change and the explanation is supported by substantial evidence. . . .

Specifically, U.S. Steel points to the fact that Commerce allocated to sales of subject merchandise and to sales of non-subject merchandise common expenses (and communication expenses in particular) which were generally comparable, even though sales of subject merchandise and sales of non-subject merchandise make very different contributions to POSAM\u2019s total sales <em>{i.e., []% </em>and []%, respectively). <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 16-17 &amp; Figures 1-2; Tr. at 37-38. <em>But see </em>POSCO Brief at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Criticizing Commerce\u2019s use of the payroll methodology to allocate communication expenses, U.S. Steel emphasizes that, as a matter of pure logic, communications expenses do not necessarily vary in proportion to salaries. <em>See </em>Tr. at 65. But it is equally true that, as a matter of pure logic, communications expenses do not necessarily vary in proportion to relative sales value either. <em>See </em>Tr. at 61. Certainly U.S. Steel has not identified even a scintilla of evidence to prove that, in this case, communications expenses increased with the relative value of sales. Thus, as to this point, there would be no advantage to use of the relative sales value methodology that U.S. Steel advocates.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Nor is there any record evidence here to support U.S. Steel\u2019s assertion that selling subject merchandise incurs disproportionately higher communications expenses than does selling non-subject merchandise (or, for that matter, managing POSAM\u2019s two subsidiaries). <em>See </em>Tr. at 54^55, 86-87. U.S. Steel seeks to make much of evidence of frequent communication between POSAM, its U.S. customers, and its corporate parent in Korea concerning sales of subject merchandise. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Brief at 15; Tr. at 37-38, 65. But, as the Government points out, nothing about that evidence speaks to the relative volume or expense of communications (i.e., communications with POSCO about sales of subject merchandise <em>versus </em>other communications concerning sales of non-subject merchandise). <em>See </em>Tr. at 68-69. There is simply no record evidence \u2014 one way or the other \u2014 as to the comparative expense of communications concerning sales of the two types of merchandise. <em>See id,.; see also id. </em>at 86-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Moreover, contrary to U.S. Steel\u2019s claims, the mere fact of higher sales value alone does not compel the conclusion that the individuals selling subject merchandise made more or longer telephone calls than the individuals selling non-subject merchandise. <em>See </em>Tr. at 63-64. Given that there were equal numbers of POSAM employees selling subject merchandise and non-subject merchandise, U.S. Steel\u2019s implication seems to be that one sales group was feverishly working the phones, while \u2014 as POSCO puts it \u2014 the other sales group played solitaire on their computers every day. <em>See </em>Tr. at 63-64, 82-83. Among its several grave flaws, U.S. Steel\u2019s theory fails to acknowledge that it is possible to make a very high value sale with a single phone call. <em>See </em>Tr. at 52-53, 88-89 (highlighting role of price of merchandise being sold).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>U.S. Steel also disputes the reasonableness of the travel and entertainment expenses that Commerce allocated to POSAM\u2019s investment manager, as compared to the travel and entertainment expenses allocated to <em>\u201cthe entire sales force </em>for POSAM\u2019s subject merchandise.\u201d <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Brief at 16 (emphasis added); <em>id. </em>at Figure 2. Specifically, U.S. Steel notes that Commerce allocated to the investment manager travel and entertainment expenses totaling [ ] the travel and entertainment expenses for that sales force. <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Brief at 16 &amp; Figure 2. <em>But see </em>POSCO Brief at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">What U.S. Steel conspicuously fails to note, however, is that \u201cthe entire sales force for POSAM\u2019s subject merchandise\u201d is [ ] people. <em>See </em>Tr. at 61. Thus, distilled to its essence, U:S. Steel\u2019s complaint is simply that the payroll methodology allocated to POSAM\u2019s investment manager a [ ] share of travel and entertainment expenses than was allocated to [ ] who sold subject merchandise. Reframed in that fashion, U.S. Steel\u2019s claim hardly screams \u201cdistortion.\u201d Further, U.S. Steel cannot dispute that the investment manager incurred travel and entertainment expenses in connection with his management of POSAM\u2019s two subsidiaries. <em>See </em>Tr. at 76. Moreover, it is uncontroverted that the investment manager\u2019s salary constituted [ <em>]% </em>of POSAM\u2019s total payroll. <em>See </em>POSCO Brief at 17; Tr. at 58-59, 81. It would seem to be a not unreasonable assumption that a higher-compensated employee would spend a greater sum on travel and entertainment. But, in any event, there is no record evidence to indicate that sales of merchandise (whether subject or not) incurred travel expenses that were disproportionate (either higher or lower) relative to those incurred in the management of POSAM\u2019s subsidiaries. Tr. at 86. In short, this claim of distortion by U.S. Steel \u2014 like its other, similar claims \u2014 is neither supported by evidence nor compelled by logic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\"> U.S. Steel makes no claim that its asserted factors have been compiled \u2014 much less collectively memorialized or codified \u2014 anywhere.
