Explaining its decision not to exclude these imports, Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">we find that the Infodrive data contain insufficient product information in the description of the line items to enable the Department to make a definitive determination that these line items are misclassified. Specifically, the product description in the Infodrive data are such that, given the dependency upon the chemical make-up of the underlying products, they could be properly classified within the Indian HTS category where they are, or in the category addressed by DunAn. Thus, the Department cannot determine, due to lack of product detail, i.e., chemical properties, the precise chemical make-up of these line items. Accordingly, without clear evidence to the contrary, the Department will not speculate that these materials have been misclassified. Therefore, . . . the Department has determined to include imports from Japan, France, and the UAE in calculating the surrogate value for brass bar in the final determination because the record evidence does not demonstrate that the imports from these countries were misclassified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\"><em>Decision Mem. </em>at 21.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>DunAn argues that Commerce should have accorded more weight to the Infodrive India data and that Commerce should have, based on these data, eliminated the three countries\u2019 data as unreliable. DunAn in addition contends that it is irrelevant which HTS classification applies; \u201c[t]he issue is not whether these shipments have been properly classified within the HTS [but rather] is whether these shipments are representative of the factor input Commerce is attempting to value.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Br. 13.) DunAn offered record evidence to demonstrate that bronze, beryllium copper, and cupronickel have different chemical properties and have different uses than brass. <em>(See id. </em>12-13;) <em>DunAn\u2019s Second Surrogate Value Submission </em>at Exs. 3A-3E. Therefore, according to DunAn, because the data from these three countries distorted the resulting brass bar surrogate value and because the Department\u2019s usage of that WTA data is not a selection of the \u201cbest available\u201d evidence, Commerce\u2019s determination is unsupported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The government responds that the complete WTA data set under HTS category 7407.21.10 was the best available information on the record. Commerce chooses surrogate values on a case-by-case basis, and prefers to use \u201cpublic, country-wide data.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Opp\u2019n to Pl.\u2019s Mot. for J. Upon the Agency R. (\u201cDef.\u2019s Br.\u201d) 27 (quoting <em>Mittal Steel Galati S.A. v. United States, </em>31 CIT 1121, 1124, 502 F. Supp. 2d 1295, 1298 (2007)).) Consequently, the government argues, Commerce used \u201cthe full WTA data set, with the exception of imports from non-market economy countries, countries known to have country-wide export subsidies, or unidentified countries . . . because [the data] are publicly-available, broad-based, product-specific, tax-exclusive and contemporaneous.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(citing <em>Decision Mem. </em>at 22-23).) In addition, the government points out that Commerce did in fact examine the Infodrive India data, but did not find them definitive, particularly because DunAn failed to \u201cprovide any specific evidence that entries containing a certain amount of a chemical were inappropriately considered \u2018brass bar\u2019 such as would be classified under the HTS category for brass bar.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>27, 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The government is correct. The problem with DunAn\u2019s claim is that it does not focus on the specific information in the administrative record. In scrutinizing the Infodrive India data, Commerce confronted two inconsistent descriptions of the imports from the three countries at issue. Whereas the Infodrive India spreadsheet listed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u201cactual product description\u201d for France, Japan, and the UAE, specified as copper and bronze, beryllium copper, and cupronickel, respectively, the spreadsheet also categorized the imported metals as \u201cbrass\u201d under the HTS Code. Bronze, brass, beryllium copper, and cupronickel are all copper alloys and, although having distinct properties and uses, the types of metals at issue here are relatively similar in chemical makeup. <em>See supra </em>notes 13, 15-17. The accuracy of labels assigned to these imports, therefore, depends very much upon the types and percentages of metals contained therein. Commerce did not have this information. Thus, even had Commerce solely relied upon the Infodrive data, Commerce would still have had to choose between the \u201cbrass bar\u201d classification listed and the perhaps conflicting product description. It was therefore reasonable for Commerce to rely upon the Infodrive India HTS classifications rather than the product descriptions, the former being consistent with the WTA data. As the court frequently emphasizes, \u201cthe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [Commerce\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States, </em>750 F.2d 927, 933 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (quoting <em>Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 619-20 (1966)). It is not the court\u2019s place to choose between the classification and the description based on this record. <em>See U.S. Steel Group v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">DunAn cites to opinions of the Court which, according to DunAn, \u201cadmonished the Department ... for failing to accord sufficient weight to Infodrive India data or other trade intelligence data that indicated the Indian import statistics utilized for the surrogate value were not representative of the input being valued.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Br. 9-12 (discussing <em>Taian Ziyang Food Co. v.

Supp. 2d at 1286, 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"A6h\">The case law DunAn cites, however, focuses on Commerce\u2019s failure to provide a sufficient reasoned explanation of its chosen data set.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>In these cases, the Department wholly failed to address \u201cwhether or not Infodrive India casts light on potential inaccuracies\u201d in the WTA data. <em>Dorbest I, </em>30 CIT at 1695, 462 F. Supp. 2d at 1284. <em>See also Zhengzhou, </em>_ CIT at _, 617 F. Supp. 2d at 1322-23 (rejecting Commerce\u2019s cursory presumption that Infodrive data were unreliable without \u201ceven a scintilla of evidence of manipulation or distortion or affiliation\u201d), 1326-27; <em>Taian </em>Ziyang, _ CIT at _, 637 F. Supp. 2d at 1156 (\u201cCommerce simply dismissed [respondents\u2019] concerns\u201d in a \u201cterse three sentences\u201d and \u201cfailed to directly confront\u201d respondent\u2019s claims), 1159-60. Instead, Commerce \u201cconclude[d] that Infodrive data [are] unreliable or contain! ] misclassifications, while simultaneously claiming that [WTA data are] both reliable and contain! ] no inaccuracies.\u201d <em>Dorbest I, </em>30 CIT at 1697, 462 F. Supp. 2d at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">In the determination at issue in this case, however, the Department directly addressed the relevance of the Infodrive data to the WTA data. Commerce did not merely dismiss the Infodrive India data out of hand, nor did it make a general finding that Infodrive data were unreliable.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Rather, Commerce, assuming the Infodrive data were in fact reliable, directly discussed Infodrive India\u2019s relevance to the WTA data and found the Infodrive data to be inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Further, even if the overall WTA data were being challenged, DunAn did not present Commerce with evidence that HTS 7407.21.10 includes imports that are other than the specific input at issue here. Moreover, DunAn did not provide evidence, other than Infodrive India, to attempt to demonstrate WTA misclassifications. <em>Compare Dorbest I, </em>30 CIT at 1694, 462 F. Supp. 2d at 1283 (noting that respondents provided evidence that Taiwanese export data did not match the WTA-listed Indian imports from Taiwan).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>See also Allied </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>Pac.

In other words, here, both the WTA data and the Infodrive India data are sufficiently product-specific or representative to be considered the \u201cbest available\u201d information. As the finder of fact, Commerce therefore had the discretion to choose between these data sets.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The court\u2019s duty, in reviewing Commerce\u2019s determination as to whether a certain set of data is the \u201cbest available .information,\u201d is \u201cnot to evaluate whether the information Commerce used was the best available, but rather whether a reasonable mind could conclude that Commerce chose the best available information.\u201d <em>Goldlink Indus. Co. v. United States, </em>30 CIT 616, 619, 431 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1327 (2006). Thus, \u201c[i]f Commerce\u2019s determination of what constitutes the best available information is reasonable, then the [c]ourt must defer to Commerce.\u201d <em>Id.

Supp. 2d at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Accordingly, because Commerce\u2019s reading of the evidence is reasonable, the court rejects DunAn\u2019s challenge to Commerce\u2019s selection of WTA data, including data on imports from France, Japan, and the UAE.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">B. Commerce\u2019s Calculation of Labor Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Next, DunAn challenges Commerce\u2019s derivation of a wage rate for DunAn\u2019s labor using a \u201cregression-based\u201d calculation<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that included wage rate and income data from countries (a) not economically com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>parable to China and (b) not significant producers of merchandise comparable to the subject FSV.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> DunAn instead advocates the use of an Indian wage rate as the surrogate wage rate for DunAn\u2019s labor. For the following reasons, the court sustains the Department\u2019s use of the labor regression model in this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In its wage rate calculation, Commerce performs a simple regression to estimate the linear relationship between yearly per capita-gross national income (\u201cGNI/capita\u201d)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and hourly wage rate (\u201cwage\u201d). To describe this relationship, Commerce uses publicly available GNI/capita and wage data from 61 market economy countries.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> GNI/capita serves as the independent variable (x) and wage as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>dependent variable (y);<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> predictably, these variables have a positive linear relationship. Commerce then estimates the wage for an NME country by using the NME GNI/capita.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">Accordingly, although Commerce used Indian data for other FOPs, in calculating a 2005 surrogate wage for merchandise from China, Commerce regressed 2005 market economy wages on 2005 GNI/capitas, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\"><em>Expected Wages of Selected Non-Market Economy Countries, supra </em>note 27. Thus, Commerce created a 2005 NME regression line equation to describe the relationship between the 61 countries\u2019 wages and GNI/capita:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Wage[predicted] = 0.257585 + 0.000448 * GNI/capita[entered]</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number><em>See id. </em>Because Commerce estimates that NME countries\u2019s GNI/capita and wages would have the same relationship, Commerce used the same regression line to also describe predicted NME wages:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">NME wage[predicted] = 0.257585 + 0.000448 * NME GNI/capita[entered]</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\"><em>See id. </em>That is to say, by entering in an NME\u2019s GNI/capita, Commerce could predict the NME\u2019s wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Using this equation, Commerce then entered China\u2019s 2005 GNI/capita \u2014 $1,740 \u2014 into the above equation and derived a wage of, approximately, $1.04.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Id. Commerce selected this surrogate wage rate as the labor FOP for the calculation of DunAn\u2019s COP. DunAn notes that, had Commerce limited its surrogate values to that of India as it did for other FOPs, DunAn\u2019s surrogate wage would have instead amounted to $0.21. (Pl.\u2019s Br. 39;) <em>Expected Wages of Selected Non-Market Economy Countries, supra </em>note 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Like the plaintiff in <em>Dorbest I </em>and in the subsequent decision post-remand, <em>Dorbest Ltd. v. United States (\u201cDorbest II\"), _ </em>CIT _, 547 F. Supp. 2d 1321 (2008), DunAn attacks 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(c)(3) as invalid both facially and as-applied in this case.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The court will address each of DunAn\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">1. Facial Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">First, DunAn argues that Commerce\u2019s regulation is contrary to the statute and, therefore invalid on its face. Following <em>Dorbest I, </em>the court rejects DunAn\u2019s facial challenge.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">Section 1677b does, of course, require Commerce to utilize, to the extent possible, the prices or costs of factors of production in one or more market economy countries that are \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>(A) at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">(B) significant producers of comparable merchandise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(4). Commerce\u2019s regulation \u2014 providing for the use of \u201cregression-based wage rates reflective of the observed relationship between wages and national income in market economy countries\u201d \u2014 is not, on its face, inconsistent with the statutory requirement for use of prices or costs from a market economy country. Rather, consistent with the statute, Commerce\u2019s regulation derives a wage rate for a \u201chypothetical\u201d market economy China, that is, \u00e1 market economy country with China\u2019s level of economic development and that produces merchandise comparable to the Chinese merchandise at issue. <em>See Nation Ford Chem.

Cir. 2001) (according Commerce discretion to depart from surrogate country valuation \u201cwhen there are other methods of determining the \u2018best available information\u2019 regarding values of [FOPs].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">DunAn attempts to distinguish <em>Dorbest I </em>on the grounds that <em>Dorbest I </em>did not address the substantial producer prong of section 1677b(c). However, the court\u2019s reasoning for economic comparability applies equally to the significant producer requirement, as to choice of an underlying data set, should such a requirement indeed exist. Therefore, <em>Dorbest I. </em>is persuasive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">DunAn also attacks <em>Dorbest I </em>by highlighting an excerpt from the legislative history of section 1677b(c). DunAn cites the Conference Agreement discussion of this provision contained in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988: \u201c[t]he [FOPs] would be valued from the best available evidence in a market economy country (or countries) that is at a comparable level of economic development as the country subject to investigation and is a significant producer of the comparable merchandise.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 100-576, at 590 (1988) (Conf. Rep.), <em>reprinted in </em>1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1547, 1623. But the language from the Conference Report does not provide any more guidance than the wording of section 1677b(c), nor has DunAn demonstrated that the Report is in any way inconsistent with the court\u2019s reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Finally, DunAn points the court to other decisions from this Court that have invalidated 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(c)(3) as an impermissible and unreasonable implementation of section 1677b(c). <em>See, e.g., Taian </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Ziyang, _ CIT at _, 637 F. Supp. 2d at 1136-38; <em>Allied Pac. Food (Dalian) Co. v. United States (\u201cAllied Pac. II\"), _ </em>CIT _, 587 F. Supp. 2d 1330 (2008). These opinions take the position that the regulation is invalid because it precludes Commerce from considering investigation- and product-specific wage data. <em>See Allied Pac. </em>II, _ CIT at _, 587 F. Supp. 2d at 1356 (\u201cThe regulation requires a single calculated wage rate to be determined annually .... [and therefore] [t]he regulation does not permit a surrogate labor rate to be determined for an individual proceeding\u201d), 1358 (\u201cCommerce\u2019s response in the preamble [to the regulation] falls short of a plausible explanation of why Commerce considered it acceptable to foreclose consideration of data specific to the type of labor required to produce comparable merchandise. . . . [Commerce\u2019s] rationale [is] insufficient to justify a regulation that disallows the use of data on the cost of a specific type of labor\u201d). But. the statute imposes a data selection requirement of country comparability, not merchandise specificity; nor does the statute require the use of data generated for an individual or specific investigation. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(4) (Commerce \u201cshall utilize . . . the prices or costs of factors of production in one or more market economy countries that are . . . significant producers of comparable merchandise\u201d).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Consequently, the Department\u2019s labor rate regulation is not, on its face, inconsistent with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">2. As-Applied Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Second, DunAn argues that the Department should have used the Indian wage rate in lieu of the number for China\u2019s wage rate derived from the regression. In this regard, DunAn does not attack the methodology Commerce used in implementing the regulation and does not, other than challenging the legality of the regression model, explain how the Indian wage rate instead constitutes the \u201cbest available information.\u201d Rather, DunAn argues that Commerce did not explain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>how use of global regression-based calculation has produced a wage rate that is more accurate for the valuation of labor in the FSVs industry. <em>(See </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 39-40; Pl.\u2019s Reply Br. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">But Commerce did in fact explain its reasoning on this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">While surrogate values for other FOPs are selected from a single surrogate country, due to the gross variability between wage rates and GNI, we do not find reliance on wage data from a single surrogate country reliable for purposes of valuing the labor input. 'While there is a strong positive correlation between wage rates and GNI, there is also variation in the wage rates of comparable market economies. For example, even for countries that are relatively comparable in terms of GNI for purposes of factor valuation (e.g., where GNI is below US$ 2500), the wage rate spans from US$ 0.21 to US$ 2.06. To further illustrate, DunAn advocates that instead of relying on the regression methodology, the Department should value labor using India\u2019s single wage rate. Petitioner contends that should the Department consider valuing labor from a single surrogate', other comparable countries should also be considered, such as [Colombia]. Although both India and [Colombia] have GNIs of under US $2500, India\u2019s wage rate is approximately US $0.21, as compared to [Colombia\u2019s] observed wage rate of US $1.13. The large variance in these two countries\u2019 wages \u2014 not to mention the variances which occur when wage rates are considered for other market economy countries of economic comparability \u2014illustrate the arbitrariness of relying on a wage rate from a single country. For these reasons, DunAn\u2019s suggestion of using a single surrogate country to value labor does not constitute the best available information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\"><em>Decision Mem. </em>at 20 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Moreover, earlier in its Decision Memo, Commerce explained the benefits of its global regression model: \u201c[t]he Department. . . considers that the regression methodology constitutes the best available information for purposes of valuing labor\u201d as \u201c[t]he Department\u2019s methodology avoids extreme variances in labor wage rates that exist across market economies, and instead, accounts for the global relationship between GNI and wages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. Further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">relying only on data from countries that are economically comparable to each NME would undermine, rather than enhance, the accuracy of the Department\u2019s regression analysis. The number of \u201ceconomically comparable\u201d countries would be extremely small. For example, when examining countries with GNIs that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>range between US $700 and US $2500 <em>ie.g., </em>countries that might be considered economically comparable to [China]), there are just nine countries out of a full data set of 61 countries used in the revised wage calculation in May 2008. A regression based on such a small subset of countries would be highly dependent on each and every data point, and thus, the inclusion or exclusion of any one country could have an extreme effect on the regression results from case-to-case, and from year-to-year. Relying on a broad data set, as opposed to data from just the economically comparable countries, maximizes the accuracy of the regression results, minimizes the effects of the potential year-to-year variability in the basket, and provides predictability and fairness. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">[T]he purpose in using a regression methodology... is to provide a more accurate labor value that is stable and predictable across all cases. The regression methodology accomplishes this by providing a variable average that \u201csmoothes out\u201d the variations in the data and permits, in a predictable manner, the estimation of a market economy wage rate relative to a level of GNI that is as accurate as practicable, with the least amount of volatility across cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 19 (citations &amp; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Considered in light of Commerce\u2019s analysis, DunAn did not create a record establishing that the particular Indian surrogate value, $0.21/hour, would somehow be more accurate, and thus better information, than the regression surrogate value derived for China. <em>Compare Dorbest </em>II, _ CIT at _, 547 F. Supp. 2d at 1328-30 (analyzing plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the regression was heteroscedastic); <em>Dorbest I, </em>30 CIT at 1710-12, 462 F. Supp. 2d at 1296-98 (addressing plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that the regression model is distorted given the existence of a non-zero y-intercept). Contrary to DunAn\u2019s arguments, Commerce\u2019s explanation reasonably supports Commerce\u2019s use of the broader global regression methodology and preference for the wage rate selected here when compared to India\u2019s surrogate wage rate. <em>See Dorbest I, </em>30 CIT at 1677, 462 F. Supp. 2d at 1269 (Commerce must \u201cjustify its selection of data with a reasoned explanation.\u201d). There is nothing on the record here that would preclude a reasonable mind from preferring the regression-generated wage rate to the specific India-based $0.21 rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Accordingly, the court affirms Commerce\u2019s use of the regression model in calculating the FOP for labor in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>C.

Although the total value noted in the invoice deviated by only thirty cents from the consumption report \u2014 consistent, with the December 2007 discrepancy between payment and invoice noted above \u2014 the quantities in the December 2007 consumption report differed significantly from those in the invoice. <em>Verification Mem. </em>at 8; <em>Application of AFA Mem. </em>at 3.

DunAn also claimed that the U.S. customer likely misreported numbers on its consumption reports for financial reasons.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Further, DunAn argued that the consumption report numbers were abnormally large in comparison to other 2007 orders,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and, in any event, it would have been impossible for the customer to withdraw so many of the relevant model of FSVs from inventory, as DunAn Precision did not have enough of the model in stock.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>Verification Mem. </em>at 10; <em>Application of AFA Mem. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Confusing matters further, however, Mr. Qi maintained separate \u201cmonthly inventory reports\u201d or \u201cMIRs,\u201d which Commerce obtained for the months October 2007 through March 2008.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Conspicuously, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>January 2008 MIR was singularly structured. <em>Verification Mem. </em>at 11; <em>Application of AFA Mem. </em>at 5-6. Unlike the other MIRs, the January 2008 MIR did not account for the final inventory from the previous month, that is, the report did not account for December 2007 inventory remaining after subtracting out the U.S. customer\u2019s purchases that month; the January MIR instead used the U.S. customer\u2019s consumption numbers.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> <em>Verification Mem. </em>at 11-12; <em>Application of AFA Mem. </em>at 5-6. The remaining 2008 MIRs carried over the sales from December 2007, but the amount carried over still came from the December consumption report, not the December invoice.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> <em>Verification Mem. </em>at 12; <em>Application of AFA Mem. </em>at 6. Commerce was concerned that this MIR structure, by eliminating December 2007 net inventory, served to side-step, rather than to reconcile, the very quantity discrepancies at issue. <em>Verification Mem. </em>at 12; <em>Application of AFA Mem. </em>at 6. At first, Mr. Qi could not provide any explanation for the difference in the January 2008 MIR or how the MIRs resolved the quantity/inventory December 2007 conundrum and could not even remember making the report. <em>Verification Mem. </em>at 9, 12. Mr. Qi finally answered that DunAn Precision reported its numbers in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>way for tax reasons.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> <em>Verification Mem. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">In essence, Mr. Qi admitted that the inventory numbers contained in the October, November, and December 2007 MIRs were incorrect. But while Commerce pointed out that this recordation of inventory indicated that the consumption reports were accurate, Mr. Qi again, without explanation, maintained that the invoice quantities were correct. <em>Verification Mem. </em>at 12.

Moreover, because Mr. Qi provided evidence that inventory numbers were incorrectly reported in the MIRs for the latter three months of 2007, Commerce applied AFA as to the ICC for these months and used the highest ICC expense calculated for any sale during the POI. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"><em>2. </em>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">a.

Because of these other invoices and documents, DunAn claims that no \u201cgaps\u201d existed on the record to justify the use of AFA.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> DunAn contends that <em>Shandong Huarong Mach.

Supp. 2d 1261 (2006) supports the conclusion that, because it provided Commerce with \u201cnecessary information,\u201d Commerce could not apply facts otherwise available. <em>Shandong, </em>30 CIT at 1301-02, 435 F. Supp. 2d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The government responds, however, that, when attempting to verify the accuracy of sales and ICC, Commerce \u201cdiscovered documents that contradicted those previously provided to it.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Br. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>17.) Because of these inconsistencies, Commerce was unable to verify the information on the record and could not rely on the accuracy of DunAn\u2019s documentation. The government also argues that DunAn\u2019s consumption reports prior to December 2007 are not relevant to the question of whether records for December 2007 were accurate, and shipment records only display import numbers and do not account for the debated consumption numbers. <em>(Id. </em>21.) As to DunAn\u2019s complaints that Commerce did not utilize the consumption reports instead of the invoices, the government argues that Commerce did not accept the accura'cy of the consumption reports, but, rather, determined that the consumption reports indicated contradictions in DunAn Precision\u2019s records that prevented Commerce from verifying the December sales numbers. <em>(Id. </em>21-22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The government is once again correct. Nothing in <em>Shandong </em>indicates that Commerce may not apply facts otherwise available when information is <em>unverifiabl</em>e; unverifiable \u201cnecessary information\u201d creates a \u201cgap\u201d in the administrative record to the same degree as a <em>complete absence </em>of \u201cnecessary information.\u201d <em>See Heveafil, </em>58 F.

Such information is still \u201cmissing\u201d from the record that would serve to verify the contradictory sales numbers. A respondent\u2019s submission of unverifiable evidence, rather than no evidence at all, does not save the respondent from Commerce\u2019s reasonable use of facts otherwise available.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In any event, the court would direct DunAn to read the clear and unambiguous language of section 1677e(a) that instructs that facts otherwise available are appropriate <em>either </em>when \u201cnecessary information is not available on the record\u201d <em>or </em>when \u201can interested party or any other person . . . provides such information but the information cannot be verified . . . .\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">For the same reason, as to ICC, the court cannot mandate that Commerce ignore purportedly unreliable statements made by Mr. Qi in favor of what Commerce has reasonably determined to be unverifiable information.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Finally on this issue, DunAn argues that the inventory reports show that it was- impossible to fulfill the consumption reports\u2019 requirements, and claims that the December 2007 withdrawal was clearly so large as to be aberrational. Commerce replied to DunAn\u2019s concerns that \u201cDunAn attempts to demonstrate the accuracy of its records by pointing to the very records that could not be substanti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ated at verification.\u201d <em>Decision Mem. </em>at 51.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The court again agrees with the government\u2019s position. Given that, for the relevant valves, Commerce could verify neither the exact number of December 2007 sales nor the total inventory in stock between October and December 2007, it is reasonable for Commerce to decline to square alleged December inventory amounts and sales, even in light of DunAn\u2019s proffered import data and even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that this import information is correct. Moreover, because its December 2007 sales were unverifiable and because of Mr. Qi\u2019s admission,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> it was also within Commerce\u2019s discretion to refuse to find that anomalies in December sales numbers definitively either verified or discredited the accuracy of various other information on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">As such, Commerce\u2019s use of facts otherwise available, as to the December 2007 sales and ICC, is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">b. Application of Adverse Inferences</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The administrative record also reflects that Commerce supported, with substantial evidence, its decision that DunAn did not act \u201cto the best of its ability\u201d to aid Commerce in resolving record discrepancies. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b).<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">In making its determination whether or not to utilize an adverse inference, Commerce need only make a \u201cfactual assessment of the extent to which a respondent keeps and maintains reasonable records and the degree to which the respondent cooperates in investigating those records and in providing Commerce with the requested information.\u201d <em>Nippon, </em>337 F.3d at 1383. Moreover, there is no <em>mens rea </em>requirement to warrant an adverse inference, and Commerce may use adverse facts regardless of a respondent\u2019s motivation or intent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">The statutory standard does not require perfection; nonetheless, though mistakes may sometimes be discounted, a respondent cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>be \u201cinattentive [ ], careless [ ], or inadequate [in] record keeping.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1382. Commerce may presume that a respondent is familiar with its own records. <em>Id. </em>Commerce may also assume that respondents are familiar with rules and regulations that apply to. the import activities undertaken. <em>Id. </em>As a consequence, in order to avoid an adverse inference, a respondent must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">(a) take reasonable steps to keep and maintain full and complete records documenting the information that a reasonable importer should anticipate being called upon to produce; (b) have familiarity with all of the records it maintains in its possession, custody, or control; and (c) conduct prompt, careful, and comprehensive investigations of all relevant records that refer or relate to the imports in question to the full extent of the importers\u2019 ability to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Errors resulting in failure to provide information <em>{e.g., </em>computer errors or mistaken advice from an attorney) will not absolve a respondent from a Commerce determination that the respondent has failed to cooperate. <em>See PAM, S.p.A. v. United States, </em>582 F.3d 1336, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2009). A respondent may not rely on excuses that its employee designated to prepare the response either does not know about the needed records, <em>Nippon, </em>337 F.3d at 1383, or has a lack of familiarity with the respondent\u2019s accounting records. <em>Heveafil, </em>58 F. App\u2019x at 849. Nor can the respondent avoid adverse inferences if it finds that records no longer exist or cannot be located. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">DunAn argues that DunAn Precision merely failed to maintain sufficient records to account for discrepancies between consumption reports and invoices. These failures, however, even if inadvertent, support Commerce\u2019s decision to apply an adverse inference. <em>See Nippon, </em>337 F.3d at 1383. Further, Commerce met with Mr. Qi several times and, in some instances, Mr. Qi could not explain the inconsistencies in DunAn Precision\u2019s documents. Of those inconsistencies for which he could account, Mr. Qi informed Commerce that DunAn Precision made adjustments in its accounting records \u2014 also provided to Commerce \u2014 but, at the same time, kept MIRs that conflicted with the invoices. Yet Mr. Qi continued to insist that the invoices were correct. This lack of clarity indicates, at best, negligent record keeping, inadequate knowledge of existing records, insufficient inquiry into these records, and failure to adequately prepare Mr. Qi for Commerce\u2019s investigation. <em>See id.; Heveafil, </em>58 F. App\u2019x at 849; <em>PAM, </em>582 F.3d at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>DunAn once again relies on <em>Shandong, </em>30 CIT at 1301-02, 435 F.

DunAn has not demonstrated to the court that, on this administrative record, a reasonable fact finder could not come to the conclusion that Commerce reached here. <em>See U.S. Steel </em>Group, 96 F.3d at 1357-58; <em>In re Alonso, </em>545 F.3d 1015, 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">On the record before the court, it was reasonable for Commerce to find that either DunAn was not completely forthcoming to Commerce or that DunAn Precision was at least negligent with its record keeping. Therefore, th&lt;? court sustains Commerce\u2019s application of an adverse inference against DunAn.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">c. Use of AFA Margin of 55.62 percent<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">DunAn also contests the resulting AFA rate. Commerce applied a 55.62 percent dumping margin to DunAn\u2019s December 2007 sales of the two FSV models at issue, as 55.62 percent was the initiation rate and the highest rate in the proceeding. <em>Application of AFA Mem. </em>at 9; <em>Decision Mem. </em>at 52.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The statute explicitly authorizes Commerce, in determining an appropriate AFA rate, to rely on any information placed on the record, including information derived from the petition. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.308; <em>F.lli De Cecco di Filippo Fara S.

Cir. 2000); SAA at 870, <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4199.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">That said, Commerce may not \u201coverreach reality\u201d in resorting to an adverse margin. <em>De Cecco, </em>216 F.3d at 1032. <em>See also PAM, </em>582 F.3d at 1340; 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c). When using \u201csecondary information,\u201d such as that from the petition, to create a proxy margin, Commerce must \u201cto the extent practicable, corroborate that information from independent sources that are reasonably at [its] disposal.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.308(d). \u201cCommerce evaluates whether secondary information has probative value by assessing its reliability and relevance.\u201d <em>KYD, Inc. v. United </em>States, _ CIT _, _, 613 F. Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>2d 1371, 1378 (2009) (citation omitted). <em>See also Mittal Steel Galati S.A. v. United States, </em>31 CIT 730, 734, 491 F. Supp. 2d 1273, 1278 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Accordingly, the rate chosen must attempt to be a \u201creasonably accurate estimate\u201d of respondent\u2019s actual rate, \u201calbeit with some built-in increase intended as a deterrent,\u201d and must be corroborated with information on the record. <em>De Ceceo, </em>216 F.3d at 1032. <em>See also id. </em>(\u201cCongress could not have intended for Commerce\u2019s discretion to include the ability to select unreasonably high rates with no relationship to the respondent\u2019s actual dumping margin.\u201d). Within these constraints, Commerce is entitled to use the highest margin applied to DunAn or any other respondent. <em>See Heveafil, </em>58 F. App\u2019x Court No. 09-00217 Page 48 at 846, 849-50; <em>De Cecco, </em>216 F.3d at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">DunAn first argues that Commerce may not apply the China-wide rate because DunAn is independent from the Chinese government. <em>See Qingdao Taifa Group Co. v. United </em>States, _ CIT _, _, 637 F. Supp. 2d 1231, 1240-41 (2009), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>581 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <em>Gerber Food (Yunnan) Co. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 753, 771-72, 387 F. Supp. 2d 1270, 1287 (2005). But the government responds that Commerce utilized the petition rate, rather than purposefully applying the China-wide rate, and claims that Commerce did not specifically group DunAn within the China-wide entity which received the China-wide rate: \u201cCommerce\u2019s use of the petition rate as [AFA] for DunAn\u2019s December 2007 sales quantity 0 cannot be equated to Commerce treating DunAn as part of the China-wide entity.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Br. 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Consistent with the government\u2019s arguments, in Commerce\u2019s determinations it referred to the high margin given to DunAn merely as the rate in the petition, and did not, in using this rate, deny DunAn a separate rate. <em>Final Determination </em>at 10,889; <em>Decision Mem. </em>at 52; <em>Frontseating Service Valves from the People\u2019s Republic of China, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at <em>62,956; Application of AFA Mem. </em>at 9. <em>Compare Qingdao, </em>_CIT at _, 637 F. Supp. 2d at 1240, 1242 (reversing Commerce\u2019s decision, when applying AFA, to apply the PRC-wide rate instead of a separate rate). As a consequence, whether or not Commerce can apply the China-wide rate to DunAn is irrelevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Be that as it may, Commerce\u2019s use of the petition margin, when based upon secondary information such as the petition rate, still must approximate DunAn\u2019s actual rate, and Commerce must corroborate the use of the rate with evidence on the record. <em>See PAM, </em>582 F.3d at 1340; <em>De Cecco, </em>216 F.3d at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">In this regard, DunAn does not argue that Commerce failed to adequately corroborate, as required by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c), Commerce\u2019s use of the 55.62 percent petition rate. Rather, DunAn argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>that the applied rate was not directly related to the unverified information at issue. DunAn complains that, while Commerce found DunAn\u2019s sales quantity data to be unverifiable, Commerce, in its calculations, nonetheless used this same quantity data when calculating DunAn\u2019s weighted-average dumping margin. To DunAn, this choice was inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Yet DunAn\u2019s argument is unpersuasive because it \u201cconflate [s] Commerce\u2019s determination to reject as unreliable [certain information' DunAn] submitted with Commerce\u2019s determination to use as AFA \u2018other\u2019 record evidence . . . .\u201d <em>Wash. Int\u2019l Ins. Co. v. United States, </em>No. 08-00156, 2010 Ct. Intl. Trade LEXIS 13, at *16-17 (CIT Feb. 9, 2010) (citation omitted). Commerce may, as here, use the quantity information rejected as unverifiable because it is DunAn\u2019s own number. DunAn cannot now complain that Commerce used, when applying AFA, the information DunAn itself submitted during the investigation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The court thus sustains Commerce\u2019s use of 55.62 percent as DunAn\u2019s AFA rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">D. Offset for Recycled Brass Scrap</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The court also rejects DunAn\u2019s final ground for remand. In using brass bar to manufacture its FSVs, DunAn produces by-product brass scrap. DunAn sells some of this scrap, but much of the brass scrap is recycled and integrated into later production of other FSVs. Responding to DunAn\u2019s case brief in the administrative proceeding below, the Department allowed an offset, in part, for the reduced value of brass scrap, and applied this offset to DunAn\u2019s normal value. <em>See Decision Mem. </em>at 58-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">DunAn claims that Commerce\u2019s scrap offset methodology is contrary to law. Specifically, DunAn argues that Commerce reduced its calculation of DunAn\u2019s COP by the reduced value of brass scrap rather than subtracting the brass bar created from scrap from the total brass bar used. This method of calculating the offset, according to DunAn, leads to significant undervaluation of DunAn\u2019s cost savings from the use of recycled brass scrap.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Commerce did not address this argument in its Decision Memorandum. Accordingly, DunAn asks that the court direct Commerce to explain its choice of offset calculation.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The court\u2019s analysis of this issue begins with the recognition that it is Commerce\u2019s consistent practice to grant, from the COP, an offset of the scrap\u2019s sales value.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> In addition, the court sees no conflict between the offset methodology and the governing statutes and regulations, and thus determines the Department\u2019s practice to be reasonable and hence in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">DunAn cites Commerce decisions to demonstrate that \u201cthe Department\u2019s practice is not to value by-products reused in production.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Reply Br. 13 (quoting <em>Coated Free Sheet Paper from the People\u2019s Republic of China, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 60,632 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Oct. 25, 2007) (final determination of sales at less than fair value), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum, A-570-906, POI 04/01/06 - 09/30/06 (Oct. 17, 2007), at 36, <em>available at </em>http:// ia.ita.doc.gov/ffn/summary/PRC/E7-21041-l.pdf (last visited Apr. 19, 2010)) (quotation marks omitted).) Pursuant to this practice, Commerce will not add the value of the brass scrap as an FOP in calculating the COP, as the scrap came from the already-valued brass FOP.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">But this is a different issue. Here, Commerce indeed did not add the sales value of the scrap to DunAn\u2019s COP. In fact, Commerce granted DunAn an offset because DunAn used some of the scrap. If DunAn\u2019s argument were correct, namely that the values of brass bar and brass bar scrap were equivalent and therefore were completely fungible, then the sales value of the scrap would equal the sales value of the brass bar and the value Commerce applied to the scrap would not be in dispute. Rather, for whatever reason, brass scrap does not equal brass bar, and it was thus reasonable for Commerce to treat these inputs differently based upon the sales value of each.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Moreover, the court does not agree that Commerce\u2019s failure to address this one issue constitutes error. Commerce is presumed to have considered all the record evidence, <em>see Thomas v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. 2009-3107, 2010 WL 391327, at *2 (Fed. Cir.
