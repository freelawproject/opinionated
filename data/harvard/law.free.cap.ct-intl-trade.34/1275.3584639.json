Ltd., and Takzin Samut Co., Ltd. (collectively, \u201cPakfood\u201d). Judgment in the underlying action has been entered in favor of Defendant United States (\u201cDefendant\u201d) and against Plaintiff Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Committee (\u201cAd Hoc\u201d), and Ad Hoc has appealed. <em>See </em>April 29, 2010 Order; Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Because Pakfood has not carried its burden of establishing that changed circumstances necessitate modification of the preliminary injunction while Ad Hoc\u2019s appeal is pending, Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">A. Preliminary Injunction Overview</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">In cases challenging antidumping determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d), \u201cthe United States Court of International Trade may enjoin the liquidation of and a proper showing that the requested relief should be granted under the circumstances.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(c)(2). Entries subject to a preliminary injunction issued by this court \u201cshall be liquidated in accordance with the final decision in the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1516a(e)(2). Courts only grant preliminary injunctions when the party seeking such relief establishes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-7\">(1) absent the requested relief, it will suffer immediate irreparable harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-8\">(2) there exists in its favor a likelihood of success on the merits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-9\">(3) the public interest would be better served by the requested relief; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-10\">(4) the balance of hardships on all parties tips in its favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\"><em>Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Comm. v. United States, </em>562 F. Supp. 2d 1383, 1386-87 (2008) (citing <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>710 F.2d 806, 809 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">Preliminary injunctions granted by this court pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(c)(2) emphasize the irreparable harm that results from liquidation. <em>See SKF USA Inc. v. United States, </em>28 CIT 170, 176, 316 F. Supp. 2d 1322 (2004) (\u201cBecause Plaintiffs have shown that in the absence of a preliminary injunction, they would suffer irreparable harm, they are required only to raise serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful questions to satisfy their burden of proving a likelihood of success on the merits.\u201d) (Quotation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-13\">This court grants preliminary injunctions in antidumping cases when it is essential 'for the protection of a party\u2019s property rights against injuries otherwise irremediable. Liquidation of a party\u2019s entries is the final computation or ascertainment of duties accruing on those entries. Once liquidation occurs, it permanently deprives a party of the opportunity to contest Commerce\u2019s results for the administrative review by rendering the party\u2019s cause of action moot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 173 (citations omitted); <em>see Zenith Radio, </em>710 F.2d at 809-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-15\">The Supreme Court in 2008 reversed lower courts for not considering the \u201clikelihood of success on the merits\u201d before ordering a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>preliminary injunction, the demonstration of which is right.\u201d <em>Munaf v. Geren, </em>553 U.S. 674, 128 S. Ct. 2207, 2219, 171 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2008) (internal quotation and citations omitted). The Federal Circuit in 2009 reconciled this concern with preliminary injunctions to prevent liquidation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-4\">The court takes very seriously the Supreme Court\u2019s recent emphasis on the importance of the likelihood of success in the preliminary injunction calculus. But the court also recognizes that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(c)(2) envisions the use of preliminary injunctions in the antidumping context to preserve proper legal options and to allow for a full and fair review of duty determinations before liquidation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\"><em>Qingdao Taifa Group Co. v. United </em>States, 581 F.3d 1375, 1382 (2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">B. This Litigation and Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">Ad Hoc in September 2008 initiated its challenge to numerous Commerce actions that resulted in <em>Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp From Thailand: Final Results and Final Partial Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 50,933 (August 29, 2008) <em>(\u201cFinal Results\u201d). See </em>Complaint. Commerce in that administrative review selected four mandatory respondents by largest volume, including Pakfood. <em>See Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Comm. v. United States, </em>675 F. Supp. 2d 1287, 1292-93 (CIT 2009). Commerce calculated antidumping margins for each of the four mandatory respondents, and the remaining cooperative companies subject to the review received the weighted-average dumping margin. <em>See id. </em>at 1296; <em>Final Results, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 50,937 \u2014 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">Ad Hoc in September 2008 sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin liquidation of the entries covered by the <em>Final Results. </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Consent Motion for Preliminary Injunction to Enjoin Liquidation of Certain Entries. Ad Hoc argued that each preliminary injunction factor favored issuance, <em>id. </em>at 4-9, and Defendant consented to the requested relief despite not conceding the likelihood of Ad Hoc succeeding on the merits, <em>id. </em>at 9. This court granted the preliminary injunction. September 10,2008 Order (\u201cPreliminary Injunction\u201d). The Preliminary Injunction enjoined Commerce and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, \u201cduring the pendency of this action, from liquidating, or causing or permitting liquidation of, any unliquidated entries of certain frozen warmwater shrimp from Thailand that: (1) are covered by [the <em>Final Results </em>];\u201d and \u201c(2) were produced and/or ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>ported by\u201d listed companies that included Pakfood. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. The Preliminary Injunction concluded that \u201centries subject to this injunction shall be liquidated in accordance with the final court decision in this action as provided in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(e).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">Pakfood and other mandatory respondents in the underlying administrative review thereafter entered this action as defendant-intervenors. <em>See, e.g., </em>September 16, 2008 Order. In November 2008, Pakfood moved to sever the first two counts of Ad Hoc\u2019s Complaint from the remaining counts. <em>See </em>Defendant Intervenors\u2019 Motion to Sever Counts I and II of Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint and To Establish These Counts as a Separate Civil Action (\u201cPakfood\u2019s Motion to Sever\u201d). These first two counts, the only that apply to Pakfood,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> challenged the process through which Commerce selected the mandatory respondents and the number of mandatory respondents. <em>See </em>Complaint f \u00b6 9-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">In March 2009, Pakfood\u2019s Motion to Sever was denied, and Ad Hoc\u2019s action was consolidated with a separate challenge to the <em>Final Results </em>initiated by Defendant-intervenors Andaman Seafood Co., Ltd., Chanthaburi Frozen Food Co., Ltd., Chanthaburi Seafoods Co., Ltd., Phatthana Seafood Co., Ltd., Phatthana Frozen Food Co., Ltd., Thailand Fishery Cold Storage Public Co., Ltd., Thai International Sea-foods'Co., Ltd., and Rubicon Resources LLC (collectively, the \u201cRubicon Group\u201d). <em>See </em>March 17, 2009 Order. In December 2009, this court rendered its determination on the consolidation action. <em>Ad Hoc Shrimp, </em>675 F. Supp. 2d 1287. The Rubicon Group\u2019s challenge was voluntarily remanded to Commerce, and every Ad Hoc claim was denied. <em>See id. </em>at 1312. With respect to the first and second counts of Ad Hoc\u2019s Complaint, this court held that Commerce properly selected four mandatory respondents by largest volume and that Ad Hoc failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. <em>See id. </em>at 1298-1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">Pakfood in April 2010 moved for modification of the Preliminary Injunction to exclude Pakfood. <em>See </em>Pakfood\u2019s Prelimin\u00e1ry Injunction Motion. The other defendant-intervenors consented to Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion. <em>See id. </em>at 13. Ad Hoc opposed Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion. <em>See id. </em>Defendant opposed Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion and also filed a consent motion to sever the Rubicon Group\u2019s remanded action from that initiated by Ad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>Hoc. <em>See </em>Defendant\u2019s Response to Pakfood\u2019s Motion to Amend the Court\u2019s Preliminary Injunction; Defendant\u2019s Consent Motion to Sever Cases and to Enter Judgment. This court granted the severance, <em>see </em>April 29,2010 Order, and entered judgment in favor of Defendant and against Ad Hoc, <em>see </em>April 29, 2010 Order and Judgment. In June 2010, Ad Hoc appealed. <em>See </em>Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Preliminary injunctions issued by this court to prevent liquidation pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(c)(2) remain in effect through appeal. <em>See Hosiden Corp. v. Advanced Display Mfrs., </em>85 F.3d 589, 590-91 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\u201c[t]he decision of the Court of International Trade is not a final court decision when appeal has been taken to the Federal Circuit.\u201d). Nevertheless, as explained in the context of a defendant-intervenor\u2019s motion as follows, this court retains the ability to modify its preliminary injunctions in response to changed circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-7\">The court has inherent power and discretion to modify injunctions for changed circumstances. However, the party challenging the preliminary injunction or seeking to modify it must prove that the injunction is unnecessary and should be reconsidered or dissolved. Accordingly, in order to succeed in obtaining a modification of the [Preliminary] Injunction, <em>Defendant-Intervenor must establish a change in circumstances of the parties from the time the injunction was issued that would make the modification necessary. </em>Additionally, the party seeking to modify a preliminary injunction bears the burden of establishing a change in circumstances that would make continuation of the original preliminary injunction inequitable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\"><em>Ad Hoc Shrimp, </em>562 F. Supp. 2d at 1388 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-11\">Pakfood argues that changed circumstances necessitate modification of the Preliminary Injunction to exclude Pakfood. <em>Infra, </em>Part IV.A. Because the possibility exists that the Federal Circuit could remand this action in a manner that requires a change to the anti-dumping margin that Commerce calculated for Pakfood in the <em>Final Results, </em>Pakfood has not carried its burden and the Preliminary Injunction will not be modified. <em>Infra, </em>Part IV.B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>A. Pakfood\u2019s Arguments To Modify The Preliminary Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">Pakfood acknowledges that the Preliminary Injunction was properly issued. <em>See </em>Pakfood\u2019s Reply to Defendant\u2019s and Plaintiff\u2019s Responses to Pakfood\u2019s Motion to Modify the Preliminary Injunction (\u201cPakfood\u2019s Reply\u201d) at 2 (\u201cPakfood agrees that the injunctive relief was appropriate at the time it was ordered.\u201d) (Emphasis omitted). However, Pakfood contends that the manner in which Ad Hoc litigated the first and second counts of its Complaint presents changed circumstances that necessitate modification of the Preliminary Injunction. <em>See id. </em>at 2-5; Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion at 4-10. According to Pakfood, these litigation arguments clarify that Ad Hoc is not seeking relief that could affect the margin calculated for Pakfood in the <em>Final Results. See </em>Pakfood\u2019s Reply at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"AF4\">Ad Hoc\u2019s first count challenged Commerce\u2019s having announced an intention to select mandatory respondents by largest volume as opposed to either by volume or sampling as it had in the past. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 9-13. Pakfood argues that although this count was ambiguous, Ad Hoc clarified in the course of litigation that it only challenged Commerce\u2019s statement of intent as opposed to the legality of Commerce\u2019s respondent selection. Pakfood\u2019s Reply at 3; Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion at 5. Pakfood notes this court\u2019s conclusion that Ad Hoc did not challenge Commerce\u2019s \u201cseparate, final, superceding respondent selection methodology decision.\u201d Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion at 6 n.3 (quoting Ad <em>Hoc Shrimp, </em>675 F. Supp. 2d at 1301 n.9). Pakfood states that \u201cAd Hoc never identified either any harm it had suffered or any relief that the Court might have provided to remedy this unannounced harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. According to Pakfood, Ad Hoc \u201cthrough the course of argumentation\u201d made clear that the relief requested in its first count would not affect the anti-dumping margin calculated for Pakfood in the <em>Final Results. </em>Pak-food\u2019s Reply at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>Ad Hoc\u2019s second count challenged Commerce\u2019s selection of four mandatory respondents. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 14-20. Pakfood argues that although this count was ambiguous, Ad Hoc clarified in the course of litigation that it only challenged Commerce\u2019s selection of more than two or three respondents. <em>See </em>Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion at 8-9. Pakfood explains that its status as the [[relative size ]] exporter by volume in the administrative review establishes that it would be selected as a respondent even if Ad Hoc were to prevail on its appeal of the second count. <em>See id. </em>at 9. According to Pakfood, Ad Hoc has \u201cthrough the course of. . . briefing\u201d made clear that the relief requested in its second count would not affect the antidumping margin calculated for Pakfood in the <em>Final Results. </em>Pakfood\u2019s Reply at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">In addition, Pakfood emphasizes this court\u2019s finding that Ad Hoc had not exhausted its administrative remedies for the first and second counts. Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion at 10-11 (citing <em>Ad Hoc Shrimp, </em>675 F. Supp. 2d at 1299-1303). Pakfood relies upon an instance in which a preliminary injunction to enjoin liquidation was denied because the plaintiff failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 11 (citing <em>Zhanjiang Regal Integrated Marine Res. Co. v. United States, </em>Ct. No. 09-00397, Order (CIT October 27, 2009)). Pakfood asks this court to \u201cconsider Ad Hoc\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to Counts 1 and 2 as part of its reconsideration of the Preliminary Injunction with respect to Pakfood entries.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">B. Pakfood Has Not Established The Requisite Changed Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">Pakfood has not carried its burden of \u201cestablish [ing] a change in circumstances of the parties from the time the injunction was issued that would make the modification necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Ad Hoc Shrimp, </em>562 F. Supp. 2d at 1388. Ad.Hoc is appealing this court\u2019s decision to the Federal Circuit and, as explained below, that appeal could conceivably require a change to the antidumping margin calculated for Pakfood in the <em>Final Results. See </em>Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The severe consequences of liquidating Pakfood\u2019s entries warrant proceeding with caution and maintaining the Preliminary Injunction throughout the pending appeal. <em>See Qingdao Taifa, </em>581 F.3d at 1382 (\u201c19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(c)(2) envisions the use of preliminary injunctions in the anti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>dumping context to preserve proper legal options and to allow for a full and fair review of duty determinations before liquidation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">If the Federal Circuit were to reverse this court\u2019s determination as to Ad Hoc\u2019s first count, it could order a remand that begins the administrative process anew. Pakfood portrays that count as merely asserting a \u201cgeneralized grievance\u201d as to Commerce\u2019s statement of intent to select respondents by volume. Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injuction Motion at 6 (citations omitted). However, the Federal Circuit could find Commerce\u2019s intent to select respondents by volume unlawful so as to render the <em>Final Results </em>void and order a remand through which Commerce employs sampling to select respondents other than Pakfood. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 9-13, 48; 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-l(c). That Pakfood would in this circumstance receive the weighted-average dumping margin belies the assertion that \u201cthere is no possibility that the margin for Pakfood will . . . change based on Plaintiff\u2019s Count 1 arguments.\u201d Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Pakfood\u2019s argument based on Ad Hoc\u2019s first count assumes that the Federal Circuit will agree with this court that Ad Hoc did not preserve its ability to challenge the legality of Commerce\u2019s respondent selection methodology. <em>See </em>Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion at 6 &amp; n. 3. Indeed, Pakfood references this court\u2019s conclusion that Ad hoc \u201cdid not contest final agency action\u201d as support for its request to \u201creconsider whether Ad Hoc ever could have demonstrated a likelihood of success with regard to Count 1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. This conflation of standards is not persuasive because, as previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-6\">the court will not allow Defendant-Intervenor, which is attempting to modify the [Preliminary] Injunction to effectively shift the burden to the plaintiff to reprove the factors for preliminary injunction that have previously been proven to the court\u2019s satisfaction. Rather, the court needs only to examine whether the Defendant-Intervenor has raised circumstances which effectively justify a rehearing of its prior determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\"><em>Ad Hoc Shrimp, </em>562 F. Supp. 2d at 1387.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">Given the possibility that a remand from the Federal Circuit could void the <em>Final Results </em>and restart the administrative process, Pak-food has not \u201craised circumstances which effectively justify a rehearing of\u2019 the Preliminary Injunction. <em>Id. </em>This also applies to Pakfood\u2019s argument based on Ad Hoc\u2019s second count because the Federal Circuit could find Commerce unlawfully selected the number of mandatory respondents, <em>see </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 14-20, 48, and Commerce, on remand, could select respondents through either sampling or largest volume. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number><em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-l(c). Even if Commerce were to once again select respondents by volume, there is no guarantee Pakfood will be selected because \u2014 as Pakfood notes \u2014 Commerce has on occasion selected only one company for review. <em>See </em>Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion at 9 n.5. However unlikely, it is incorrect that \u201cthere is no possibility that the margin for Pakfood ever will change based on Plaintiff\u2019s Count 2 arguments.\u201d Pakfood\u2019s Reply at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-4\">Finally, Pakfood\u2019s reliance on this court\u2019s exhaustion determination reveals its attempt to bootstrap the underlying decision into its requested modification of the Preliminary Injunction. <em>See </em>Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion at 10-11. Because the Federal Circuit may find that Ad Hoc did exhaust its administrative remedies, this court\u2019s exhaustion analysis is not relevant in considering Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion. While the failure to exhaust administrative remedies is considered in assessing the likelihood of success on the merits, Pakfood recognizes that \u201cthe standards for obtaining a preliminary injunction and for modifying a preliminary injunction are not the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. To prevail on its Preliminary Injunction Motion, Pakfood must establish that circumstances have changed that necessitate modification of the Preliminary Injunction to exclude Pakfood. <em>See Ad Hoc Shrimp, </em>562 F. Supp. at 1388. Pakfood has not carried its burden because Ad Hoc\u2019s litigation arguments on the first and second counts of its Complaint do not foreclose the possibility that Commerce could, upon a remand ordered by the Federal Circuit, require a change to the margin calculated for Pakfood in the <em>Final Results.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">Pakfood in essence invites this court to presume that the Federal Circuit will agree with the decision in Ad <em>Hoc Shrimp, </em>675 F. Supp. 2d 1287. This court will not do so because it is \u201cfar from infallible.\u201d <em>Kaplan v. Burroughs Corp., </em>426 F. Supp. 1328, 1336 (N.D. Cal. 1977) (\u201cThere would be no job for the Court of Appeals if I were infallible. The Court of Appeals is set up for the very purpose of correcting errors of the trial courts, and it is expected that a trial judge will make a certain number of errors. . . . [I]f counsel think I made a mistake, they will have a right to appeal to the Court of Appeals and, in some instances, to the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-8\">For the above stated reasons, Pakfood\u2019s Partial Consent Motion to Modify the Preliminary Injunction is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1300-7\"> Ad Hoc\u2019s fourth through ninth counts refer specifically to respondents other than Pakfood. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 25-47. Ad Hoc\u2019s third count, challenging Commerce\u2019s treatment of warehousing expenses as moving expenses, does not apply to Pakfood. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6[\u00b6 21-24; Memorandum from Stephen J. Claeys, Deputy Assistant for Import Administration, to David M. Spooner, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, Re: Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Certain Frozen Warm-water Shrimp from Thailand - February 1, 2006, through January 31, 2007, appended to <em>Final Results, </em>cmt. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1301-12\"> At oral argument, Defendant raised the question of a jurisdictional issue based on Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (\u201cFRAP\u201d) Rule 12.1. <em>See </em>August 17, 2010 Oral Argument at 5:41-6:09; FRAP R. 12.1 (\u201cRemand After an Indicative Ruling by the District Court on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>Motion for Relief that Is Barred by a Pending Appeal.\u201d). FRAP Rule 12.1(a) provides as follows: \u201cIf a timely motion is made in the district court for relief that it lacks the authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, the movant must promptly notify the circuit clerk if the district court states either that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a serious issue.\u201d Any FRAP Rule 12.1 issue is moot because the court is not \u201cgrant[ing]\u201d Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion. FRAP 12.1(a); <em>see </em>August 17, 2010 Oral Argument at 16:18-16:35. Moreover, Pakfood\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Motion does not implicate FRAP Rule 12.1 because in this case the court has the authority to grant the requested modification. FRAP Rule 8(a)(1) provides, in part, that: \u201cA party must ordinarily move first in the district court for . . . (C) an order . . . modifying ... an injunction while an appeal is pending.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1303-7\"> Because Pakfood has not satisfied this threshold requirement, it need not be resolved whether Pakfood has further carried its \u201cburden of establishing a change in circumstances that would make continuation of the original preliminary injunction inequitable.\u201d <em>Ad Hoc Shrimp, </em>562 F.
