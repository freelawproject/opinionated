United States, </em>33 CIT _, 605 F. Supp. 2d 1361 (2009), in which the Court remanded a decision of the United States International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d) which found that revocation of certain antidumping and countervailing duty orders would not be likely to lead to the continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic hot-rolled steel industry. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>See Hot-Rolled Steel Products From Argentina, China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Romania, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, and Ukraine (\u201cFinal Determination\u201d), </em>USITC Pub. 3956, Inv.

The parties allege, <em>inter alia, </em>that the ITC\u2019s negative injury determination in the five-year sunset review of the countervailing duty order on hot-rolled steel products from South Africa and the antidumping duty orders on hot-rolled steel from Kazakhstan, Romania and South Africa was unsupported by substantial evidence. In its opinion, the Court found that the ITC had failed to provide an adequate explanation or substantial evidentiary support for certain findings relating to the likely volume, price effect, and impact of subject imports from the affected countries. As a result, the Court remanded the matter and instructed the Commission to reevaluate and explain more fully its negative injury determination in light of the Court\u2019s findings. <em>See Nucor, </em>33 CIT at _, 605 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1381-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The Court now reviews the Commission\u2019s findings pursuant to the Court\u2019s remand<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u201cRemand Determination\u201d), dated July 8, 2009, in which the ITC\u2019s revocation decision remains unchanged from the <em>Final Determination. </em>Plaintiff, Nucor Corporation (\u201cNucor\u201d) and Plaintiff-Intervenors, United States Steel Corporation (\u201cU.S. Steel\u201d) and AK Steel Corporation (\u201cAK Steel\u201d) (collectively \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d or \u201cDomestic Producers\u201d) assert that the Remand Determination is also unsupported by substantial evidence or otherwise contrary to law and urge the Court to remand the matter for further consideration. The Commission, joined by Amicus, ArcelorMitt\u00e1l USA,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> argues that the decision should be sustained.

Below, the Court provides only that background information specific to the Remand Determination now before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">In August and November of 2001, the Commission unanimously determined that the domestic hot-rolled steel industry was materially injured by reason of subsidized imports of hot-rolled steel from Argentina, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Thailand, and by reason of less than fair value imports of hot-rolled steel from Argentina, China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Romania, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, and Ukraine. <em>See Hot Rolled Steel Products From Argentina and South Africa, </em>Inv. Nos. 701-TA-404 and 731-TA-898 and 905 (Final), USITC Pub. 3446 (Aug. 2001) (PR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>65); <em>Hot-Rolled Steel Products From China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, The Netherlands, Romania, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, and Ukraine, </em>Inv. Nos. 701-TA-405-408 and 731-TA-899-904 and 906-908 (Final), USITC Pub. 3468 (Nov. 2001) (PR 66) (collectively <em>\u201cOriginal Determinations\u201d). </em>Accordingly, between September 2001 and December' 2001, the United States Department of Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d) published countervailing duty orders on hot-rolled steel from Argentina, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Thailand, as well as antidumping duty orders on hot-rolled steel from Argentina, China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Romania, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand and Ukraine. <em>See Final Determination </em>at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">On August 1, 2006, the Commission initiated five-year sunset reviews to determine whether revocation of the countervailing duty and antidumping duty orders on hot-rolled steel products from Argentina,. China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Romania, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand and Ukraine would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic hot-rolled steel industry. <em>See Hot-Rolled Steel Products from Argentina, China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Romania, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, and Ukraine, </em>71 Fed. Reg. 43,521 (Aug. 1, 2006) (PR 3). At the conclusion of the sunset reviews, the Commission determined that revocation of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on hot-rolled steel from China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand and Ukraine would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of material injury. <em>See Final Determination </em>at 3 (PR 453). However, the Commission determined that revocation of the orders on hot-rolled steel from Argentina, Kazakhstan, Romania and South Africa (\u201csubject countries\u201d) would not be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States within a reasonably foreseeable time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Domestic Producers subsequently initiated actions in this Court seeking review of the ITC determinations. On March 9, 2009, after briefing and oral argument the Court remanded the Commission\u2019s negative determinations in part, ordering the ITC to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">(1) reevaluate its flawed reasoning for the finding that Arcelor-Mittal companies and/or Mittal USA would limit subject imports from the subject countries; (2) reassess and further explain the basis for its findings that significant imports in any region of the country are likely to have a disruptive impact on the overall U.S. market, and that any pricing practices that would negatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>impact Mittal USA\u2019s competitors are likely to also impact Mittal USA; (3) reassess and further explain the behavior of Arcelor-Mittal and its predecessor, the Ispat organization, with respect to their business practices in exporting to countries in which they maintain production facilities; (4) reassess and further explain evidence opposed to the ITC\u2019s volume determination, including excess capacity, export orientation of the subject countries\u2019 producers, attractiveness of the U.S. market, and capacity increases in alternative export markets; (5) reassess the potential price effects in accordance with its revised volume determination; and (6) reassess its likely impact analysis in accordance with its revised volume and price effects determinations, and account for and explain the poor performance of the domestic industry in the latter portion of the period of review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><em>See Nucor, </em>33 CIT at _, 605 F. Supp 2d 1361, 1381-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">On remand, the Commission reopened the record with respect to certain issues, inviting parties to offer additional information on matters relating to the remand and submit written comments. <em>See Hot-Rolled Steel Products From Kazakhstan, Romania, and South Africa, </em>Inv. Nos. 701-TA-407 and 731-TA-902, 904, 905 (Review) (Remand) 74 Fed. Reg. 21,821 (May 11, 2009). As much of the Court directed inquiry focused on the business practices of ArcelorMittal, the Commission permitted Mittal USA to participate as a party in the proceeding. The Commission issued its Remand Determination on July 8, 2009, once again finding that revocation of the countervailing duty order on hot-rolled steel from South Africa and the antidumping duty orders on hot-rolled steel from Kazakhstan, Romania and South Africa would not be likely to lead to the continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic industry within a reasonably foreseeable time. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">This Court\u2019s remand instructions were carefully delineated into six areas for further review by the Commission: four involving volume, one involving price effects and one involving likely impact on the domestic industry. <em>See Nucor, </em>33 CIT at _, 605 F. Supp 2d 1361. The Court will hew to that framework in evaluating the Commission\u2019s determination on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>1. <em>ArcelorMittal\u2019s Limitation of Subject Imports</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><em>A. </em>The Commission\u2019s determination on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Pursuant to the Court\u2019s instructions, the Commission specifically examined whether, upon revocation of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders, ArcelorMittal or Mittal USA would limit imports from the subject countries. <em>See Nucor </em>33 CIT at _, 605 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1381. The Commission\u2019s analysis once again led it to the conclusion that ArcelorMittal\u2019s likely behavior with respect to the hot-rolled steel mills it operates in Kazakhstan, Romania and South Africa would not result in significant volumes of subject imports entering the U.S. market. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 10. The Commission relied on information submitted by Arcelormittal, in both the five-year reviews and remand proceeding, as evidence of the firm\u2019s decision to serve the U.S. market principally through its American subsidiary, Mittal USA. <em>See id. </em>According to the ITC, this strategy of constraining imports in furtherance of maximizing domestic production did in fact serve to maintain price stability and promote Arcelormittal\u2019s overall corporate interests. <em>See </em>Defendant\u2019s Rebuttal to Plaintiff\u2019s Comments on Remand Determination (\u201cITC Rebuttal Comments\u201d) at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">B. Parties\u2019Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The Commission argues that ArcelorMittal\u2019s strategy for its subsidiaries to supply home and regional markets, and not to serve export markets where the company is a producer, limits the motivation of the subject producers in Kazakhstan, Romania and South Africa to significantly increase shipments to the U.S. market.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As support for this position, Defendant points to the substantial investment ArcelorMittal has made in its subsidiary, Mittal USA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Mittal USA accounts for such a large segment of ArcelorMittal\u2019s production overall, and in light of the domestic producer\u2019s prominence in the U.S. market, the Commission concludes, it is in ArcelorMittal\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>best interests to limit the amount of imports of hot-rolled steel. Similarly, the ITC points to the decision by ArcelorMittal to provide Mittal USA with the right to veto any imports from other ArcelorMit-tal facilities, and its policy of serving the U.S. market principally through Mittal USA. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 10. Inasmuch as the production of hot-rolled steel in the subject countries is controlled entirely by ArcelorMittal, these practices, according to the Commission, \u201cserve as a powerful deterrent to significant volumes of subject imports entering the U.S.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Specifically, the Commission relies on statements from two of Ar-celorMittal\u2019s corporate officers. The first, Louis L. Schorsch, the company\u2019s president and chief executive officer, provided testimony during-the hearing describing the approval required for the entry of merchandise from other ArcelorMittal mills.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Administrative Record, Tr. at 218-19 (PR 253). The second, an affidavit from [\u00b6] ]] discusses the factors ArcelorMittal considers in deciding whether or not to export to the United States merchandise produced in overseas ArcelorMittal facilities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ArcelorMittal Factual Submission on Remand, Ex. 8, \u00b6 5 (CR 433R). In addition, the ITC identifies empirical data from the importer questionnaires which indicate that U.S. hot-rolled steel imports by ArcelorMittal decreased noticeably subsequent to the merger of Arcelor SA and Mittal Steel Co. NV. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 12. This, says the Commission, is the effect of ArcelorMit-tal\u2019s corporate strategy which perceived that maintaining the profitability and market share of Mittal USA was in its overall interest. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In response to Plaintiffs\u2019 theoretic\u00e1l model showing how Arcelor-Mittal would likely benefit from subject imports even if doing so caused harm to Mittal USA, the Commission found this scenario \u201clacking in probative value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Citing the lack of any documentation to support the figures reported, the ITC argues that even a slight variation of these figures results in adverse financial consequences for ArcelorMittal. Moreover, the ITC points to the difficulty in precisely gauging the price effects of subject imports in such a manner as to calculate accurately the level of imports necessary to achieve such a favorable result. <em>See id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>By contrast, Plaintiffs argue that the record does not support the premise that ArcelorMittal will restrain subject imports from lower production cost facilities if such imports would maximize overall corporate profits. <em>See </em>Nucor Corporation\u2019s Comments on Remand Determination (\u201cNucor Comments\u201d) at 9. As Plaintiffs recite the record, the evidence demonstrates that if ArcelorMittal can produce and sell steel for consumption in the U.S. more profitably through its mills overseas, \u201cthereby increasing company-wide profits, it will do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to this theory, any potential harm to Mittal USA would be outweighed by the benefit to Arcelormittal\u2019s overall operations. Plaintiffs argue that it is a core principal of the director/officer\u2019s fiduciary duty to maximize profits of the entire company for the benefit of its shareholders. <em>See </em>id. This basic tenet of corporate law is discussed in two affidavits submitted by Plaintiffs. The first, [\u00b6] ]] discusses the obligation a corporate officer has to his shareholders, which is the maximization of corporate profits even at the expense of one of its subsidiaries. <em>See </em>Nucor Factual Submission on Remand, Attachment 1, Affidavit of [\u00b6] ]] \u00b6 3 (CR 434R) (\u201cI have never witnessed a company make a decision that benefits its subsidiary at a cost to overall operational profits.\u201d) The second, Michael Meyers, the general manager of sales of U.S. Steel, speaks to the \u201cimperative that the producer do what is in the best interest of its overall operation, not that of each affiliated entity.\u201d Nucor Comments at 10; U.S. Steel Factual Submission on Remand, Affidavit of Michael Meyers, \u00b6 5 (CR 435R). Thus, according to Plaintiffs, \u201ca rational business model requires companies to maximize profits for the entire enterprise, rather than protecting one business unit at the expense of total corporate profits.\u201d Nucor Comments at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In support of this assertion, U.S. Steel presented two hypothetical profit maximization scenarios purporting to show how ArcelorMittal could serve its overall corporate interest by importing hot-rolled steel from the subject countries, while concomitantly causing U.S. prices to fall. <em>See </em>Comments on the Remand Determination Filed by United States Steel Corporation (\u201cU.S. Steel Comments\u201d) at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">During a five-year review, the ITC determines whether revocation of an antidumping or countervailing duty order \u201cwould be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury within a reasonably foreseeable time.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(1). In making this decision, the Commission \u201cis required to consider whether the likely volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject merchandise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>on the industry will be significant if an order is revoked.\u201d <em>United States Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>32 CIT _, 572 F. Supp. 2d 1334, 1341 (2008) (internal citation omitted). Plaintiffs argue that the ITC made several erroneous findings which it contends are not supported by substantial evidence. U.S. Steel and Nucor attack the substanti-ality of the Commission\u2019s likely volume determination by offering their own evidence in support of an alternative result. Essentially, Plaintiffs claim that the testimony on which they rely is a more adequate basis from which to draw a conclusion. The task for the reviewing court, however, is not to evaluate the evidence the Commission collects during its review, or to decide the weight to be assigned to a particular piece of evidence. <em>See United States Steel Group v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1996). It is the Commission\u2019s task to evaluate the evidence it collects in conducting an investigation or review, and \u201ccertain decisions, such as the weight to be assigned a particular piece of evidence, lie at the core of that evaluative process.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In the case at bar, the Commission acted within its discretionary-authority when it discounted the probative value of Plaintiffs\u2019 profit maximization scenarios. On the basis of the data that was compiled with respect to the risk of adverse price effects on the circumstances of Plaintiffs\u2019 hypothetical, the Commission evaluated the competing economic data to reach a well-supported conclusion. The risk of adverse price effects may well be considered high in instances, such as the one here, where there is a high degree of interchangeability between hot-rolled steel from a variety of sources. Thus, the likelihood that prices could be driven to a point that would adversely affect both ArcelorMittal and Mittal USA is significant. In addition, the Commission now points to data from the importer questionnaires which reveal that imports from ArcelorMittal mills overseas were noticeably [\u00b6] ]] in interim 2007 than in interim 2006. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 12 n.45; <em>see also </em>Mittal Steel NA, Importer Questionnaire at 11-13 (CR 155); Arcelor International, Importer Questionnaire at 10-11 (CR 137). Such evidence is consistent with Defendant\u2019s argument concerning the effects of ArcelorMit-tal\u2019s corporate policy of providing Mittal USA with the right to veto any imports from other ArcelorMittal production facilities. While it is true, as Plaintiffs point out,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that there are circumstances under which ArcelorMittal could conceivably increase its overall profits in the U.S. market even if doing so caused harm to Mittal USA, the mere plausibility of a set of given circumstances is insufficient to overcome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the high barrier to reversal of an agency determination. ArcelorMit-tal\u2019s fiduciary obligations to its shareholders and its role as corporate parent are not mutually exclusive. The welfare of one does not inevitably result in the demise of the other, and Plaintiffs\u2019 have offered only innuendo and speculation as evidence to the contrary. The ITC\u2019s reliance on testimony from ArcelorMittal officials about the policies and practices of which these witnesses have first hand knowledge cannot be considered unreasonable. Therefore, all the agency has done is reach an alternate conclusion based upon data it has assigned greater evidentiary weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">In its prior opinion, the Court voiced concerns over the sufficiency of the ITC\u2019s explanation for its findings on ArcelorMittal\u2019s likely behavior upon revocation of the orders at issue here. On remand, however, the Commission has proffered additional grounds on which it based its original decision. This explanation is sufficient to meet the ITC\u2019s burden of offering a rational basis between the facts found and the choices made. Accordingly, the Court finds the Commission\u2019s determination, in this regard, to be supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">2. <em>Regional Imports and Pricing Practices</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\"><em>A. </em>The Commission\u2019s Determination on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">This Court previously objected to the basis cited for the Commission\u2019s determination that significant imports into any region of the country are likely to have a disruptive impact on the overall U.S. market, and that any price impact on Mittal USA\u2019s competitors would also negatively impact Mittal USA. <em>Nucor, </em>33 CIT at _, 605 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1379. The Court explained that the \u201conly data\u201d cited by the Commission in support of its conclusions was \u201ca chart listing producers and importers by region,\u201d and that with nothing more to rely upon, the Commission\u2019s volume determination could not be sustained. <em>Id. (citing Final Determination </em>at Table II \u2014 1 (PR 453)). The Court also pointed to the testimony of \u201can executive of ArcelorMittal that its imports may affect competitors in this market who are in different geographies or serve different market segments, and so on.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court instructed the Commission to reassess and farther substantiate its findings. <em>Id. </em>33 CIT at _, 605 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">On remand, the Commission explained that the record does not reveal any regional markets within the United States to which Arce-lorMittal could direct subject imports while maintaining stability in the U.S. market overall and protecting its domestic subsidiary from harm. Remand Determination at 17. The Commission obtained addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>tional information from Mittal USA during the remand proceeding and concluded that \u201cthe record does not indicate any gaps in Mittal USA\u2019s geographic coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\">Additionally, the Commission obtained nationwide pricing data for hot-rolled steel and determined that while prices in the United States show some regional variation (owing to freight costs and distances between producers and purchasers), the prices in the different regions show a high degree of correlation. <em>Id. </em>at 19. The Commission therefore concluded that even if ArcelorMittal were to bring subject imports to a region of the United States where Mittal USA does not produce hot-rolled steel, \u201cany significant influx of imports into a particular region that would cause a regional price dislocation would affect prices nationwide \u2014 including those in the regions where Mittal USA does operate mills.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Finally, the Commission again considered whether there was any evidence that ArcelorMittal might manufacture niche products in the subject countries that it could import to compete with Mittal USA\u2019s competitors. In concluding that this was unlikely, the ITC pointed to three pieces of evidence. First, in the <em>Final Determination, </em>the ITC found a high degree of interchangeability between the products, regardless of source. <em>Id. </em>at 21. Second, there were no purchasers of hot-rolled steel that indicated in response to ITC questionnaires that Kazakhstan, Romania or South Africa were the source of any unique niche products. <em>Id. </em>Finally, witnesses for Nucor and U.S. Steel could not identify any niche products that ArcelorMittal is manufacturing in the subject countries. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">B. Parties\u2019 Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In response, Plaintiffs point to the testimony of witnesses Louis Schorsch and [\u00b6] ]]. Schorsch testified that subject imports \u201cmay affect competitors in this market who are in different geographies or serve different market segments, and so on.\u201d Nucor Comments \u2022 at 13; U.S. Steel Comments at 20. Whereas [\u00b6] ]] suggested that ArcelorMittal is capable of supplying particular market segments or geographic regions that Mittal USA would be unable to supply. Nucor Comments at 13; U.S. Steel Comments at 20-21. Plaintiffs are of the opinion that these statements work as something of an admission against interest by ArcelorMittal, and should be dispositive on the ITC\u2019s likely volume determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Both Nucor and U.S. Steel, once again, rely on the hypothetical scenarios purporting to show how ArcelorMittal could benefit financially from importing subject goods, in spite of having a large domestic presence in the U.S. market. Nucor Comments at 15; U.S. Steel Comments at 25. Nucor also emphasized that a \u201clarge percentage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Mittal USA\u2019s domestic sales are sold on a contract basis.\u201d Nucor Comments at 16. Nucor reasoned that if a [\u00b6] ]] amount of production by Mittal USA is already accounted for by long-term contracts, then Mittal USA is only competing on the spot market for a portion of its overall production, making it easier to import subject goods without harming itself. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Friend of the Court Mittal USA rebuts Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments by invoking the pricing data and customer list Mittal USA provided to the Commission on remand which demonstrated \u201clargely identical\u201d prices by region, and a \u201cwidespread\u201d customer base. ArcelorMittal USA Rebuttal Comments (\u201cMittal USA Rebuttal Comments\u201d) at 8. Mittal USA also provided evidence of its \u201cactual business practices\u201d of \u201censuring] that prices in a geographic region that might be served by imports of an affiliate were consistent with prices in other regions in which Mittal Steel USA was selling, and did not disrupt U.S. market prices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Defendant, ITC, rebuts Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments by pointing out that it explicitly considered the testimony of the two ArcelorMittal executives in its Remand Determination. ITC Rebuttal Comments at 16 <em>(citing </em>Remand Determination at 17). Defendant points out that neither of the witnesses affirmatively declared that there <em>were </em>\u201cU.S. regional markets or specialty products that Mittal USA could not serve or supply,\u201d but instead had phrased their comments \u201cin the conditional.\u201d Id. The Commission also defended its consideration of the niche products argument by pointing out that neither Nucor nor U.S. Steel identified \u201cany hot-rolled steel products that they produce, but Mittal USA does not.\u201d Id. at 20. The ITC found this inability of Plaintiff and Plaintiff-Intervenor to be weighty, and thereby concluded that \u201cthere are no such actual products.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The Court finds that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Commission\u2019s finding that significant imports in any region of the country are likely to have a disruptive impact on the overall U.S. market. The strongest evidence that the ITC points to in support of this finding consists of pricing data submitted by Mittal USA on remand. The ITC analyzed the regional price data in pairs, and concluded that the correlation coefficient for prices between the West and Midwest, the Midwest and Gulf, and the Gulf and the West, each exceeded 0.98, respectively. Remand Determination at 20 n.69. It is true that the ITC\u2019s analysis does not include any empirical historical observation of the actual national price effect of some burst of regionally-confined imports in the past. As such, it would be difficult to state with absolute certainty what effect an influx of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>regionally-confined imports would have on nationwide prices. However, the Commission did not attempt to make such a bold prognostication. Instead, it merely concluded that \u201cany significant influx of imports into a particular region <em>that would cause </em>a regional price dislocation <em>would affect </em>prices nationwide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20 (emphasis added). The Court finds that a reasonable mind would accept the high level of correlation between regional prices as adequate support for this conclusion, formed as a conditional statement, and therefore constitutes substantial evidence within the meaning of the standard of review. <em>See Huaiyin Foreign Trade Corp., </em>322 F.3d at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\">The Court finds that there is also substantial evidence in the record to support the Commission\u2019s finding that pricing practices that would negatively impact Mittal USA\u2019s competitors are likely also to impact Mittal USA. Specifically, the Court notes the evidence indicating that there are no regional markets in the United States to which Arcelor-Mittal could direct imports while maintaining stability in the U.S. market and protecting its domestic subsidiary from harm. On remand, Mittal USA submitted a chart purporting to show domestic shipments of hot rolled steel more than 1000 miles from Chicago. <em>See </em>ArcelorMittal Factual Submission on Remand, Ex. 6, (CR 433R). This chart indicates that between 2005 and the first quarter of 2007, Mittal USA shipped hot rolled steel to 12 continental states that have some portion of land further than 1000 miles from Chicago. <em>See id. </em>The chart clearly indicates that Mittal USA\u2019s domestic shipments reach all regions of the United States. The Court further notes the Producers\u2019 Questionnaire, filled out by Mittal USA, explicitly indicates that every geographic market area in the United States is served by the firm\u2019s hot-rolled steel. <em>See </em>Mittal USA Producers\u2019 Questionnaire, Part IV-B-9 (CR 126). The Court finds that taken together, the questionnaire response and chart constitute more than a mere scintilla of evidence in support of the ITC\u2019s conclusion that there are no regions of the U.S. where ArcelorMittal could import hot rolled steel, to which Mittal USA does not already ship domestically. <em>See Altx, Inc., </em>370 F.3d at 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The Court also finds that the arguments advanced by Plaintiff and Plaintiff-Intervenor do not effectively undermine the Commission\u2019s conclusion. Specifically, the ITC has given appropriate consideration to the testimony of Louis Schorsch and the affidavit of [\u00b6] ]] which are the subject of much ado by Plaintiffs. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 16-17. Not only is it inappropriate for the Court to re-weigh this evidence, or to require the ITC to do so, but when the statements are viewed in context, it is clear that they do not amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>to the veritable admissions against interest as Plaintiffs suggest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As for Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that \u201ca large percentage\u201d of Mittal USA\u2019s sales are made pursuant to contract, and therefore do not compete on the spot market; the Court notes Plaintiffs\u2019 own concession that, \u201clarge percentage\u201d or not, [\u00b6] ]] of Mittal USA\u2019s sales <em>do </em>compete on the spot market \u2014 a percentage large enough to ensure Mittal USA\u2019s ongoing concern with spot market prices. Nucor Comments at 16. In sum, the Court sustains this aspect of the ITC\u2019s volume determination as supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">3. <em>Prior Business Practices</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">A. The Commission\u2019s Determination on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In its remand instructions, the Court required the Defendant to further explain the behavior of ArcelorMittal and its predecessor company, Ispat International, with respect to their past practice of exporting to countries in which they maintained production facilities.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consistent with its earlier findings, the Commission determined that the record does not support an inference that ArcelorMit-tal will likely make significant shipments of hot-rolled steel from its low cost production facilities into the U.S. market. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 26. Unlike its previous position, however, the ITC does not rely solely on a market share analysis of Ispat and its affiliates. Instead, the Defendant identifies changes in the policy, structure and export trends of the ArcelorMittal organization since the original period of investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">B. Parties\u2019 Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">On remand, the Commission offers three distinct evidentiary points as the basis for its determination. First, Arcelormittal exerts a more centralized system of control over its exports from affiliated producers than did its predecessor Ispat International. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 23. According to the ITC, this is an important change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the evolution of Mittal USA and distinguishes its practices from those of Ispat. After the formation of ArcelorMittal the newly formed entity continued the policy, [\u00b6] ]] of not using third-party trading companies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>Prior to the adoption of this policy, whereby Ispat \u2014 and ultimately ArcelorMittal \u2014 became the solitary sales agent for corporate affiliates abroad, imports of subject merchandise from these affiliates were not controlled by the corporate parent. <em>See id. </em>The efficacy of this policy, argues Defendant, is evidenced by the decrease in quantity of hot-rolled steel imported by Ispat from Kazakhstan 'during the original period of investigation. Because Ispat was responsible for approximately [\u00b6] ]] of the imports from Kazakhstan in 1998, but only [\u00b6] ]] of those imports in 2000, the increase in subject imports during the original period of investigation was due not to Ispat, but rather the third-party traders that the new corporate policy was intended to eliminate. <em>Compare </em>Final Staff Report at Table 1-1 (CR 376) (U.S. import data from Kazakhstan during original period of investigation), with ArcelorMittal Factual Submission on Remand, Ex. 5 (CR 433R) (breakdown of hot-rolled steel imports from Kazakhstan by Ispat during the original period of investigation); <em>see also </em>Remand Determination at 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Second, the Commission restates its previous position that Mittal USA has a [\u00b6] ]] larger presence in the U.S. market than did Ispat Inland, and that this larger market share provides a strong incentive to strictly adhere to its stated policy of maintaining market stability through the restriction of imports from affiliated producers. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Finally, in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions, the ITC examined the pattern of Mittal USA\u2019s exports to Western Europe in light of the presence of other ArcelorMittal production facilities. The ITC can identify only one shipment of hot-rolled steel to a European country in which ArcelorMittal maintained a presence, a single 12,000 ton shipment to Belgium.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 25. Therefore, the Commission argues, the record does not support the inference that ArcelorMittal will likely export significant shipments of subject merchandise to countries in which it operates hot-rolled steel production facilities. <em>See id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">In Plaintiffs\u2019 first assertion of error, they posit that the behavior of the Ispat organization prior to the assignment of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders is \u201cfar more probative\u201d of ArcelorMit-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>tal\u2019s future behavior than crediting a policy instituted after the orders were put in place. U.S. Steel Comments at 28. Therefore, Plaintiffs argue, the Commission is in error to give more weight to policies made effective after the institution of relief as opposed to those actions taken when the subject countries had unlimited access to the U.S. market \u2014 a condition that would be replicated if the orders are revoked. <em>See id. </em>For example, the 47.7 percent increase in imports of hot-rolled steel by Ispat from Kazakhstan, during the original period of investigation, is identified by Plaintiffs as evidence of the likely future behavior of ArcelorMittal based upon the theory that should the orders be revoked, ArcelorMittal will similarly increase the volume of hot-rolled steel exported to the U.S. market. <em>See </em>Nucor Comments at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Next, Plaintiffs challenge the ITC\u2019s conclusion that the record is limited to only one specific instance in which ArcelorMittal exported hot-rolled steel to a European country wherein it maintained a production facility. As alleged by Plaintiffs, \u201cthe record actually contains very significant evidence about Mittal USA\u2019s exports to Europe.\u201d U.S. Steel Comments at 29. The evidence to which Plaintiffs refer includes two press releases; one in which Mittal USA acknowledges the previously identified 12,000 ton shipment to Belgium; and another describing Mittal USA\u2019s intention to become an active exporter of steel. <em>See </em>U.S. Steel\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, Ex\u2019s. 15, 16 (PR 328). The third piece of evidence Plaintiffs cite to is the testimony of Louis Schorsch who speaks briefly about exports to Western Europe. <em>See </em>Administrative Record, Tr. at 334 (PR 253). Plaintiffs suggest that this evidence is indicative of ArcelorMittal\u2019s intention to take advantage of the relatively attractive market conditions in the U.S. even if that market contains another ArcelorMittal facility. <em>See </em>U.S. Steel Comments at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Lastly, Plaintiffs discount the Commission\u2019s reiteration of its market analysis claim, arguing that it is essentially the same explanation rejected by the Court in its previous opinion. <em>See </em>U.S. Steel Comments at 27; Nucor Comments at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AQx\">In evaluating whether the likely volume of subject imports will contribute to the recurrence or continuation of material injury within a reasonably foreseeable time, the ITC is statutorily required to take into account numerous factors including its previous injury determination conducted prior to the order being issued. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(1)(A). As the Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the statute explains, the purpose of this inquiry is to examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>the most recent period of time in which subject imports competed without the discipline of an antidumping or countervailing order in place. <em>See </em>Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Statement of Administrative Action (\u201cSAA\u201d), H.R. 5110 (H.R. Doc. No. 103-316), <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4040, 4209. Section 1675a(a)(1)(A) does not, however, require a \u201cfull blown reconsideration\u201d of the original injury determination in a sunset review. <em>See Consolidated Fibers, Inc. v. United States, </em>30 CIT 1820, 1823, 465 F. Supp. 2d 1338, 1341 (2006). Instead, that provision simply requires the Commission take into account its findings as to volume, price, and impact of subject imports prior to the institution of an order. Neither the statute nor its legislative history direct the ITC to distinguish every factor of its original investigation findings from those made in a sunset review. Presently, the ITC did not disregard the findings from its original investigation, but rather cited to .such findings repeatedly. <em>See, e.g., </em>Remand Determination at 22-25. The Commission discussed its negative determination in terms of the likely volume of imports from the subject countries while incorporating and distinguishing various aspects of the original investigation. <em>See id. </em>at 21-26. Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the behavior of ArcelorMittal\u2019s predecessor, Ispat, is far more probative than the current practices of the corporation and its affiliates, merely replicates their previous position urging the Court to re-weigh the evidence considered by the Commission. Once again, the Court is disinclined to accept Plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to displace the agency\u2019s interpretation of that evidence with its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The Court rejects Plaintiffs\u2019 argument on additional grounds. Namely, that they have pointed to no evidence impeaching the credibility of the data relied on by the Commission. Other than the single 12,000 ton shipment to Belgium, the press reports cited by Plaintiffs make no mention of any actual exports of hot-rolled steel to a country with an ArcelorMittal affiliate. At most, the statements relied upon by Plaintiffs indicate a willingness on the part of Mittal USA to expand its export activity to parts of Western Europe, which may or may not include countries in which ArcelorMittal has a production facility. Such vague and circumstantial evidence is simply insufficient to overcome Plaintiffs\u2019 high burden in this case. In this way, the witness testimony, e-mail correspondence and producer\u2019s questionnaire utilized by the Commission in making its determination must preponderate. Accordingly, the Court holds that the ITC adequately investigated and explained the basis for its finding that the prior business practices of ArcelorMittal\u2019s predecessor, Ispat International, do not support an inference that ArcelorMittal will likely make significant export shipments to other countries in which it operates hot-rolled steel production facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>4. <em>Neglected Volume Considerations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">A. The Commission\u2019s Determination on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">This Court previously found that there were several pieces of evidence in the record that had not been properly considered by the Commission in its initial sunset review determination, and that if considered, may have weighed against revoking the relevant orders. On remand, the ITC was instructed to \u201creassess and further explain evidence opposed to the ITC\u2019s volume determination, including excess capacity, export orientation of the Mittal Countries\u2019 producers, attractiveness of the U.S. market, and capacity increases in alternative export markets.\u201d <em>Nucor, </em>33 CIT at _, 605 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">With respect to excess capacity of the subject countries, the Commission determined that while the Court had correctly identified excess capacity at the end of the period of review, it was not persuaded that the subject producers could or would utilize that capacity. Remand Determination at 26-27. In support, the Commission pointed out that through the duration of the period of investigation and the period of review, capacity utilization remained well below maximum. <em>Id. </em>at 27. On this basis, the Commission concluded that the subject producers\u2019 excess capacity is nothing more than \u201ctheoretical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission also concluded that \u201cArcelorMittal lacks the incentive to increase capacity utilization ... in light of its corporate policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. Moreover, the excess capacity of the subject countries is [\u00b6] ]] and Mittal USA has shown higher levels of capacity utilization as well. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">With respect to export orientation of the subject countries, the ITC found that exports, when viewed as a proportion of total shipments, remained \u201crelatively stable throughout the period of review, ranging between [\u00b6] ]] percent and [\u00b6] ]] percent during the six calendar years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28-29. The Commission found that these percentages did not \u201csignify that the subject industries are heavily export-oriented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. The ITC also noted that the majority of these subject producers\u2019 exports were directed to regions outside the U.S.: from Kazakh and Romanian producers to [\u00b6] ]], from Romania to [\u00b6] ]], and from South Africa [\u00b6] ]] <em>Id. </em>at 29 n.104.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">With respect to the attractiveness of the U.S. market, the Commission included a footnote in its remand determination acknowledging that the U.S. market has a \u201crelatively open nature\u201d and \u201chigher prices than some other world markets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29 n.105. However, the Commission reasoned that in light of ArcelorMittal\u2019s U.S. and Canadian operations and stated corporate policies, the attractiveness of the U.S. market was unlikely to incentivize the subject producers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>target the U.S. market. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">With respect to capacity increases in export markets, specifically China, the ITC\u2019s finding was twofold. First, China had not been a primary export market for any of the subject producers before it shifted from being a net-importer to being a net-exporter, so the subject countries did not lose an export market as a result of China\u2019s shift. <em>Id. </em>at 29. Second, the ITC found that the subject countries\u2019 primary export markets were not in southeast Asia, where it reasoned China would be directing most of its exports. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the ITC determined that the subject countries did not face increased competition from China as a result of China\u2019s shift in status from net-importer to net-exporter. <em>Id. </em>at 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">B. Parties\u2019Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Plaintiffs focus their remand comments on excess capacity by highlighting what appears to be large excess capacity in the subject countries. Nucor points out that the subject countries experienced a \u201cnearly [\u00b6] ]] increase in capacity\u201d during the period of review, which, in absolute terms, is \u201c[[ ]] volume of subject imports from the Mittal Countries during the last year of the period of investigation.\u201d Nucor Comments at 20. Accordingly, Nucor asserts that the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the subject countries have experienced \u201c\u2018at most incremental growth in capacity and incremental declines in capacity utilization in the subject countries,\u201d\u2019 is fallacious. <em>Id. (quoting </em>Remand Determination at 8); <em>see also </em>U.S. Steel Comments at 31-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Nucor also takes issue with the Commission\u2019s characterization of the subject countries\u2019 excess capacity as merely \u201ctheoretical.\u201d Nucor Comments at 21. Nucor argues that data relating to excess capacity was obtained by questionnaires which \u201cspecifically instructed the Mittal country producers to report actual, not theoretical, capacity, and [that] there is no evidence to suggest that they did not report actual capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>U.S. Steel points out that the questionnaire instructions specifically request that the respondent provide \u201c\u2018[t]he level of production that [the producer] could reasonably have expected to attain during the specified periods.\u2019\u201d U.S. Steel Comments at 15 <em>(quoting </em>Foreign Producer Questionnaire Instructions at 8 (PR 132)).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Nucor and U.S. Steel also both push back on the Commission\u2019s finding about the export orientation of the subject countries. Nucor argues that Romania, Kazakhstan and South Africa export a \u201c[[ ]] of total shipments than [\u00b6] ]] and [that] in its affirmative determination for China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Thailand, and Ukraine, the Commission relied on subject producers\u2019 export orientation to support continuation of the orders.\u201d Nucor Comments at 22-23. Nucor claims that it is \u201carbitrary for the Commission to cite a particular factor in support of continuation in one instance, but discount it entirely in another wherein the evidence in support is greater.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. U.S. Steel argues that the figures the Commission identified as reflecting the proportion of subject producers\u2019 export shipments to total shipments ([[ ]] percent), are misleading because [\u00b6] ]] U.S. Steel Comments at 32-33. U.S. Steel claims that the proportion of export shipments to commercial shipments suggests [\u00b6] ]] <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">With respect to the attractiveness of the U.S. market, U.S. Steel charges that the extent of the Commission\u2019s treatment of this issue \u2014 a footnote \u2014 is insufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 33-34. And last, U.S. Steel challenges the Commission\u2019s remand determination on the capacity increases of alternative export markets, namely, China. U.S. Steel claims that in 2006, [\u00b6] ]] percent of exports from the subject producers \u201cwent to Asian markets other than China.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35. In the same year, of \u201cthe Chinese producers who responded to the Commission\u2019s questionnaire\u201d 57.7 percent of their exports were shipped to this same market. <em>Id. </em>U.S. Steel thereby concludes that Chinese producers are focused on a market that is critical to producers in the Mittal Countries. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">In its rebuttal comments, the Commission reiterated that during the nine-year period examined by the ITC, [\u00b6] ]] tons of excess capacity in the subject countries was never utilized. ITC Rebuttal Comments at 26. The ITC also acknowledged that U.S. Steel is correct in pointing out that a relatively large portion of the subject countries\u2019 shipments were exports, but pointed out that this proportion of exports during the period of review remained \u201crelatively stable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission attempted to defend its characterization of the subject countries\u2019 excess capacity as \u201ctheoretical\u201d by emphasizing that in using that term, it only meant to draw attention to the fact that the subject producers have no history of operating at full capacity, and are unlikely to do so in the near future. <em>Id. </em>at 27. Moreover, the ITC asserts that the mere existence of excess capacity in the subject producers \u201cis insufficient to mandate a finding of significant likely subject import volume.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28 <em>(citing Nucor Corp. v. United States, </em>32 CIT _, 569 F. Supp. 2d 1328, 1349 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">With respect to U.S. Steel\u2019s arguments about the effect of China on the subject producers, the ITC points out that it considered China\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>production extensively, and determined that the subject producers\u2019 exports to third countries were not affected by increasing exports from China. <em>Id. </em>at 28-29. The Commission also extensively and repeatedly emphasized its belief that ArcelorMittal will abid,e by corporate policies to have producers focus on local markets, to limit production to promote market stability, and to permit Mittal USA veto power over subject imports. <em>See generally id. </em>at 26-31. The Commission concludes by accusing Nucor and U.S. Steel of wanting the Court to do nothing more than re-weigh the evidence that the Commission already considered. <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The Court shares Plaintiffs\u2019 concerns about the Commission\u2019s characterization of the excess capacity of the subject countries as \u201ctheoretical,\u201d to the extent that this suggests that subject producers are incapable of utilizing the excess capacity that they have reported. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 27. As U.S. Steel pointed out, the subject producers were explicitly instructed to provide data about the level of production that the producer \u201ccould reasonably have expected to maintain during the specified periods.\u201d Foreign Producer Questionnaire Instructions at 9. Moreover, closer inspection of the Foreign Producer Questionnaire responses provided by the Mittal affiliated producers in Romania, South Africa and Kazakhstan confirms that all three producers complied with that instruction. In their responses, each Mittal affiliated subject producer indicated that production capacity had been adjusted downward to take into account lost production time due to planned and unplanned repairs, delays, maintenance and other shutdowns. <em>See </em>Foreign Producer Questionnaire of Mittal Steel Galati at Ex. 3 (CR 113); Foreign Producer Questionnaire of Mittal Steel South Africa at 23 (CR 78); and Foreign Producer Questionnaire of Temirtau at 15 (CR 145). In light of what appear to be carefully calculated responses, the ITC\u2019s characterization of subject producer excess capacity as merely \u201ctheoretical\u201d is problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Presumably, the purpose of the Commission\u2019s query into subject producer excess capacity during a sunset review is to determine whether the subject producers would be capable of ramping up production if the orders are permitted to expire. While a report of little or no excess capacity would weigh in favor of permitting the anti-dumping orders to sunset, a report of significant excess capacity may be a legitimate cause of concern for the domestic industry. The Commission should not seek to diminish the weight of reported subject producer excess capacity by characterizing it as \u201ctheoretical,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>thereby implying that the subject producers are somehow incapable of utilizing their reported unused capacity. The numbers speak for themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Nevertheless, the Court\u2019s objection is primarily with the Commission\u2019s terminology. The excess capacity figures do not suggest that the subject producers are <em>incapable </em>of expanding output, but when considered in light of historically low capacity utilization rates, there is reason to believe that the subject producers are <em>unlikely </em>to expand output, even upon revocation of the orders. Moreover, the Court also finds significant that the scale of the subject producers\u2019 excess capacity is [\u00b6] ]] by the excess capacity of Mittal USA. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 28. Given ArcelorMittal\u2019s policy to source locally, these figures support the Commission\u2019s conclusion that dumping or injury is not likely to recur if the orders are revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">With respect to export orientation of the subject producers, the Court finds that the arguments of Plaintiff and Plaintiff-Intervenor are ineffective. First, U.S. Steel\u2019s contention that the percentages cited by the Commission [\u00b6] ]] rather than of total shipments, as the Commission claims, is untrue. <em>See </em>U.S. Steel Comments at 32. Based on the data found in the Final Staff Report at Tables IV \u2014 31, IV \u2014 35, and IV-40, the Court finds that the percentage of exports as a share of total shipments does, indeed, range from [\u00b6] ]] percent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, U.S. Steel fails to offer a compelling reason why this figure does not accurately represent the extent to which the subject producers are export oriented, and why the better ratio to consider is total exports to total commercial shipments. Surely, the volume of production that is internally consumed is pertinent to the question of how export-oriented a particular producer is.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Turning to Plaintiff\u2019s concerns regarding export orientation, the Court is similarly unconvinced. Plaintiff is correct that in the Commission\u2019s initial sunset review determination, the ITC referred to the hot-rolled steel industries of Kazakhstan, Romania, and South Africa, along with the six other countries for which antidumping orders remained in place, as \u201cexport [ing] a large percentage of total shipments.\u201d Views of the Commission at 20 (CR 427). Context, however, is everything. In this portion of its opinion, the Commission was deciding whether or not to cumulate the respective subject countries for the purposes of the sunset review. <em>See id. </em>at 13-29. Specifically, as a part of that inquiry, the Commission was addressing the question of whether the subject imports \u201care likely to have no discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry in the event of revocation of orders covering those imports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. The Commission characterized the percentage of exports from the Mittal Countries as \u201clarge\u201d in the course of deciding that imports from the Mittal Countries were <em>not </em>likely to have no discernible adverse impact. In other words, because of the specific question the Commission was addressing at the cumu-lation stage, the bar had been set low. The Court finds that it is not arbitrary, nor even inconsistent to characterize export percentage as \u201clarge\u201d because a country\u2019s exports are not likely to have no discernible adverse impact, and then subsequently, to find that the same country is not \u201cheavily export-oriented\u201d when those percentages fall in the range of [\u00b6] ]] percent<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>. <em>See id.; see also </em>Remand Determination at 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Next, the Court considers the argument of Plaintiff-Intervenor with respect to the attractiveness of the U.S. market. Ultimately, the Commission has credited the testimony and data provided by Arce-lorMittal regarding its corporate policies to source hot-rolled steel locally and to provide the domestic subsidiary veto power over imports. Because the Court has already found that the Commission\u2019s acceptance of ArcelorMittal\u2019s stated corporate policies is supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law, the Court is satisfied with the agency\u2019s explanation of the attractiveness of the U.S. market. <em>See </em>Discussion IV.l.C., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">On the issue of China\u2019s shift from net-importer to net-exporter status, this Court\u2019s previous instructions to the Commission consisted essentially of a requirement to address, and at a minimum, to explain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>why China is irrelevant with respect to the Mittal Countries. The Court finds that in the Commission\u2019s Remand Determination, it has thoroughly considered the evidence about the shift in China\u2019s import/export patterns. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 29-30. The Court agrees that the arguments of the Plaintiff-Intervenor on this issue amount to nothing more than a desire to re-weigh the evidence. While it is true that comparable percentages of exports are directed to Asian markets other than China from the Mittal Countries, on one hand, and from China, on the other, the Court does not see reason to disturb the Commission\u2019s volume determination on that basis. For the foregoing reasons then, the Court finds that the Commission\u2019s determination regarding excess capacity, export orientation, the attractiveness of the U.S. market and China\u2019s shift from net-importer to net-exporter status to be supported by substantial evidence in the record and otherwise supported by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">5. <em>Potential Price Effects</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">A. The Commission\u2019s Determination on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The Court predicated its remand instructions on the potential price effects of the subject imports on the correlative effects of the Commission\u2019s faulty volume analysis. Because the relationship between the imports\u2019 potential price effects and their volume is obvious, it logically follows that likely volume findings deemed unsupported by substantial evidence would impact the agency\u2019s conclusions with regard to price effects. As a result, the ITC was ordered on remand to reassess its potential price effects analysis in accordance with the agency\u2019s revised volume determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Consistent with its decision in the <em>Final Determination, </em>the ITC concluded that upon revocation of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders, the likely volume of subject imports will be small, and in light of ArcelorMittal\u2019s efforts to price these imports in a manner so as not to disrupt the U.S. market for hot-rolled steel, there will not likely be significant underselling of hot-rolled steel from the subject countries. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 32; <em>see also Final Determination </em>at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">B. Parties\u2019 Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Both Nucor and U.S. Steel advance arguments that are grounded on the assumption that the Commission\u2019s likely volume finding cannot be sustained. As such, Plaintiffs aver, that finding cannot support the agency\u2019s likely price effects analysis. <em>See </em>U.S. Steel Comments at 36; Nucor Comments at 23. Nucor further alleges that the ITC dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>regarded significant pricing evidence, and cites to data from the <em>Final Determination </em>demonstrating that the average unit values<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (\u201cAUVs\u201d) of the subject countries\u2019 home markets and third country exports were [\u00b6] ]] than the AUV of U.S. commercial shipments during the period of review. <em>See </em>Nucor Comments at 23-24 n.9. Thus, Nucor maintains, the potential for significant underselling of hot-rolled steel in the U.S. market combined with the Commission\u2019s recognition that even moderate levels of undersold merchandise will have a significant price suppressing or depressing effect, undermines the ITC\u2019s analysis. <em>See id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The Commission bases its price effects determination primarily on the reaffirmation of its likely volume analysis. That is to say, while ArcelorMittal may import modest levels of hot-rolled steel into the U.S. from its overseas affiliates, the volume of such imports would not be significant. Moreover, Defendant claims, the stated policy of Arce-lorMittal is to ensure that when the company did import products from its affiliates [\u00b6] ]] Remand Determination at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">Having already found that the Commission\u2019s likely volume determination is supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law, the Court rejects Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments regarding the sufficiency of the agency\u2019s price effects analysis. In addition, Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint about the ITC\u2019s assessment of the pricing evidence is clearly in error. Far from being dismissive of the pricing data, the Commission cited to this information in the explanation of its price effects determination. <em>See </em>Remand Determination at 31-32. In fact, the ITC specifically discussed the underselling data, from both the original period of investigation and the five-year review. <em>See id. </em>While acknowledging the instances of underselling which form the basis of Nucor\u2019s claim, the ITC concluded that this evidence was not dispositive when examined against the backdrop of ArcelorMittal\u2019s practices regarding imports from affiliated firms. To be sure, this evaluation of the evidence is more than mere conjecture, and the agency\u2019s decision is reasonably discernible to the Court. <em>See NSK Corp. v. United States, </em>33 CIT _, 637 F. Supp. 2d 1311, 1318 (2009) <em>(citing NMB Singapore Ltd. v. United States, </em>557 F.3d 1316, 1319-20 (Fed. Cir. 2009)). Therefore, the Court finds that the Commission sufficiently explained its price effects findings in the context of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>likely volume determination as mandated by the Court. As a result, the Commission\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">6. <em>Likely Impact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">A. The Commission\u2019s Determination on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The Court instructed the Commission on remand to reconsider its likely impact determination in light of its revised volume and price effects determinations. <em>Nucor, </em>33 CIT _, 605 F. Supp 2d 1361, 1383. The Commission was also required to \u201caccount for and explain, the poor performance of the domestic industry in the latter portion of the POR.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the ITC did not reach a different conclusion on either the volume issue or the price effects issue, it similarly concluded that the subject imports were not likely to have a significant impact on the domestic industry. Remand Determination at 33. The Commission also attributed the domestic industry\u2019s poor performance in the latter portion of the POR to \u201cflat or declining prices after 2006.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[a] 11 Commissioners who are joining this opinion concluded that the industry was not in a vulnerable condition, notwithstanding substantial performance declines in interim 2007, in light of its overall profitability since 2004.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">B. Parties\u2019 Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Plaintiff Nucor responds to the Commission\u2019s likely impact determination simply by invoking its objections to the Commission\u2019s volume and price effects determinations, without raising any new objection. Nucor Comments at 24-25. Plaintiff-Intervenor U.S. Steel contends that in reaching an affirmative determination in the original sunset review on <em>certain </em>countries (not involved in this litigation), the Commission determined that imports from <em>those </em>countries would have a negative impact on the domestic industry. U.S. Steel Comments at 37. The Commission responds to Nucor\u2019s comments by pointing out that Plaintiff does not raise any new arguments on the likely impact analysis, and urges that the ITC should be affirmed. ITC Rebuttal Comments at 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">As the Court has already sustained the Commission\u2019s volume and price effects analyses, and upon hearing no compelling argument from Plaintiff or Plaintiff-Intervenor as to why the ITC\u2019s likely impact analysis is flawed, the Court finds that the likely impact analysis is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">For all the reasons set forth above, the Commission\u2019s negative injury determination, reached on remand, is sustained in its entirety.
