Reg. 33,985 (Dep\u2019t Commerce June 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>2008) <em>(\u201cFinal Determination\u201d). </em>The plaintiffs, Mid Continent Nail Corporation, Davis Wire Corporation, Maze Nails and Treasure Coast Fasteners, Inc., collectively the domestic industry, submitted a motion for judgment on the agency record. For the reasons stated below, the court denies the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and grants judgment on the agency record in favor of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">I. Targeted Dumping</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Targeted dumping analysis is \u201can alternative method for determining the existence of margins of dumping in an investigation . . . .\u201d <em>Targeted Dumping in Antidumping Investigations; Request for Comment, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 60,651, 60,651 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Oct. 25, 2007) <em>(\u201cRequest for Comment\u201d). </em>The purpose of this methodology is to enable Commerce to identify dumping when a seller is providing lower prices to only certain United States purchasers \u201cby comparing the weighted average of the normal values to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(1)(B); <em>see Request for Comment. </em>By contrast, during an ordinary antidumping investigation, Commerce determines \u201cwhether the subject merchandise is being sold in the United States at less than fair value ... by comparing the weighted average of the normal values to the weighted average of the export prices (and constructed export prices) for comparable merchandise\u201d or by \u201ccomparing the normal values of individual transactions to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">II. Commerce\u2019s Investigation of Certain Steel Nails from the UAE</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">In May 2007, the plaintiffs filed petitions with Commerce concerning certain steel nails from the UAE. <em>Certain Steel Nails from the People\u2019s Republic of China and the United Arab Emirates: Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigations, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 38,816, 38,817 (Dep\u2019t Commerce July 16, 2007). In July 2007, Commerce initiated a targeted dumping investigation of certain steel nails from the UAE for the period of April 1, 2006, through March 31, 2007. <em>Id. </em>In August 2007, Commerce selected Dubai Wire FZE (\u201cDW\u201d), \u201cthe largest producer/exporter of nails from the UAE,\u201d as the mandatory respondent in the investigation. <em>Certain Steel Nails From the United Arab Emirates: Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 3945, 3945 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Jan. 23, 2008) <em>(\u201cPreliminary Determination\u201d). </em>In October 2007, the plaintiffs submitted an allegation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>targeted dumping against DW. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJi\">In its <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>published on January 23, 2008, Commerce used the methodology it had accepted in a previous investigation to conclude that targeted dumping had occurred at an anti-dumping duty (AD) margin of 4.47%.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 3950. At that time, however, Commerce stated that it intended to develop, a new methodology to assess DW\u2019s alleged targeted dumping and requested comments on the matter. <em>Id. </em>at 3947.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">On April 21, 2008, Commerce informed the plaintiffs of its new methodology (\u201cthe nails test\u201d) and set a sixteen day deadline for comments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Pis.\u2019 Confidential App. in Supp. of Pis.\u2019 Rule 56.2 Mot. for J. Upon the Agency R. (\u201cPis.\u2019 App.\u201d) Tab 10 at 7-9.) The nails test consists of two stages. <em>Proposed Methodology for Identifying and Analyzing Targeted Dumping in Antidumping Investigations; Request for Comment, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 26,371, 26,372 (Dep\u2019t Commerce May 9, 2008) <em>(\u201cProposed Methodology\u201d). </em>The first stage, the \u201cstandard deviation test,\u201d requires Commerce to calculate a standard deviation for all of the sale prices of an item from a particular exporter. <em>Id. </em>Commerce then must add together the volume for all of the items sold at a price below one standard deviation from the weighted-average price. <em>Issues and Decision Memorandum </em>at 19. If this combined volume exceeds thirty-three percent of the total volume of sales of that item from the particular exporter, the first stage of the test is satisfied. <em>Id. </em>The second stage of the test, the gap test, is satisfied if the volume of sales that qualify under a price gap comparison<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> exceeds five percent \u201cof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the total [volume] of sales of subject merchandise to the allegedly targeted customer.\u201d <em>Proposed Methodology, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 26,372, <em>amended by Issues and Decision Memorandum </em>at 20 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The plaintiffs filed their case brief in response to the nails test on May 7, 2008. (See Pis.\u2019 App. Tab 13.) On May 9, 2008, Commerce published the nails test and provided the public thirty days to comment. <em>Proposed Methodology, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 26,372. Commerce subsequently extended this deadline until June 23, 2008. <em>Antidumping Methodologies for Proceedings that Involve Significant Cost Changes Throughout the Period of Investigation (POI) </em>/ <em>Period of Review (POR) that May Require Using Shorter Cost Averaging Periods; Request for Comment and Proposed Methodology for Identifying and Analyzing Targeted Dumping in Antidumping Investigations; Request for Comment, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 32,557, 32,557 (Dep\u2019t Commerce June 9, 2008). On June 16, 2008, however, Commerce published its <em>Final Determination, </em>which adopted the nails test, and used it to calculate a dumping margin of zero. <em>Final Determination, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 33,988. In addition, Commerce determined that it had properly calculated DW\u2019s financial expense rate without including the financial expenses of Global Fasteners Ltd. (\u201cGF\u201d), an entity that Commerce had previously collapsed with DW. <em>Issues and Decision Memorandum </em>at 28-30. Finally, Commerce also allowed a revised scrap offset that included the sale price of extraneous materials that were not the by-product of nail production. <em>Id. </em>at 30-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In August 2008, the plaintiffs filed a complaint contesting the <em>Final Determination. </em>In February 2009, the plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment on the agency record pursuant to USCIT Rule 56.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c). The court will uphold Commerce\u2019s final determinations in AD investigations unless they are \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">I. Reasonable Time under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(g)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">The plaintiffs allege that Commerce\u2019s actions deprived them of their due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. (Pis.\u2019 Mem. of Law in Supp. of Pis.\u2019 Rule 56.2 Mot. for J. Upon the Agency R. (\u201cPis.\u2019 Mem.\u201d) 16.) The plaintiffs claim that by providing the domestic industry only sixteen days to comment on the nails test, Commerce did not afford enough time to submit meaningful comments to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>strate all of the nails test\u2019s errors. <em>(See Id. </em>at 17-24.) In support of their position that the comment period was unreasonable, the plaintiffs cite the facts that Commerce needed \u201cseveral months\u201d to develop the nails test, that Commerce typically affords parties fifty days to comment on preliminary determinations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that Commerce provided the public over thirty days to comment. <em>(Id.) </em>This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Congress has provided a fair process for commenting within the statutory language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(g). Subsection (g) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">Information that is submitted on a timely basis to the administering authority or the Commission during the course of a proceeding under this subtitle shall be subject to comment by other parties to the proceeding within such reasonable time as the administering authority or the Commission shall provide. The administering authority and the Commission, before making a final determination . . . shall cease collecting information and shall provide the parties with a final opportunity to comment on the information obtained by the administering authority or the Commission . . . upon which the parties have not previously had an opportunity to comment. Comments containing new factual information shall be disregarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(g). Whether or not a constitutional due process right exists in these circumstances is an issue that need not be decided here because such a right would not require any more time to be afforded to the plaintiffs than is already required by statute. If Commerce provides a time period for comments that is unreasonable, it would be in violation of the statute. <em>Compare </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(g), <em>with Borden Inc. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 372, 375 n.3 (1999), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>7 F. App\u2019x 938, 938-39 (2001) (holding that \u201c[t]he court applies a rule of reason in evaluating administrative due process claims\u201d). Accordingly, the court considers the plaintiffs due process argument as a claim that Commerce violated the statutory due process requirement of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Generally, \u201c[w]here a right to be heard exists, due process requires that right be accommodated at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Barnhart v. United States Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>588 F. Supp. 1432, 1438 (CIT 1984). Recognizing that \u201c[w]ith more time most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>parties could improve the quality of their comments,\u201d courts ask whether there is \u201cevidence that given more time [a plaintiff] would have, in fact, provided more meaningful comments.\u201d <em>Sichuan Changhong Electric Co. v. United States, </em>466 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1328 (CIT 2006). If, however, a plaintiff makes thoughtful comments that Commerce addresses in its determination, then, \u201cas a practical matter, [the plaintiff] was not substantially deprived of an opportunity to be heard before the agency.\u201d <em>Borden, </em>23 CIT at 375 n.3. This understanding has previously led the court to conclude that a comment period as brief as four days can be reasonable. <em>See Sichuan, </em>466 F. Supp. 2d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Despite having a full opportunity to demonstrate that the comment period was unreasonable by presenting the court with additional critiques of the nails test that they were not previously afforded the opportunity to develop, the plaintiffs have failed to provide any new and convincing arguments. Although the plaintiffs filed a thorough case brief, the court notes that most of their arguments are similar, if not identical, to the ones raised at the administrative level. <em>(Compare </em>Pis.\u2019 App. Tab 13, <em>with </em>Pis.\u2019 Mem.) The plaintiffs claim that they would have made many additional arguments if they were afforded more time to comment, yet now provide only one such example. (Pis.\u2019 Mem. 22.) They argue that the mean price was incorrectly used to calculate the standard deviation. <em>(Id.) </em>The plaintiffs contend that if the statistically correct median price were used, Commerce might have found dumping in this case. <em>(Id.) </em>Contrary to the plaintiffs claim, however, the use of a mean to calculate a standard deviation is, by definition, a perfectly acceptable statistical method. Christine Ammer &amp; Dean S. Ammer, <em>Dictionary of Business and Economics </em>397 (1977). Although median can be substituted for mean in certain situations, such a substitution is not required. <em>See generally </em>Yulia Gel, Weiwen Miao &amp; Joseph L. Gastwirth, <em>The Importance of Checking the Assumptions Underlying Statistical Analysis: Graphical Methods for Assessing Normality, </em>46 Jurimetrics J. 3, 26 (2005). In addition, such claims are merely speculative \u2014 the plaintiffs do not offer any numerical evidence to support their contention that using a median would yield a different result.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">There is no evidence before the court, therefore, to suggest that the plaintiffs would have provided more meaningful comments if they were afforded additional time to comment. Accordingly, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>holds that Commerce afforded the plaintiffs a reasonable time to comment under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\">II. The Nails Test</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The plaintiffs challenge the <em>Final Determination </em>on the grounds that the nails test violates 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(B) and 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.414(f)(1)(i) and therefore, Commerce\u2019s conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that in investigating their claim of targeted dumping, Commerce improperly considered only identical products, used a statistically invalid methodology, and unreasonably defined terms. (Pis.\u2019 Mem. 24-25.) This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(1)(B), which essentially defines the targeted dumping remedy, Commerce \u201cmay determine whether the subject merchandise is being sold in the United States at less than fair value by comparing the weighted average of the normal values to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise,\u201d but only if \u201cthere is a pattern of export prices (or constructed export prices) for comparable merchandise that differ significantly among purchasers, regions, or periods of time.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(B). In addition, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.414(f)(1)(i) provided that Commerce must use \u201cstandard and appropriate statistical techniques\u201d when determining whether sales qualify for this section. 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.414(f)(1)(i).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Generally, courts lack an \u201cindependent authority to tell the [agency] how to do its job\u201d when a statute does not specify \u201cany Congressionally mandated procedure or methodology for assessment of the statutory tests.\u201d <em>U.S. Steel Group v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1996). This silence has been interpreted as \u201can invitation\u201d for an agency administering unfair trade law to \u201cperform its duties in the way it believes most suitable\u201d and courts will uphold these decisions \u201cMo long as the [agency]\u2019s analysis does not violate any statute and is not otherwise arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">A. Commerce\u2019s decision to consider only identical products is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The plaintiffs first claim that Commerce\u2019s decision to test only identical products was in violation of the clear language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(B), which instructs Commerce to consider \u201ccomparable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>merchandise.\u201d (Reply Br. of Mid Continent Nail Corp., Davis Wire Corp., Maze Nails and Treasure Coast Fasteners, Inc. 7.) Identical merchandise is comparable merchandise. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16). In some cases it may be a smaller subset of all comparable merchandise. Id.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a case such as this, however, where the great bulk of the allegedly targeted sales had identical matches, the statutory language does not require Commerce to do more.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Def.\u2019s Supp. Br. and Confidential App. 2.) Based on this record, the court concludes that Commerce\u2019s decision to consider only identical merchandise was supported by substantial evidence and was in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">B. Commerce\u2019s use of standard deviation is statistically valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The plaintiffs claim that Commerce\u2019s use of standard deviation in the nails test is unreasonable because \u201c[a] standard deviation is simply a descriptive measure of a population; in other words, standard deviation measures <em>describe </em>the dispersion of data, and then <em>calculate </em>how spread out prices are from the average price.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Mem. 26.) The plaintiffs go on to claim that \u201c[a]t the most basic level, then, the Department\u2019s starting point violated the regulatory requirement that it use a \u2018standard and appropriate\u2019 statistical technique to determine whether targeting was occurring\u201d because, contrary to Commerce\u2019s assertion, \u201cthe standard deviation cannot validly be used as a method to calculate a \u2018relative measure.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Generally, a standard deviation is defined as \u201ca measure of the tendency of individual values to differ from the mean.\u201d Christine Ammer &amp; Dean S. Ammer, <em>Dictionary of Business and Economics </em>397 (1977). \u201cThe standard deviation is the most common measure of dispersion,\u201d which is \u201cthe total spread of the values in a frequency distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122. In statistics, a frequency distribution is \u201cthe organization of data to show how often certain values or ranges of values occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">As previously described, the nails test uses standard deviation to measure the dispersion of values in an exporter\u2019s price data, to aid in identifying which of the exporter\u2019s sales were relatively low compared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>to others.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Proposed Methodology, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 26,372. After the dispersion is identified, the nails test requires Commerce to use the thirty-three percent test to determine whether a \u201cpattern\u201d existed under the statute. <em>Id. </em>Thus, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, Commerce\u2019s use of standard deviation was, by definition, statistically valid because it was used to measure the dispersion of the sales prices.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This aspect of the nails test, therefore, is not in violation of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">C. The nails test\u2019s definitions of \u201cpattern\u201d and \u201cdiffer significantly\u201d do not violate 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1 (d)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The plaintiffs further challenge Commerce\u2019s definitions of \u201cpattern\u201d and \u201cdiffer significantly\u201d as arbitrary, unexplained, and unreasonable. (Pis.\u2019 Mem. 26.) Particularly, the plaintiffs claim that Commerce\u2019s use of thirty-three percent in its \u201cpattern\u201d definition and five percent in its \u201cdiffer significantly\u201d definition are seemingly random values with no meaning. <em>{Id. </em>at 36-38.) The plaintiffs contend that, in this case, these unreasonable definitions cause the nails test to overlook obvious targeting.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>{Id. </em>at 24 \u2014 25.) This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">As previously discussed, Commerce included a thirty-three percent threshold requirement in its definition of \u201cpattern.\u201d <em>Issues and Decision Memorandum </em>at 19. Commerce explained that it considered thirty-three percent reasonable for establishing a pattern of activity. <em>Id. </em>The court has no reason to disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Commerce defined \u201cdiffer significantly\u201d as any situation when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>five percent price gap test is satisfied. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. Commerce stated that it considered a five percent difference as significant, when used in combination with the thirty-three percent threshold, under the statutory language. <em>Id. </em>at 21. Although these tests may create a standard that is more difficult to satisfy than the domestic industry would have preferred, the nails test \u201cdoes not violate any statute and is not otherwise arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>U.S. Steel Group, </em>96 F.3d at 1362. In other AD contexts, and for a long period of time five percent tests have been used to measure significance for AD purposes. <em>See, e.g., </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(1)(C) (1994) (using five percent test to determine home market viability); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1677b(a)(1)(B)(ii)(II) (1994) (using five percent test to determine third-country market viability); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.403(d) (1998) (using five percent test to determine whether to \u201ccalculate normal value based on the sale by an affiliated party\u201d). Furthermore, plaintiff has done nothing to attempt to establish that on this record the five percent requirement is unreasonably high. The various aspects of the nails test do not violate the statutory language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(l)(B)(i) and are applied reasonably based on this record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">III. <em>Withdrawal of the Regulatory Provisions Governing Targeted Dumping in Antidumping Duty Investigations {\u201cRevocation\u201d), </em>73 Fed. Reg 74,930 (Dep\u2019t Commerce, Dec. 10, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In December 2008, Commerce issued an \u201cinterim final rule for the purpose of withdrawing the regulatory provisions governing the targeted dumping analysis in antidumping duty investigations.\u201d <em>Revocation, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 74,930. Commerce explained that it \u201cmay have established thresholds or other criteria that have prevented the use of this comparison methodology to unmask dumping, contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Congressional intent. In that case, these provisions would act to deny relief to domestic industries suffering material injury from unfairly traded imports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74,931. The plaintiffs now cite these statements as evidence to support their arguments that given more time they could have provided more meaningful comments and that the nails test violates 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Contrary to this proposition, courts have made it clear that unreasonableness cannot be inferred from a subsequent withdrawal. <em>See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., </em>129 S. Ct. 1800, 1811 (2009) (holding that an agency \u201cneed not demonstrate to a court\u2019s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are <em>better </em>than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency <em>believes </em>it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately indicates\u201d); <em>GPX Int\u2019l Tire Corp. v. United States, </em>645 F. Supp. 2d 1231, 1238 (CIT 2009) (holding that \u201c[i]f the statutes are ambiguous, it does not matter whether Commerce\u2019s new interpretation of the statutes conflicts with its old interpretation, because the court is now looking at Commerce\u2019s new interpretation and will give that interpretation deference if it is reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Furthermore, in the <em>Revocation, </em>Commerce stated that it \u201cbelieves the withdrawal of this rule is not significant.

Instead, the Department is returning to a case-by-case adjudication, until additional experience allows the Department to gain a greater understanding of the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By its very terms, therefore, the <em>Revocation </em>is not an admission by Commerce that the nails test is unlawful- \u2014 -it merely demonstrates that Commerce is dubious as to whether this particular methodology should be universally applicable and announces that Commerce will continue to search for a widely applicable test.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <em>Revocation </em>has no effect on the court\u2019s conclusions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>IV. Commerce\u2019s Financial Expense Rate Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">During its investigation, Commerce determined that DW had no viable home market, and therefore, based normal value on constructed value, which required it to consider DW\u2019s costs. <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>at 3948-49; 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(4), (e). The plaintiffs challenge Commerce\u2019s decision to calculate DW\u2019s financial expense rate without including the financial expenses of GF. (Pis.\u2019 Mem. 39-40.) Specifically, the plaintiffs assert that Commerce departed from its established practice of using a combined financial expense rate in cases involving collapsed entities. <em>(Id. </em>at 45.) This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Commerce\u2019s authority to collapse affiliated producers into a single entity for the purposes of an antidumping investigation, codified in 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(f),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> has been affirmed by the court. <em>See Queen\u2019s Flowers de Colom. v. United States, </em>981 F. Supp. 617, 622 (CIT 1997). When dealing with collapsed entities, Commerce has established a \u201cnormal methodology of calculating the financial-expense ratio based on the financial statements at the highest level of consolidation normally prepared by the companies.\u201d <em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review of Certain Softwood Lumber Products From Canada, </em>A-122-838, POR 05/22/2002-04/30/2003, at 83 (Dec. 13, 2004) <em>(\u201cSoftwood Lumber\u201d), available at </em>http://ia.ita.doc.gov/frn/summary/canada/E4-3751-l.pdf (last visited Apr. 29, 2010). \u201c[W]here consolidated audited financial statements do not exist and are not easily prepared, [Commerce has deemed] it appropriate to base the interest expense calculation on the audited financial statements of the respondent.\u201d <em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice from Brazil \u2014 May 1, 1998, through April 30, 1999, </em>A-351-605, at comment 2 (Oct. 11, 2000), <em>available at </em>http://ia.ita.doc.gov/frn/summary/braziP00-26074-l.txt (last visited Apr. 29, 2010). If \u201cusing merely one company\u2019s financing information would not yield a more accurate result,\u201d Commerce has \u201cbased financing expenses on the unconsolidated financial statements for the [collapsed] entities ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>In such a case, \u201cthe highest level of consolidation is the individual financial statements of each company.\u201d <em>Softwood Lumber </em>at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>In this case, Commerce collapsed DW and GF, but concluded that it was not necessary to include GF\u2019s financial expenses in the financi\u00e1l expense ratio calculation because GF \u201cdid not sell the merchandise under consideration in the United States and its home market was not viable during the [period of investigation] . . . <em>Issues and Decision Memorandum </em>at 29. Although Commerce stated at oral argument that it had the proper documentation to include GF\u2019s financial expenses in its calculation, Commerce maintained that its practice is to categorically exclude such expenses for the purposes of consistency because financial documents from companies that do not sell merchandise in the US are not always readily available. In response to this information, the plaintiffs acknowledged Commerce\u2019s normal practice, but argued that the degree of intertwining was anything but normal in this case. Some level of intertwining, by definition, will always exist between collapsed entities and the plaintiffs have failed to show that the intertwining in this case is so advanced beyond the norm that Commerce must deviate from its practice. There has been no showing that Commerce\u2019s decision to follow its usual methodology is inherently flawed. Commerce\u2019s decision to calculate DW\u2019s individual financial expense rate, therefore, was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary because it was based on the financial statements of DW, which produced the merchandise. <em>See Gulf States Tube Div. of Quanex Corp. v. United States, </em>981 F. Supp. 630, 647-48 (CIT 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">V. DW\u2019s Scrap Adjustment</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Finally, the plaintiffs challenge Commerce\u2019s decision to accept the second portion of DW\u2019s claimed scrap \u201coffset\u201d as a reduction to its reported cost of production as not supported by substantial evidence. In support of this proposition, the plaintiffs cite to record evidence that a significant portion of these items included materials \u201cclearly unrelated to the cost of producing nails,\u201d and therefore, should not have been included in the scrap \u201coffset.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Mem. 46-49.) In addition, the plaintiffs claim that the record demonstrates that: (1) the sale price of the miscellaneous items did not approximate the purchase cost, (2) the cost of the miscellaneous items were not included in the cost of production, and (3) the cost related to the revenues from the sale of scrap were not included in DW\u2019s reported cost of production. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Under 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(b), Commerce may make adjustments \u201cto export price, constructed export price, or normal value,\u201d so long as the Secretary ensures that \u201c[t]he interested party that is in possession of the relevant information has the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Secretary the amount and nature of a particular ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>justment,\u201d and does not \u201cdouble-count adjustments.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(b)(1)-(2). Commerce has clarified its typical practice regarding by-product offsets as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">[A] respondent must first provide and substantiate the quantity of by-product it produced from subject merchandise during the [period of review]. Thus, in order to grant a by-product offset, it is [Commerce\u2019s] practice to require respondents to provide sufficient documentation of the actual amount of by-product produced. The reason for this practic\u00e9 is that [Commerce] must determine whether the respondent\u2019s production process for subject merchandise actually generated the amount of scrap claimed as a by-product offset.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and New Shipper Review of Wooden Bedroom Furniture from the People\u2019s Republic of China, </em>A-570-890, POR 01/01/2006-12/31/2006, at 70 (Aug. 11, 2008), <em>available at </em>http://ia.ita.doc.gov/frn/summary/PRC/E8-19303-l.pdf (last visited Apr. 29, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In its cost verification, Commerce found that DW included the sale of extraneous materials as an offset because it had previously improperly added the cost of such items to its manufacturing cost. (Pis.\u2019 App. Tab 17 at 17-18.) Although Commerce incorrectly agreed with DW\u2019s description of this cost correction a \u201cscrap offset,\u201d its decision to allow DW to back out improperly added costs is supported by its cost verification.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>(See Id.) </em>Any further discrepancies raised by the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>tiffs are <em>de minimis </em>and do not render the determination unsupported or arbitrary.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">For the aforementioned reasons and based on this record, the court concludes that utilization of the \u201cnails test\u201d for the targeted dumping analysis was reasonable and Commerce\u2019s determinations were supported by substantial evidence, and in accordance with law.

Although the plaintiffs are correct that the word \u201clow\u201d does not appear within the language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(B), Commerce explains that this interpretation \u201cstrikes a balance between two extremes, the first being where <em>any </em>price below the average price is sufficient to distinguish the alleged target from others... and the second being where only prices at the very bottom of the price distribution are sufficient to distinguish the alleged target from others.\u201d <em>Issues and Decision Memorandum </em>at 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b528-10\"> Based on the evidence, the court is not convinced that the P/2 test is an inherently better test. The P/2 test, which draws a hard line at two-percent, is arguably only well suited for a particular type of market. Hypothetically, if the prices of the market greatly varied, most prices are likely to satisfy the two-percent requirement and this test may capture too many sales. Alternatively, if the prices were nearly uniform, few sales would satisfy the two-percent threshold and the test may not capture enough. In contrast, a standard deviation can be calculated for all types of dispersions and therefore, provides Commerce with a consistent method to analyze all markets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b528-11\"> The plaintiffs spend several pages in their brief detailing hypothetical data sets in an attempt to illustrate this point and thus, expose Commerce\u2019s test as unreasonable. <em>{See </em>Pis. Mem. 30-34.) The plaintiffs argue that these examples clearly illustrate \u201ctargeted dumping\u201d under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(B)(i), but would not be classified as such under Commerce\u2019s test. (Id.) The plaintiffs further contend that much like these examples, the facts of this case clearly support a finding of targeted dumping and that any finding otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>cannot be supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at 38-39.) The plaintiffs\u2019 examples, however, are unconvincing because they oversimplify a market. Each example contains only a few hypothetical prices spread out at a great variance, creating a market where all of the extremely low prices fall within one standard deviation of the average price. (See <em>id. </em>at 30-34.) Such a result occurs because the hypothetical markets also contain extremely high prices that offset the low ones. <em>(See Id.) </em>The price variation of these markets are unrealistic, and therefore, raise few practical concerns regarding this methodology.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\"> The plaintiffs also contend that Commerce\u2019s test masks targeted dumping because it improperly averages all sales, both allegedly targeted and non-targeted to calculate the average-mean price. (Pis.\u2019 Mem. 28.) The plaintiffs claim that this practice is \u201cdistorting or biasing the comparison to a finding that targeting does not exist.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 28-29.) While including the alleged targeted sales in the average-mean calculation could lower the mean, excluding such sales could lead to the opposite result, perhaps raising the mean too high and increasing the chance that an otherwise non-targeted sale be classified as targeted. An inclusion of these prices, therefore, is no less reasonable than the exclusion that the plaintiffs desire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b530-6\"> The court notes that the nails test has been used by Commerce in three subsequent investigations, two of which occurred after the issuance of the <em>Revocation.
