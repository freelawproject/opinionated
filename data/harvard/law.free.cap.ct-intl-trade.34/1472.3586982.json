Reg. 56,550 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Sept. 29, 2008) (final results and rescission, in part, of twelfth new shipper review) and the accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Sept. 19, 2008) (\u201cIssues &amp; Dec.

Jurisdiction lies pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) (2006) and 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-5\">For the reasons set forth below, the court denies plaintiff\u2019s motion and sustains Commerce\u2019s Final Results.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-7\">On May 17, 2007, plaintiff asked Commerce to initiate a new shipper review of its sale of fresh garlic. Fresh Garlic from the PRC, 72 Fed. Reg. 38,057, 38,057-58 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce July 12, 2007) (initiation of antidumping duty new shipper reviews) (\u201cInitiation\u201d). The purpose of a new shipper review is to determine whether an exporter or producer, whose sales were not examined in an investigation, is (1) entitled'to its own antidumping duty rate under the order resulting from the investigation, and (2) if so, to calculate that rate. To calculate a rate, Commerce must determine the normal value,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> export price,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1495-8\">and the antidumping duty margin<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for each entry of the subject merchandise. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-9\">Commerce initiated the review on July 12, 2007. Initiation, 72 Fed. Reg. at 38,060. On May 1, 2008, the Department published its preliminary results. Fresh Garlic from the PRC, 73 Fed. Reg. 24,042, 24,042 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce May 1, 2008) (preliminary results of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number>12th new shipper reviews) (\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d). In the Preliminary Results, Commerce found that Chenhe had imported the subject merchandise into the United States in a bona fide sale at a non-dumped price. <em>Id. </em>at 24,047. Commerce then preliminarily calculated a dumping margin of zero for the company. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1496-4\">After these results were published, defendant-intervenors filed a case brief alleging that Chenhe\u2019s purported sale was, in fact, not bona fide. The brief claimed that Commerce had made errors in its analysis and asserted that if Commerce had taken specific evidence into consideration it would have not concluded, in the Preliminary Results, that plaintiff was entitled to a separate rate. Conf. R. (\u201cCR\u201d) Doc. No. 102 (\u201cDef.-Int. Case Brief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-5\">In its Final Results, the Department took defendant-intervenors\u2019 arguments into account and determined that Chenhe\u2019s sale was not bona fide. Commerce then rescinded the new shipper review as to the company. Final Results, 73 Fed. Reg. at 56,551.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-7\">The court must uphold a final determination by the Department in an antidumping proceeding unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law . . . .\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-9\">I. Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-10\">Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(B), upon request, Commerce shall conduct administrative reviews \u201cfor new exporters and producers\u201d and \u201cestablish . . . individual weighted average dumping margin [s]\u201d for them. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(B)(i). Thus, the statute provides new exporters or producers the opportunity to establish that they are entitled to an individual rate under an existing order. It is Commerce\u2019s practice during these new shipper reviews to determine whether the new exporters and producers have conducted bona fide or commercially reasonable transactions. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.214(b)(2) (2009); <em>Hebei New Donghua Amino Acid, Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 603, 608, 374 F. Supp. 2d 1333, 1338 (2005) <em>(\u201cHebei\u201d). </em>In conducting this test, Commerce\u2019s goal is to determine \u201cwhether the sale(s) under review are indicative of future commercial behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-11\">This Court has, on a number of occasions, upheld Commerce\u2019s use of this analysis. <em>See, e.g., Hebei, </em>29 CIT at 608-09, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 1338; <em>Tianjin Tiancheng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., v. United States, </em>29 CIT 256, 366 F. Supp. 2d 1246 (2005) <em>(\u201cTianjin\u201d); Windmill International Pte., Ltd., v. United States, </em>26 CIT 221, 193 F. Supp. 2d 1303 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>(2002) <em>{\u201cWindmill\"). </em>As laid out in <em>Hebei, </em>Commerce normally employs a totality of the circumstances test to determine whether the transaction is \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d or \u201catypical of normal business practices.\u201d 29 CIT at 610, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 1339 (quoting <em>Windmill, </em>26 CIT at 231, 193 F. Supp. 2d at 1313). Commerce looks at, among other factors, \u201cthe price and quantity\u201d of the goods sold. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1497-5\">II. Commerce\u2019s Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-6\">Chenhe\u2019s request for an individual dumping margin was based on its sole entry during the POR. Initiation, 72 Fed. Reg. at 38,057. In the Final Results, Commerce found that \u201c[biased on the totality of the circumstances . . . , the Department has determined that Chenhe\u2019s single POR sale is not a <em>bona fide </em>transaction, and subsequently has rescinded the new shipper review . . . .\u201d Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-7\">In making this determination, Commerce stated that its practice, when applying its totality of the circumstances test, is \u201cto examine both the quantity and value of other POR entries of subject merchandise from the PRC as well as a respondent\u2019s sales to third countries, when available, in evaluating the price and quantity of a single POR sale for the purposes of the <em>bona fides </em>analysis.\u201d Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1. The Department further explained that its determination that Chenhe\u2019s sale was not bona fide was \u201cbased on a combination of factors including: [the entry\u2019s] high price, its low quantity, and the fact that it was atypical of Chenhe\u2019s U.S. customer\u2019s normal commercial practices.\u201d Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-8\">With respect to quantity, Commerce found that Chenhe\u2019s sole sale of fresh garlic was: (1) smaller than the average sale amount for all Chinese exporters shipping to the United States during the POR; (2) markedly less than Chenhe\u2019s average sales to third countries during the POR; and (3) smaller than the average amount imported by Chenhe\u2019s U.S. customer during the POR.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1 (\u201c[T]he Department finds that the quantity of Chenhe\u2019s sale . . . fell substantially below the average U.S. import quantities [from China] .... [T]he department notes that when the quantity of Chenhe\u2019s U.S. sales is compared to the average quantity of its third-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>country sales, the quantity is atypical. . . . Furthermore, . . . the quantity ... of Chenhe\u2019s sale [was] atypical of the other purchases of subject garlic made by Chenhe\u2019s U.S. customer during the POR.\u201d). As a result of these findings, Commerce concluded that the small size of Chenhe\u2019s sale supported a finding that the entry was unrepresentative of sales during the POR and thus not indicative of future sales by the company. Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-3\">With regard to sales price, the Department further found that the relatively high sales price of Chenhe\u2019s entry was an even greater indication that the sale was atypical of what Chenhe\u2019s future behavior would be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1498-4\">[T]he Department compared the per-unit price for Chenhe\u2019s single POR sale with the [Average Unit Value (\u201cAUV\u201d)] for all entries under HTSUS 0703.20.0010:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> FRESH WHOLE GARLIC BULBS, and found that the price of Chenhe\u2019s single POR s\u00e1le was unusually high when compared to the weighted AUV of all other entries under this HTSUS subcategory. . . . The Department further note[d] that Chenhe\u2019s POR sale subject to this review was also a typical when compared to the AUV of Chenhe\u2019s third country sales. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1498-5\">Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-6\">In other words, Commerce found that the price paid for Chenhe\u2019s g\u00e1rlic was abnormally high<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> when compared to: (1) other Chinese entries during the POR; and (2) the price of the company\u2019s sales to third-country purchasers. In addition, the Department concluded that the price paid by Chenhe\u2019s U.S. customer was markedly higher than the customer paid to other Chinese exporters and producers during the POR.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1498-7\">Based on these findings, Commerce determined that \u201c[Chenhe\u2019s] sale does not provide a reasonable or reliable basis for calculating an antidumping duty margin.\u201d Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>fore, since Chenhe had only one entry during the POR, and that entry was determined, based on quantity and price, to be. non-bona fide, Commerce rescinded Chenhe\u2019s new shipper review and did not calculate a separate antidumping duty for the company. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1499-5\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-6\">The issue before the court is whether Commerce erred in its decision to rescind the new shipper review based on its finding that Chenhe\u2019s sale was not bona fide. For its part, Chenhe maintains that, as a matter of law, the Department can reject its sale only if it was \u201cunrepresentative and extremely distortive,\u201d and that substantial evidence did not support such a finding. Pl.\u2019s Br. 12 (quoting <em>Hebei, </em>29 CIT at 610, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 1339). Commerce counters that both the low quantity of Chenhe\u2019s entry and its high price lead to a conclusion that the single sale under review was not indicative of future commercial behavior. Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-7\">The bona fide analysis conducted in new shipper reviews has been addressed by this Court on multiple occasions. The case that corresponds most closely to the facts before the court is <em>Hebei, </em>which involved Commerce\u2019s determination that a single entry of glycine into the United States was not a bona fide sale. <em>Hebei, </em>29 CIT at 604, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 1334. The Court in <em>Hebei </em>upheld, as reasonable, Commerce\u2019s use of the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d test to determine if a sale was bona fide, and rejected the plaintiff\u2019s call for \u201cbright line rules\u201d regarding what constituted an acceptable transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 610, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-8\">In <em>Hebei, </em>the Department determined that the single entry at issue could not provide the basis for making a new shipper determination because \u201cthe pricing of the sale is artificially high and otherwise commercially unreasonable,... the quantity of the single shipment is extremely low in comparison with other sales from the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d and \u201cthe importer has not resold the merchandise and has otherwise not acted in a commercially reasonable manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 1336. In reaching its holding, the <em>Hebei </em>Court found that the quantity of the questioned sale was \u201cextremely low\u201d when compared with: (1) sales of other Chinese exporters to U.S. purchasers; and (2) the exporter\u2019s own sales to other U.S. purchasers and to purchasers in third countries. <em>Id. </em>at 614-15, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 12 1342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-9\">As to price, the Court found that Commerce had supported its conclusion that the price was abnormally high by a comparison of the sales price with: (1) the price of all similar (clearly not aberrational) entries made from China; and (2) the price of all similar entries from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>whatever source. <em>Id. </em>at 611, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 1340 (\u201cThese price comparisons constitute substantial evidence for Commerce\u2019s decision that [Hebei\u2019s] sales price was \u2018substantially higher than any observed value.\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-4\">Other cases have looked at similar factors when applying the totality of circumstances test. The <em>Tianjin </em>case also involved a single shipment of glycine from the PRC to the United States. <em>Tianjin, </em>29 CIT at 256, 366 F. Supp. 2d at 1247. In that case, Commerce also rescinded the new shipper review, relying on its finding that \u201cthe price at which the goods were sold was not \u2018commercially reasonable.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 366 F. Supp. 2d at 1248. Commerce found the sales price to be atypical of both the market as a whole and of plaintiff\u2019s own sales prices.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 261, 366 F. Supp. 2d at 1251 (\u201cAccordingly, Commerce found that Plaintiff\u2019s price was out of line with both the benchmark of other Chinese exporters\u2019 sales of glycine to the United States, and with Plaintiff\u2019s own pricing practice as it applied to third-country sales.\u201d). The <em>Tianjin </em>Court sustained Commerce\u2019s finding that in order to be bona fide, a transaction must be a \u201cnormal\u201d sale in the context of good business practice generally and \u201ca good future indicator of Plaintiff\u2019s future sales in the market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 366 F. Supp. 2d at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-5\"><em>Windmill </em>involved a new shipper review for an exporter of cut-to-length carbon steel plate from Romania. <em>Windmill, </em>26 CIT at 221,193 F. Supp. 2d at 1304-05. In that case, Commerce looked at a number of factors in making its determination, including that the merchandise was shipped by air rather than by sea and that the purchaser re-sold the merchandise at a loss.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, Commerce assigned great weight to its finding that \u201c[t]he quantity of the sale was atypical of that which Windmill normally sells to the U.S. [purchaser]....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 193 F. Supp. 2d at 1307 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-6\">The <em>Windmill </em>Court also found important Commerce\u2019s finding that \u201cMix months prior to and subsequent to the sale [at issue], Windmill made sales [of different merchandise] to the same U.S. purchaser that was substantially larger than the test case quantity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 193 F. Supp. 2d at 1311 (citations omitted). Thus, the Court upheld Commerce\u2019s conclusion that the transaction \u201cwas not commercially reasonable and was atypical of the normal business practices between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>Windmill and the United States purchaser.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1501-5\">Commerce\u2019s determination that Chenhe\u2019s sale was not bona fide is sustained. In reaching this holding, the court is aware that the size of an entry does not necessarily control Commerce\u2019s analysis. <em>See Windmill, </em>26 CIT at 231, 193 F. Supp. 2d at 1313 (\u201c[S] ingle sales, even those involving small quantities, are not inherently commercially unreasonable and do not necessarily involve selling practices atypical of the parties\u2019 normal selling practices.\u201d) (citations omitted). Nonetheless, the size of the sale can raise questions as to whether the purchaser would buy the merchandise in the future in the same quantity at the same price. <em>See Tianjin, </em>29 CIT at 260, 366 F. Supp. 2d at 1250 (\u201c [B]ecause the ultimate goal of the new shipper review is to ensure that the U.S. price side of the antidumping calculation is based on a realistic figure, any factor which indicates that the sale under consideration is not likely to be typical of those which the producer will make in the future is relevant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-6\">In addition, while plaintiff\u2019s reliance on a single sale need not be fatal, a single sale leaves little to review. <em>See Tianjin, </em>29 CIT at 275, 366 F. Supp. 2d at 1263 (\u201cIn one-sale reviews, there is, as a result of the seller\u2019s choice to make only one shipment, little data from which to infer what the shipper\u2019s future selling practices would look like. This leaves the door wide to the possibility that the sale may not, in fact, be typical, and that any resulting antidumping duty calculation would be based on unreliable data.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-7\">As to Chenhe\u2019s legal argument that its shipment must be found \u201cextremely distortive\u201d in order for it to be rejected, the company seeks to set the bar too high. The purpose of a new shipper review is to determine if an exporter or producer is entitled to a separate rate and to <em>set that rate. </em>In order for Commerce to set an accurate rate, it must have before it a transaction from which it can reasonably determine a margin. Thus, a single transaction need not be \u201cextremely distor-tive\u201d in order to be found unsuitable. Rather, to be used as a basis for setting an individual rate, a sale must be typical of normal business practices. <em>See Windmill, </em>26 CIT at 231, 193 F. Supp. 2d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-8\">As to the evidence Commerce cites to justify its conclusion, Chenhe does not dispute that its entry contained one of the smallest quantities of goods of any entry from China during the POR. Nor does it dispute that the size of the shipment was small when compared to Chenhe\u2019s sales to other countries and other purchases by the U.S. purchaser. Thus, it was reasonable for Commerce to conclude the small quantity of Chenhe\u2019s sale would not be indicative of typical future transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-9\">As to the price paid for the shipment of merchandise, Commerce found it to be \u201cunusually high when compared to the [average unit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>value] of all entries\u201d during the POR. Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1. Commerce also found the price to be significantly higher than Chenhe\u2019s sales to third countries and higher than its buyer\u2019s other purchases. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff contends that Commerce erred in its price analysis in comparing the price of the entry with the AUVs of the other Chinese entries during the POR. Chenhe insists that Commerce should have instead compared the price of the entry to other individual entries. Pl.\u2019s Br. 23 (\u201cThe bona tides of the Chenhe sale is based on the Department\u2019s determination as to whether the price is commercially reasonable \u2014 a determination which requires a comparison of that price to other prices which fall within the norm, regardless of their relationship to the average\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-4\">If Commerce had done so, plaintiff argues, it would have found that the price of other entries that were not found to be atypical had prices closer to Chenhe\u2019s price than to the AUV. Pl.\u2019s Br. 23. Put another way, plaintiff urges the court to find that Commerce should have compared the price of its single entry to other entries during the POR with prices more in line with the price of Chenhe\u2019s entry. Thus, plaintiff observes that a number of entries during the POR were relatively close to Chenhe\u2019s price, although no entry had a price as high as Chenhe\u2019s.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pl.\u2019s Reply Br. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-5\">Chenhe\u2019s argument is unconvincing. Commerce\u2019s use of AUV data has been upheld by this Court in the past because \u201cthe larger the sample, the less risk run that the sample chosen is extreme or unusual simply by chance.\u201d <em>Tianjin, </em>29 CIT at 267, 366 F. Supp. 2d at 1256. In other words, using the average of a large sample is a better indicator of normal activity than a comparison of a smaller number of selected sales. Here, Chenhe\u2019s price was dramatically higher than the AUV for other Chinese entries during the POR, as well as higher than the AUV for Chenhe\u2019s sales to third countries during the POR and its buyer\u2019s other purchases. While the sale price may well have been close to the high end of all Chinese sales during the POR, this evidence does little to detract from the conclusion that Ghenhe\u2019s sale was atypical of normal business practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-6\">Finally, plaintiff argues that the price of its entry included a premium to compensate Chenhe for agreeing to pay any antidumping duties.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As such, Chenhe maintains that the purchase price should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>be reduced to account for this premium.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Pl.\u2019s Br. 20. Chenhe\u2019s U.S. customer, however, would not respond to repeated questionnaires from Commerce and inquiries from Chenhe\u2019s counsel concerning the terms of the sale. As a result, Commerce could not substantiate the company\u2019s claim of an agreement relating to the antidumping duties. Ultimately, Commerce found that there was \u201cno evidence on the record of this review supporting Chenhe\u2019s claim that its U.S. customer agreed to pay a higher premium in exchange for Chenhe\u2019s agreement to act as the [importer of record] and be responsible for the [antidumping duty] liability.\u201d Issues &amp; .Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-5\">In disputing this conclusion, plaintiff insists that the terms of the sale themselves \u201cconstitute the best evidence that the buyer and seller understood the significance of the [antidumping duty] liability when they negotiated the material terms of this transaction\u201d and that \u201c[t]here was simply no reason ... for Chenhe ... to submit any additional documentation to support the self-evident fact that.. . the price will be influenced by a decision as to which party assumes responsibility for this liability.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 20. In other words, Chenhe claims that the high price paid for the merchandise is substantial evidence that it included an amount to compensate plaintiff for assuming the burden of the duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-6\">The court finds that Commerce\u2019s decision not to credit plaintiff\u2019s argument that the purchase price should be reduced to compensate for antidumping duties is supported by substantial evidence. During the course of the review, Chenhe\u2019s U.S. purchaser refused to respond to Commerce\u2019s questionnaires regarding the negotiations leading up to the sale, and as to the terms of sale themselves. <em>See </em>CR Doc. Nos. 52, 63 (responses from U.S. customer to Commerce and Counsel for Chenhe regarding additional questionnaires). Nor would the purchaser answer questions posed by Chenhe\u2019s counsel. CR Doc. Nos. 52, 63. As a result, Commerce had no information before it concerning: (1) whether the sales price was increased to account for any antidumping duties to be paid by the seller; or (2) the amount by which the sales price was increased. Thus, there is nothing on the record to support plaintiff\u2019s terms of sale contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-7\">Further, the high price paid does not constitute evidence that there was an agreement to compensate plaintiff for assuming the anti-dumping duties, particularly because plaintiff has not made any representation as to the amount that plaintiff was supposed to be compensated. At oral argument, counsel for plaintiff was unable to offer the court any additional explanation of plaintiff\u2019s claim, nor a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>methodology by which to calculate the size of the claimed premium. Tr. of Conf. Or. Arg. at 47. As such, the court finds reasonable Commerce\u2019s decision not to reduce the entry\u2019s price in order to take the claimed terms of sale into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-4\">Ultimately, the court must hold that substantial evidence supports Commerce\u2019s finding that Chenhe\u2019s sale was not bona fide because it was not \u201ca good future indicator of Plaintiff\u2019s future sales in the market.\u201d <em>Tianjin, </em>29 CIT at 276, 366 F. Supp. 2d at 1263. The purpose of a new shipper review is to determine an individual antidumping margin for an importer that did not receive a separate rate under an antidumping duty order. In order to calculate an accurate antidump-ing duty margin for a new shipper, Commerce must examine sales data that is indicative of the respondent\u2019s normal business practices so as to judge its future commercial behavior. <em>Hebei, </em>29 CIT at 613, 374 F. Supp. 2d at 1342. If the evidence of the entry on the record is not indicative of typical business practices, no accurate individual rate can be set. Accordingly, in this case, the low quantity and high price for the single sale constitutes substantial evidence that the transaction could not be used as a basis for a separate rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the agency record is denied and Commerce\u2019s decision to rescind the new shipper review as to Chenhe is sustained.
