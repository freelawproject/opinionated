Reg. 47,198 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Sept. 15, 2009) (final admin, review) <em>(\u201cFinal Results\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Specifically, Plaintiffs present three arguments: (1) that the Department unlawfully refused to rely on certain double-bracketed business proprietary information in the. <em>Final Results; </em>(2) that Commerce should have found foreign producer Venus Wire Industries Pvt. Ltd. (\u201cVenus\u201d) and domestic purchaser AMS Specialty Steel (\u201cAMS\u201d) to be affiliated during the period of review; and (3) that the agency should have applied adverse facts available (\u201cAFA\u201d) to Venus. Pis. Br. 13-37. For the reasons below, Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments fail, and the court denies their motion for judgment on the agency record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-5\">I. Background &amp; Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-6\">In 1995, Commerce issued an antidumping duty order on stainless steel bar from India. <em>Stainless Steel Bar from Brazil, India and Japan, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 9661 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Feb. 21, 1995) (anti-dumping duty orders). Over a decade later, after receiving a timely request from Carpenter, the Department initiated an administrative review of Venus. <em>Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews, Requests for Revocation in Part, and Deferral of Administrative Review, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 16,837 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Mar. 31, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-7\">As a part of its review, Commerce asked Venus to answer various questionnaires. In its responses, Venus, which has participated in the review without counsel, referred to AMS as an unaffiliated customer and reported the export price of the subject merchandise that it sold to AMS. J.A. 63, 117. In response, Carpenter submitted comments to the Department which averred that AMS acted as a sales agent for Venus, pointing to the presence of AMS\u2019s customer names on purchase orders sent to Venus. J.A. 130. Venus replied, stating that formatting purchase orders in this manner allows it to fulfill the technical specifications, labeling, and marketing requested by AMS\u2019s custom\u00e9rs. J.A. 270-71. Venus also insisted that intermediate customers regularly provide steel suppliers with the names of the products\u2019 final third-party customers. J.A. 271. To eliminate confusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>over its purported affiliations, Venus further highlighted that it had no commission agreement with AMS. J.A. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-4\">Carpenter responded to this information by submitting 44 pages of comments, including 15 pages of double bracketed proprietary evidence that it believed demonstrated a principal/agent relationship between Venus and AMS. J.A. 325-69. Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(b)(l)(B) and 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.304(a)-(b), the Department could not release the proprietary information to Venus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, the agency notified Carpenter that it would not base its determination on the double bracketed information because of due process concerns, since Venus could not respond to the allegations against it. <em>See </em>J.A. 522-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-5\">In March 2009, Commerce published its preliminary results, <em>Stainless Steel Bar from India, </em>74 Fed. Reg. 9787 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Mar. 6, 2009) (prelim, admin, review), and issued its final results six months later.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See generally Final Results; see also Issues and Decision Memorandum for 2007-2008 Antidumping Duty Administrative Review of Stainless Steel Bar from India, </em>A-533 \u2014 810 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Sept. 2, 2009) <em>(\u201cIssues &amp; Decision Mem\u201d). </em>The Department determined that AMS acted as an independent reseller and, therefore, did not qualify as an affiliate of Venus. <em>Final Results, </em>74 Fed. Reg. at 47,199; <em>Issues &amp; Decision Mem. </em>at 7-10. Commerce based its conclusions about the use of Carpenter\u2019s double bracketed information on the same due process concerns as before. <em>Issues &amp; Decision Mem. </em>at 31-32. Finally, Commerce declined to apply AFA to Venus because the agency found that it had the relevant information necessary to make accurate calculations and that any minor deficiencies in Venus\u2019s submissions did not impede the review or show that the company failed to act to the best of its ability. <em>Id. </em>at 11-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-6\">II. Subject Matter Jurisdiction &amp; Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-7\">The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c). The court will disturb a Commerce determination only when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>\u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-4\">Substantial evidence on the record constitutes \u201cless than a preponderance, but more than a scintilla.\u201d <em>Novosteel SA v. United States, </em>25 CIT 2, 6, 128 F. Supp. 2d 720, 725 (2001) (citation &amp; quotation marks omitted), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>284 F.3d 1261 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The requisite proof amounts to \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d in light of the entire record, including \u201cwhatever fairly detracts from the substantiality of the evidence.\u201d <em>Atl. Sugar, Ltd. v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (footnote &amp; quotation marks omitted). This standard necessitates that the Department thoroughly examine the record and \u201carticulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (citation &amp; quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Bando Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 133, 136-37, 787 F. Supp. 224, 227 (1992). That the court may draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not preclude Commerce from supporting its determination with substantial evidence. <em>Thai Pineapple Pub. Co. v. United States, </em>187 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-6\">A. Commerce\u2019s Refusal to Use Plaintiffs\u2019 Double Bracketed Submissions</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-7\">A party to an administrative proceeding may submit two types of business proprietary information to Commerce. <em>See generally </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(b); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.304(a). If a submitting party sets off the proprietary information with single brackets, then Commerce discloses it during the course of the proceedings to all interested parties under an administrative protective order. \u00a7 1677f(b)(1)(B)(ii)(I) &amp; (c); \u00a7 351.304(b)(1); see <em>Allied Tube &amp; Conduit Corp. v. United States, </em>898 F.2d 780, 783 (Fed. Cir. 1990). The Department does not release the second type of information, which a party submits with double brackets, to interested parties under any circumstances. \u00a7 1677f(b)(1)(B)(ii)(II); \u00a7 351.304(b)(2); <em>see Allied Tube &amp; Conduit Corp., </em>898 F.2d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-8\">Plaintiffs challenge Commerce\u2019s refusal to consider the double bracketed information they submitted to demonstrate that Venus and AMS had' a principal/agent relationship. Pis. Br. 27 (citing J.A. 325-69). Although Plaintiffs chose to make this information exempt from release under an administrative protective order, and therefore unavailable for Venus or any other interested party\u2019s viewing, Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>tiffs insist that \u201cnothing in the statute or regulations permits the Department to disregard this information\u201d once placed on the record. Pis. Br. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-4\">This claim has no legal merit. Although the relevant statute and related regulations permit a party to submit business proprietary information not subject to release under an administrative protective order, Congress intended these exceptions \u201cto be very narrow and limited\u201d and \u201cto be used rarely, in situations in which substantial and irreparable financial or physical harm may result from disclosure.\u201d <em>Allied Tube &amp; Conduit Corp., </em>898 F.2d at 786 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 100-576 at 85 (1988) (Conf. Rep.), <em>reprinted in </em>1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1547, 1656); <em>see Issues &amp; Decision Mem. </em>at 31-32. In this case, however, Plaintiffs did not narrowly tailor their submissions to conceal, for example, the identity of market researchers, information sources, or customer names; rather, the submissions contained wholesale allegations challenging the truthfulness of Venus\u2019s questionnaire responses. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 346-47, 353-63, 365-67. This fact, in conjunction with Congess\u2019s mandate that substantive information submitted to Commerce during the course of the proceeding shall be subject to comment by other parties, supports the Department\u2019s refusal to countenance the information in the <em>Final Results. </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(g); <em>accord Issues &amp; Decision Mem. </em>at 31-32. If Commerce had relied upon Plaintiffs\u2019 double bracketed submissions, it would have unlawfully deprived Venus of its statutory right to comment on the allegations against it. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677m(g); <em>Mid Continent Nail Corp. v. United States, </em>34 CIT _, _, 712 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1375 (2010) (\u201cCongress has provided a fair process for commenting within the statutory language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>cf. Atar, S.r.L. v. United States, </em>33 CIT _, _, 637 F. Supp. 2d 1068, 1084 (2009) (affirming Commerce\u2019s decision not to use business proprietary information to make calculation when doing so would make information public). The Department\u2019s decision not to use Plaintiffs\u2019 double bracketed submissions in its determination comports with the relevant statute and controlling regulations, and the court affirms the Department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-7\">B. The Department\u2019s Finding of No Principal/Agent Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-8\">In the antidumping context, Congress has defined \u201caffiliated persons,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201c[a]ny person who controls any other person and such other person.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(33)(G); <em>accord </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.102(b)(3). The requisite control exists \u201cif the person is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>other person.\u201d \u00a7 1677(33); <em>accord Chia Far Indus. Factory Co. v. United States, </em>28 CIT 1337, 1348 n.9, 343 F. Supp. 2d 1344, 1357 n.9 (2004) (citing <em>Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Statement of Administrative Action, </em>H.R. Doc. No. 103316, vol. 1, at 838 (1994), <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4040, 4174-75). When determining whether parties qualify as affiliated in the absence of an explicit agency agreement, Commerce examines the totality of the circumstances and considers</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1509-4\">1) the foreign producer\u2019s role in negotiating price and other terms of sale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1509-5\">2) the extent of the foreign producer\u2019s interaction with the U.S. customer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1509-6\">3) whether the agent/reseller maintains inventory;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1509-7\">4) whether the agent/reseller takes title to the merchandise and bears the risk of loss;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1509-8\">5) whether the agent/reseller further processes o[r] otherwise adds value to the merchandise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1509-9\">6) the means of marketing a product by the producer to the U.S. customer in the pre-sale period; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1509-10\">7) whether the identity of the producer on sales documentation inferred such an agency relationship during the sales transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1509-11\"><em>Chia Far Indus. Factory Co., </em>28 CIT at 1349 n.10, 343 F. Supp. 2d at 1358 n.10 (citation omitted); <em>see id. </em>at 1350, 343 F. Supp. 2d at 1358 (quotation omitted) (citing \u00a7 351.102) (listing similar set of four factors agency may consider in affiliated persons evaluation).</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-12\">Plaintiffs contend that the Department improperly found no <em>de facto </em>principal/agent relationship between Venus and AMS.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Pis. Br. 10-11, 16-24. In their brief, Plaintiffs trace the seven-part test delineated above and state that each factor suggests that such a relationship existed between the companies. On the first prong, they claim that \u201cthe only evidence on the record show[s] that Venus [ ] was actively involved in the negotiations by AMS with the ultimate U.S. customer.\u201d Pis. Br. 17. According to Plaintiffs, Venus [\u00b6] had influence over.AMS ]]. Pis. Br. 18 (citing J.A. 345-69, 380-81, 491-500, 502-07). Plaintiffs next highlight, in examining the second prong, that Venus interacted with final, third-party U.S. customers, Pis. Br. 19 (citing J.A. 130, 143-62), and that Venus even directly contacted them on multiple occasions. Pis. Br. 19 (citing J.A. 364-69). To bolster their argument that Venus had sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>nificant interactions with AMS\u2019s domestic customers, Plaintiffs specifically point to AMS\u2019s custom of providing Venus with the names AMS\u2019s customers. Pis. Br. 19. Plaintiffs believe that AMS had \u201cno commercial reason\u201d to disclose its U.S. customers to Venus if the two companies truly conducted their transactions at arm\u2019s-length. Pis. Br. 19 n.29 (\u201c[T]he only reason for AMS to divulge the customer\u2019s identity to Venus [ ] is that AMS was acting primarily for the benefit of Venus [ ] and not itself.\u201d). With respect to the third factor, Plaintiffs note that AMS did not maintain inventory of the subject merchandise and had it shipped to the ultimate U.S. customer, evidence that purportedly bolsters a finding of an agency relationship. Pis. Br. 24 (citing J.A. 374). On the fourth factor, Plaintiffs proffer that AMS faced minimal financial risk in these transactions because AMS did not take physical possession of the merchandise and because Venus retained liability for merchandise quality problems, even though AMS took proper title to the merchandise. Pis. Br. 23 (J.A. 374). Plaintiffs contend that this risk minimalization should have led Commerce to find affiliation between the two companies. According to Plaintiffs, that AMS also did not process or add any value to the subject merchandise purchased from Venus supports the same affirmative affiliation conclusion on the fifth prong. Pis. Br. 24 (citing J.A. 271). Plaintiffs maintain on the sixth prong that AMS \u201cclearly marketed the subject merchandise on behalf of Venus\u201d because of AMS\u2019s status as [\u00b6] a large seller of Venus products ]]. Pis. Br. 21 (citing J.A. 364-69). Finally, on the last factor, Plaintiffs aver that U.S. consumers of the subject merchandise understood that AMS acted as Venus\u2019s domestic sales agent, pointing to, <em>inter alia, </em>Venus\u2019s letter notifying them that it would bypass AMS and begin working with them directly. Pis. Br. 21-22 (citing J.A. 345-69).</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-4\">Notwithstanding Plaintiffs\u2019 lengthy arguments to the contrary, Commerce did not err when it concluded that the two companies had no agency relationship. The Department notes that nothing on the record shows that Venus played a role in price negotiations between AMS and its domestic customers or that Venus paid AMS commissions for its subject merchandise sales. <em>Issues &amp; Decision Mem. </em>at 8 (citing J.A. 373-74, 441); <em>see </em>J.A. 306, 418, 984. Commerce also found that Venus had limited interaction with AMS\u2019s U.S. customers. <em>Issues &amp; Decision Mem. </em>at 8-9. While Venus knew the names of these customers from purchase orders, Commerce determined that this standard industry practice simply allowed Venus to produce the subject merchandise to the ultimate customers\u2019 technical specifications and label/marking requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9 (citing J.A. 372-73); <em>see </em>J.A. 270, 306. Moreover, the Department correctly concluded that Venus and AMS did not establish a principal/agent relationship when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>Venus notified AMS\u2019s customers by letter that it soon would begin selling its products through its new U.S. affiliate and no longer through AMS. <em>Issues &amp; Decision Mem., </em>at 9. Although Venus may have implied that AMS acted as its agent, Commerce agreed that \u201cbecause AMS had been servicing [Venus\u2019s] customers for quite a long time using Venus material, those customers may have had the <em>impression </em>that AMS represented Venus in the U.S. market.\u201d <em>Issues &amp; Decision Mem. </em>at 9 (citing J.A. 372-73) (emphasis added). The letter\u2019s use of the term \u201cagent\u201d cannot alone demonstrate that such a legal relationship existed. In that vein, the Department recognized that Venus never engaged in conduct typical of a principal, such as contacting the customers for the purpose of sales negotiations, presale discussions, or marketing. <em>Issues &amp; Decision Mem. </em>at 8-9; <em>see </em>J.A. 373. Finally, the Department noted that although AMS did not maintain an inventory or add any non-service value to the subject merchandise after purchase, it took title of the subject merchandise and bore the risk of loss. <em>Issues &amp; Decision Mem. </em>at 10 (citing J.A. 372-74); <em>see </em>J.A. 418. Examining the totality of these facts, the Department reasonably concluded that Venus and AMS did not have an agency relationship, and the court therefore affirms this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-4\">C. The Department\u2019s Decision Not to Apply AFA to Venus</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-5\">When conducting an antidumping duty administrative review, the Department uses facts otherwise available if a party, <em>inter alia, </em>withholds requested information, fails to timely or submit such information \u201cin the form and manner requested,\u201d or \u201csignificantly impedes\u201d the proceeding. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2). After making this finding, Commerce <em>\u201cmay\u201d </em>employ AFA against the party if the agency makes a separate finding that the \u201cparty has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information.\u201d \u00a7 1677e(b) (emphasis added); <em>accord Steel Auth. of India, Ltd. v. United States, </em>25 CIT 482, 488, 149 F. Supp. 2d 921, 929 (2001). If a party does not submit complete and accurate information due to \u201csimple inadvertence\u201d despite its ability to do so, the Department may apply AFA only once it shows \u201cwillfulness on the part of the [party] or behavior below the standard of a reasonable respondent.\u201d <em>Steel Auth. of India, Ltd., </em>25 CIT at 489 n.11, 149 F. Supp. 2d at 930 n.11 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-6\">Plaintiffs assert that Commerce should have applied AFA to Venus\u2019s antidumping duty margin calculation. In a laundry list of grievances, they allege that Venus wantonly violated the Department\u2019s procedural and regulatory requirements, filed numerous improper requests for extensions of time, and failed to place on the record nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>essary information which the agency requested. Pis. Br. 30-37. Plaintiffs, though not Commerce, argues that this purported behavior \u201c[significantly [i]mpeded [t]he Department\u2019s [r]eview.\u201d Pis. Br. 35. <em>But see Issues &amp; Decision Mem. </em>at 11-12, 14-15, 17-22; Def. Br. 25-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-4\">In light of the \u201cparticularly great\u201d deference granted to the Department\u2019s factual determinations when deciding whether to apply AFA to allegedly uncooperative respondents, <em>F.Lli de Cecco di Filippo Fara S. Martino S.p.A. v. United States, </em>216 F.3d 1027, 1032 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (citations omitted), and the near-frivolous quality of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, the court adopts Commerce\u2019s succinct and eloquent reasoning on this issue in full and affirms its refusal to apply AFA against Venus. <em>See Issues &amp; Decision Mem. </em>at 10-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-5\">IV.
