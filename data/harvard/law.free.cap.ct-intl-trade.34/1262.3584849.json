(\u201cPl.\u2019s Mem.\u201d). This is the third administrative review of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\">Using adverse facts available, the Department of Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d or the \u201cDepartment\u201d) applied a PRC-wide rate of 157.68 percent to plaintiff\u2019s merchandise in the Final Results. By its motion, plaintiff asks the court to instruct Commerce \u201cto treat Since Hardware as a company separate from [the] China-wide entity and calculate a margin specific to Since Hardware using the U.S. sales database and factors of production reported by Since Hardware, as was done in the preliminary results of this proceeding.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mem. 12-13. Defendant and defendant-intervenor oppose plaintiff\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Resp. Pl.\u2019s Mot. J. Agency R. (\u201cDef.\u2019s Resp.\u201d); Br. Home Products Int'l, Inc. Opp. to Pl.\u2019s Mot. J. Agency R. (\u201cDef.-Int.\u2019s Opp.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">The central question in this case is the lawfulness of Commerce\u2019s conclusion that the inaccuracies in plaintiff\u2019s questionnaire responses provided a sufficient basis for finding that Since Hardware provided \u2018\u201cunreliable and incomplete\u2019 documentation in support of its claimed purchase of market economy materials\u201d and that \u201cthe nature of the unreliable submission called into question the reliability of questionnaire responses submitted by Since Hardware in the review, including its claim of eligibility for separate rate status.\u201d Def.\u2019s Resp. 15 (citing Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) and 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(iii) (2006).

Legal Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">A. Presumption of State Control and Commerce\u2019s Preliminary Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">Plaintiff operates in the PRC. As a result of the PRC\u2019s status as a non-market economy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> country, its domestic companies are presumed to be part of the state-wide entity. <em>See Sigma Corp. v. United States, </em>117 F.3d 1401, 1405-06 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (\u201c[I]t was within Commerce\u2019s authority to employ a presumption of state control for exporters in a nonmarket economy, and to place the burden on the exporters to demonstrate an absence of central government control.... Moreover, because exporters have the best access to information pertinent to the \u2018state control\u2019 issue, Commerce is justified in placing on them the burden of showing a lack of state control.\u201d (citing <em>Zenith Elecs. Corp. v. United States, </em>988 F.2d 1573, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). The presumption, however, can be rebutted. <em>See id. </em>at 1405 (\u201c[T]he Court of International Trade has ruled that an exporter in a nonmarket economy country must \u2018affirmatively demonstrate\u2019 its entitlement to a separate, company-specific margin by showing \u2018an absence of central government control, both in law and in fact, with respect to exports.\u2019 Absence of de jure government control can be demonstrated by reference to legislation and other governmental measures that decentralize control. Absence of de facto government control can be established by evidence that each exporter sets its prices independently of the government and of other exporters, and that each exporter keeps the proceeds of its sales.\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">In this review, Since Hardware provided information relating both to its separate rate status and the price of its manufacturing inputs from claimed purchases from market economy sources. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Resp. 3-4 (citing questionnaire responses). In the preliminary results, based on the company\u2019s questionnaire responses, Commerce found that the company had demonstrated the absence of de jure and de facto government control over its activities, and thus was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>to separate rate status. <em>See </em>Floor-Standing, Metal-Top Ironing Tables and Certain Parts Thereof From the PRC, 73 Fed. Reg. 52,277, 52,279 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Sept. 9, 2008) (preliminary results) (\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d). Also in the Preliminary Results, the Department calculated an antidumping duty rate of 1.53 percent, based, in part, on the prices from the claimed market economy purchases. Preliminary Results, 73 Fed. Reg. at 52,280-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\">B. Factors of Production</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">Because Commerce has found the PRC to be a non-market economy, 19 U.S.C \u00a7 1677(18) requires the Department, when calculating an antidumping duty margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to determine normal value on the basis of the factors of production used in producing the subject merchandise. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1). To value the factors of production, Commerce generally uses prices or costs from a market economy country that is at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmar-ket economy country, and which is a significant producer of comparable merchandise. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(4), Accordingly, Commerce normally uses information and data from a surrogate market economy country to value the respondent\u2019s inputs used in the production of its merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">Commerce does not use surrogate values, however, if a respondent purchases inputs from a market economy country at the market economy purchase price. <em>See </em>Antidumping Methodologies: Market Economy Inputs, Exptected Non-Market Economy Wages, Duty Drawback; and Request for Comments, 71 Fed. Reg. 61,716, 61,716-19 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Oct. 19, 2006) (notice) (\u201cMarket Economy Inputs Methodology\u201d). As to these purchases, Commerce has instituted a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-7\">rebuttable presumption that market economy input prices are the best available information for valuing an entire input when the total volume of the input purchased from all market economy sources during the period of investigation or review exceeds 33 percent of the total volume of the input purchased from all sources during the period. In these cases, unless case-specific facts provide adequate grounds to rebut the Department\u2019s presumption, the Department will use the weighted-average market economy purchase price to value the entire input.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqmH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>Market Economy Input Methodology, 71 Fed. Reg. at 61,717-18. In other words, Commerce\u2019s policy is to presume that market economy purchase prices are the best available inform\u00e1tion, and thus, where possible, to use them to value the total quantity of an input.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">Here, in accordance with its policies, Commerce used the reported market economy purchase prices to value plaintiff\u2019s inputs of cold-rolled steel, hot-rolled steel, steel wire rod, powder coating, cotton fabric, springs, bolts, center nail and nail heads, rivets, cartons, corrugated paper, and labels. Def.\u2019s Resp'. (citing Preliminary Results, 73 Fed. Reg. at 52,280). Home Products International (\u201cHPI\u201d), the petitioner and currently the defendant-intervenor, challenged Since Hardware\u2019s market economy purchases, as it had in each of the prior segments of this antidumping duty order. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Resp. 4-5; Mem. to File Regarding July 15, 2008 and Aug. 7, 2008 Meetings with Fred Ikenson, dated Aug. 12, 2008, Public Record (\u201cPR\u201d) 47. Petitioner met with Commerce to discuss its concerns, and Commerce subsequently responded to this challenge by issuing five supplemental questionnaires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">As a result of these questionnaires, it came to light that the company had submitted false and fraudulent documentation regarding the country of origin and valuation of the claimed market economy purchases. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Resp. 5-14 (citing to record). Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXK\">The certificates submitted by Since Hardware relating to its claimed purchases of a steel input from a? market economy supplier are clearly not used by the regulatory agency responsible for certifying the origin of the input. These certificates constitute the entire basis for establishing that Since Hardware purchased the steel input from a market economy supplier. In its October 31,2008 .letter, the Department asked Since Hardware to explain the discrepancies detailed by Petitioner in the certificate of origin forms which Since Hardware submitted. However, Since Hardware failed to address the discrepancies ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1. The discrepancies, which have to do with the country of origin of various inputs, are further detailed in the Memorandum Regarding Since Hardware (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd.\u2019s Claim Re: Market Economy Purchases, and Use of Adverse Facts Available, dated Mar. 9, 2009, Confidential Record (\u201cCR\u201d) 870 (\u201cAFA Memo\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, Commerce found that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>identical typographical errors and other discrepancies appear on documentation submitted from multiple, independent, unaffiliated suppliers. Since Hardware has never explained the source of these typographical errors and discrepancies, and has provided no credible explanation as to why the same set of typographical errors appear in the documentation submitted from multiple independent, unaffiliated suppliers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\">Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1. In other words, Commerce found the forms submitted by Since Hardware' to substantiate its market economy purchases were fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">After the questionnaire responses revealed that the company\u2019s documentation of these inputs appeared to be false, Commerce asked for, among other things, mill certificates from the input manufacturers in order to determine the origin of the inputs (e.g., the steel) used in the production of the subject merchandise. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Resp. 12 (citing PR 73, CR 25). Since Hardware claimed it had no mill certificates to identify the type of steel it bought or, for that matter, to verify any of the other inputs it had purchased and used in its products. Def.\u2019s Resp. 6 (citing PR 48, CR 14). It further insisted that it relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>on its suppliers for country of origin information, and indeed, relied on its suppliers for all the documentation it submitted to Commerce. Def.\u2019s Resp. 12-13 (citing PR 61; CR 21).</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">The company then provided ledger entries that it claimed documented its purchases. Def.\u2019s Resp. 10 (citing PR 57; CR 19). The accounting ledgers included the disputed market economy purchases. AFA Memo at 11. With respect to these ledger entries, Commerce noted that they</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-5\">were purportedly associated with its market economy purchases ... which were consistent with \u201cthe now-discredited . . . documentation submitted by Since Hardware.\u201d Holding that \u201c[t]his evinces that the pervasive errors in the . . . documents infect Since Hardware\u2019s own books and accounting records,\u201d and that Since Hardware\u2019s accounting records \u201creflect unreliable and inaccurate information\u201d Commerce determined that it was unable to rely on the accuracy and validity of the data which Since Hardware retrieved from its accounting system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">Def.\u2019s Resp. 16-17 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-7\">When a respondent in an administrative review \u201csignificantly impedes\u201d the proceeding, Commerce is permitted to \u201cfill [ ] gaps in the record\u201d using facts otherwise available. <em>See </em>Statement of Administrative Action, Uruguay Round Agreements Act, accompanying H.R. Rep. No. 103-316, 656, 830-31 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C. C.A.N. 4040, 4199; <em>see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(C).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on the submission of false questionnaire responses, \u201cCommerce determined, pursuant to its statutory authority, to use facts otherwise available because Since Hardware withheld information requested by Commerce and significantly impeded the investigation.\u201d Def.\u2019s Resp. 18 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-8\">Once it has determined that the use of facts otherwise available is required, Commerce may make findings to determine if the \u201cuse [of] an inference that is adverse to the interests of [a respondent] in selecting from among the facts otherwise available,\u201d is authorized. Commerce may make an affirmative determination if it finds that the respondent \u201chas failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply\u201d with a request for information. <em>Nippon Steel Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>337 F. 3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003) <em>(\u201cNippon Steel\u201d); </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-4\">Because it found that, as a result of its unreliable questionnaire responses, plaintiff \u201cfailed to cooperate to the best of its ability,\u201d Commerce applied adverse facts available (\u201cAFA\u201d), and assigned an antidumping duty rate to the company that was equal to the highest rate calculated for a respondent in prior segments of the proceeding. Def.\u2019s Resp. 15 (citing Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1). Commerce explained: \u201cSince Hardware\u2019s conduct in this review . . . significantly impeded the proceeding\u201d by producing false information for market economy purchases that \u201cconstitute a major portion of the production inputs of the subject merchandise\u201d to the effect that the company\u2019s responses \u201care no longer reliable for purposes of determining Since Hardware\u2019s margin of dumping.\u201d AFA Memo at 10. Commerce then found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-5\">We have determined that the documentation submitted by Since Hardware to support its claimed purchases of market economy inputs to be unreliable and inaccurate. The deficiencies in Since Hardware\u2019s response establish a pattern of behavior that undermines the reliability and credibility of Since Hardware\u2019s entire questionnaire response, including Since Hardware\u2019s claim of eligibility for separate rate status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1. Commerce thus put aside the entirety of Since Hardware\u2019s submissions, including evidence relating to separate rate status, and assigned the PRC-wide entity antidump-ing duty rate of 157.68 percent. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Resp. 15, 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">In its motion for judgment on the agency record, plaintiff contends: (1) that Commerce should not have rescinded the separate rate status plaintiff was afforded in the Preliminary Results; and (2) that Commerce should have applied partial adverse facts available only to valuing the inputs found to be based on unreliable information, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>rather than total adverse facts available.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> PL\u2019s Mem. 11-13. In pleading its case, plaintiff does not contest the application of facts available, nor that partial adverse inferences should be applied. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">A. Separate Rate Status</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">In the Final Results, Commerce concluded that the \u201cunreliable and inaccurate\u201d information regarding market economy purchases called into question all of Since Hardware\u2019s responses including the record evidence regarding state control. An examination of the record, however, reveals that none of the unreliable information submitted by the company is relevant to the question of government control. That is, while many of plaintiff\u2019s answers to questions dealing with market economy purchases were untrue, there is nothing to suggest that the company was other than truthful when answering questions relating to government control. Put another way, the evidence that the company was not controlled by the government (e.g., documentation substantiating its claims that it is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise registered in PRC\u2014 such as the \u201cForeign Trade Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d and copies of its business licenses\u2014 and evidence regarding de facto control over its export activities) is far removed from questions relating to the origin of the factors of production and their cost. <em>See, e.g., </em>Preliminary Results, 73 Fed. Reg. at 52,278-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-7\">This Court has previously faced a similar situation relating to questionnaire responses. In <em>Qingdao Taifa Group Co. v. United States, </em>33 CIT _, 637 F. Supp. 2d 1231 (2009) <em>(\u201cQingdao\u201d), </em>the Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-8\">Commerce may not apply the PRC-wide rate as the AFA rate where AFA is warranted for sales and [factors of production] data, but the respondent has established independence from government control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-9\">33 CIT at _, 647 F. Supp. 2d at 1240-41 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-10\">In <em>Qingdao, .as </em>here, Commerce found an absence of government control in the preliminary results, and subsequently discovered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>respondent\u2019s failure to report accurately factors of production data. The Court remanded the matter to Commerce to determine whether substantial evidence supported a finding of government control, and stated that if there was a sufficient link to the PRC, Commerce could apply the PRC-wide rate; if not, Commerce was directed to calculate a separate AFA rate for the respondent. <em>Qingdao, </em>33 CIT at _, 637 F. Supp. 2d at 1240-41, 1244; <em>see Gerber Food (Yunnan) Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 753, 772, 387 F. Supp. 2d 1270, 1287 (2005) (\u201cGerber\u201d) (finding application of adverse facts available unsupported by substantial evidence where Commerce imposed a rate that presumed government control when respondent was found to be independent of government control); <em>Shandong Huarong Gen. Group Corp. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 1568, 1595-6 (2003) (not reported in Federal Supplement) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">Similarly, here, Commerce has found that Since Hardware\u2019s responses failed to report accurately information, such as prices and country of origin, for inputs purchased in market economy countries. The Department, however, made no specific finding that the responses concerning state control were inaccurate. When, as here, the use of AFA is justified, Commerce may \u201cuse an inference that is adverse to the interests of [a respondent] in selecting among the facts otherwise available.\u201d <em>Nippon Steel, </em>337 F. 3d at 1381; 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b). When making this selection, however, Commerce may not stray too far from the questionnaire responses that justified the use of AFA. Neither Commerce nor defendant-intervenor has presented any information tending to lead to the conclusion that Since Hardware\u2019s questionnaire responses relating to government control were other than truthful. Consequently, remand is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">B. Adverse Facts Available Applied to Entirety of Since Hardware\u2019s Responses</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-8\">As previously noted, by rejecting all of the company\u2019s questionnaire responses, Commerce applied inferences adverse to Since Hardware's interests in selecting from the facts available. Def.\u2019s Resp. 15 (citing Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comm. 1). Since Hardware contends that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-9\">is no[t] challenging either the Department\u2019s determination to apply facts available or the Department\u2019s determination to utilize an adverse inference as to Since Hardware in the application of facts available. Since Hardware is challenging only the manner in which the Department applied adverse facts available to Since Hardware.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1293-10\">Pl.\u2019s Mem. 11. Specifically, the company contends that Commerce overreached by finding that its production information was unreli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>able not only as to the country of origin and cost of its factors of production, but also as to the identification of each factor and its quantity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-4\">The record in this case established that the Department may have been correct in determining that it was appropriate for the Department to rely upon facts available and to make adverse inferences with respect to Since Hardware\u2019s reported market economy purchases. However, under the statutory scheme, the Department\u2019s application of adverse facts available should have been limited strictly to the offending information. The Department\u2019s application of total adverse facts available, and its rejection of all of Since Hardware\u2019s responses, overreached the manner in which the statute authorizes the application of adverse facts available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">Pl.\u2019s Mem. 20. Therefore, while Since Hardware does not dispute that the information it submitted as to the country of origin and valuation of certain inputs was unreliable, it objects to Commerce extending its finding of unreliability to all of plaintiff\u2019s other factors of production responses. Accordingly, plaintiff argues, the court should \u201cremand the action to the Department with instructions for the Department to apply partial adverse facts available and limit the impact of adverse facts available only to the offending information relating to Since Hardware\u2019s market economy purchases.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mem. 20. Plaintiff further contends that Commerce, rather than being permitted to assign a rate, should be instructed to use surrogate values to value Since Hardware\u2019s other reported factors of production and then calculate an individual rate for the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">Commerce submits that its determinations are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-7\">Since Hardware submitted contradictory and unreliable information and these discrepancies permeated Since Hardware\u2019s responses. By including the discredited and unsubstantiated market economy purchase prices in its accounting ledgers, Since Hardware rendered its entire submission inaccurate. By failing to adequately explain the discrepancies in its supporting documentation to Commerce and provide requested alternative documentation, Since Hardware failed to cooperate with the administrative review. Accordingly, Commerce applied total adverse facts available to Since Hardware.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">Def.\u2019s Resp. 21. Further, Commerce found that the \u201cproblems with the market economy input purchases pervaded Since Hardware\u2019s entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>responses.\u201d Def.\u2019s Resp. 16 (citing AFA Memo at 11). Indeed, Commerce points out that after it questioned Since Hardware\u2019s early submission, the company</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-4\">provided copies of ledger entries that were purportedly associated with its market economy purchases . . . , which were consistent with \u201cthe now-discredited . . . documentation submitted by Since Hardware.\u201d Holding that \u201c[t]his evinces that the pervasive errors in the . . . documents infect Since Hardware\u2019s own books and accounting records,\u201d and that Since Hardware\u2019s accounting records \u201creflect unreliable and inaccurate information [,]\u201d Commerce determined that it was unable to rely on the accuracy and validity of the data which Since Hardware retrieved from its accounting system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Def.\u2019s Resp. 16-17 (internal citations omitted). Consequently, Commerce insists that it cannot rely on Since Hardware\u2019s submission in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">The court finds that Commerce\u2019s use of AFA to assign a dumping rate to Since Hardware\u2019s merchandise is in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence. First, it is clear that the Department acted reasonably in determining that it could not rely on the material the company placed on the record relating to the country of origin and valuation of the factors of production. Plaintiff submitted forged and altered documents on its market economy-purchases. Then it submitted accounting ledgers that contained information taken from the forged and altered documents. As Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae4\">Since Hardware submitted contradictory and unreliable information and these discrepancies permeated Since Hardware\u2019s responses. By including the discredited and unsubstantiated market economy purchase prices in its accounting ledgers, Since Hardware rendered its entire submission inaccurate. By failing to adequately explain the discrepancies in its supporting documentation to Commerce and provide requested alternative documentation, Since Hardware failed to cooperate with the administrative review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">Def.\u2019s Resp. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">Here, Commerce\u2019s determination rests on credibility. This Court in <em>Shanghai Taoen Int\u2019l Trading Co. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 189, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1339 (2005) <em>(\u201cShanghai Taoen\u201d), </em>upheld the application of \u00e1dverse facts available to an entire submission in similar circumstances. The Court noted that the application of partial adverse facts available was not appropriate because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>[t]his is not a case of partial gaps in the record. Commerce determined that [respondent] failed to provide a credible explanation for the inconsistencies between Customs\u2019 entry documents and [respondent\u2019s] questionnaire responses which concerned the identity of suppliers. Such information is core, not tangential, and there is little room for substitution of partial facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\"><em>Shanghai Taoen, </em>29 CIT at 199 n.13, 360 F. Supp. 2d at 1348 n.13. As in <em>Shanghai Taoen, </em>here the missing information on production inputs goes to the core of the antidumping duty rate determination, i.e., the inputs at issue are a \u201cmajor portion of the production inputs of the subject merchandise.\u201d AFA Memo at 10. Since Hardware insists that its sales and factors of production data were not tainted by its market economy input purchases. However, the unsubstantiated market economy purchase prices were included in Since Hardware\u2019s accounting ledgers, themselves found to \u201creflect unreliable and inaccurate information.\u201d AFA Memo at 11. This being the case, it can hardly be said that Commerce was unreasonable in determining not to rely on these documents. Thus, the court finds that, given the pervasiveness of the inaccuracies in Since Hardware\u2019s questionnaire responses, Commerce acted reasonably in determining it could not rely on any of the company\u2019s financial information. Accordingly, Commerce\u2019s application of adverse facts available to all of plaintiff\u2019s input submissions is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the court grants plaintiff\u2019s motion, in part, and remands a portion of Commerce\u2019s determination. On remand Commerce shall reexamine the record to again determine if Since Hardware has produced evidence sufficient to qualify for application of a separate rate. In doing so, Commerce may not assume that the portion of the record Court No. 09-00123 Page 23 relating to independence from government control has been impacted by Since Hardware\u2019s questionnaire responses to unrelated matters. If the record supports application of a separate rate, Commerce must determine a separate AFA rate for Since Hardware; if not, Commerce may apply the PRC-wide rate. The remand results shall be due on January 27, 2011; comments to the remand results shall be due on February 28, 2011; and replies to such comments shall be due on March 14, 2011.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1286-8\"> A non-market economy includes \u201cany foreign country that the administering authority [Commerce] determines does not operate on market principles of cost or pricing structures, so that sales of merchandise in such country do not reflect the fair value of the merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(18)(A); <em>Shandong Huarong Gen.
