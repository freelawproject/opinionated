(\u201cPresitex\u201d) and United States Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCustoms\u201d) regarding the classification of certain apparel that Presitex imported from Nicaragua in 2005. Pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(5) of the United States Court of International Trade, Defendant United States (\u201cDefendant\u201d) has moved to dismiss this action \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter\u201d and \u201cfor failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Memorandum in Support of Its Motion to Dismiss (\u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion\u201d) at 1. Because this court lacks jurisdiction over Presitex\u2019s 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d) claim and will not exercise whatever jurisdiction it may have over Presitex\u2019s unripe 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4034 claim, Defendant\u2019s motion is GRANTED and this action is dismissed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b82-16\">In September 2005, Presitex<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed entry summaries and paid estimated duties of 16.6 percent ad valorem at the Port of Los Angeles-LAX for seven entries (\u201cthe subject entries\u201d) of apparel from Nicara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>gua (\u201cthe subject goods\u201d) that it classified under subheading 6204.62.40 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (\u201cHTSUS\u201d). <em>See </em>Defendant\u2019s Motion Ex. 1: Entry Summaries for Entry Nos.

Customs denied each protest on receipt as \u201c[u]ntimely filed\u201d. <em>Id. </em>More than one year later, Presitex filed another protest covering all seven adjustment decisions. <em>See </em>U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Protest No. 2720-08-100289 (May 27, 2008). Customs again denied this protest on receipt as untimely. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">In July 2008, Presitex sent a letter to Customs requesting reliqui-dation of the subject entries and \u201crefunds of duty and interest . . . pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d).\u201d Defendant\u2019s Motion Ex. 4: Letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>from Peter S.

In September 2008, Customs directed Presitex to withdraw the letter and resubmit it at the Port of Los Angeles-LAX, the port at which the subject goods had been entered. <em>See </em>Defendant\u2019s Motion at 5. When Presitex resubmitted the letter that month, Customs returned it with an \u201cinsufficiency notice\u201d explaining that Presitex\u2019s two previous protests were untimely and noting a \u201c[p]ossible issue for the Court of International Trade.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019 [sic] Memorandum in Support of Its Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Response\u201d) Ex.

B: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Insufficiency Notice (September 26, 2008). Presitex commenced this action in October 2008 and asserted jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i). <em>See </em>Complaint for Damages (October 27, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On April 8, 2009, Presitex submitted an \u201cadministrative request for the retroactive application of [CAFTA-DR\u2019s] tariff provisions\u201d to the subject entries pursuant to the Customs regulation' implementing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4034. <em>See </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Ex.

In August 2005, Congress amended 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d) to reflect CAFTA-DR and enacted 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4034. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>See </em>Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, P.L. 109-53,119 Stat. 462 (August 2, 2005) (\u201cCAFTA-DR Act\u201d). In April 2006, CAFTA-DR entered into force with respect to Nicaragua. <em>See </em>Proclamation 7996 of March 31, 2006 To Implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement\" With Respect to Honduras and Nicaragua, 71 Fed.

As a result, Nicaragua no longer qualified as a CBTPA country for the purposes of CBTPA. <em>See </em>Proclamation 7996, 71 Fed. Reg. at 16,971.

Presitex\u2019s claim under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d) fails because it falls outside this court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i). <em>See infra </em>Part IV.A. Presitex\u2019s claim under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4034 fails because it is not ripe. <em>See infra </em>Part IV.B. Contrary to Presitex\u2019s apparent assertion, nothing in the Customs Modernization Act mitigates either of these threshold deficiencies. <em>See infra </em>Part IV.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Presitex\u2019s 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d) Claim Falls Outside This Court\u2019s Jurisdiction Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581 (i)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d) permits Customs to \u201creliquidate an entry to refund any excess duties . . . paid on a good\u201d if the good qualified under the CAFTA-DR Act\u2019s rules of origin \u201cat the time of importation,\u201d the importer files a claim \u201cwithin 1 year after the date of importation,\u201d and both the entry and the claim meet certain other requirements. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d); <em>see also </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.590. Such reliquidation may occur \u201cNotwithstanding the fact that a valid protest was not filed.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d). However, the refusal to reliquidate pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d) is itself a protestable decision. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(a)(7). 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d) makes no reference to CBTPA. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">Presitex cannot invoke this court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i) in order to challenge the denial of its 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d) request. Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i) \u201cmay not be invoked when jurisdiction under another subsection of [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581] is or could have been available, unless the remedy provided under that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>other subsection would be manifestly inadequate.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Custom Prods., Inc. v.

The \u201crefusal to reliquidate an entry under\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d) is susceptible to the filing of a protest. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(a)(7). Jurisdiction to review the denial of such a protest is in turn available under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a); <em>see also Thomson Consumer Elecs., Inc. v.

Plaintiff concedes that \u201cthe denial of a claim under [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d)] is a protestable decision\u201d and does not dispute the adequacy of this remedy. Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 5.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For these reasons, jurisdiction is not available under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Even if Presitex had exhausted its administrative remedies and then commenced an action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a), its claim under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(d) would still fail. The CAFTADR Act\u2019s rules of origin require that a qualifying good originate in \u201cone or more of the CAFTADR countries.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4033(b). These countries include Nicaragua \u201cfor such time as [CAFTA-DR] is in effect between the United States and that country.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4033(n)(2)(B). Presitex imported the subject goods from Nicaragua in August and September 2005. <em>See </em>Entry Summaries. CAFTA-DR entered into effect with respect to Nicaragua in April 2006, more than six months later. <em>See </em>Proclamation 7996, 71 Fed. Reg. at 16,971.

Such liquidation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>reliquidation is to occur \u201c[n]othwithstanding [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514] or any other provision of law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4034(a); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.625(a). 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514 references other bases for liquidation and reliquidation as well as a different section of the CAFTA-DR Act, but it is silent as to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4034. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(a), (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">This ambiguity has jurisdictional implications. If the refusal to reliquidate an entry under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4034 is not a protestable decision, then jurisdiction might exist under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i) to directly review that refusal. But if the refusal is a protestable decision, then jurisdiction would exist under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a) to review a denial of a protest to that refusal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a). In that case, as long as the remedy provided by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a) is not \u201cmanifestly inadequate,\u201d jurisdiction would not exist under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i). <em>Int\u2019l Custom Prods., </em>467 F.3d at 1327 (quoting <em>Norcal/Crosetti Foods, </em>963 F.2d at 359); <em>see also supra </em>Part IV.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Although courts would ordinarily \u201cask and answer\u201d the question of subject-matter jurisdiction, <em>Steel Co. v.

These prudential reasons include a desire to \u201cprotect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[E]ven in a case raising only prudential concerns, the question of ripeness may be considered on a court\u2019s own motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u201cIn determining whether an appeal from an administrative determination is ripe for judicial review,\u201d courts look \u201cto (1) \u2018the fitness of the issue for judicial decision\u2019 and (2) \u2018the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u2019\u201d <em>Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho, Ltd. v. United States, </em>529 F.3d 1352, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting <em>Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 148-149, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681 (1967) (discussing discretionary remedies)).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Presitex\u2019s 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4034 claim, however, does not even satisfy the prerequisite for this two-part test. Prior to April 2009, Customs had no opportunity to make any relevant administrative determination from which Presitex could have appealed, because Presitex did not request reliquidation of the subject entries pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4034.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Any claim based on Presitex\u2019s April 2009 request is not prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>erly before this court, since Presitex filed its complaint in October 2008 and has not sought leave to file a supplemental complaint pursuant to USCIT Rule 15(d). Moreover, any such claim would be inappropriate for. judicial review, as Customs has not yet made a final determination with respect to the underlying reliquidation request. <em>See supra </em>Part II; <em>see also Tokyo Kikai, </em>529 F.3d at 1362 (discussing the first prong of the ripeness test).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Presitex has not demonstrated that it would suffer hardship if judicial review is withheld. Its April 2009 request was still pending before Customs as of August 28,2009, <em>see supra </em>Part II, and dismissal for lack of ripeness does not preclude recourse to this court upon conclusion of the administrative process, <em>see </em>13B Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>(3d ed. 2004) \u00a7 3532.1 (\u201c[I]t should be clear that dismissal for lack of ripeness is not a decision on the merits for purposes of preclusion by judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Customs cannot have refused an administrative request that Pres-itex did not make, and this court cannot review an administrative determination that Customs has not yet made. Accordingly, Presitex\u2019s 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4034 claim is not ripe for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The Customs Modernization Act Does Not Support Presitex\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The Customs Modernization Act (\u201cMod Act\u201d), as Title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act is commonly called, made a number of changes to the statutory framework for Customs. <em>See </em>North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Title VI, P.L. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057 (December 8,1993). It required Customs to provide notice of and an opportunity for comment on certain proposed interpretive rulings and decisions that deviated from past practice or would limit the application of a court decision. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1625(c) &amp; (d). It also authorized Customs to \u201cmake available ... all information, including [that which is] necessary for- importers and exporters to comply with the Customs laws and regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1625(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">The Mod Act accordingly \u201cimplement [ed] the concept of \u2018informed compliance,\u2019 which is premised on the belief that importers have a right to be informed about customs rules and regulations, as well as interpretive rulings, and to expect certainty that the Customs Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>will not unilaterally change the rules without providing importers proper notice and an opportunity for comment.\u201d S. Rep. No. 103-189 at 64 (1993); <em>see also Int\u2019l Custom Prods., </em>549 F. Supp. 2d at 1390-94; <em>United States v. Optrex Am., Inc., </em>30 CIT 650, 667-68 (2006); <em>Am. Bayridge Corp. v. United States, </em>22 CIT 1129, 1144-52, 35 F. Supp. 2d 922 (1998) (subsequent history omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Presitex quotes similar language before asserting that Customs \u201chad the obligation to advise Presitex that it had to invoke section 1520(d) not section 1520(c)\u201d and \u201chad the obligation to inform Pres-itex that its claim must be made under CAFTA-DR.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 4.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As Defendant replies, however, \u201cPresitex provides no authority for [its] proposition that Customs has an obligation under the Mod Act to inform individual importers of errors in their legal strategy.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Reply at 11 (citing Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 3-4). In the case cited by Presitex, the concept of informed compliance assisted this court\u2019s interpretation of a particular provision of the Mod Act. <em>See Int\u2019l Custom Prods., </em>549 F. Supp. 2d at 1393-94 (holding in part that a Notice of Action issued by Customs \u201cwas an \u2018interpretive ruling or decision\u2019 within the meaning of\u2019 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1625(c)). In this action, Presitex neither argues that Customs failed to comply with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1625 nor explains how the concept of informed compliance is otherwise relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Presitex\u2019s implicit denial of its responsibility to understand its own legal remedies is even less persuasive because \u201cimporters are presumed to know the law.\u201d <em>Esso Standard Oil Co. (PR) v. United States, </em>559 F.3d 1297, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding in part that an importer\u2019s reliance on a Customs regulation that had been contravened by statute was a mistake of law rather than a mistake of fact under former 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(c)) (quoting <em>V.
