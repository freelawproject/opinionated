Conclusion........................ 1179</p>\n<p id=\"Auj\">Presently before the Court are Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Strike portions of the Second Amended Economic Loss Master Consolidated Complaint (hereinafter referred to, for the sake of simplicity, as \u201cthe Complaint\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as a related Request for Judicial Notice (\u201cRJN\u201d). <em>(See </em>Docket Nos. 580 (current operative Complaint on behalf of the domestic economic loss Plaintiffs), 734 (Notice of Motion to Dismiss), 735 (Notice of Motion to Strike), 736 (Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of both Motions) (hereinafter \u201cDefs.\u2019 Mem.\u201d), 738 (Request for Judicial Notice).) Previously, on November 30, 2010, the Court issued its Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Strike the Master Consolidated Complaint (\u201cMCC\u201d). <em>(See </em>Docket No. 510.) The Court granted leave to amend certain claims, <em>id., </em>and on January 10, 2011, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint, which the current Motions address. The Court considers the sufficiency of those amended allegations in light of the legal principles set forth at length in the Court\u2019s November 30, 2010 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"ANM\">At the outset, the Court\u2019s consideration of the issues presented by the present Motions is limited to those issues that are supported by the parties\u2019 arguments. The Court notes that in many instances, some of which are specifically referenced in this Order, <em>see e.g., infra </em>section VII.B, the bases for dismissal set forth in the Notice of Motion to Dismiss are far more numerous than those supported by legal argument and citation to the record in the Memorandum in Support of the Motions. The same is also true of the Notice of Motion to Strike. <em>(Compare, e.g., </em>Notice of Motion to Strike at 2-3) (moving to strike a number of allegations related to damages available under the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7\u00a7 1750, <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cCLRA\u201d) <em>with </em>Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 20-22 (limiting the discussion regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 CLRA claim to those allegations related to the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30101-30170 (\u201cTREAD Act\u201d)).) To the extent the Toyota Defendants\u2019 briefing does not focus on these issues, the Court does not considered them. Neither does the Court consider arguments raised for the first time in the Reply. <em>See, e.g., infra </em>n. 24; <em>Zamani v. Carnes, </em>491 F.3d 990, 997 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe district court need not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d). Finally, the Court declines the invitation, set forth in the Memorandum in Support of the Motions, to consider anew all the issues set forth in the Motions to Dismiss and Strike the MCC. <em>(See </em>Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 3 n. 3 &amp; 22 (asking that the Court \u201c[d]ismiss all claims as described in Toyota\u2019s prior motion to dismiss and strike briefing (Dkt. Nos. 332 and 450)\u201d).) In a 104-page Order, the Court previously ruled on these Motions. In litigation this complex, the parties must, at all times, precisely and concisely define the issues before the Court at any proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>This action arises out of Plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of vehicles designed, manufactured, distributed, marketed, and sold by Defendants Toyota Motor Corporation dba Toyota Motor North America, Inc.

The Court reiterates those allegations in this Order only to the extent necessary to give context to the Court\u2019s legal analyses. Below, the Court notes significant amendments to the allegations found in Plaintiffs\u2019 previous Complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-13\">Specifically, Plaintiffs<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> make additional allegations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1197-14\">\u2022 Each Plaintiff (including the non-consumer Plaintiffs) was exposed to Toyota advertising regarding the reliability and safety of Toyota vehicles; this exposure influenced each Plaintiffs decision to buy a Toyota vehicle, and if the SUA defect had been disclosed to them, each Plaintiff would not have purchased a Toyota vehicle and/or would have paid less for the vehicle. <em>(See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-64, 66-69, \u00b6 71 (G &amp; M Motors), \u00b6 74 (Green Spot Motors), \u00b6 76 (Auto Lenders Liquidation Center, Inc.), \u00b6 85 (Deluxe Holdings Inc.).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1197-15\">\u2022 Internal Toyota documents evidence specific examples of SUA events and Toyota\u2019s knowledge thereof.

Com.Code \u00a7 2608; (7) Violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301, <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cMMA\u201d); (8) Breach of Contraet/Common Law Warranty; (9) Fraud by Concealment; and (10) Unjust Enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-11\">II. <em>Request for Judicial Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-12\">In addition to the pleadings before the Court, the Toyota Defendants ask the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>Court to take judicial notice, \u201cas background material,\u201d of two publicly available documents issued by federal agencies that have investigated SUA events and Toyota\u2019s ETCS, as well as a related agency press release. <em>See </em>RJN (Docket No. 738) at 2 &amp; Exs. 1-3; Fed.R.Evid. 201(b)-(d) (providing for judicial notice of a fact \u201cnot subject to reasonable dispute ... that ... is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d). Specifically, the Toyota Defendants request judicial notice of (1) the Executive Summary and Findings of the NHTSA Report entitled, \u201cTechnical Assessment of Toyota Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) Systems,\u201d (2) the Executive Summary and Findings of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (\u201cNASA\u201d) Report entitled, \u201cTechnical Support to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the Reported Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC Unintended Acceleration (UA) Investigation,\u201d and (3) a NHTSA press release dated February 8, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">The Court denies the request for judicial notice. The materials filed by the Toyota Defendants go far beyond mere \u201cbackground material\u201d and instead implicate the key disputed factual allegations at issue in this action; as such, they are materials that are clearly \u201csubject to reasonable dispute\u201d and thus are not proper subjects of judicial notice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 201(b); <em>Suzuki Motor Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>330 F.3d 1110, 1137 (9th Cir.2003) (impliedly reject ing the proposition that conclusive weight should be given to conclusions drawn by NHTSA regarding vehicle rollover incidents); <em>Pina v. Henderson, </em>752 F.2d 47, 50 (2d Cir.1985) (\u201cThe more critical an issue is to the ultimate disposition of the case, the less appropriate judicial notice becomes.... A court should not go outside the record to supply a fact that is an essential part of a party\u2019s case unless the fact is clearly beyond dispute.\u201d) (internal citations omitted), <em>cited with approval in Clicks Billiards, Inc. v. Sixshooters, Inc., </em>251 F.3d 1252, 1267 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">III. <em>Article III Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">In the Court\u2019s November 30, 2010 Order, the Court held that economic loss injuries consisting of overpayment, loss in value, or loss in usefulness were sufficient to confer standing. (Docket No. 510 at 15-16.) In reaching this conclusion, the Court recognized that the inquiry into whether Plaintiffs sufficiently allege an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d for standing purposes is conceptually distinct from whether \u201cdamages\u201d are sufficiently alleged under a particular theory of liability. <em>See, e.g., Braden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 585, 591 (8th Cir.2009) (\u201cIt is crucial ... not to conflate Article Ill\u2019s requirement of injury in fact with a plaintiffs potential causes of action, for the concepts are not coextensive.\u201d); <em>Cole v. General Motors Corp., </em>484 F.3d 717, 722-23 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cWhether recovery for such a claim is permitted under governing law is a separate question; it is sufficient for standing purposes that the plaintiffs seek recovery for an economic harm that they allege they have suffered.\u201d); <em>Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG, </em>443 F.3d 253, 264-65 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[A]n injury-in-fact differs from a \u2018legal interest\u2019; an injury-in-fact need not be capable of sustaining a valid cause of action under applicable tort law.\u201d). Because several lead Plaintiffs alleged facts establishing overpayment, loss in value, or loss in usefulness, they satisfied Article Ill\u2019s injury-in-fact requirement. (Docket No. 510 at 24-25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">However, the Court also determined that some lead Plaintiffs failed to adequately allege a loss. <em>(Id. </em>at 26-28.) For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>example, the MCC contained the following allegation regarding Plaintiff Ebony Brown: \u201cPlaintiff Ebony Brown is a resident and citizen of Illinois. She owns a 2009 Toyota Camry.\u201d (MCC \u00b6 38.) While the MCC contained general class allegations that Plaintiffs overpaid for their vehicles, made lease payments that were too high, or sold their vehicles at a loss, and the Court accepted in principle that these allegations were sufficient to confer standing for the putative class, the Court held that lead Plaintiffs such as Ms. Brown, seeking to proceed as such, were required to allege specific facts to support a cognizable injury under Article III. (Docket No. 510 at 27-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">In the Complaint, Ms. Brown amends her allegations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1201-6\">Plaintiff Ebony Brown is a resident and citizen of Illinois. She owns a 2009 Toyota Camry. Ms. Brown saw advertisements for Toyota vehicles on television, in magazines, on billboards, in brochures at the dealership, on the Internet, in newspapers, and on banners in front of the dealership, during the two years before she purchased her Camry on July 26, 2008. Although she does not recall the specifics of the many Toyota advertisements she saw before she purchased her Camry, she does recall that safety and reliability were a consistent theme across the advertisements she saw. Those representations about safety and reliability influenced her decision to purchase her Camry. <em>Had those advertisements or any other materials disclosed that Toyota vehicles could accelerate suddenly and dangerously out of the driver\u2019s control and lacked a fail-safe mechanism to overcome this, she would not have purchased her Camry. She certainly would not have paid as much for it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">(\u00b6 40 (emphasis added).) The amended allegations of the other lead Plaintiffs previously dismissed in the November 30, 2010 Order closely track Ms. Brown\u2019s amended allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">Toyota contends that these amended allegations, including those of Ms. Brown, again fail to satisfy Article Ill\u2019s injury-in-fact requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\">A. <em>Summary of Parties\u2019Positions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-11\">Toyota argues that several Plaintiffs offer \u201cbare and conclusory allegations of economic injury that do not constitute sufficient factual allegations as to their own economic loss,\u201d and thus should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 14.) Specifically, Toyota objects to the repeated use of the emphasized language contained in Ms. Brown\u2019s allegations, <em>supra, </em>because this \u201cboilerplate overpayment language is nothing more than a bare conclusion,\u201d which is plainly deficient under <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal. </em>(Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 17-18 (citing <em>Bell Atl.

For example, Toyota notes that \u201cPlaintiffs allege that the 2007 Toyota Camry reduced in value $400 from January-April 2010,\u201d but Ms. Brown \u201cowns a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>2009 Toyota Camry and has not alleged that she tried to sell \u2014 let alone sold \u2014 her vehicle at a loss, nor does she allege that the vehicle has reduced in value <em>now </em>should she attempt to sell it now.\u201d (Reply at 15 (emphasis in original).) \u201cGeneral allegations of an alleged \u2014 and temporary, past \u2014 reduction in value simply do not relate to the value of Ms. Brown\u2019s individual vehicle.\u201d (Defs. Reply at 15.) To the extent that Plaintiffs rely on recalls of Toyota vehicles to support their \u201cmarket effect theory,\u201d Toyota submits that \u201cthe mere fact of a recall cannot create an inference that <em>all </em>Subject Vehicles reduced in value and cannot serve as a stand-in for a true factual allegation of economic injury for each named Plaintiff.\u201d (Reply at 15 (emphasis in original); Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 18 (\u201c[Alleging a loss of value solely on the fact of the Toyota UA recalls is not only a bare legal conclusion unworthy of any deference, but one that requires a leap of logic.\u201d).) If standing required only that an automobile manufacturer issued a recall to satisfy an injury in fact, \u201cvirtually every vehicle owner in the United States would be entitled to sue his or her automobile manufacturer.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">Plaintiffs respond that each Plaintiff individually alleges that he or she overpaid for his or her vehicle, and these allegations establish an injury in fact. (Opp\u2019n at 7.) The amended allegations address the flaw previously identified in the Court\u2019s November 30, 2010 Order, which stated that general allegations of economic harm \u201ccould not be construed to have been pleaded personally by each named plaintiff.\u201d (Opp\u2019n at 7.) Moreover, each Plaintiff identifies \u201cthe basis for that alleged overpayment \u2014 a vehicle with defects affecting the driver\u2019s ability to maintain speed control is not worth as much as a vehicle that is safe and reliable.\u201d (Opp\u2019n at 7.) For example, \u201cMs. Brown alleges she was personally exposed to advertisements that emphasized safety, explains that those motivated her to purchase her vehicle, and then concludes that she personally would not have purchased her vehicle or paid as much for it had she known the truth about the defects.\u201d (Opp\u2019n at 9.) In Plaintiffs\u2019 view, \u201c[t]his precise type of pleading was approved in <em>Kwikset.\u201d </em>(Opp\u2019n at 9) (citing <em>Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court, </em>51 Cal.4th 310, 325, 120 Cal.Rptr.3d 741, 246 P.3d 877 (2011).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 rely on <em>Kwikset </em>to rebut several of Toyota\u2019s other arguments concerning standing. Just as the California Supreme Court in <em>Kwikset </em>held that locks that were falsely advertised as being made in the United States were worth less to a consumer even if the locks were fully functional, so too have Plaintiffs alleged here that the alleged safety defects make Plaintiffs\u2019 vehicles worth less even if SUA has not yet occurred. (Opp\u2019n at 9.) Plaintiffs\u2019 personal allegations of overpayment are substantiated by specific allegations of diminution of value, and \u201crepeated recalls involving the most significant of safety concerns in millions of vehicles have driven down resale values and auction prices\u201d and is \u201cabsolutely pertinent to \u2018market effect.\u2019 \u201d (Opp\u2019n at 9-10.) Toyota\u2019s insistence that Plaintiffs provide \u201cproof-positive causation allegations [between the market effect of the SUA defect and their alleged injuries] is inappropriate at the pleadings stage,\u201d because \u201cthreats or potential of injury\u201d suffice \u2014 the \u201cinjury itself need be nothing more than a trifle.\u201d (Opp\u2019n at 10-11) (citing <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n v.

Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Moreover, on a motion to dismiss, courts must \u201cpresum[e] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, </em>497 U.S. 871, 889, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990)). Here, every Plaintiff alleges that his or her Toyota vehicle contains a defect; namely, the vehicles \u201caccelerate suddenly and dangerously out of the driver\u2019s control and lack[ ] a fail-safe mechanism to overcome this.\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6 36-69.) Virtually every Plaintiff alleges that he or she would probably not have purchased or leased his or her Toyota vehicle had the defect been known at the time of purchase, but certainly would not have paid as much for it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Taking these allegations as true, as the Court must at the pleading stage, they establish an economic loss. Plaintiffs bargained for safe, defect-free vehicles, but instead received unsafe, defective vehicles. A vehicle with a defect is worth less than one without a defect. The overpayment for the defective, unsafe vehicle constitutes the economic-loss injury that is sufficient to confer standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">1. <em>Plaintiffs Establish an Economic Loss by Plausibly Alleging a Safety Defect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">Toyota argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 repeated use of the same \u201coverpayment language is nothing more than a bare conclusion,\u201d which is deficient under <em>Tivombly </em>and <em>Iqbal. </em>The primary focus of <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal, </em>however, is on the pleading as a whole: does the pleading allege enough facts to plausibly infer that the pleader is entitled to relief? Pleadings containing conclusory claims \u2014 \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d and \u201cformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action\u201d \u2014 are insufficient. <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949 (citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., </em>631 F.3d 939, 955 &amp; n. 9 (9th Cir.2011) (denying standing for ADA claim in which plaintiff never specifically alleged what architectural barriers denied him \u201cfull and equal\u201d access and how his disability was affected by them). Moreover, a plausible injury cannot be alleged when a pleader is silent about \u201charm to its particular interests.\u201d <em>City of Kansas City, Mo. v. Yarco Co., </em>625 F.3d 1038, 1040 (8th Cir.2010) (\u201cThough the burden of showing injury at the pleading stage is low, the pleader must say something.\u201d). Thus, were Plaintiffs to offer conclusory allegations about the safety defect such that the Court could not discern a defect (other than the label attached to it), or if Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations about the alleged defect were implausible, or even if Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were predicated solely on the harm experienced by other Toyota owners, Plaintiffs\u2019 ability to allege an injury for standing purposes might be fatally undermined. However, once the safety defect is sufficiently and plausibly pled by all Plaintiffs, the economic losses resulting from the defect are readily established: defective cars are simply not worth as much.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-10\">As discussed in the Court\u2019s November 30, 2010 Order, and further discussed herein, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations about the safety defect are neither conclusory nor implausible. Nineteen of the thirty-four lead Plaintiffs<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> allege that they experienced the safety defect. For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>\u2022 Plaintiff Maureen Fitzgerald experienced the SUA defect twice in her 2009 Toyota Corolla LE. First, when she test drove the Corolla with the salesman, it accelerated at the corner to turn into a busy four-lane road. She slammed on the brakes and remarked that everything felt too \u201cloose,\u201d but the salesman told her that she just had to \u201cget used to it.\u201d Second, on October 6, 2010, having had the pedal-recall repair performed on her Corolla, the car suddenly accelerated and did not respond when she applied the brake. She swerved into a parking space to avoid hitting a pedestrian and another car, and hit the handicapped bar \u2014 nearly launching her dog through the windshield. (\u00b6 47.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-4\">\u2022 Plaintiff Matthew Heidenreich experienced three SUA incidents in his leased 2010 Toyota Corolla. First, on March 5, 2010, the car engine revved twice to 3000 RPM on its own while parked at a bank drive-through. Second, on April 1, 2010, after putting the car in park at the post office, the engine revved while he was out of the car. Third, on April 28, 2010, after backing the car out of the garage, the car idled at about 2000 RPM. He turned the engine off and back on. The tachometer redlined for three separate starts, and the engine \u201csounded like it was going to explode.\u201d (\u00b6 53.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-5\">\u2022 Plaintiff Carl Nyquist twice observed his 2006 Toyota Avalon increase idle speed to redline by itself while parked, even though he did not apply his foot to the accelerator. Additionally, while driving on the interstate with his wife at approximately 75 mph, the Avalon accelerated to 90 mph. He turned the car off and slowed to 75 mph, but then turned the car back on and it again accelerated to 90 mph. After turning the car off and on again, the Avalon accelerated normally. (\u00b6 58.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-8\">\u2022 Plaintiff Peggie Perkin was involved in a collision as a result of SUA in her 2005 Lexus ES 330. On May 24, 2010, she was driving between 5 and 10 mph in a parking lot when the engine revved and the car suddenly accelerated rapidly to 35 mph despite application of the brakes. She made a 90-degree turn to avoid a collision with vehicles and pedestrians, hit three cars, and then stopped. She tried to turn off the car with such force that the key broke. (\u00b6 59.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-9\">\u2022 Plaintiff Barbara J. Saunders experienced collisions as a result of SUA in her 2006 Toyota Avalon and 2009 Toyota Matrix. On May 3, 2008, the Avalon suddenly accelerated, causing her to lose control of her vehicle and skid into a guardrail and concrete divider. On February 2, 2009, the Matrix suddenly accelerated, causing her to rear-end a pick-up truck. On March 11, 2010, she experienced a second SUA incident in her Matrix. (\u00b6 63.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1204-10\">When read as a whole, the specific allegations of Plaintiffs Fitzgerald, Heidenreich, Nyquist, Perkin, and Saunders, as well as those of the other fourteen lead Plaintiffs who experienced SUA,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> combined with the detailed allegations concerning SUA and its possible causes <em>(see, e.g., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 173-341, 348-367), plausibly establish a safety defect. <em>Braden, </em>588 F.3d at 594 (\u201c[T]he complaint should be read as a whole, not parsed piece by piece to determine whether each allegation, in isolation, is plausible.\u201d) While Toyota also takes issue \"with Plaintiffs\u2019 general allegations that they \u201coverpaid\u201d for their allegedly defective vehicles, general factual allegations of injury <em>(i.e., </em>the overpayment) suffice at the pleadings stage because courts must \u201cpresum[e] that general allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Because every lead Plaintiff alleges a safety defect, and defective cars are not worth as much as defect-free cars, Plaintiffs plausibly establish an economic loss.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">2. <em>The Economic Loss Ensuing from the Safety Defect Is Actual or Imminent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">Toyota also argues that any injury resulting in loss or overpayment that is tied to a \u201cmarket effect\u201d must occur at the time of purchase, but that Plaintiffs \u201cfailed to provide any factual allegations as to how the general \u2018market effect\u2019 actually resulted in them overpaying for their vehicle.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 18 (emphasis omitted).) But this argument succeeds only if one assumes that a plaintiff who has not <em>experienced </em>a safety defect <em>does not have </em>a safety defect. If the Court accepts the allegations that all Toyota vehicles had the safety defect at the time of purchase, and the defects were not subsequently remedied through recalls, all Plaintiffs suffered an economic loss at the time of purchase because they received a defective vehicle. The fact that Plaintiffs discovered this defect after the time of purchase is of no moment. The economic loss was present from the beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">The Court has also considered a variation of Toyota\u2019s argument that would require more detailed factual allegations tied to a market effect from those Plaintiffs who have not experienced a safety defect. This line of reasoning begins with the proposition that buyers\u2019 remorse is insufficient to confer standing. Merely alleging that a car is an overpriced \u201clemon\u201d is insufficient when there are no allegations of a \u201cmalfunction\u201d (as opposed to allegations of a \u201cdefect\u201d). After all, if Plaintiffs do not allege that they experienced a safety defect, do not allege that they tried to sell or trade in the vehicle at a loss, and do not allege that they have stopped using the vehicle owing to the safety defect, how plausible are allegations of \u201coverpayment, loss in value, or loss of usefulness\u201d? <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>der this logic, allegations of overpayment would be plausible only if Plaintiffs presented an additional, objective basis to substantiate their allegations of overpayment. For example, the Court previously held the following allegation sufficiently alleges a cognizable loss under Article III:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAfj\">Plaintiff Richard Benjamin is a resident and citizen of Missouri. He owns a 2007 Toyota Sienna. Mr. Benjamin began investigating a trade of his 2007 Sienna for a 2011 Sienna just before the recalls were made public. He has seen the trade-in value drop $2,000 since the recalls according to KELLEY BLUE BOOK, NADA GUIDE, and Edmunds.com.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">(MCC \u00b6 35; Docket No. 510 at 24.) Although Mr. Benjamin did not state that he experienced a safety defect, he plausibly established an economic loss by alleging that he saw the trade-in value of his 2007 Toyota Sienna drop according to various sources \u201conce the recalls were made public.\u201d In essence, Mr. Benjamin alleged an objective basis to substantiate his overpayment injury based on the market effect of the safety defect. <em>{See </em>Docket No. 510 at 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">While factual allegations tying an economic loss to a \u201cmarket effect\u201d are sufficient to establish an injury for standing purposes, they are not indispensable\u2014 even for those Plaintiffs who have not experienced the safety defect.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As long as Plaintiffs do not simply allege that their Toyota vehicles are \u201cdefective,\u201d but rather offer detailed, non-conclusory factual allegations of the product defect, the economic loss injury flows from the plausibly alleged defect at the pleadings stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">3. <em>All Lead Plaintiffs Do Not Establish Standing Based on a Credible Threat of Future Harm</em></p>\n<p id=\"ACl\">In the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-9\">Each of the plaintiffs who still own their vehicles face an increased risk of future harm that would not be present if defendants had not designed, manufactured and sold vehicles that had an unacceptable increased propensity for SUA and which lack an adequate override/fail-safe mechanism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1206-10\">(\u00b6 428.) Based on this allegation, Plaintiffs argue that all lead Plaintiffs have standing based on a credible threat of future harm.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>{See </em>Docket No. 510 at 14 n. 9.) The Court disagrees. Some lead Plaintiffs hkely allege sufficient facts to support standing on this basis. For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>\u2022 Plaintiff Dale Baldisseri alleges that he \u201cand his wife are afraid to drive the Canny because of its SUA defect, so the vehicle has remained parked since December 2009.\u201d (\u00b6 35.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-5\">\u2022 Plaintiff Connie A. Kamphaus alleges that she and her husband \u201cput the 2010 Camry in storage because they were afraid to drive it, and they had to purchase a replacement vehicle.\u201d (\u00b6 54.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-6\">\u2022 Plaintiffs John and Mary Ann Laidlaw \u201cwere afraid to drive the vehicle\u201d and \u201csurrendered the vehicle by leaving it in the dealer\u2019s lot.\u201d (\u00b6 56.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">Plaintiffs Baldisseri, Kamphaus, and Laid-law not only allege that they were afraid to drive their Toyota vehicles, but also allege that they stopped driving them as a result of this fear. These allegations provide a factual basis to support a credible threat of future harm for these Plaintiffs. However, as discussed in the November 30, 2010 Order, general allegations of an \u201cincreased risk of future harm\u201d are insufficient for other lead Plaintiffs seeking to proceed as such. (Docket 510 at 27-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">C. <em>Conclusion as to Article III Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-9\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs sufficiently allege an injury in fact to satisfy Article III standing. Plaintiffs bargained for safe, defect-free vehicles, but instead received unsafe, defective vehicles. The overpayment for the defective, unsafe vehicle constitutes an economic-loss injury that is sufficient to confer standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-12\">IV. <em>Standing to Assert UCL, FAL, and CLRA Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-13\">In its Motion, Toyota alleges that <em>\u201cnone </em>of the 50 named Plaintiffs have standing to bring the CLRA, UCL, and FAL statutory claims (Counts I \u2014 III), because they fail to sufficiently plead reliance and actual causation.\u201d (Notice of Motion to Dismiss at 2 (emphasis in the original).) However, Toyota has not provided any legal argument or citation to the record in its Memorandum to support this position. Given that the Court previously did not reach these issues, but instead expressly noted that \u201cthe AMCC makes significant changes to the named Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations with respect to actual reliance, which may moot Toyota\u2019s concerns,\u201d (Docket No. 510 at 31 &amp; n. 16), Toyota\u2019s failure to support its Motion with legal argument is inexplicable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On this basis alone, the challenges to Plaintiffs\u2019 standing under the UCL, FAL, and CLRA fails. <em>See </em>Local Rule 7-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>12 (\u201cThe failure to file any required paper, or the failure to file it within the deadline, may be deemed consent to the granting or denial of the motion.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">Additionally, the Court independently determines that Plaintiffs satisfy the standing requirements under the UCL, FAL, and CLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">A. <em>UCL and FAL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">1. <em>Plaintiffs Allege a Money or Property Loss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">The UCL and FAL provide a private right of action only if Plaintiffs have \u201csuffered injury in fact and [have] lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.\u201d Cal.

Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff must state \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955.

First, the Court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, but \u201c[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949. Nor must the Court \u201c \u2018accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1949-50 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Second, assuming the veracity of well-pleaded factual allegations, the Court must \u201cdetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1950. This determination is context-specific, requiring the Court to draw on its experience and common sense; there is no plausibility \u201cwhere the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-11\">B. <em>Motion to Strike Pursuant to Rule 120)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-13\">Under Rule 12\u00ae, a party may move to strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f). The grounds for a motion to strike must appear on the face of the pleading under attack, or from matters which the Court may take judicial notice. <em>SEC v. Sands, </em>902 F.Supp. 1149, 1165 (C.D.Cal.1995). The essential function of a Rule 12\u00ae motion is to \u201cavoid the expenditure of time and money that must arise from litigating spurious issues by dispensing with those issues prior to trial.\u201d <em>Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty, </em>984 F.2d 1524, 1527 (9th Cir.1993); <em>Sidney-Vinstein v. A.H. Robins Co., </em>697 F.2d 880, 885 (9th Cir.1983). Where a party moves to strike a prayer for damages on the basis that the damages sought are precluded as a matter of law, the request is more appropriately examined as a motion to dismiss. <em>See Whittlestone, Inc. v. Handi-Craft Co., </em>618 F.3d 970, 974-75 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cWe therefore hold that Rule 12\u00ae does not authorize district courts to strike claims for damages on the ground that such claims are precluded' as a matter of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-14\">VI. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 CLRA, UCL, and FAL Claims (First, Second, and Third Causes of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-15\">Toyota argues that the CLRA claim should be dismissed because Plaintiffs have failed to \u201csufficiently plead a duty to disclose material facts under the CLRA\u201d and because \u201cPlaintiffs fail to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>heightened pleading requirements for Fed. R.Civ.P. 9(b).\u201d (Notice of Motion to Dismiss at 3.) Toyota also seeks to dismiss the FAL claim because Plaintiffs \u201cfail to sufficiently allege any representations or omissions that are likely to deceive as a matter of law\u201d and because it believes that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b). <em>(Id.) </em>The Court has already made a determination about the pleading requirements of 9(b), finding that the fraud allegations \u201care properly pled under Rule 9(b).\u201d (Docket No. 510 at 39.) Nothing in the Complaint disturbs this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">To the extent Toyota seeks to dismiss these two claims because Plaintiffs fail to plead a duty to disclose material facts, representations or omissions, they have not supported these specific arguments in their Memorandum. (Docket No. 736.) Therefore, Toyota\u2019s Motion to Dismiss on this point is denied. More importantly, however, the Court has already determined that Plaintiffs allege viable claims under the CLRA and the FAL. (Docket No. 510 at 39-43, 47-49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-9\">The thrust of Toyota\u2019s present argument, therefore, lies with its Motion to Strike, in which Toyota asks the Court to strike two references to the TREAD Act, which is part of Plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action for violations of the CLRA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Toyota moves to strike the following: \u201c... and by selling vehicles while violating the TREAD Act .... \u201d and \u201c... selling vehicles in violation of the TREAD Act.\u201d (\u00b6 422.) Toyota also provides notice that it seeks to strike other parts of the Complaint, such as requests for damages and punitive damages pursuant to the CLRA claim,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but the Court does not address such issues since they are not addressed in the Memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-10\">The TREAD Act was enacted in 2000. The Act creates \u201cearly warning reporting requirements,\u201d in which automobile manufacturers must submit various types of data<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to NHTSA. <em>See, e.g., </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30166(m); <em>id. </em>at (m)(3)(A). Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>automobile manufacturers must submit, within five days of initiating a foreign recall on equipment identical or substantially similar to a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment offered for sale in the United States, a report to NHTSA. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30166(i )(1).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">Plaintiffs allege that on September 29, 2009, Toyota issued to distributors in thirty-one European countries a Technical Instruction (\u201cTI\u201d), identifying \u201ca production improvement and repair procedure to address complaints by customers in those countries of sticky accelerator pedals, sudden engine RPM increases and/or sudden vehicle acceleration. No disclosure of this TI was made to consumers or regulators in the U.S.\u201d (\u00b6 288.) Plaintiffs allege that on January 19, 2010, \u201ctwo days before initiating its safety-related recall on the sticky pedal issue,\u201d Toyota met with NHTSA, at NHTSA\u2019s request, to \u201cdescribe and discuss the sticky pedal phenomenon in Europe and the United States. Toyota continued to sell vehicles containing a safety-related defect between initiation of its European action on September 29, 2009, and its stop sale order issued in the United States on January 26, 2010.\u201d (\u00b6 293.) Plaintiffs allege that \u201c[b]y failing to disclose and actively concealing the SUA defect and the lack of adequate fail-safe mechanisms ... and by selling vehicles while violating the TREAD Act,\u201d Toyota engaged in deceptive business practices prohibited by the CLRA including \u201cselling vehicles in violation of the TREAD Act.\u201d (\u00b6422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-10\">Toyota argues that the TREAD Act allegations are \u201cwholly immaterial and unnecessary\u201d and should be stricken. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 21.) Toyota argues that only active misrepresentations can give rise to a CLRA claim, and here, Plaintiffs do not allege \u201cthat Toyota made any misrepresentations to consumers with respect to the TREAD Act.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 21.) Toyota argues that Plaintiffs must allege \u201cwhen, where or how TREAD Act regulations were communicated to consumers in connection with the sale of Toyota vehicles,\u201d and that Plaintiffs \u201care required to allege a deceptive or misleading representation to consumers regarding relevant TREAD Act standards\u201d in order to \u201cdeem[ ] pertinent or material\u201d the TREAD Act allegations to the CLRA claim. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 21-22; see <em>also </em>Reply at 17-18.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>) Toyota also argues that Plaintiffs cannot bring a CLRA claim on the basis of the TREAD Act because the Act requires the manufacturer make disclosures to NHTSA, not the public, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>therefore the public cannot be misled by disclosures to NHTSA. (Reply at 18.) Toyota argues that the TREAD Act does not impose a duty on Toyota to \u201cdisclose information to the public that could form the basis of a CLRA claim.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">Plaintiffs argue that the TREAD Act violations are actionable under a theory of fraudulent omission. (Opp\u2019n at 21.) They also argue that Toyota \u201chad a duty to disclose its violations of the TREAD Act to consumers while selling and advertising defective vehicles.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiffs contend that they have alleged materiality already, and that violations of the TREAD Act \u2014 \u201ca nondisclosure about safety considerations of consumer products\u201d \u2014 are material. <em>(Id. </em>at 22.) During the hearing, counsel for Toyota argued that whether Toyota issued a recall in Europe would not be material to consumers. The Court disagrees, noting, as Plaintiffs did in their Opposition, \u201c[t]he fact that Toyota was in violation of federal law for failure to report safety-related information would be material to a reasonable consumer.\u201d (Opp\u2019n to Motion to Strike at 1.) Toyota\u2019s approach to the CLRA is simply too narrow; the Court sees no reason not to allow allegations regarding the TREAD Act to be part of a CLRA claim, especially when Toyota has not shown that this language is redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous. Toyota did not take up this argument during the hearing, instead arguing that the CLRA does not \u201cborrow\u201d causes of action from other statutes as the UCL does. This argument is unavailing, as Plaintiffs have alleged a violation of the CLRA based on a duty to disclose material information. The fact that Toyota had a duty to disclose to NHTSA rather than consumers does not exonerate the statutory duty to disclose material facts to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">Plaintiffs also argue that Toyota had a duty to disclose its \u201cnon-compliance\u201d because it had exclusive knowledge about whether it had complied with the statute; it \u201cactively concealed its non-compliance from the public and from NHTSA\u201d; and it made representations about product safety \u201cwhile failing to disclose that it was violating the TREAD Act.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 22.) The Court agrees. The TREAD Act protects consumers through NHTSA, and allegations that Toyota did not comply with the reporting requirements support the contention that Toyota did not comply with another consumer protection statute, the CLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-8\">As this Court has already recognized, Plaintiffs allege a CLRA claim based on fraudulent omissions. Here, they simply add an additional basis for their claim, violations of the TREAD Act. Toyota has not shown that the phrases it wishes to strike are redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous, nor has Toyota shown how it will be prejudiced by the inclusion of the TREAD Act in the CLRA claim, because evidence of violations will be relevant under the UCL. (Opp\u2019n to Motion to Strike at 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-9\">Accordingly, the Court finds that Toyota has not established that Plaintiffs\u2019 references to the TREAD Act in the CLRA claim should be stricken. The Court has already ruled on the other requests to strike the damages claims. Moreover, Toyota has also failed to show that the CLRA claim or the FAL claim should be dismissed. Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss the CLRA and FAL claims and the Motion to Strike the CLRA claims and other language in the Notice of Motion are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-10\">VII. <em>Express and Implied Warranties (Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1213-11\">A. <em>Express Written Warranty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1213-12\">In its November 30, 2010 Order, the Court made a number of rulings regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>ing Plaintiffs\u2019 express warranty claims, which consist of two separate and distinct types of claims: one based on the express written warranty and another based on express statements made by the Toyota Defendants in advertising and marketing materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\"><em>In </em>the Court\u2019s November 30, 2010 Order, the Court dismissed with prejudice as outside the scope of the written warranty all claims based on design defects rather than defects in materials and workmanship.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 57-59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">The Court also held that those claims based on defects in materials and workmanship could be asserted by Plaintiffs who sought repairs pursuant to the recalls or SUA-related issues during the warranty period <em>(id. </em>at 51), but expressly rejected the argument that the latent nature of the alleged defect excused compliance with a contractual requirement that repair be sought during the warranty period <em>(id. </em>at 52-55).</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">In repleading this claim, Plaintiffs appear to seek partial clarification or partial reconsideration of the Court\u2019s ruling. Specifically, Plaintiffs make allegations that are contrary to the Court\u2019s ruling dismissing with prejudice certain breach of express written warranty claims by re-pleading claims by Plaintiffs \u201cwho neither sought repairs pursuant to the recalls nor sought repairs for SUA-related issues\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 55), and by adding allegations that the seeking of repairs would have been futile. <em>(See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 472, 478 (noting the futility of presenting a vehicle for repair in light of allegations that \u201cthe repairs Toyota offers do not fix all causes of SUA or prevent SUA\u201d), 473 (pedal recall and brake-override \u201cconfidence booster\u201d excluded many models).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">Seeking repair under the express written warranty is a contractual obligation. <em>(See </em>Docket 510 at 51.) Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the futility of seeking a repair should excuse their nonperformance of this obligation implicates the latent nature of the alleged defect(s). Certainly, the existence of a latent defect (which by definition is difficult or impossible to ascertain) is far more susceptible to being overlooked or being denied than is a non-latent defect. Thus, it is the latency of the alleged defect(s) that leads to the alleged futility. The Court has already discussed at length why, under California law, the latency of a defect in an automobile does not excuse compliance with the contractual obligation to present the vehicle for repair under an express written warranty. <em>(See </em>Docket No. 510 at 52-55.) The Court declines to revisit this holding; futility arising from the latent nature of the alleged defect(s) does not excuse compliance with the requirement that repair of a vehicle be sought within the warranty period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-10\">The parties\u2019 arguments, however, demonstrate that points of clarification are in order. First, it appears to the Court that its definition of \u201crecalls\u201d should include the \u201cconfidence booster,\u201d in light of allegations tending to suggest the brake-override \u201cconfidence booster\u201d was a lukewarm response to SUA-related events requiring a more aggressive response, such as a full-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>scale safety recall. <em>(See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 239, 351-367.) Thus, Plaintiffs who sought adjustment of their vehicles and/or installation of the \u201cconfidence booster\u201d fall within the broad category of \u201cPlaintiffs who ... sought repairs pursuant to the recalls.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Docket No. 510 at 55.) Therefore, Plaintiffs may assert claims based on the express written warranty if they sought out the \u201cconfidence booster\u201d during the warranty period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">Next, the Court disagrees that Plaintiffs who contacted Toyota dealers to the dealer replacement or repurchase of the vehicle fall into either category of Plaintiffs entitled to assert a breach of express written warranty claim. Although this argument is not without appeal (in that these Plaintiffs are essentially requesting the ultimate repair \u2014 a completely defect-free vehicle), <em>see </em>Opp\u2019n at 14-15, it must be viewed in the context of the specific contractual obligation at issue. Replacement or repurchase of the vehicle is not a remedy permitted by the relevant express written warranty. <em>(See </em>Docket No. 510 at 51.) Rather, the only remedy under the express written warranty is \u201crepair or adjustment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The claims for breach of the express written warranty made by Plaintiffs who sought only replacement or repurchase of their vehicles are dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">Plaintiffs seek clarification whether certain Plaintiffs <em>(ie., </em>Rocco and Bridie Doino, Barry and Vicki Karlin, and Barbara Saunders (\u00b6\u00b6 44, 55, 63)) are excused from presenting their vehicles for repair or adjustments because their vehicles were \u201ctotaled in SUA-related incidents.\u201d <em>{See </em>Opp\u2019n at 15.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>) In Plaintiffs\u2019 view, these occurrences rendered performance impossible and therefore excused their performance. <em>Id. </em>In response, Defendants merely note that these Plaintiffs, like those who sought replacement or refund, failed to \u201cseek repair\u201d as required by the terms of the warranty. (Reply at 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-9\">California law has long recognized that impossibility of performance will excuse a party\u2019s performance under a contract. <em>Mineral Park Land Co. v. Howard, </em>172 Cal. 289, 291, 156 P. 458 (1916) (recognizing that impossibility, but not mere difficulty, excuses a party\u2019s performance). However, even accepting Plaintiffs\u2019 argument, their view overlooks the inescapable conclusion that Toyota\u2019s performance under the warranty, which is limited to \u201crepair or adjustment\u201d is, as applied to a totaled vehicle, likewise impossible, excusing Toyota\u2019s performance as well. Thus, applying the doctrine advocated by Plaintiffs, because of the exclusive remedy of \u201crepair or adjustment,\u201d Plaintiffs who have totaled their vehicles \u2014 which by definition cannot be repaired \u2014 have no claim under the express written warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-10\">This conclusion is further compelled by the fundamental reason that the express written warranties (filed by Toyota in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>nection with the previous Motion to Dismiss) reveal that there is no warranty-coverage for totaled vehicles. Specifically, the exemplar warranties set forth provisions explicitly excluding coverage for losses such as those incurred by these Plaintiffs. Toyota\u2019s warranties exclude coverage for \u201cany vehicle that has ever been ... declared a \u2018total loss\u2019 or equivalent by a financial institution or insurer, such as by payment for a claim in lieu of repairs because the cost of repairs exceeded the cash value of the vehicle.\u201d (Gilford Decl. Ex. B at 26 (2010 Camry Warranty) (Docket No. 330-2 at 17); <em>id. </em>at 109 (2007 LEXUS Warranty) (Docket No. 330-3 at 23) (identical provision); <em>id. </em>at 183 (2002 Toyota Owner\u2019s Warranty Information) (Docket No 330-4 at 14) (identical provision); <em>see also </em>Gilford Decl. \u00b6 3 (representing Ex. B as \u201cexemplary of Plaintiffs\u2019 warranties\u201d).) Plaintiffs who totaled their vehicles have no claim for breach of express written warranty, and those claims are dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">Thus, applying the Court\u2019s previous rulings, as well as the ones set forth herein, the following Plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on the breach of express written warranty remain viable: Consumer Plaintiffs Fitzgerald (\u00b6 47), Heidenreich (\u00b6 53), Kamphaus (\u00b6 54), Perkins (\u00b6 59), and non-consumer Plaintiff Auto Lenders Liquidation Center, Inc. (\u201cAuto Lenders\u201d) (\u00b6 84). <em>(See </em>Berman Decl. (Docket No. 871-2), Ex. B at 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">Finally, it bears reiteration that the Court has made separate rulings regarding the two types of express warranty claims: The first type of claim is based on the express written warranties covering the vehicles, and the second type of claim is based on statements made by Toyota regarding the safety and performance of their vehicles. <em>(Compare </em>Docket 510 at 50-61 <em>with id. </em>at 61-64.) The present Order does not meant in any way to disturb that distinction.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-8\">In the related Motion to Strike, the Toyota Defendants move to strike a number of allegations, including language regarding the scope of the remedies available for breach of express warranty and Toyota\u2019s knowledge of the alleged defects., <em>(See </em>Notice of Motion to Strike at 4-5 (moving to strike \u00b6\u00b6 474, 476, 477, 481 (related to scope of remedies), \u00b6\u00b6 475, 480 (related to Toyota\u2019s knowledge)).) The Court has dismissed with prejudice Plaintiffs\u2019 revocation claim and therefore strikes the reference to remedies available for revocation of acceptance (\u00b6477). The remainder of the Motion to Strike the above-referenced paragraphs is not supported by argument in the Memorandum in Support; thus, the Court otherwise denies the Motion to Strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">B. <em>Implied Warranty</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">In its November 30, 2010 Order, the Court denied the Motion to Dismiss the implied warranty claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-10\">Although stopping short of filing a Motion for Reconsideration under this Court\u2019s Local Rules, <em>see </em>L.R. 7-18(b), and without much elaboration, Toyota \u201crequests\u201d that the Court \u201creexamine\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 implied warranty claims in light of a recently decided Central District case, <em>Webb v. Carter\u2019s, Inc., </em>272 F.R.D. 489, 499-500 (C.D.Cal.2011). (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 9 n. 7.) In <em>Webb, </em>the court relied on <em>Hicks v. Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp., </em>89 Cal.App.4th 908, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 761 (2001), for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>proposition that \u201ca plaintiff can recover for breach of an implied warranty only if the product \u2018contains an inherent defect which is substantially certain to result in malfunction during the useful life of the product.\u2019 \u201d <em>Webb, </em>272 F.R.D. at 499 (quoting <em>Hicks, </em>89 Cal.App.4th at 918, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 761). <em>Webb </em>does not represent new legal authority justifying reconsideration under L.R. l-18(b). Instead, it merely applies a ten-year old California Court of Appeal decision that this Court also relied upon in its November 30, 2010 Order. The Court declines Toyota\u2019s \u201crequest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">Moreover, although purporting to move to dismiss the implied warranty claim for, <em>inter alia, </em>lack of privity and sufficiency of allegations regarding vehicle malfunction, Toyota discusses the sufficiency of the implied warranty claim in its Memorandum only insofar as the claim applies to two non-consumer Plaintiffs. (Compare Notice of Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 734) at 5 with Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 11-13, 23; <em>see also id. </em>at 9 n. 7 (discussed supra).) As noted at the outset of this Order, the Court declines to undertake a broader analysis of the implied warranty claim unguided by the moving parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">C. <em>Ruling Regarding Warranty Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">Thus, subject to the clarifications set forth above, the Court grants in part and denies in part the Motion to Dismiss as to the warranty claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-11\">The Court strikes \u00b6477 of the Complaint, but denies the remainder of the Motion to Strike regarding the express warranty claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-12\">VIII. <em>Revocation of Acceptance (Sixth Cause of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-13\">In the November 30, 2010 Order, the Court held that Plaintiffs may not revoke acceptance against a non-seller manufacturer.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (Docket No. 510 at 71.) However, the Court dismissed the claim without prejudice to allow Plaintiffs to replead, if they so chose, that the relevant express written warranty \u201cfail[s] of its essential purpose\u201d within the meaning of Cal. Com. Code \u00a7 2719. (Docket No. 510 at 74-75 &amp; n. 24.) Plaintiffs responded by pleading in the Complaint that the revocation claim \u201cis asserted to preserve the Count for appeal and Plaintiffs and the Class understand the claim is dismissed.\u201d (\u00b6 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-14\">Thus, based on this repleading, despite some suggestion to the contrary elsewhere in the record before the Court,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the Court treats the Complaint as indicating an intent on the part of Plaintiffs to forego a claim based on a theory that the warranties\u2019 exclusive or limited remedies fail of their essential purpose within the meaning of section 2-719 of the Uniform Commercial Code (Cal. ConxCode \u00a7 2719).</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>The Court grants the Motion to Dismiss as to this claim. The revocation claim, Plaintiffs\u2019 sixth cause of action, is dismissed with prejudice as to all Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">IX. <em>Breach of Contract/Common Law Warranty (Eighth Cause of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">The Toyota Defendants move <em>to </em>strike all language setting forth the eighth cause of action. The Court previously denied the Motion to Dismiss an identical claim set forth in the MCC. (Docket No. 510 at 71 (noting that this claim was properly pled in the alternative).) Moreover, Defendants present no legal argument in support of unrelated portion of their Motion to Strike, which the Court now denies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-6\">X. <em>Unjust Enrichment (Tenth Cause of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">In its November 30, 2010 Order, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for unjust enrichment with prejudice because unjust enrichment is not a cause of action in California. (Docket 510 at 87-88, 103.) Plaintiffs expressly state they re-assert the unjust enrichment claim merely to preserve it for appeal. (\u00b6 532.) For the reasons set forth in the November 30, 2010 Order, the Court again dismisses this claim with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-8\">XI. <em>Auto Lenders Liquidation Center, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-9\">With the amendments set forth in the Complaint, Plaintiffs have added a new non-consumer Plaintiff. <em>(See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 76-84.) Auto Lenders is described as \u201ca residual value insurer, guarantor and lease maturity vehicle liquidator,\u201d as well as the operator of \u201cfive New Jersey retail automobile dealerships and service centers.\u201d (\u00b6 76.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-10\">Auto Lenders insured the residual value of a fleet of vehicles leased by non-party Hann Financial Service Corporation (\u201cHann\u201d), including vehicles alleged in the Complaint to be affected by the SUA defects). <em>(Id.) </em>Auto Lenders saw Toyota\u2019s advertising regarding safety and reliability, and was influenced by those advertisements to insure the residual values of the Hann fleet of vehicles. <em>(Id.) </em>Had Auto Lenders been aware of the alleged defects), it either would not have insured those values or would have guaranteed residual values at a lower amount. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-12\">As part of its contractual arrangement with Hann, Auto Lenders takes possession and ownership of vehicles for \u201creconditioning and sale.\u201d (\u00b6 78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-13\">Before September 2009, Toyota vehicles had \u201cpredictably and consistently maintained resale value,\u201d which changed when the SUA tendency became publicly known. (\u00b6 79.) On September 1, 2009, Auto Lenders had approximately 5,800 Toyota and Lexus vehicles \u201cin inventory.\u201d (\u00b6 80.) Over the next year, Auto Lenders sold approximately 1,700 Toyota vehicles, and estimates its losses (as measured between predicted value and sales revenue) at approximately $5.5 million. (\u00b6 82.) During the same period, Auto Lenders sold approximately 900 Lexus vehicles, and estimates its losses at approximately $5.9 million. (\u00b6 83.) Transportation of vehicles subject to recalls cost Auto Lenders $80 per vehicle for a total of approximately $43,000. (\u00b6 84.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-14\">Although Toyota contends that the warranty claims of Auto Lenders should be dismissed with prejudice because it \u201cdoes not allege to have ever purchased or leased a Toyota vehicle at issue in this case,\u201d the allegations set forth in the Complaint foreclose this argument. <em>(See </em>Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 13; <em>cf. </em>\u00b6 78.) The Court denies the Motion to Dismiss the warranty claims of Auto Lenders. The Court\u2019s warranty rulings set forth in the November 30, 2010 Order apply to this new party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>XII. <em>Availability of Injunctive Relief, Restitution and/or Restitutionary Disgorgement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">The Toyota Defendants move to strike Plaintiffs\u2019 request for an injunction requiring implementation of a fail-safe mechanism and Plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for restitution and/or restitutionary disgorgement, but have not addressed these issues in their briefing. <em>(Compare </em>Notice of Motion to Strike at 6 with Defs.\u2019 Mem.) Furthermore, the Court previously denied Toyota\u2019s motion to strike these requests for relief. (Docket No. 510 at 88-101.) The Court denies the current Motion to Strike the prayer for restitution and/or restitutionary disgorgement for the reasons set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">XIII. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">The Court grants in part and denies in part the Motions to Dismiss and to Strike. To the extent not expressly granted, the Motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">The Court denies the Request for Judicial Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-9\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AJ-\">.

Claims by a putative class of foreign Plaintiffs were asserted in a separate consolidated complaint. (See Court\u2019s Sept. 13, 2010 Order at 3-4 (Docket No. 341) (appointing Monica R. Kelly as lead counsel for the foreign economic loss Plaintiffs and ordering the filing of a consolidated complaint on behalf of the foreign Plaintiffs).) On April 8, 2011, the Court dismissed the foreign Plaintiffs' claims, but the Court granted leave to amend certain claims, in some instances subjecting any proposed amendments to offers of proof. <em>(See </em>Court's April 8, 2011 Order at 64-66 (Docket No. 1237).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-11\">Herein, the Court's reference to \"Plaintiffs\u201d generally refers to the domestic Plaintiffs collectively, except when, in context, it clearly refers to a subset of domestic Plaintiffs. <em>See e.g., infra </em>n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1197-16\">. In addition to the putative class of individuals, a small number of business entities \u2014 such as an auto dealership and a car rental business \u2014 are Plaintiffs as well. (\u00b6\u00b6 71-86). The Court refers to these business entities as the non-consumer Plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1197-17\">.

Plaintiffs rely on <em>Kwikset </em>for the proposition that an injury in fact is satisfied when plaintiffs plead that they would not have bought a product but for defendants' misrepresentation. 51 Cal.4th at 325, 120 Cal.Rptr.3d 741, 246 P.3d 877. In <em>Kwikset, </em>plaintiffs thought they were purchasing one type of product, a lock \"Made in U.S.A.,\u201d but later discovered that the lock \u201ccontained foreign-made parts or involved foreign manufacture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316-17, 120 Cal.Rptr.3d 741, 246 P.3d 877. Defendants argued that plaintiffs did not suffer an economic loss <em>{i.e., </em>a money or property damage) because the consumers received a fully functioning lock and thus received the benefit of their bargain. In rejecting defendant's argument, the California Supreme Court recognized that the accuracy of labels can affect the economic value of a product. Setting aside differences between federal standing requirements and statutory standing requirements under California law, the Court agrees that <em>Kwikset </em>has some persuasive value: it is plausible that consumers suffer an economic loss by purchasing a product that is different from the advertised product. Although there are meaningful differences between <em>Kwikset </em>and this case, <em>see infra </em>at n. 11, at the end of the day both sets of plaintiffs plausibly allege an injury because they did not receive the product that they bargained for \u2014 a lock \"Made in U.S.A.\u201d or a defect-free Toyota vehicle. Toyota distinguishes <em>Kwikset, </em>in part, by contending that the issue here is whether Plaintiffs adequately pled personal factual allegations necessary to support standing under Article III. As discussed herein, the Court holds that Plaintiffs satisfy Article III by plausibly establishing a safety defect \u2014 a defect now alleged by all Plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1205-9\">. This question reveals one difference between the economic loss in <em>Kwikset </em>and the loss alleged in this case. In <em>Kwikset, </em>plaintiffs essentially argued that they were duped into buying a different type of lock: they thought they bought a lock made in the U.S.A. (Lock X), but instead bought a lock that was not completely made in the U.S.A. (Lock Y). In the Kwikset-type of allegation, the overpay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>ment injury does not depend on how the product functions because \"labels\u201d and \"brands\u201d have independent economic value. Here, however, Plaintiffs do not allege that they were duped into buying a different \"type\u201d of vehicle <em>{i.e., </em>they do not allege that they thought they bought a Toyota vehicle (Car X), but instead bought a non-Toyota vehicle (Car Y)), but rather that they were duped into buying a \"defective\u201d vehicle <em>{i.e., </em>they thought they bought a safe Toyota vehicle (Car X), but instead bought a defective Toyota vehicle (Car X\u2019)). When the economic loss is predicated solely on how a product functions, and the product has not malfunctioned, the Court agrees that something more is required than simply alleging an overpayment for a \"defective\u201d product. As explained, <em>infra, </em>that \"something more\u201d could be allegations based on market forces. It could also be based on sufficiently detailed, non-conclusory allegations of the product defect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1206-12\">. Although not relevant here, this proposition is supported by the fact that not all products have an aftermarket. <em>See Kwikset, </em>51 Cal.4th at 332-34, 120 Cal.Rptr.3d 741, 246 P.3d 877.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1206-13\">. Plaintiffs made this argument at the April 29, 2011 hearing, but did not explicitly make it in their Opposition. Although the Court concludes that all lead Plaintiffs have standing based on the economic losses associated with the alleged safety defect, the Court addresses this argument to make clear that it does not accept this proffered basis for standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1207-10\">. Indeed, Toyota's statements regarding this issue are internally inconsistent. As noted above, although raising the issue of standing to assert UCL, FAL, and CLRA claims in its Notice of Motion, Toyota fails to support its position in its Memorandum of Points and Authorities. Notwithstanding this omission, and presumably in response to the Notice of Motion, Plaintiffs understandably support their own position on the issue. <em>(See </em>Opp'n at 2-4.) Thereafter, in the Reply, Toyota criticizes Plaintiffs for \"devotfing] an entire section to arguing\u201d against a position it has not taken, only to again contend (in the same document), again unsupported by legal argument or citation to authority, that Plaintiffs have failed to allege injury pursuant to their UCL, FAL, and CLRA claims. <em>(Compare </em>Reply at 11 (\"Nowhere in Toyota's Motion, however, does it raise the injury-in-fact issue under California law or what is required to sufficiently allege a claim under California procedural law.\u201d) <em>with id. </em>at 11 n. 3 (\"Plaintiffs likely fail to allege injury under the California statutes as well, but Toyota does not raise that issue here.\u201d).) At the April 29, 2011 hearing, Toyota clarified that its intent was to preserve in its Motion its prior position on these issues for appeal. Had there been minor, non-material changes to the Complaint, or no changes at all, Toyota's position would be sensible. However, the Court does not find that the changes to the Complaint were immaterial with respect to standing under the UCL, FAL, and CLRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1209-7\">. In the previous round of briefing for the MCC, Toyota argued that \"a presumption of reliance is limited to securities fraud claims and, even then, confined to claims alleging fraudulent omissions.\u201d (Docket No. 450 at 8.) Toyota cited <em>Poulos v. Caesars World, Inc., </em>379 F.3d 654, 666-67 (9th Cir.2004), and <em>Gartin v. S &amp; M NuTec LLC, </em>245 F.R.D. 429, 438 (C.D.Cal.2007), to support this proposition. <em>Poulos </em>discussed a \"presumption of reliance\u201d in the context of civil RICO claims. 379 F.3d at 666-67. Whether the plaintiffs in <em>Poulos </em>were entitled to a \u201cpresumption of reliance\u201d in a civil RICO action has little bearing on whether Plaintiffs here are entitled to a presumption under the UCL and FAL. As to <em>Gartin, </em>the court discussed a \u201cpresumption of reliance\u201d in the context of common law fraud \u2014 not as it relates to standing under the UCL or FAL. 245 F.R.D. at 438. Moreover, <em>Gartin </em>was decided two years before the California Supreme Court stated that a presumption of reliance arises as long as the misrepresentation was material. <em>In re Tobacco II, </em>46 Cal.4th at 327, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1211-6\">.
