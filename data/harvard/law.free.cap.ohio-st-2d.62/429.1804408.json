Respondent does not contend that he was not convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Gov. R. V (8)(b) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u201cA certified copy of a judgment entry of conviction of an offense shall be conclusive evidence of the commission of that offense in any disciplinary proceedings instituted against an attorney based upon the conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">This rule makes it clear that a disciplinary proceeding is not an appropriate forum in which to collaterally attack a criminal conviction. Respondent has exhausted all appeals from his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Upon a careful review of the evidence and stipulation, the court concludes that respondent has violated DR 1-102(A)(3) and DR 1-102(A)(6). Therefore, respondent, Jerry F. Chvosta, is indefinitely suspended from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-10\">Celebrezze, C. J., W.
