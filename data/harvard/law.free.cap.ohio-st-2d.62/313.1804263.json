C. 2911.13, pertaining to \u201cbreaking and entering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">We hold that the Volkswagen bus in the instant cause is <em>not </em>an \u201cunoccupied structure\u201d within the ambit of R. C. 2911.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Burglary at common law was the breaking and entering in the nighttime of the dwelling or mansion house of another with intent to commit a felony therein. Burglary has been statutorily defined in R. C. 2911.11 through 2911.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">R. C. 2911.13, which is the section in focus in the instant cause, refers to the breaking and entering of an \u201cunoccupied structure.\u201d The problem herein arises in that there is no definition of an \u201cunoccupied structure\u201d in the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">The Committee Comment to R. C. 2911.13 states, in part, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">\u201cThis section defines an offense <em>identical to burglary, </em>except that the structure involved in a violation of this section is unoccupied rather than occupied.***\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">R. C. 2911.11 and 2911.12, concerning the burglary of an \u201coccupied structure,\u201d specifically refer to the definition of an \u201coccupied structure,\u201d as set forth in R. C. 2909.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">Initially, it is noted that R. C. 2909.01 makes no specific reference to motor vehicles.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Furthermore, the gist of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>statute limits the definition of \u201coccupied structures\u201d to those instances where there is a more serious risk of harm due to a person\u2019s actual or likely presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u201cOccupied structures\u201d could possibly include motor vehicles \u201crigged for an overnight stay,\u201d but, as the Committee Comment to R. C. 2909.01 further explains, in parts relevant to the instant cause:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u201c * * *The tent camper rigged for an overnight stay is an occupied structure, but would not come under the definition [of an occupied structure] when collapsed for travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Therefore, the Volkswagen bus in the instant cause would not come within the meaning of an \u201coccupied structure\u201d under R. C. 2909.01, and it, consequently, should not be considered an \u201cunoccupied structure\u201d as contained in R. C. 2911.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">R. C. 1.42 reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\u201cWords and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage. Words and phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">R. C. 2901.04 reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">\u201c(A) Sections of the Revised Code defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed against the state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">\u201c(B) Rules of criminal procedure and sections of the Revised Code providing for criminal procedure shall be construed so as to effect the fair, impartial, speedy, and sure administration of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">These two sections, when read in <em>pari materia, </em>indicate to this court that the Volkswagen bus in the instant cause, when given its common usage, is not an \u201cunoccupied structure,\u201d as it pertains to R. C. 2911.13. The Court of Appeals concluded that an unoccupied structure would be \u201ca[ny] product of construction capable of being occupied by at least one person.\u201d Such a broad interpretation of an \u201cunoccupied structure\u201d is misdirected and would go far beyond the scope intended by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">Furthermore, the inclusion of the Volkswagen bus as an \u201cunoccupied structure\u201d would, in most instances, completely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>undermine the purpose of R. C. 2913.03(A), the unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Volkswagen bus in the instant cause is not within the ambit of R. C. 2911.13, and, therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b374-7\">Celebrezze, C. J., Herbert, W. Brown, P. Brown, Sweeney, Locher and Holmes, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-16\"> If the General Assembly had intended to automatically include motor vehicles within the ambit of its burglary sections, it should have expressly done so, as have other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-17\">For example, 21 Okla. Stat. Anno., Section 1435, which specifically includes both automobiles and trucks, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">\u201cEvery person who breaks and enters any building or any part of any building, room, booth, tent, railroad car, automobile, truck, trailer, vessel or other structure or erection, in which any property is kept, or breaks into or forcibly opens, any coin operated or vending machine or device with intent to steal any property therein or to commit any felony, is guilty of burglary in the second degree.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
