C. 2923.03(D) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">\u201cNo person shall be convicted of complicity under this section solely upon the testimony of an accomplice, unsupported by other evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">In its first proposition of law, the state argues that, literally construed, R. C. 2923.03(D) only prohibits convictions \u201cunder this section,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>convictions for the <em>complicity </em>offenses described in R. C. 2923.03(A),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and does not prohibit convictions for principal offenses. Thus, since appellee was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>convicted for the principal offenses of aggravated murder, aggravated robbery and kidnapping pursuant to R. C. 2903.01, 2911.01 and 2905.01, respectively, the state contends that R. C. 2923.03(D) does not prohibit appellee\u2019s convictions. The state asks that we reconsider our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>where we applied R. C. 2923.03(D) to prohibit a conviction under R. C. 2911.01 for aggravated robbery, a principal offense. Upon reconsideration, we reject the state\u2019s argument and explicitly approve of our application of R. C. 2923.03(D) to principal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">To restrict the application of R. C. 2923.03(D) to the complicity offenses described in R. C. 2923.03(A) would be to exalt form over substance. Under R. C. 2923.03(F), \u201c***[a] charge of complicity may be stated [at the option of the prosecution] in terms of* * *[R. C. 2923.03(A)] or in terms of the principal offense.\u201d Moreover, under R. C. 2923.03(F), a person accused of complicity is \u201cprosecuted and punished as if he were a principal offender.\u201d Indeed, if we were to sanction the state\u2019s construction of R. C. 2923.03(D), it is unlikely that a prosecutor would ever charge an accused with complicity. Rather, he would charge the accused with the underlying principal offense and thereby avoid R. C. 2923.03(D). Since the serious infirmities associated with accomplice testimony<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are unrelated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>to the way in which the prosecution states its charges, the above construction of R. C. 2923.03(D) could not have been the General Assembly\u2019s intent. We therefore refuse to give literal effect to the phrase \u201cunder this section\u201d in R. C. 2923.03(D), and hold that R. C. 2923.03(D) can prohibit convictions for principal offenses, as well as prohibit convictions for the complicity offenses described in R. C. 2923.03(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In its second proposition of law, the state alternatively argues that it introduced sufficient evidence to satisfy the corroboration requirement of R. C. 2923.03(D). The state has conceded that it introduced no evidence corroborating the testimony of appellee\u2019s alleged accomplice, Avila Chambliss, tending to connect appellee with the commission of the alleged crimes. On the other hand, there is no dispute that the state introduced ample evidence corroborating Chambliss\u2019 testimony as to other material circumstances of the respective crimes. Thus, we need to determine whether the corroboration requirement of R. C. 2923.03(D) prohibits an otherwise sustainable conviction where no evidence has been introduced which corroborates the testimony of an accomplice tending to connect an accused with the commission of an alleged offense. The state explicitly asks that we reevaluate our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>at page 75, that an \u201c[accomplice\u2019s] testimony must be corroborated by some other fact, circumstance or testimony which also points to the identity of the one he accuses as a guilty actor.\u201d Accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Vorys, supra, </em>at page 110. Upon reconsideration, we reaffirm our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The state argues that corroboration of an accomplice\u2019s testimony concerning any of the material circumstances of an alleged crime, apart from an accused\u2019s connection therewith, should be sufficient to satisfy the corroboration requirement of R. C. 2923.03(D). Apparently, the justification for the state\u2019s position is that since corroboration of an accomplice\u2019s testimony concerning any of the material circumstances of an alleged crime enhances the accomplice\u2019s credibility, a jury should be permitted to believe the accomplice\u2019s uncorroborated testimony concerning the accused\u2019s connection with the alleged crime. At best, however, corroboration of an accomplice\u2019s testimony concerning the material circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>a crime, apart from the accused\u2019s connection therewith, demonstrates that the <em>accomplice </em>was connected with the crime. It does little to allay one\u2019s concern that the accomplice is being untruthful concerning the accused\u2019s connection with the crime, especially since the accused\u2019s connection therewith would ordinarily be the primary if not sole contested issue in such cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Thus, we reaffirm our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>and herein reemphasize that, in order for the prosecution to satisfy the corroboration requirement of R. C. 2923.03(D), independent evidence must support an accomplice\u2019s testimony, and must tend to connect the accused with the alleged crime or must tend to identify the accused as a guilty actor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b353-8\">Celebrezze, C.

See, also, <em>Cool </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1972), 409 U.S. 100, 103; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1909), 212 U.S. 183, 203, 204. By the enactment of R. C. 2923.03(D), the General Assembly concluded that the serious infirmities associated with accomplice testimony required that corroborating evidence be introduced as a precondition to conviction. In nearly half the states, corroboration of an accomplice\u2019s testimony is required by either statute, rule or judicial decision. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolery </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 316, 330, at fh. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">We remain in complete agreement with the General Assembly as to the imprudence of depending solely on a jury\u2019s assessment of an accomplice\u2019s credibility as a means of scrutinizing accomplice testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>at page 75, which reads as follows: \u201c***In this day of plea bargaining and immunized testimony* * *, it is vitally important that one implicating an accomplice do something more than point a finger.\u201d The impact of the testimony of one. who claims to have participated in the crime and who has confessed might be so great that the jury may overlook the need to carefully assess credibility despite a cautionary instruction. See Note, 16 Utah L. Rev. 60, 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b353-11\"> The motivation for an accomplice to accuse another falsely would be greatest where the prosecutor had abundant evidence concerning both the material circumstances of a crime and the accomplice\u2019s connection therewith. In this situation evidence corroborating the testimony of the accomplice concerning the material circumstances of a crime, apart from the accused\u2019s connection therewith, would be a foregone conclusion, leaving identification of the accused as the vital issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b353-12\"> Virtually every state which requires corroboration of accomplice testimony requires, as we do, that such corroboration tend to connect the accused with the crime. See 7 Wigmore on Evidence (Chadboum Rev.), Section 2059; 3 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence (13th Ed.), Section 649; and 30 American Jurisprudence 2d 329, Evidence, Section 1153.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b353-9\">Celebrezze, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AY9\">concurring. Although I concur in this court\u2019s construction of R. C. 2923.03(D), I must express serious reservations about that provision and its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">The General Assembly in R. C. 2923.03(D) has enacted an inflexible rule that provides that all accomplice testimony is inherently unreliable. In so doing, the General Assembly has taken much of the evaluation of witness credibility away from the jury. In our legal system the jury, on a case-by-case basis, not the legislature in an intractable, stony provision, ordinarily assesses witness credibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuttle </em>(1903), 67 Ohio St. 440. A jury\u2019s personal assessment of witness credibility is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>much better method of weighing accomplice testimony than an inflexible statutory rule such as the one contained in R. C. 2923.03(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Obviously there are reasons for distrusting accomplice testimony, but they are not a proper basis to constitute an automatic exclusion resulting in a discharge of a criminal offender. There is of course the concern that the accomplice has been promised or believes he will receive immunity or leniency. There is also the possibility that the accomplice may maliciously include others in his own crime. The existence of such promises, beliefs, or malice however varies on a case-by-case basis and should be assessed according to the individual witness\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">As stated in 7 Wigmore on Evidence 417 (Chadbourn Rev.), Section 2057:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u201cThe promise of immunity, * * * being the essential element of distrust, but not being invariably made, no invariable rule should be fixed as though it had been made. Moreover, if made, its influence must vary infinitely with the nature of the charge and the personality of the accomplice. Finally, credibility is a matter of elusive variety, and it is impossible and anachronistic to determine in advance that, with or without promise, a given man\u2019s story must be distrusted***.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">We are all cognizant of the fact that most crimes are not committed in front of a crowd.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">In allowing the testimony of one accomplice to corroborate the testimony of another, the General Assembly recognized that accomplices could be credible witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vorys </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 107. In light <em>of </em>this, and for the reasons stated above, I believe that the legislature should reevaluate the rule it has set down in R. C. 2923.03(D) and leave the issue of accomplice credibility to the fact finder.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-10\">Holmes, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
