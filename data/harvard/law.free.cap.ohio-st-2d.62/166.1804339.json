The only evidence here which evaluated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>combined effect of the two conditions indicated that appellant was permanently and totally disabled. Therefore, since there is no evidence upon which the commission could have based its conclusion that appellant is not permanently and totally disabled, mandamus becomes appropriate. See <em>State, ex rel. Wallace, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St. 2d 55, 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed and the writ of mandamus is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b227-6\">Celebrezze, C.
