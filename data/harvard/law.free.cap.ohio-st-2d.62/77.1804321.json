Milligan, Jr., </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b137-8\">Herbert, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR\">Appellant contends that by virtue of the provisions of former G.C. 8619,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellee\u2019s ownership of the chattels in question became vested in appellant upon the expiration of the five-year period set forth in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that G.C. 8619 was a statute of frauds. <em>Richter &amp; Phillips Co. </em>v. <em>Queen City Mfg. Co. </em>(1951), 156 Ohio St. 143, 101 N.E. 2d 291. As such, appellant\u2019s failure to plead it as an affirmative defense constitutes a waiver. Civ. R. 8(C); Civ. R. 12(H); cf. <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Whitehouse Tracking Co. </em>(1974), 40 Ohio St. 2d 55, 320 N.E. 2d 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Appellant argues, however, that the defense was tried by the express or implied consent of the parties, and that, under Civ. R. 15(B), the issue must be treated as if it had been raised in the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">Appellant\u2019s proposition in this regard is premised mainly upon the parties\u2019 stipulation, submitted to the trial court on remand of the case, that the loan agreements were not recorded in conformity with the terms of G.C. 8619. However, the record indicates that prior to the stipulation, appellee challenged appellant\u2019s assertion of this defense on the ground that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>had been waived. Furthermore, the terms of the stipulation agreement itself indicate that appellee specifically contested the admissibility of any evidence relative to G.C. 8619. Accordingly, we conclude that appellee did not consent, within the meaning of Civ. R. 15(B), to the trial of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Appellant urges further that the Court of Appeals erred in <em>Houser </em>v. <em>Ohio Historical Society, supra </em>(55 Ohio App. 2d 241), by concluding that appellee\u2019s cause of action is not barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant avers that the Court of Appeals has failed to follow <em>Keithler </em>v. <em>Foster </em>(1871), 22 Ohio St. 27,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and has thereby undermined the statutory safeguards against fraud upon which statutes of limitation are founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">A fair interpretation of the language of the instant bailment agreement shows that appellee loaned the Putnam artifacts to appellant for one year or more, to be returned upon proper demand. This was an indefinite term and, in such circumstances, a bailee is not in default until the requisite demand for the bailed chattels is made, and the applicable statute of limitations does not begin to run against the bailor\u2019s cause of action until such time. <em>Gehres </em>v. <em>Ater, supra </em>(148 Ohio St. 89); 172 A.L.R. 693, 701-702.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We are aware that in some jurisdictions, where a demand is a condition precedent to the return of bailed property and no fixed time for the demand is agreed upon, the bailor will not be permitted to postpone the demand indefinitely so as to defeat the policy of the statute of limitations. 8 American Jurisprudence 2d 1178, Bailments, Section 292; Annotation, 57 A.L.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>2d 1044, 1046, 1052, Sections 2, 4; see <em>Hamrick </em>v. <em>Indianapolis Humane Society </em>(C.A. 7, 1959), 273 F. 2d 7, certiorari denied, 362 U.S. 919. Instead, a duty rests with the bailor to make a demand, within a reasonable time, for the return of the property, the issue of reasonableness to be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case. Annotation, 57 A.L.R. 2d 1044, 1053, Section 5; <em>Lowney </em>v. <em>Knott </em>(1956), 83 R.I. 505, 120 A. 2d 552; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Whorisky </em>(1898), 170 Mass. 63, 66-67, 48 N.E. 1070. In Ohio, and in a majority of other jurisdictions, a reasonable time within which the demand must be made is ordinarily presumed to be the period of the statute of limitations applicable to the bailor\u2019s cause of action for return of the property. Annotation, 57 A.L.R. 2d 1044, 1054, Section 6; <em>Keithler </em>v. <em>Foster, supra; West </em>v. <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1940), 311 U.S. 223 (applying Ohio law), 132 A.L.R. 956, 966-967; <em>Gossard </em>v. <em>Gossard </em>(C.A. 10, 1945), 149 F. 2d 111; <em>Slack </em>v. <em>Bryan </em>(1945), 299 Ky. 132, 184 S.W. 2d 873. This general rule is subject, however, to the well-recognized exception that a demand will not be presumed if to do so would be contrary to the express terms of the agreement between the parties, or if the circumstances indicate that the parties contemplated a quick demand or an unusual delay in making the demand. Annotation, 57 A.L.R. 2d 1044, 1054, Section 6; <em>e.g., Barer </em>v. <em>Goldberg </em>(1978), 20 Wash. App. 2d 472, 582 P. 2d 868; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Middle States Utilities </em>(1940), 228 Iowa 686, 293 N.W. 59; <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Keefer </em>(1929), 48 Idaho 42, 280 P. 324; <em>Daugherty </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1890), 125 Ind. 421, 25 N.E. 542; 54 Corpus Juris Secundum 68, Section 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In <em>Keithler </em>v. <em>Foster, supra </em>(22 Ohio St. 27), this court recognized that the rule imposing a presumed demand is not inflexible in that a cause may present \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d which provide relief from application of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In summary, where a bailment agreement specifies a period of \u201cone year, or more,\u201d for the return of loaned chattels, and states that the chattels may be retrieved by the bailor \u201cupon presentation of this receipt,\u201d a cause of action for the return of the bailed property does not accrue until the receipt has been presented.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals, where not inconsistent with this decision, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b140-6\">Celebrezze, C.
