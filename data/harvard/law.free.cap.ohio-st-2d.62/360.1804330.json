S. Code, a conviction which is now final. Respondent was suspended from the practice of law before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, for failing to file income tax returns for three separate years.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Prior cases of this court have consistently held that the fact of conviction for willful failure to file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service is sufficient to support a finding that the attorney involved has violated DR 1-102 (A) of the Code of Professional Responsibility, thereby warranting that attorney\u2019s indefinite suspension from the practice of law in this state. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Pandilidis, supra; Cin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>cinnati Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Beall, supra; Ohio State Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St. 2d 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Upon examination of the record in this proceeding, we find that respondent has violated DR 1-102(A)(1), (3), (4) and (6) of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and he is, therefore, indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-7\">Celebrezze, C.
