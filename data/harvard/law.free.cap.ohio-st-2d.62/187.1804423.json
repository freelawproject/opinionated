C. 4111.03 of the Ohio Minimum Fair Wage Standards Act. It is argued that the General Assembly did not intend, under R. C. 4111.01(E)(7),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to exclude all members of police and fire protection agencies from the overtime compensation provisions of R. C. 4111.03. Instead, it is contended that the statute excludes only members of police or fire protection agencies employed on a part time or seasonal basis. Appellants in case Nos. 79-1294 and 79-1308 urge that to exclude all members of police or fire protection agencies from the statutory overtime compensation would constitute a denial of their property rights in violation of due process, and would deprive them of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>In <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Weimer </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 312, 55 N.E. 2d 413, paragraph five of the syllabus states that, \u201c[w]here the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning there is no occasion for* * * [resort] to rules of statutory interpretation. An unambiguous statute is to be applied, not interpreted.\u201d The same principle was expressed in a different manner in <em>Carmelite Sisters, St. Rita\u2019s Home, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Review </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St. 2d 41, 247 N.E. 2d 477, where this court indicated, at page 46, that \u201c* * * legislative intent may be inquired into only if the enactment is ambiguous upon its face.\u201d Where a statute is found to be subject to various interpretations, however, a court called upon to interpret its provisions may invoke rules of statutory construction in order to arrive at legislative intent. <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Central Natl. Bank </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St. 2d 16, 242 N.E. 2d 342; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Youngstown </em>{1946), 146 Ohio St. 203, 65 N.E. 2d 63; <em>Commercial Credit Co. v. Schreyer </em>(1929), 120 Ohio St. 568, 166 N.E. 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The disagreement among the trial and appellate courts below, and others,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> indicates strongly that R. C. 4111.01(E)(7) is ambiguous. Our perusal of the briefs and arguments herein brings us to that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In adopting rules of statutory construction formulated by the judiciary, the General Assembly has enacted R. C. 1.49:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u201cIf a statute is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention of the legislature, may consider among other matters:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\u201c(A) The object sought to be attained;</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">\u201c(B) The circumstances under which the statute was enacted;</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">\u201c(C) The legislative history;</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u201c(D) The common law or former statutory provisions, including laws upon the same or similar subjects;</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u201c(E) The consequences of a particular construction;</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u201c(F) The administrative construction of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Appellees in case Nos. 79-1294 and 79-1308 have proffered for the record certifi\u00e9d copies of the Ohio Legislative Service Commission\u2019s analysis of Sub. H. B. No. 201, R. C. 4111.01 <em>et seq., </em>during the time it was introduced, voted upon, and passed by the Ohio Senate and House of Representatives. Although this court is not bound by such analyses, we may refer to them when we find them helpful and objective. This legislative history indicates that the commission, in analyzing the bill and explicating the classes of employers or employees to be exempted from the operation of R. C. 4111.01 <em>et seq., </em>informed the members of the General Assembly that Sub. H. B. No. 201 excluded \u201cpublic employers of police and fire protection personnel* * *.\u201d To the same effect is the 1973-74 Legislative Service Commission\u2019s Summary of Legislative Enactments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>ITT Canteen Corp. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St. 2d 155, 158, 283 N.E. 2d 124; <em>Weiss </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 117, 120, 271 N.E. 2d 792. \u201c[Statutes are to be read in the light of attendant circumstances and conditions, and are to be construed as they were intended to be understood, when they were passed.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fairley </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 327, 48 N.E. 2d 217, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">In <em>State, ex rel. Pratt, </em>v. <em>Weygandt </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 463, 466, 132 N.E. 2d 191, it was stated that \u201c***statutes relating to the same matter or subject, although passed at different times and making no reference to each other, are <em>in pari materia </em>and should be read together to ascertain and effectuate if possible the legislative intent. 37 Ohio Jurisprudence 599, Section 332; <em>Thoman </em>v. <em>Farmers &amp; Bankers Life Ins. Co., </em>155 Kan. 806, 130 P. 2d 551; <em>State, ex rel. Carlton, </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>208 Minn. 342, 294 N.W. 370.\u201d The basis for this rule is that the General Assembly, in enacting a statute, is assumed to have been aware of other statutory provisions concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>subject matter of the enactment even if they are found in separate sections of the Code. See <em>State, ex rel. Darby, </em>v. <em>Hadaway </em>(1925), 113 Ohio St. 658-659) 150 N.E. 36. It is accepted that in arriving at legislative intent, such related provisions should be reconciled with the enactments in question, if possible. <em>Trotwood Trailers, Inc., </em>v. <em>Evatt </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 197, 51 N.E. 2d 645; <em>State, ex rel. O\u2019Neil, </em>v. <em>Griffith </em>(1940), 136 Ohio St. 526, 27 N.E. 2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">That the General Assembly intended to exclude all police and fire personnel from the operation of R. C. 4111.01(E)(7) is borne out by the conflict which would otherwise emerge between R. C. 4111.03 and statutes in effect at the time of the adoption of the Ohio Minimum Fair Wage Standards Act. Under R. C. 4111.03, compensation for \u201cemployees,\u201d as defined by R. C. 4111.01(E)(7), .is fixed at one and one-half times the normal wage rate for hours worked by that \u201cemployee\u201d in excess of 40 hours in one work week. Although the word \u201cweek\u201d is not defined by the Ohio Minimum Fair Wage. Standards Act, R. C. 1.44(A) provides that \u201c \u2018[w]eek\u2019 means seven consecutive days.\u201d Thus, a \u201cwork week\u201d under R. C. 4111.03 apparently consists of 40 hours of work in 7 consecutive days. However, under R. C. 737.07<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a work week is expressly defined to mean work not in excess of 44 hours. A similar inconsistency is evident when R. C. 4111.03 is read <em>in pari materia </em>with R. C. 4115.02<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which sets out detailed and comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>work standards for firemen employed by a municipal corporation, township, or fire district. Finally, we note that a construction of R. C. 4111.01(E)(7) which would mandate the payment of overtime compensation under R. C. 4111.03 to deputy sheriffs would be inconsistent with discretion afforded sheriffs under R. C. 325.17 to \u201cfix the compensation\u201d of their deputies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In our view, a construction of R. C. 4111.01(E)(7) which denies the statutory overtime to appellants in case Nos. 79-1294 and 79-1308 does not unconstitutionally deprive them of their property rights in violation of the due process and equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Appellants have not demonstrated that they have been deprived of a \u201cproperty\u201d interest which is protected by procedural due process. See <em>Bd. of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth </em>(1972), 408 U. S. 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Furthermore, we cannot accept appellants\u2019 contention that the exclusion of police and fire personnel from the operation of R. C. 4111.03 violates the Equal Protection Clause. In <em>State, ex rel. Soller, </em>v. <em>West Muskingum Bd. of Edn. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 148, 280 N.E. 2d 382, it is stated, at page 151: \u201c***The constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws does not dispense with the right and power of the General Assembly to differentiate within reasonable limitations, and if a classification has a reasonable basis it is not rendered invalid because it does not affect all in an identical manner.\u201d The classification of police and fire personnel has long been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>recognized as constitutionally appropriate due to the special function these individuals perform in safeguarding our communities. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1976), 425 U. S. 238; <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Murgia </em>(1976), 427 U. S. 307. A rational basis for legislative differentiation of police and fire personnel under the Ohio Minimum Fair Wage Standards Act is that the responsibilities of these public employees, unlike their counterparts, have no temporal parameters and pose specialized scheduling considerations for their employers. See, <em>e.g., </em>R. C. 737.07; 4115.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Accordingly, it is our conclusion that R. C. 4111.03 of the Ohio Minimum Fair Wage Standards Act does not require the payment of overtime compensation to any member of a police or fire protection agency working for an employer defined in R. C. 4111.01(D), as such persons were not intended by the General Assembly to be employees within the meaning of R. C. 4111.01(E)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In case No. 79-1299, appellants contend that R. C. 4111.01(E)(7) excludes deputy sheriffs from the definition of the term \u201cemployee\u201d as used in R. C. 4111.01 <em>et seq., </em>and for that reason deputy sheriffs are not employees entitled to the payment of overtime pursuant to the provisions of R. C. 4111.03. Based upon the foregoing, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals in case Nos. 79-1294 and 79-1308 is affirmed, and that of the Court of Appeals in case No. 79-1299 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in case Nos. 79-12% and 79-1308.
