Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar\">To decide these causes we must determine the conditions under which a Court of Appeals has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>jurisdiction to entertain the state\u2019s appeal from a trial court decision in a criminal case granting defendant\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress evidence. Since R. C. 2945.67 provides that such an appeal may be prosecuted as a matter of right,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> our inquiry is confined to the limitations imposed by the Ohio Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and by the Criminal Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The relevant constitutional limitation is the venerable \u201cfinal order\u201d requirement included in Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St. 2d 107,107-110, this court considered the conditions under which a decision granting defendant\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress evidence could be a final order, and concluded that such a decision is a final order within the meaning of R. C. 2505.02 and the Ohio Constitution \u201cwhere prosecution is irretrievably foreclosed through the suppression of evidence,***.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at page 110.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Collins, </em>proof that prosecution was \u201cirretrievably foreclosed\u201d emanated from the state\u2019s representation in oral argument \u201cthat the deprivation of the use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>evidence suppressed below rendered it virtually impossible ***to obtain a conviction***.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at pages 109-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Consistent with <em>Collins, </em>Crim. R. 12 (J)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has now formalized the procedure through which the state must represent that prosecution would be \u201cirretrievably foreclosed,\u201d by requiring the prosecutor to certify \u201cthat (1) the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay; and (2) the granting of the motion has rendered the state\u2019s proof with respect to the pending charge so weak in its entirety that any reasonable possibility of effective prosecution has been destroyed.\u201d Moreover, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Waller </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St. 2d 52, 57, and paragraph two of the syllabus, this court held that the time limitation, diligent prosecution and recognizance provisions of Crim. R. 12 (J), as well as the above certification, are valid, mandatory procedural requirements under Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Taken together, <em>Collins </em>and <em>Waller </em>provide that a Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to entertain the state\u2019s appeal from a trial court decision in a criminal case granting defendant\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress evidence <em>only </em>where the state has complied with Crim. R. 12 (J). Accordingly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ongell, </em>the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the appeal because the state complied with Crim. R. 12 (J). On the other hand, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Buckingham, </em>the Court of Appeals correctly dismissed the appeal since the state did not therein comply with Crim. R. 12(J).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ongell </em>is reversed, and the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment in <em>State </em>v. <em>Buckingham </em>is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed in case No. 79-803.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in case No. 79-620.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-8\">Celebrezze, C. J., Herbert, P. Brown, Sweeney, Locher and Holmes, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-6\"> In pertinent part, R. C. 2945.67(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u201cA prosecuting attorney* * *may appeal as a matter of right any decision of a trial court in a criminal case,***which decision grants***a motion to suppress evidence,***.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\"> A statute is void to the extent that it attempts to enlarge the Court of Appeals\u2019 jurisdiction beyond that provided for in Section 6 (reenacted as Section 3), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dodge </em>(1967), 10 Ohio App. 2d 92, 103, affirmed <em>sub </em>nom. <em>Euclid </em>v. <em>Heaton </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\"> In pertinent part, Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">\u201cCourts of Appeals shall have such jurisdiction as may be provided by law to review and affirm, modify, or reverse judgments or <em>final ordjers </em>of the courts of record inferior to the Court of Appeals * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b73-12\"> In pertinent part R. C. 2505.02 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">\u201c***an order <em>affecting a substantial right </em>made in a <em>special proceeding***is </em>a final order which may be reviewed, affirmed, modified or reversed, with or without retrial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\"><em>Collins, </em>at pages 109-110, concluded \u201cthat a pre-trial proceeding on a motion to suppress evidence in a criminal case is a special proceeding within the meaning of R. C. 2505.02***, and where prosecution is irretrievably foreclosed through the suppression of evidence, that right is clearly and adversely affected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">Notwithstanding'the conclusion that Section 3(B)(2) of Article IV did not prohibit the Court of Appeals from entertaining the appeal, <em>Collins </em>held that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction for reason that no statute then in existence extended such an appellate right to the state.
