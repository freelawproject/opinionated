Further, it appears that respondent acted neither maliciously nor for gain. Yet, respondent was involved in an obvious conflict of interest situation and there are indications of overreaching in these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">\u201cOne of the fundamental tenets of the professional responsibility of a lawyer is that he should maintain a degree of personal and professional integrity that meets the highest standard. The integrity of the profession can be maintained only if the conduct of the individual attorney is above reproach.***\u201d <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Stein </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 77, 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Having reviewed the findings of fact of the board, as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>as the documentation and argument presented to this court, it is found that respondent did violate the above cited provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">We, therefore, confirm the recommendation of the board that respondent, William Gargiulo, be publicly reprimanded.
