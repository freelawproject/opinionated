Humble, </em>v. <em>Mark Concepts, Inc. </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 77, 79, as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u201c***[W]here the record contains some evidence to support the commission\u2019s factual findings, these findings will not be disturbed. <em>State, ex rel. General Motors Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 278, 283; <em>State, ex rel. Capitol City Excavating Co., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 184, 188-189.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The commission stated in its decision that it relied, <em>inter alia, </em>upon \u201cevidence in the file.\u201d Under R. C. 4123.10, the commission \u201cshall not be bound by the usual common law or statutory rules of evidence***.\u201d In addition, the commission file is replete with material of a quasi-evidentiary nature which would support the commission\u2019s determination and satisfy the \u201csome evidence\u201d rule. For instance, appellant filed suit for injuries sustained in an automobile accident in 1969, including sprain and contusion of the musculature of the lumbo-sacral spinal region and aggravation of pre-existing arthritis in the spinal region and left knee. In 1967, appellant sued for injuries allegedly received from a fall in a laundromat including injuries to her head, back, left arm, right leg, and limitation of motion and pain regarding her back, arms, and legs. In addition, appellant was repeatedly treated at the Cleveland Clinic for recurrent pain in her knees prior to her alleged industrial accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In view of the extensive medical history of appellant, there was definitely some evidence in appellant\u2019s file upon which the commission could base its finding that she is permanently and totally disabled but not as a result of the allowed injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b468-9\">Celebrezze, C. J., Herbert, W. Brown, P. Brown, Sweeney, Locher and Holmes, JJ.; concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
