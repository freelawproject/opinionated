C. 2953.31 <em>et seq.,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>empower sentencing courts of this state to expunge the record of conviction of first offenders occurring in \u201canother jurisdiction,\u201d unconstitutionally deny judicial proceedings of other states full faith and credit within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Section 1 of Article IV of the Constitution of the United States, in relevant part, states that \u201cFull faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other State.\u201d Congress, pursuant to the enabling clause of Section 1 of Article IV,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11 (1 Stat. 122, Section 687, Title 28, U.S. Code, revised by Section 1738, Title 28, U.S. Code [1948]), set forth the manner by which this constitutional mandate is to be implemented, providing that judgments \u201c * * * shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States***as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state***from which they are taken.\u201d However, the United States Supreme Court has held that this constitutionally in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>spired command is not an all-embracing one, in that a rigid and inflexible implementation may fail to accommodate important and fundamental interests of sovereign states which are paramount to the unifying principle upon which the Full Faith and Credit Clause was predicated. See <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Attrill </em>(1892), 146 U.S. 657; <em>Alaska Packers Assn. </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Comm. </em>(1935), 294 U.S. 532; <em>Milwaukee County </em>v. <em>M. E. White Co. </em>(1935), 296 U.S. 268, 274; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1942), 317 U.S. 287; <em>Magnolia Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(1943), 320 U.S. 430; <em>May </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1953), 345 U.S. 528; <em>Nevada </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Although relaxation of the strictness of full faith and credit has been rare, an early exception was made respecting sister state judgments which were penal in the \u201cinternational sense,\u201d such as those resulting from state criminal convictions applying the <em>lex loci delictus. </em>See <em>The Antelope </em>(1825), 23 U.S. 66 (10 Wheat.), 122, 123; <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Pelican Ins. Co. </em>(1888), 127 U.S. 265; <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Attrill, supra; Converse </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1912), 224 U.S. 243, 260; <em>Bradford Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Clapper </em>(1932), 286 U.S. <em>145, 160) Nelson v. George </em>{1970), 399 U.S. 224, 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In the vintage case of <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Pelican Ins. Co., supra, </em>the court addressed as a corollary matter the breadth of the Full Faith and Credit Clause with respect to the enforcement of the penal judgments of one state by another. Quoting Chief Justice Marshall in <em>The Antelope, supra, </em>the <em>Wisconsin </em>court, at page 290, reasoned that it is an \u201cincontrovertible maxim\u201d that \u201c * * * [t]he courts of no country execute the penal laws of another.\u201d The court, in expounding upon this axiom in relation to the provisions of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, held at pages 290-291:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u201cThe rule that the courts of no country execute the penal laws of another applies not only to prosecutions and sentences for crimes and misdemeanors, but to all suits in favor of the State for the recovery of pecuniary penalties for any violation of statutes for the protection of its revenue, or other municipal laws, and to all judgments for such penalties. If this were not so, all that would be necessary to give ubiquitous effect to a penal law would be to put the claim for a penalty into the shape of a judgment.

Constitution, art. 4, sect. 1, Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11, 1 Stat. 122; Rev. Stat. \u00a7 905.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">It is our conclusion that under the provisions of R. C. 2953.31 <em>et seq., </em>courts of this state may grant intrastate ex-pungement for a judgment of conviction occurring in a sister <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>state, as Section 1 of Article IV of the Constitution of the United States does not place an obligation upon state courts to accord full faith and credit to extra-territorial state criminal judgments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">As a secondary challenge to appellee\u2019s application for ex-pungement, appellants contend in effect that the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires the <em>lex loci delictus </em>to be applied in order to determine whether appellee is entitled to the ex-pungement of his criminal record, which in this cause is the law of West Virginia. Insofar as the statutes of West Virginia do not authorize this type of an expungement, appellants argue that the expungement in Ohio would unconstitutionally deprive the West Virginia expungement statutes of the full faith and credit in Ohio guaranteed by Section 1 of Article IV of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In construing the breadth of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, and <em>a fortiori </em>the derivative Act of Congress, the United States Supreme Court has indicated that a foreign state statute is a \u201cpublic act\u201d within the meaning of Section 1' of Article IV. <em>Bradford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Clapper, supra </em>(286 U.S. 145, 154-155).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nonetheless, it has been emphasized that the degree to which a statute of a sister state must be accorded full faith and credit differs from the constitutional recognition required of out-of-state judgments submitted for enforcement in a foreign jurisdiction. <em>Magnolia Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>Hunt, supra </em>(320 U.S. 430); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra </em>(317 U.S. 287, 294-295). Since each state has both the constitutional authority to enact its own laws, and the corollary right to apply them with respect to persons or events within its borders in a manner consistent with the limits of due process,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>compel the displacement of local law with the conflicting law of another state, notwithstanding the undeniable applicability of the conflicting law in the other jurisdiction with reference to the same persons or events. <em>Magnolia Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>Hunt, supra; Pacific Employers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Comm. </em>(1939), 306 U.S. 493. Justice Stone, <em>in Alaska Packers Assn. </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Comm., supra </em>(294 U.S. 532), at pages 547-548, set forth the standard upon which resolution of these matters turns:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><em>\u201c*** Prima facie </em>every state is entitled to enforce in its own courts its own statutes, lawfully enacted. One who challenges that right, because of the force given to a conflicting statute of another state by the full faith and credit clause, assumes the burden of showing, upon some rational basis, that of the conflicting interests involved those of the foreign state are superior to those of the forum. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">See, also, <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co., supra; Nevada </em>v. <em>Hall, supra </em>(440 U.S. 410); cf., <em>Schiltz </em>v. <em>Meyer </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 169, 280 N.E. 2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In our view, a similar conclusion is warranted in the instant cause. The General Assembly has declared with the enactment of R. C. 2953.31 <em>et seq. </em>that this state is to provide remedial relief to qualified offenders in order to facilitate the prompt transition of these individuals into meaningful and productive roles.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To require Ohio to subordinate its announced policy, however wise or unwise it may be, for that of the <em>lex loci delictus, </em>would be repugnant to this state\u2019s interests with respect to its residents. No countervailing reasons have been presented which convince us that West Virginia\u2019s interests are paramount herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Appellants\u2019 final challenge to these statutory provisions stems from a literal reading of R. C. 2953.32(A). Appellants contend that upon a finding that appellee is entitled to the ex-pungement of an offense occurring in West Virginia, the Court of Common Pleas would be required to order authorities in West Virginia to expunge the records of conviction in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>state. Because Ohio is constitutionally unable to force West Virginia to expunge appellee\u2019s records there, appellants contend that the commands of R. C. 2953.31 <em>et seq., </em>pertaining to the expungement of records in jurisdictions other than Ohio, are without constitutional support.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">A review of the pertinent statutory provisions demonstrates that the expungement language scheme is indeed imprecise with regard to the manner in which the courts are to perform their statutory duty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is not, however, the function of this court to rewrite the enactment. Instead, it must be presumed that the General Assembly intended for these statutes to comport with the Constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Furthermore, these remedial provisions are to be liberally construed to promote their purposes. R. C. l.ll;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinito </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St. 2d 98, 101, 330 N.E. 2d 896. Accordingly, we conclude that the provisions of R. C. 2953.31 <em>et seq., </em>which refer to the expungement of a record of conviction, require only the expungement of those records located within the territorial boundaries of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b100-8\">Celebrezze, C.

That court reasoned at pages 673-674:</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">\u201cThe question whether a statute of one State, which in some aspects may be called penal, is a penal law in the international sense, so that it cannot be enforced in the courts of another State, depends upon the question whether its purpose is to punish an offense against the public justice of the State, or to afford a private remedy to a person injured by the wrongful act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">Particularly relevant to the cause at bar is the <em>Huntington </em>court\u2019s statement, at page 673, with regard to extra-territorial enforcement of the disabilities associated with criminal convictions under the Full Faith and Credit Clause:</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">\u201c * * *[P]ersonal disabilities imposed by the law of a State, as an incident or consequence of a judicial sentence or decree, by way of punishment of an offender, and not for the benefit of any other person\u2014such as attainder, or infamy, or incompetency of a convict to testify, or disqualification of the guilty party to a cause of divorce for adultery to marry again\u2014are doubtless strictly penal, and therefore have no extraterritorial operation.
