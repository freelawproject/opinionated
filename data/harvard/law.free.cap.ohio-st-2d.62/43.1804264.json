Gen., Appellant.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"b101-5\">[Cite as Lake Brady Assn. v.

C. 2915.01(I).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That section states: \u201c \u2018Religious organization\u2019 means any church, body of communicants, or group that is not organized or operated for profit, that gathers in common membership for regular worship and religious observances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">The only portion of this definition in question is whether appellee gathers for regular worship and religious observance. It is undisputed that appellee meets the other criterion presented in R. C. 2915.01(1). The statute does not define what is meant by \u201cregular worship and religious observance,\u201d and that phrase is open to various interpretations. When a statute is facially ambiguous, it is the function of the courts to construe the statutory language to effect a just and reasonable result. <em>Gulf Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St. 2d 208, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>paragraph two of the syllabus. See, also, R. C. 1.47(C). The Court of Appeals construed the statute reasonably. When it addressed the manner in which a religious organization conducted its worship, it concluded that appellee\u2019s summer gatherings constituted \u201cregular worship and religious observance.\u201d We agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b103-7\">Celebrezze, C. J., Herbert, W. Brown, P. Brown, Sweeney, Locher and Holmes, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b102-10\"> The record established that appellee met the requirements of R. C. 2915.01(H). It received a letter from the Internal Revenue Service stating that it was tax exempt and it was in continuous existence for a period of two years before applying for a bingo license.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
