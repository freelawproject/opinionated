C. 2919.22).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">R. C. 2919.22(B)(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as submitted to the jury for its con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>sideration, does not \u201cspecify any degree of culpability\u201d nor does it \u201cplainly indicate] a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in such section.\u201d R. C. 2901.21(B). Recklessness therefore is sufficient culpability to commit the offense. The Court of Appeals correctly held that prior to finding a defendant guilty of violating R. C. 2919.22(B)(2), the state must prove recklessness on the part of the defendant as defined in R. C. 2901.22(C). The state has the burden of establishing all material elements of a crime by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur </em>(1975), 421 U. S. 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">As a general rule, a defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on all elements that must be proved to establish the crime with which he is charged,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, where specific intent or culpability is an essential element of the offense, a trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on that mental element constitutes error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In this cause, appellee neither requested an instruction on the element of recklessness nor did he object to the instruction as given. Thus, the Court of Appeals did not properly reverse Adams\u2019 conviction on the basis of the deficient instructions unless the trial court\u2019s error rose to the level of \u201cplain error\u201d and prejudiced the appellee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">We held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St. 2d 91, paragraph three of the syllabus, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\u201cNotice of plain error under Crim. R. 52(B) is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Consistent with <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>we hold that a trial court\u2019s failure to separately and specifically charge the jury on every element of each crime with which a defendant is charged does not <em>per se </em>constitute plain error nor does it necessarily require reversal of a conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Only by reviewing the record in each case can the probable impact of such a failure be determined, and a decision reached as to whether substantial prejudice may have been visited on the defendant, thereby resulting in a manifest miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In presenting its case against the appellee, the state called the senior pathologist of the county coroner\u2019s office who had performed an autopsy on the deceased child. He testified that the child, who weighed 19 pounds and was 33 inches tall at the time of his death, had suffered external injuries \u201cwhich extended literally from his hairline down to his ankles\u201d in the form of contusions (bruises) and abrasions (scrapes). Internally, the child had suffered hemorrhaging and bruising of the right lung, stomach, intestines and brain. In the pathologist\u2019s professional opinion, George 0. Walker, Jr. \u201cdied as a result of multiple bruises or impacts to his head, trunk [and] extremities that led to associated internal injuries, shock and death.\u201d One particularly significant injury, a torn adrenal gland, was caused, in the pathologist\u2019s opinion, by \u201ca violent impact to the trunk, either in the form of a powerful blow or a squeeze\u201d greater than could have been suffered as the result of an ordinary fall onto a playground or onto cement. He testified that the child\u2019s injuries were sustained over a period of at least several days and that, although none of the individual injuries would necessarily have caused death, the cumulative effect of the injuries was more than the boy\u2019s body could tolerate.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The pathologist testified further that some of the child\u2019s abrasions could have been inflicted by fingernails or resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>from a fall. He testified that either an adult man or woman was capable of inflicting the injuries. The pathologist\u2019s descriptions of the child\u2019s injuries and his conclusions as to the cause of death were not controverted by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">On the basis of this undisputed expert medical testimony and photographs of the child\u2019s body (which were admitted in evidence), the jury could only have come to the conclusion that the child was subjected to severe and repeated beatings by some person or persons. The defense presented no evidence which could support a theory that the injuries were caused by mere criminal negligence. On the contrary, the state\u2019s proof of the brutal nature of the boy\u2019s injuries support the conclusion that the person inflicting even some of the injuries would necessarily have known that his or her actions would risk causing serious physical harm to a 2 V2 year old child.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By relying on the sole defense that the appellee was not the person or one of the persons who abused the victim, the existence of recklessness on the part of the abuser was never put in issue at trial. \u201cThe evidence, as well as the law, governs the charge of the court in a criminal case***[R. C. 2945.11].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Loudermill </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 79, 80. In finding the appellee guilty of involuntary manslaughter, the jury necessarily rejected the proffered defense and believed beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellee had been responsible for inflicting proven injuries to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Thus, on this record and in the absence of a specific request for an instruction on the element of culpability, it cannot be said that a manifest injustice may have been worked on the appellee by the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the essential element of recklessness. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that failure to be plain error and in reversing the conviction on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The Court of Appeals found separate reversible error in the trial court\u2019s calling of Renia Sartors as a court\u2019s witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The prosecutor presented his request that Renia Sartors be called as a court\u2019s witness out of the presence of the jury. He represented to the court that \u201cthere is a witness* * * Renia Sartors,\u201d that in the past she had made \u201capproximately three statements, and that there are items in those statements which are in conflict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That there are matters about this case that she wishes to testify to, and that [it] would be in the interest of justice at arriving at the truth of what occurred* * * \u201d that she testify. The prosecutor felt, however, that \u201cbecause of the conflicting statements* * *[the State was] unable to vouch for her credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The defense promptly objected to the prosecution\u2019s request that the court call Sartors as a court\u2019s witness on the basis that such a \u201chighly irregular\u201d procedure would \u201cin essence give the jury the feeling that the court is taking sides in this issue.\u201d Sartors was called to the courtroom, still out of the presence of the jury. The court determined from the potential witness and her counsel that no \u201cdeal\u201d with the prosecution had been struck for her testimony. The court assured itself that her testimony would be given freely and voluntarily, in full knowledge of her rights. Sartors was thereafter called as a witness before the jury by the court and asked a short series of questions (her name, knowledge of her son\u2019s death, and her discovery of it). The court then allowed both prosecution and defense the opportunity to cross-examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The Court of Appeals recognized that a trial court has the inherent power in its discretion to call an individual as a witness of the court. It held, however, that \u201cbecause of the great potential for prejudice, absent special circumstances which should be placed in the record, the general rule must be that the court should not call a witness.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>We are not in total disagreement with the general rule formulated by the Court of Appeals. Unlike the Court of Appeals, however, we do not believe that the trial court\u2019s action in calling Sartors constituted an abuse of discretion nor that it constituted grounds for reversing Adams\u2019 conviction and remanding the cause for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Under Ohio common law rules of evidence, the prosecution, had it called Sartors, would have been deemed to have \u201cvouched\u201d for her credibility and could not thereafter have impeached her.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Appellee concedes that a trial court has the power to call \u25a0witnesses in the exercise of a sound discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, when the court called Renia Sartors as a witness of the court appellee emphasizes that not only was he subjected to the risks of prejudice mentioned by the Court of Appeals, but the prosecution gained two significant procedural advantages: (1) it gained the right to impeach Sartors, and (2) it avoided the application during its examination of Sartors of the rule prohibiting it from asking leading questions of its own witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>Steiner </em>v. <em>Custer </em>(1940), 137 Ohio St. 448; <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Conner </em>(1959), 170 Ohio St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>85; <em>Chester Township </em>v. <em>Geauga Co. Budget Comm. </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">At the point in the trial when the trial court was faced with the prosecution\u2019s request that Sartors be called as a court\u2019s witness, the state had established a <em>prima facie </em>case against the appellee.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The state had produced evidence that the child had been badly abused; that the appellee had been present in the child\u2019s home during the time frame in which that abuse had been inflicted; that the proposed witness was the child\u2019s mother; and that both the appellee and the proposed witness had given statements to the police concerning the source of the child\u2019s injuries. The trial court had before it ample justification for concluding that Sartors\u2019 testimony would be beneficial to the jury in performing its fact-finding responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u201c[I]n modern criminal trials, defendants [as well as prosecutors] are rarely able to select their witnesses: they must take them where they find them.\u201d <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1973), 410 U. S. 284, 296. The court, at the time it was faced with the prosecution\u2019s request, had in addition to the prosecutor\u2019s representation of prior conflicting statements, information that the appellee had lived as a partner in the potential witness\u2019 household (indicating a possible predisposition towards the appellee), but also that the witness was a co-defendant awaiting trial and willing to testify at her former household partner\u2019s trial for the same crime of which she was accused (suggesting a possible motivation to testify against the appellee).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">We cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in refusing to require the state to take its chances on Sartors\u2019 testimony and instead calling her as a witness of the court. Nor did the court act improperly in conducting direct examination from the bench. The court\u2019s examination was short, and it consisted of non-leading questions. It remained for trial counsel to elicit the bulk of her testimony through cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Because we find no error in this record justifying reversal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>of the conviction, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b217-5\">Celebrezze, C.
