As no bills of exception were reserved, at least none being in the record, we can not review these matters. Heither are there any special charges in .the record. If any were requested they were not copied in the transcript, consequently we can not say whether any of them should have been given or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-17\">Such complaints as \u201cthe court erred in its general charge in failing to charge the law applicable to the case,\u201d are too general to bring anything before us for review.
