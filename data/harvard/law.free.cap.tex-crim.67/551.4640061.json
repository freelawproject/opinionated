It has been held by this court that a rash, inconsiderate expression, provoked by an angry altercation in which the parties were then engaged, will not constitute the offense. (March v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 107.) The most the testimony shows is that appellant perhaps made an unprovoked assault, and when prevented from again striking Rayburn, made an inconsiderate and harsh remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
