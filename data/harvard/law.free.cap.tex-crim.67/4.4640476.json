In addition to this,' the State introduced another witness, and before he testified as to the facts' of the case appellant' proved by him, without objection by the State, that he had served' a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>full term in the penitentiary for a felony, and had never been pardoned, nor his citizenship restored to him. The appellant then objected to his testifying, because he was an unpardoned convict. The statute expressly disqualifies such a witness from testifying. Code of Criminal Procedure, article 783, subdivision 3. The State, upon proper objection, could have prevented the witness from testifying orally about his conviction, etc., and have required the defendant to \u2022 produce the proper judgment of conviction, sentence, etc., but not having done this, and the witness being permitted to testify, clearly presents reversible error. White v. State, 33 Texas Crim. Rep., 177, and Moore v. State, <em>39 </em>Texas Crim. Rep., 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\">Whether or not appellant had the pistol on this occasion was expressly denied by him in his testimony, and in addition he had several witnesses who also, in substance, so testified. The question of whether or not he had a pistol was, therefore, the material question in the case. Permitting the disqualified witness to testify is, therefore, reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
