Appellant presented an application for continuance on account of the absence of several witnesses. In the absence of a statement of facts we are unable to say that there was any error on the part of the court in refusing to continue the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\"><em>2. </em>While the witness Brown was testifying for the State he was asked the following question: \u201cHad you said anything to him or . done anything to him?\u201d meaning had the witness said anything to the defendant or done anything to the defendant. Objection was urged to this because same was leading and suggested the answer desired by State\u2019s counsel. The answer is not given or stated in the bill of exceptions, if in fact the witness did answer. The answer may have been favorable to the accused so far as the bill is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">3. Another bill of exception^ recites .that -the witness Brown testified on cross-examination that he was deputy constable. He was then asked the following question: \u201cWhat salary, if any, do you draw?\u201d Objection was urged by the State, which was sustained by the court. The object and purpose of asking this question is not stated, nor is it shown what answer the witness would have given had he been permitted to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-16\">4. Another bill recites that the witness Chesia, while tesifying for the State, was asked the following question: \u201cAt the time he fired the shot, state to the jury if you or Joe Brown had drawn your pistols,\u201d meaning at the time the shot was fired, which wounded the witness Brown, had either Brown or the witness Chesia drawn their pistols. Objection was urged by the defendant, which was sustained by the court, and then the following question was asked: \u201cState to \u25a0the jury whether or not you had said anything to the defendant,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>meaning had the witness Chesia said anything to the party who fired the shot which wounded the witness Brown. To this appellant interposed objection, which was sustained by the court. The bill then uses this language: \u201cto which ruling of the court in sustaining both objections the defendant then and there, in open court, excepts and tenders his bill of exceptions.\u201d This is signed by the court as given. There certainly could be no error urged by appellant in having both of his objections sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">5. Another bill recites the witness Chesia having testified for the State on cross-examination, by defendant, was examined touching his feeling and prejudices in the case, and the following question was asked: \u201cWould you like to see him punished as much as could be and jura would testify everything in the world to convict him that was straight and fair?\u201d The witness answered, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d when the court stopped the cross-examination of the witness by the defendant and refused further examination; and the defendant says had he been allowed to further question the witness on this point, he could have shown a bias and prejudice, which he says he was entitled to and which the jury should have known. This bill is signed with the explanation that \u201cthe witness had testified at the instance of the defendant that he felt unkindly to defendant, because of being shot by him, that he wanted the defendant convicted, and used the language mentioned in the bill. The court did not stop the witness until he had admitted his bias, and the objection made by the State was correct,_ that is witness was asked to go over the same matter time and again.\u201d As this bill is qualified by the judge there could have been no error. The bill is accepted with this qualification and will be treated as correctly presenting the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">6. Another bill recites that the witness Chesia had detailed \u201cas to how he first saw the party who did the shooting that night and how they had passed him and that one had a gun and a guitar.\u201d On direct examination by the State it had been shown that prior to the shooting defendant did not have a gun, and the witness Chesia testified that defendant had a gun, but when asked on cross-examination .the following question: \u201cDid the man that had a guitar have the shotgun?\u201d the State objected, which objection was sustained, and appellant excepted. This bill was refused by the court with the statement that no such ruling was made by the court. These are the bills found in the record, and none of them present error. The bills are imperfect, and not in such condition as really to be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
