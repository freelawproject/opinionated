This issue was submitted to the jury, and we have carefully reviewed all the grounds assigned -and none of them present error unless it is the fourth bill of exceptions. Appellant testified he came to Texas about four years ago and went to live with his uncle, C. C. McCollum, and had made a crop there every year until the year 1911. That during this year he went to Bremond and did some work,' but frequently visited the home of his uncle and considered that his home. He was at his uncle\u2019s on this occasion, and carried the pistol on his uncle\u2019s place, as all the testimony would show. Hnder appellant\u2019s testimony we think the issue was fairly raised as to whether or not this was his home, and the special charge requested presenting this issue to the jury for their determination should have been given. Appellant reserved a bill of exceptions to the failure to give this charge, and complained of the failure to do so also in his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-15\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-16\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
