He also complains of the charge of the court in several particulars, but none of these matters can be considered by this court without a statement of facts. The court gave a charge that- could clearly have been applicable to a statement of facts under the allegations of the indictment. With the record as it is, we must presume that the charge and judgment of the court is in every way correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">The judgment will, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
