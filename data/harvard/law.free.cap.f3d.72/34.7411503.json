GARZA and PARKER, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<author id=\"b126-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b126-20\">Petitioner Harvey F. Garlotte (\u201cGarlotte\u201d) brings a habeas corpus action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, challenging a 1985 state conviction for possession of marijuana. The district court, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, dismissed the petition. We granted Garlotte\u2019s request for a Certificate of Probable Cause, ordering Respondent Kirk Fordice (\u201cFordice\u201d) to brief the issue of whether the district court prematurely dismissed Garlotte\u2019s petition without requiring an answer or conducting an eviden-tiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-21\">Garlotte was sentenced to three years on the possession of marijuana charge. At the same time he received two concurrent life sentences for murder to run consecutive to that three year sentence. The present petition targets only the marijuana conviction which Garlotte has already discharged. Con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>eluding that Garlotte was not \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2254, we affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The Supreme Court subsequently reversed that affirmance, holding that Garlotte remains \u201cin custody\u201d under all of his consecutively imposed sentences until all are served and may attack the conviction underlying the sentence scheduled to run first in the series. <em>Garlotte v. Fordice, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 1948, 132 L.Ed.2d 36 (1995). Therefore, the Supreme Court remanded the case for further proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Garlotte advances fifteen points of error on appeal, contending that his guilty plea was unlawful on various grounds, including ineffective assistance of counsel, double jeopardy, and generally whether his plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary. Having reviewed the record and briefs on appeal, we have concluded that there is no merit to any of his grounds of error. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
