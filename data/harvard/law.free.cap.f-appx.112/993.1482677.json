The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on all claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">This court reviews the grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion <em>de novo. Brown v. Nationsbank Corp., </em>188 F.3d 579, 585 (5th Cir.1999). Dismissal should be affirmed only if \u201cit appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). We examine only the allegations of the complaint, accepting all well-pled allegations as true and liberally construing any ambiguities in favor of the appellant. <em>Collins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, </em>224 F.3d 496, 498-99 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">Price\u2019s appellate brief does not address the district court\u2019s ruling on his Title VII claim, and we accordingly treat that issue as waived. After reviewing Price\u2019s amended complaint, we agree with the district court that, taking all of the allegations in his complaint as true, it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that Price can prove no set of fact in support of his claims that would entitle him to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is AFFIRMED. All outstanding motions in the case are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1031-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">. Price also alleged violations of a Louisiana criminal statute. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. 14:134. Price does not brief this issue on appeal, and we accordingly treat it as waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
