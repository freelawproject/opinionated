Bradley alleged that prison guards wrongly allowed another inmate to enter Bradley\u2019s cell and attack him. Defendant Jacobs was dismissed, and Bradley does not appeal that dismissal. Bradley contends that the jury verdict for the remaining defendant was not supported by evidence. He also contends that the district court erred by not allowing two witnesses to testify, by allowing the defendant to file a second motion for summary judgment, and by denying Bradley\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">There was evidence that the assailant deliberately misled the inexperienced defendant by telling him to open the wrong cell door and that the defendant did so in error. Bradley presented evidence that could have established the defendant\u2019s negligence, but a reasonable jury could easily conclude that the defendant did not act with the requisite \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to Bradley\u2019s safety. <em>See Neals v. Norwood, </em>59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1995) (discussing deliberate indifference); <em>Granberry v. O\u2019Barr, </em>866 F.2d 112, 113 (5th Cir.1988) (jury verdict will be upheld unless reasonable jury could not reach that verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">Bradley offers only short, bald conclusions without factual or legal analysis with regard to his other claims. Consequently, those claims are waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief issues); <em>see also Brown v. Slenker, </em>220 F.3d 411, 421 n. 9 (5th Cir.2000) (summary judgment rulings mooted by trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1029-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
