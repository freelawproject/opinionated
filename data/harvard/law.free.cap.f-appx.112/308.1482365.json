DeVaughn seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on his action alleging violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) and <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and his motion to reconsider. Regarding the district court\u2019s order dismissing the action, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because DeVaughn\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-22\">Parties are accorded sixty days if the United States is a party after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-23\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing DeVaughn\u2019s action was entered on the docket on October 1, 2003. DeVaughn\u2019s notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>appeal was filed on February 24, 2004.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because DeVaughn failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Regarding DeVaughn\u2019s timely appeal of the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to reconsider under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in denying relief. <em>CNF Constructors, Inc. v. Donohoe Constr. Co., </em>57 F.3d 395, 401 (4th Cir.1995) (providing standard of review). Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-16\"> This date gives DeVaughn the benefit of <em>Houston v.
