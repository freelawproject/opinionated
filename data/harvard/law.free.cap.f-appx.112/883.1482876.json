The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for partial dismissal as to the FLSA claims. The parties then filed cross-motions for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>mary judgment as to the Federation\u2019s two remaining claims. The Federation .subsequently filed a motion to amend the complaint to add a new defendant, Boykin Rose, the Director of the Department of Public Safety. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied as moot the Federation\u2019s motion to amend the complaint. The Federation now appeals only the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. We affirm, albeit on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The district court properly construed the Federation\u2019s remaining causes of action as claims arising under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983. A cause of action under Section 1983 requires the deprivation of a civil right by a \u201cperson\u201d acting under color of state law. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983. It is now well settled that a state cannot be sued under Section 1983 (West 2003). <em>Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (\u201c[N]either a State nor its officials acting in their official capacities are \u2018persons\u2019 under \u00a7 1983.\u201d). This rule applies \u201cto States or governmental entities that are considered \u2018arms of the State\u2019 for Eleventh Amendment purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 109 S.Ct. 2304. For Eleventh Amendment purposes, the Department of Public Safety is considered an arm of the State of South Carolina. Accordingly, it cannot be sued under Section 1983, as the Federation conceded at the oral argument of this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because neither the State of South Carolina nor the Department of Public Safety qualify as \u201cpersons\u201d under Section 1983, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-6\">. In fact, counsel conceded that unless the Federation was allowed to amend its complaint, it would \"lose\u201d on its Section 1983 claims for failure to name a \"person.\u201d Nonetheless, the Federation did not appeal the district court\u2019s order denying its motion to amend the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b923-7\">. Although the district court declined to address the defendants\u2019 argument that the State and the Department of Public Safety did not qualify as \"persons\u201d under Section 1983, we may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Scott v. United States, </em>328 F.3d 132, 137 (4th Cir.2003) (\"We are, of course, entitled to affirm on any ground appearing in the record, including theories not relied upon or rejected by the district court.\u201d). On appeal the defendants continue to argue that they are not amenable to suit because they do not qualify as \"persons\u201d under Section 1983. In response, the Federation appears to contend that the defendants cannot raise such an argument in their defense without filing a cross-appeal. <em>See </em>Appellant's Brief at 2. We disagree. A prevailing party may defend a judgment on any ground, including theories not relied upon or even rejected by the district court, so long as that party seeks to preserve, and not modify, the judgment. <em>See El Paso Nat. Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, </em>526 U.S. 473, 479, 119 S.Ct. 1430, 143 L.Ed.2d 635 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
