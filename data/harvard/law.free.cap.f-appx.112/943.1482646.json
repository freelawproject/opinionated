The district court sentenced Miles to six months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">In 1997, Miles\u2019 probation officer filed a petition seeking Miles\u2019 arrest and revocation of his supervised release based on several violations of the conditions of supervised release. At the time the petition was filed, however, Miles had absconded from supervision and his whereabouts were unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">In October 2003, Miles was arrested by New Jersey police officers for possession of cocaine. Miles\u2019 probation officer then filed an amendment to the petition, noting Miles\u2019 new violations based upon the New Jersey arrest. At the revocation hearing, the district court found Miles had committed the violations and revoked Miles\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">Because Miles\u2019 underlying offense is a Class C felony, the maximum term of imprisonment imposed upon the revocation of supervised release may not exceed two years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000). Because Miles\u2019 sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum term set forth in \u00a7 3583(e), we review the sentence only to determine whether it is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3742(a)(4), 3742(e)(4) (2000). Given the facts of this case, we cannot say that a twenty-four month sentence is plainly unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s imposition of a twenty-four month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
