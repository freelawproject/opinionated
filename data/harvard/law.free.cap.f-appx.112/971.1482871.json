He was sentenced to a 57-month term of imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-20\">Barrios contends that the district court misapprehended its authority to depart downward on grounds of cultural assimilation. The issue presented to and addressed by the district court was whether Barrios qualified for a \u201cfast track\u201d departure. Rather than misapprehending its legal authority to depart downward on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>basis of cultural assimilation, the district court determined that it lacked legal authority to adopt a substitute basis for departure as a means for remedying the Government\u2019s failure to implement a \u201cfast track\u201d program. Because the record does not support Barrios\u2019s argument that the district court misapprehended its legal authority to depart downward on the basis of cultural assimilation, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the issue. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Montelongo, </em>263 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.2001). The appeal is dismissed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Barrios\u2019s offense level was raised by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because he was convicted for an aggravated felony/crime of violence prior to deportation. Barrios contends that the prior conviction constituted an element of the offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) and should not be regarded as a mere sentencing factor. Because the fact of the prior conviction was not alleged in the indictment, he contends, his maximum sentence should have been no more than 24 months under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but asserts that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been called into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART; and the appeal is DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1010-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
