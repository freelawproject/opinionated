The district court struck Peppers\u2019s four attempts to file an answer to the complaint for failure to comply with the local rules of civil procedure. Peppers argues that the district court did not consider lesser sanctions before striking his pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-23\">\u201cEntry of a default judgment is an appropriate sanction when the disobedient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>party has failed to comply with a court order because of willfulness, bad faith, or other fault on its part, as opposed to its inability to comply with the court\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Technical Chem. Co. v. IG-LO Prod. Corp., </em>812 F.2d 222, 224 (5th Cir.1987). The district court warned Peppers that the local rules would be strictly enforced and repeatedly gave him opportunities to correct the various deficiencies before striking the pleadings and entering a default judgment. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See McLeod, Alexander, Powel &amp; Apffel, P.C. v. Quarles, </em>894 F.2d 1482, 1486 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">The appellee\u2019s motion for sanctions against Peppers pursuant to Fed.
