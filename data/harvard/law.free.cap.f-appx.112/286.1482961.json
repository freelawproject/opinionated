Jenkins alleged that his rights were violated because a conversation with his attorney was videotaped by the Defendants at the Lexington County Sheriffs Department without his knowledge. The portion of the videotape at issue was approximately twenty seconds long. The district court, accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, denied relief on Jenkins\u2019 claims. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinions and find no reversible error. Accordingly, with regard to Jenkins\u2019 claims that the recording violated his Fourth Amendment rights and his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Jenkins v. Lexington County Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t, </em>No. CA-00-2722 (D.S.C. Sept. 30, 2003 <em>&amp; </em>Feb. 26, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Jenkins also alleged that the recording violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. We find this claim is without merit because the portion of the tape at issue was suppressed at Jenkins\u2019 criminal trial, the audio portion of the tape could not be discerned, and, at a post-trial hearing on the matter, neither Jenkins nor his counsel could recall anything prejudicial being discussed during the conversation. Thus, under <em>Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 558, 97 S.Ct. 837, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977), Jenkins has failed to establish a Sixth Amendment violation. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of this claim on the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Weatherford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
