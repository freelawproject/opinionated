Specifically, he challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Batten argues that he pleaded guilty in a timely manner, truthfully admitted all offense conduct and relevant conduct, and has shown remorse for his conduct. He urges that denial of the aceeptance-of-responsibility reduction should not have been based upon his alleged marijuana possession since that conduct predated his plea and has not resulted in any additional criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The district court did not err in denying acceptance of responsibility based on Batten\u2019s pre-plea conduct indicating continuing criminal behavior, specifically, his possession of marijuana pending trial. <em>See United States v. Flucas, </em>99 F.3d 177, 180 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Rickett, </em>89 F.3d 224, 227 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also United States v. Watkins, </em>911 F.2d 983, 984-85 (5th Cir.1990). Batten acknowledges these cases but urges the court to revisit them, citing cases from the Ninth Circuit, which he contends show that the denial of acceptance of responsibility is more appropriate when the defendant engages in criminal conduct after pleading guilty. However, no panel of this court may overrule the decision of a prior panel in the absence of <em>en banc </em>reconsideration or a superseding Supreme Court decision. <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The facts contained in the presentence report and adduced at sentencing establish that Batten possessed marijuana in his jail cell while he awaited trial. There is no evidence to support Batten\u2019s contention that the marijuana was not his. The district court\u2019s denial of acceptance of responsibility was not error. <em>See United States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>62 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also Fincas, </em>99 F.3d at 180; <em>Rickett, </em>89 F.3d at 227; <em>Watkins, </em>911 F.2d at 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">In a letter filed pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j), Batten argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of sentencing enhancements under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) and (b)(4) violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). This issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 466 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
