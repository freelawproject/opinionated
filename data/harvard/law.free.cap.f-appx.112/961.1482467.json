Montes argues that the upward adjustment for obstruction of justice was contrary to the Sentencing Guideline\u2019s commentary and that, even if the obstruction adjustment was not barred, it was not supported by the evidence because the Government admitted that it could not prove that \u201cJuan Alberto Montes\u201d is a false name and the Government had offered no evidence that the birth date Montes had given was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-18\">The district court made no explicit finding to support the enhancement for obstruction of justice. By granting the Government\u2019s motion, the district court implicitly found either that Montes had made a materially false statement to a judge or magistrate judge or to the probation officer. However, the record does not support a finding that Montes had made a false statement at all. The Government admitted that it did not know whether \u201cMontes\u201d was a false name and did not offer any evidence that the 1972 birth date was false. Thus, the district court clearly erred. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>263 F.3d 436, 441 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-19\">We do not conclude, \u201con the record as a whole, that the error was harmless, i.e., that the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>posed.\u201d <em>United States v. Ahmed, </em>324 F.3d 368, 374 (5th Cir.2003)(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Montes\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the matter REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1000-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
