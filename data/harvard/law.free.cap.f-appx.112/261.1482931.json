He received a sentence of forty-eight months imprisonment. Gonzalez-Michel appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred in deciding that his prior North Carolina felony conviction for taking indecent liberties with a child<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> constitutes a crime of violence warranting a 16-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (2003). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Gonzalez-Michel was deported in 1998 after he was charged with statutory rape of a girl under thirteen years old and pled guilty to the reduced charge of taking indecent liberties with a child. He reentered the United States illegally in May 2000, and was subsequently charged with illegal reentry after being convicted of an aggravated felony. He entered a guilty plea in November 2003 and was sentenced in February 2004. The 2003 Guidelines Manual applied when he was sentenced. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 IB.11(a) (requiring use of Guidelines Manual in effect on date defendant is sentenced).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">Guideline section 2L1.2(b) provides a base offense level of 8 and a 16-level enhancement if the defendant has been convicted, before deportation, of certain offenses, including a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). An 8-level enhancement applies if the defendant was convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d before deportation. USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Application Note l(N)(iii) to \u00a7 2L1.2 states explicitly that sexual abuse of a minor is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). The term also includes other enumerated crimes and \u201cany offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Application Note 3(B) states that the 8-level enhancement shall be applied \u201cfor any aggravated felony ... with respect to which the offense level is not increased under subsections (b)(1)(A) or (B).\u201d When Gonzalez-Michel was sentenced, the district court applied, over his objection, the 16-level enhancement from subsection (b)(1)(A), based on his conviction for taking indecent liberties with a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">In this appeal, Gonzalez-Michel argues first that his North Carolina conviction for taking indecent liberties with a child is not a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 because it does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force against the person of another. Gonzalez-Michel does not dispute that the offense constitutes sexual abuse of a minor. <em>See United States v. Pereira-Salmeron, </em>337 F.3d 1148, 1155 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cThe use of young children for the gratification of sexual desires constitutes an abuse.\u201d) (internal quotation and citation omitted). We review de novo the legal issue of whether a state offense is a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>278 F.3d 282, 286 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Gonzalez-Michel\u2019s first argument appears to focus on the 2002 version of \u00a7 2L1.2 and its commentary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The 2003 commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) explicitly defines \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as a crime of violence distinct from \u201cforcible sex offenses.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). Amendment 658, effective on November 1, 2003, was intended in part to clarify the definition of \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as used in \u00a7 2L1.2, and to \u201cmake[ ] clear that the enumerated offenses are always classified as \u2018crimes of violence,\u2019 regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d Even before the 2003 amendment, other circuits held that a conviction for an offense constituting sexual abuse of a minor, whether or not force was an element of the offense, was a crime of violence as defined in Application Note 1 to \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>Pereira-Salmeron, </em>337 F.3d at 1152; <em>United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 316 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1095, 123 S.Ct. 694, 154 L.Ed.2d 645 (2002); <em>United States v. Gomez-Hernandez, </em>300 F.3d 974, 979 (8th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1138, 123 S.Ct. 929, 931, 154 L.Ed.2d 831 (2003). Moreover, we held in <em>Pierce </em>that the particular North Carolina offense at issue here was a crime of violence properly used as a predicate offense for a career offender sentence. <em>Pierce, </em>278 F.3d at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Gonzalez-Michel also maintains that the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 should not be followed because it imposes a greater punishment than is warranted by the language of the guideline itself. He relies on <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 42-45, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (holding that guideline controls if commentary is inconsistent with it). We discern no inconsistency between \u00a7 2L1.2(b) and the definition of crime of violence set out in Application Note l(B)(iii). Gonzalez-Michel\u2019s final argument is based on his analysis of the language of the 2002 version of Application Note 1 which, as explained above, does not apply to his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">As Gonzalez-Michel has not identified any error in the district court\u2019s decision to impose the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) for having been deported after conviction of a crime of violence, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-11\">.
