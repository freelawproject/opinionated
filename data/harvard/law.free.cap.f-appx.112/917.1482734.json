Because Smith has filed an untimely notice of appeal, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The time periods for filing notices of appeal are governed by Fed. R.App. P. 4. These periods are \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)). A defendant in a criminal action has ten days within which to file in the district court a notice of appeal from a judgment or final order. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). The only exception to the appeal period is when the district court extends the time to appeal upon showing of excusable neglect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-26\">The district court entered its judgment on December 13, 2001; Smith\u2019s notice of appeal was filed in July 2004, well beyond the ten day appeal period. Smith\u2019s failure to note a timely appeal or obtain an extension of the appeal period leaves this court without jurisdiction to consider the merits of his appeal. We therefore dismiss the appeal. In No. 04-7364, Smith appeals the district court\u2019s order denying leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Accordingly, we dismiss both appeals. We further deny Smith\u2019s motions to proceed in forma pauperis and to correct the record. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
