UNITED STATES, Defendant-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"AmE\">No. 04-5123, 04-5148.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"AFx\">United States Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AVn0\">Oct. 13, 2004.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b828-18\">Before MAYER, Chief Judge, MICHEL and CLEVENGER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b828-19\">ON MOTION</p>\n<author id=\"b828-20\">CLEVENGER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b828-21\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b828-22\">The United States moves to dismiss these appeals, filed by John R. O\u2019Donnell and Carol A. O\u2019Donnell (the O\u2019Donnells), for lack of a final appealable judgment. The O\u2019Donnells oppose. The United States moves to stay the briefing schedule. The O\u2019Donnells move to expedite and to stay an order of the United States Court of Federal Claims that requires them to respond to the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss filed in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-23\">The O\u2019Donnells filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims challenging the forfeiture of property due to convictions against John R. O\u2019Donnell. The United States moved to dismiss the O\u2019Donnells\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The O\u2019Donnells moved for leave to depose a witness. The Court of Federal Claims stayed the O\u2019Donnells\u2019 discovery motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>pending disposition of the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The O\u2019Donnells appeal that order in 04-5123. Thereafter, the Court of Federal Claims ruled that it had jurisdiction to continue proceedings in the matter, notwithstanding the O\u2019Donnells\u2019 appeal. The O\u2019Donnells appeal that order in 04-5148.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The O\u2019Donnells do not dispute that there has been no entry of an appealable final judgment. Instead, they argue that the appeal is permissible pursuant to <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Under the collateral order doctrine, certain orders are appealable despite the lack of a final judgment. A collateral order may be appealed if it conclusively determines the disputed question, resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978). We determine that the appeal of the order staying discovery pending disposition of a motion to dismiss, 04-5123, does not meet any of the three required grounds for allowing an appeal from an interlocutory order. Further, we have no jurisdiction over appeal 04-5148 for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted. Appeals 04-5123 and 04-5148 are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">(2) The United States\u2019 motion to stay the briefing schedule is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">(3) The O\u2019Donnells\u2019 motion to stay an order of the trial court is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">(4) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
