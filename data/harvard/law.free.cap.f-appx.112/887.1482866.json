We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir.2004) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Ngembus\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-24\">While we lack jurisdiction to consider the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Ngembus\u2019s asylum claim, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of his requests for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2004). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). To qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, a petitioner bears the burden of proof of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004). Based on our review of the record, we find that Ngembus has failed to meet these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Accordingly, we deny Ngembus\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
