Because Taylor\u2019s motion did not directly attack his conviction or sentence, but rather asserted a defect in the collateral review process itself, it constituted a true Rule 60(b) motion under our decision in <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 207 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). To appeal an order denying a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas action, Taylor must establish entitlement to a certificate of appealability. <em>See Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-23\">A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). Because Taylor\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was untimely filed, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1) (providing one year time limit), we conclude Taylor\u2019s appeal is futile, precluding entitlement to a certificate of appealability. <em>See Reid, </em>369 F.3d at 372 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>In 04-7384, Taylor seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order construing his motion to dismiss his indictment as a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. We have independently reviewed the record and conclude Taylor has not made the requisite showing for a certificate of appealability. To the extent that Taylor\u2019s notice of appeal and appellate brief can be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we deny such authorization. <em>See Winestock, </em>340 F.3d at 208. Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
