By moving for leave to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>ceed IFP, Forkner is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5). However, Forkner has not demonstrated any nonfrivolous ground for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Forkner\u2019s claims of false arrest and imprisonment rest on his allegation that he was acquitted of the burglary charges against him. He ignores the fact, as demonstrated by the undisputed summary-judgment evidence, that although he was acquitted on one count of the two-count burglary indictment at issue, he was convicted on the other count. Because his conviction on the burglary charge necessarily implies that probable cause existed for his arrest, he cannot prevail on his false-arrest and false-imprisonment claims. <em>See Sappington v. Bartee, </em>195 F.3d 234, 237 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Wells v. Bonner, </em>45 F.3d 90, 95 (5th Cir.1995). Forkner\u2019s conviction similarly defeats his malicious-prosecution claim. <em>See Kerr v. Lyford, </em>171 F.3d 330, 340 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The summary-judgment dismissal of the conditions-of-confinement claims also provides no basis for appeal. The defendants\u2019 summary-judgment evidence shows no constitutional violation, and, even if Forkner\u2019s self-serving, conclusional allegations were sufficient to raise a material factual dispute regarding the conditions of his confinement at Wilkinson County Jail, he has never alleged or demonstrated any resulting injury, which defeats the claims. <em>See Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura, </em>477 U.S. 299, 308-09, 106 S.Ct. 2537, 91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Both the district court\u2019s dismissal and this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Forkner is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
