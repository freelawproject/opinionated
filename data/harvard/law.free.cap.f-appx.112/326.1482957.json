Essell alleged that the conditions caused him injury, including the development of high blood pressure for which he must take \u2022 medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Clark v. America\u2019s Favorite Chicken Co., </em>110 F.3d 295, 296-97 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the record reflects that \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297 (citation omitted); Fed.R.CivP. 56(c). Once the moving party meets its initial burden, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party \u201cto come forward with competent summary judgment evidence establishing the existence of a material factual dispute.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>110 F.3d at 297. The nonmovant cannot satisfy his burden by presenting unsupported allegations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">The United States met its initial burden of pointing out the absence of a genuine issue for trial, and the burden shifted to Essell to come forward with competent summary judgment evidence to establish that he suffered an injury and that his injury was caused by the conditions of his confinement. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 56(e); <em>Quijano v. United States, </em>325 F.3d 564, 567 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Castillo v. Westwood Furniture, Inc., </em>25 S.W.3d 858, 862 (Tex.Ct. App.2000). Essell did not meet his burden; unsworn documents are not competent summary judgment evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>Martin v. John W. Stone Oil Dist., </em>819 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">The United States of America is immune from claims for damages based upon violations of the Eighth Amendment and is not liable for punitive damages in a tort action. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674; <em>Martin v. Miller, </em>65 F.3d 434, 442 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Johnson v. Sawyer, </em>47 F.3d 716, 727 (5th Cir.1995) (en banc). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
