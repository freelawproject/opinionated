Dyer, </em>186 F.3d 417, 422 (5th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Clark remains in custody, he is not entitled to a writ of <em>coram nobis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The writ of <em>audita querela </em>is not available when the prisoner has a remedy under \u00a7 2255. <em>United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.1993). Neither an unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion nor an inability to meet the requirements for a successive \u00a7 2255 motion will render the \u00a7 2255 remedy unavailable. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Clark also seeks a writ of mandamus to direct the district court to comply with this court\u2019s prior order of remand. Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, available only when a petitioner establishes: \u201c(1) a clear right to the relief, (2) a clear duty by the respondent to do the act requested, and (3) the lack of any other adequate remedy\u201d. <em>In re Stone, </em>118 F.3d 1032, 1034 (5th Cir.1997). Such relief is not available to Clark, because Clark could have raised his claims in either a direct appeal from the proceedings on remand or a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Because Clark specifically disclaimed that he is seeking relief under either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 or <em>28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, we do not consider Clark\u2019s brief as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
