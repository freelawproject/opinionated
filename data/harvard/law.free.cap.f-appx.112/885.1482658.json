TineoJames was convicted in a Maryland state court of child abuse in violation of Md. Code Ann., Art. 27, \u00a7 35(C) (Michie 1999) (repealed 2002). The Board found TineoJames was not entitled to relief from removability because he was convicted of an aggravated felony. Tineo-James filed with the Board a motion to reconsider, which was denied. Tineo-James filed with this Court petitions for review from both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-21\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (2000), appellate courts do not have jurisdiction to review the final order of removal of an alien who is removable for having committed certain criminal offenses, including an aggravated felony. Because the Board did not find Tineo-James was removable for having committed an aggravated felony, we have jurisdiction over the petitions for review. <em>See Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 325 (2001); <em>see also Hernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft, </em>373 F.3d 9, 17-20 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-22\">With respect to relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a) (2000) and 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>\u00a7 1182(h) (2000), we find the Board\u2019s conclusion that Tineo-James was convicted of an aggravated felony was supported by reasonable, substantial, probative evidence on the record and does not compel a different result. <em>See Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 661 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">We further find the Board did not abuse its discretion denying the motion for reconsideration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Yanez-Popp v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">We deny the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
