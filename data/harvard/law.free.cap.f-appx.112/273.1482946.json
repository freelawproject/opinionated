Prior to trial, Atkins filed a motion to suppress evidence, alleging that the narcotics and firearms were obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. On October 27, 2000, the district court granted Atkins\u2019 motion and suppressed the drugs and firearms found in his possession. The Government appealed. In an unpublished opinion, this Court reversed the district court\u2019s ruling on the suppression motion and remanded for further proceedings. <em>United States v. Atkins, </em>2001 WL 863557, 16 Fed.Appx. 145 (4th Cir.2001). On remand, the district court admitted the evidence, and Atkins was found guilty of three drug charges and one firearms charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On appeal, Atkins argues that the district court improperly admitted the previously suppressed evidence because this Court\u2019s ruling was \u201cnot based upon a clear evidentiary description of how much of the gun was visible.\u201d Atkins specifically contends that the trial further developed the record and established that the gun was in plain view, not concealed, and thus its presence in the car was not a violation of Virginia\u2019s concealed weapons law. <em>See </em>Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-308(A) (Michie Supp. 2004). Generally, \u201c \u2018the doctrine [of the law of the case] posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 815-16, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988)). The law of the case must be applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal ... unless: (1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to the issue, or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sejman v. Warner-Lambert Co., </em>845 F.2d 66, 69 (4th Cir.1988)). Atkins asserted the same argument before this Court in his previous appeal. Atkins has not presented substantially different evidence than that considered by this Court in his prior appeal. <em>Aramony, </em>166 F.3d at 661. Consequently, in keeping with the doctrine of the law of the case, we conclude that the district court properly admitted the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">Atkins also contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of \u00a7 924(c). \u201cThe verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). After careful review of the record, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence to sustain Atkins\u2019 conviction for violating \u00a7 924(c). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000); <em>Glasser, </em>315 U.S. at 80; <em>United States v. Sloley, </em>19 F.3d 149, 152 (4th Cir.1994) (holding that the government must prove the defendant possessed a firearm, during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime); <em>United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.2002) (listing factors which may establish the nexus between the firearm and the drug trafficking offense); <em>United States v. Blue, </em>957 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>106, 107 (4th Cir.1992) (holding that constructive possession may be proven by showing dominion or control over the contraband or vehicle in which the contraband is concealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Finally, Atkins asserts that the district court erred by converting cash to the drug equivalent because the Government did not prove the cash equivalency by a preponderance of the evidence. A district court\u2019s specific factual findings regarding the proper amount of drugs will be upheld unless the record demonstrates that it is clearly erroneous, <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989), but the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence rests with the government. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>880 F.2d 804, 806 (4th Cir.1989). After careful review we find no error in the district court\u2019s calculations.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\"> Atkins does not assert an argument pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), on appeal, and any such claim would be meritless in light of this court's recent decision in <em>Unit</em>ed <em>States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>- U.S.L.W. - (U.S. Aug. 6, 2004) (No. 04-193).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
