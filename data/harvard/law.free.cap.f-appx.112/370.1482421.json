Mancilla\u2019s daughter, Isabelle Mancilla-Hernandez, also seeks to obtain asylum and withholding of deportation, and her petition is dependent upon Mancilla\u2019s. Mancilla argues that the BIA erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>by determining that he was not persecuted based upon his being in a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">This court will uphold the findings that an alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding if those findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Under this standard, the BIA\u2019s determination will be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The Immigration Judge determined that Mancilla had not shown that threats from members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a Colombian guerilla group, constituted persecution or that the threats were on account of Mancilla\u2019s membership in the Liberal Party of Colombia. The evidence established that the FARC guerillas threatened Mancilla, not due to his status as a former policeman or his membership in the Liberal Party, but due to his refusal to comply with their demand that he provide intelligence about police activities. Harassment aimed at obtaining information without regard for the political belief of the person being harassed is not persecution on account of political opinion. <em>See Ozdemir v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 6, 7 (5th Cir.1994). Similarly, extortion or forced recruitment does not constitute persecution based on the victim\u2019s political beliefs or membership in a particular social group. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Mancilla has not shown that the evidence compels a conclusion contrary to that of the Immigration Judge. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez, </em>78 F.3d at 197. Because Mancilla has not shown persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of any ground protected by the INA as required for asylum, he also has not shown a clear probability of persecution as required by the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
