Edens, Jr. pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West 2003). Edens alleges that Appellee George L. Kennedy, a West Virginia State Trooper, twice violated Edens\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights by trespassing on his property, once with no warrant and once with an invalid warrant. Edens further alleges that Kennedy chilled Edens\u2019 exercise of First Amendment rights by filing a report accusing him of illegal activities after he told a reporter about Kennedy\u2019s alleged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>The district court granted summary judgment to Kennedy on all claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">I. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The facts of this case are intensely disputed. In general, Edens alleges that Kennedy violated his constitutional rights as a result of Kennedy\u2019s association with Carney Wright, a neighbor of Edens\u2019 who works for the local prosecutor; Wright has had a long-running dispute with Edens stemming from an attack by Wright\u2019s dog against Edens\u2019 wife\u2019s dog. Kennedy replies that he does not know Wright and that his actions were normal police practices that did not infringe Edens\u2019 rights. More detailed descriptions of the evidence will accompany the discussion of each of Edens\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">On appeal from the grant of summary judgment, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Edens, the non-moving party. <em>See Figgie Int'l Inc. v. Destileria Serralles, Inc., </em>190 F.3d 252, 255 (4th Cir.1999). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together -with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Our review is de novo. <em>See Edelman v. Lynchburg College, </em>300 F.3d 400, 404 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Also relevant in this appeal is the doctrine of qualified immunity, which shields government officials from liability for conduct that \u201cdoes not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Layne, </em>526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all, and if so, proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">II. <em>Kennedy\u2019s First Entry onto Edens\u2019 Property</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">On October 6, 1999, Kennedy obtained a search warrant for Edens\u2019 home. In his warrant application, Kennedy alleged that he had seized marijuana plants from Edens\u2019 front doorstep earlier that day. Edens alleges that the entry onto his property described in the warrant application was unconstitutional. We hold that this entry may have been unlawful but that Kennedy is entitled to qualified immunity. Accordingly, we affirm the entry of summary judgment against Edens on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">Edens\u2019 house is located on a narrow, rural road. There is a fence around the front, back, and left side of the house (as one faces the front of the house); on the right side of the house, there is no fence, but the lot is densely wooded. The fence does not obscure the view of the home from the road, both because its rails are separated by wide gaps (as are the fence-posts) and because the house is located on a hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">Where the fence crosses the driveway, to the left of the house, there is a gate wide enough to admit a vehicle. The gate is kept locked, and the fencepost next to the gate is marked with a sign that Edens characterized as a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign. J.A. 160a. Edens also testified that several other \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs are displayed on his property. Edens acknowledged, however, that his signs frequently fall down. Kennedy testified that when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>went to Edens\u2019 house he saw that the gate was locked but did not notice any \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">The fence in front of the house is not quite flush with the woods to the right of the house. Instead, there is a gap approximately four feet wide between the fence and woods; this gap is near the road that runs in front of Edens\u2019 home. Edens attempts to cover this gap with a wooden pallet in order to prevent the escape of cattle he keeps on his property, but the pallet often falls over. According to his deposition testimony, Kennedy entered the property through the gap between the fence and the woods. He could not recall seeing the pallet at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Kennedy testified that he went to Edens\u2019 house in response to an anonymous tip. According to Kennedy, the tipster said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-7\">he worked for the power company and that he had installed a meter base or a meter box ... at a place the day prior and that he\u2019d seen marijuana plants ... outside the residence or in portable pots, something of that nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-8\">He then went into detail that ... several marijuana plants ... were in portable containers outside the residence. And then he went on to say that he actually knew the homeowner and that the homeowner was growing them indoors and was carrying them outside during the day for sunlight____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 345a-46a. The tipster also provided Kennedy with Edens\u2019 address and a description of his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">Kennedy recounted at his deposition that he and another officer, Donald Frye, responded to this tip by going to the address provided by the tipster. After confirming that the property matched the tipster\u2019s description, Kennedy parked his vehicle by the side of the road. While Frye waited in the vehicle, Kennedy walked through the gap between the fence and the woods and went to the front door of the house to \u201ctalk to the homeowner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370a. Acknowledging that he did not have probable cause at that time, Kennedy said his intent was to ask the homeowner for consent to search the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">When Kennedy got to the front door, he saw a flowerpot containing five or six marijuana plants. After finding this flowerpot, he knocked on the front door but got no response. He then went to the back and knocked on the door there, but he again received no response. While in back of the house, Kennedy did not see the marijuana plants that had been described by the tipster. He did, however, observe that the windows of the home were covered with plywood, which he was aware was a common practice among marijuana growers. According to his testimony, Kennedy left the premises after receiving no answer to his knocks, taking the flowerpot and its contents with him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">Edens claims that the entry onto his property was unlawful because (1) Kennedy should have investigated the tip more thoroughly before intruding on Edens\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>property; (2) Kennedy\u2019s entry to \u201ctalk to the homeowner\u201d was really a pretext for searching the curtilage around Edens\u2019 home; and (3) even if Kennedy genuinely intended to knock and ask permission to search the interior of the home, rather than to search the exterior without consent, the entry onto Edens\u2019 property was impermissible in light of Edens\u2019 clear intent to exclude strangers from his premises. We hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Before addressing Edens\u2019 individual arguments, we note that Edens has questioned whether the initial entry onto his property even occurred. His allegations, if true, would lend considerable support to the Fourth Amendment claim discussed in Part III but would obliterate this claim. We will therefore assume for purposes of this claim that Kennedy in fact went to Edens\u2019 house and walked on Edens\u2019 property before obtaining a search warrant. We will discuss Edens\u2019 allegations to the contrary in Part III.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Edens urges that Kennedy could have evaluated the veracity of the anonymous tip without encroaching on Edens\u2019 property \u2014 for example, by checking whether the power company had in fact serviced Edens\u2019 home or by conducting a helicopter flyover of the property (which was done by Frye after he and Kennedy visited Edens\u2019 property). The Fourth Amendment, however, does not require police officers to employ the \u201cleast intrusive means\u201d of conducting their investigations. <em>Bd. of Educ. v. Earls, </em>536 U.S. 822, 837, 122 S.Ct. 2559, 153 L.Ed.2d 735 (2002). Thus, if it was otherwise lawful for Kennedy to enter Edens\u2019 premises, the fact that he could have followed up on the tip in some other manner does not render the entry unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">Edens\u2019 second argument derives from the limitations on so-called \u201cknock and talk\u201d investigations. We have held that, ordinarily, no Fourth Amendment violation occurs when the police \u201cknock on a residence\u2019s door or otherwise approach the residence seeking to speak to the inhabitants.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Pendleton, </em>249 F.3d 279, 289 (4th Cir.2001); <em>see Alvarez v. Montgomery County, </em>147 F.3d 354, 357 (4th Cir.1998) (\u201c[PJolice may approach a building, including the front entranceway to a residential dwelling, without committing a search where a person lacks a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area.\u201d). Furthermore, the police may circle to the back of the home under appropriate circumstances. <em>See Alvarez, </em>147 F.3d at 358. The police may not, however, conduct a full search of the curtilage without a warrant or another justification that would be sufficient for entry into the home itself. <em>See Rogers, </em>249 F.3d at 287, 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Edens contends that Kennedy\u2019s entry onto his property was unlawful because the purpose was to search the curtilage. But Kennedy\u2019s purpose is irrelevant. Edens has offered no evidence that Kennedy conducted a general search of the curtilage or otherwise strayed from the areas a police officer is ordinarily permitted to enter. To the extent that Kennedy would ordinarily have been permitted to enter the curtilage and knock on the front and back doors of Edens\u2019 home, his authority to do so was not impaired by his receipt of a tip stating that there might be evidence of criminal activity behind Edens\u2019 house. <em>See United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, </em>462 U.S. 579, 584 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. 2573, 77 L.Ed.2d 22 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>3.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Edens\u2019 final argument with respect to this claim is that his clear declaration of his intent to exclude strangers from his property rendered any \u201cknock and talk\u201d unlawful, regardless of Kennedy\u2019s motivation. We hold that Kennedy\u2019s entry onto Edens\u2019 property may have violated the Fourth Amendment but that Kennedy was nevertheless entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Our analysis begins with the precept that the curtilage is entitled to the same Fourth Amendment protection as the home. <em>See Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 180, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984); <em>Rogers, </em>249 F.3d at 287. This does not mean, however, that limits on access to the home and the curtilage are equivalent. Access to the home is strictly forbidden in the absence of a warrant or exigent circumstances. <em>See Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 590, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). In contrast, police officers ordinarily may enter the curtilage in order to approach the home without impheating the constraints of the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Alvarez, </em>147 F.3d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">We hold, however, that if the owner of a home encloses the curtilage with a fence, locks the gate, and posts \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, the effect for Fourth Amendment purposes is to extend the walls of the home to the edge of the curtilage. This is because the act of sealing the property creates an elevated expectation of privacy. <em>Cf. California v. Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 211, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986) (\u201cThe touchstone of Fourth Amendment analysis is whether a person has a \u2018constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 360, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring))); <em>Alvarez, </em>147 F.3d at 357 (discussing reasonable expectations of privacy with respect to curtilage).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">In the absence of a fence with a locked gate, a homeowner is likely to receive visits from pollsters, door-to-door salespeople, and trick-or-treaters, among others. There is no constitutional basis for excluding police officers from this list of potential visitors. <em>See Rogers, </em>249 F.3d at 289-90 (\u201c[Pjolice officers do not need a warrant to do what any private citizen may legitimately do \u2014 approach a home to speak to the inhabitants.\u201d). Nevertheless, the homeowner can reasonably expect all such visits to cease when he has manifested his intent to exclude strangers by sealing the property around his home and posting \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs. Thus, in the absence of a warrant or exigent circumstances, a police officer may not lawfully breach a locked enclosure around the curtilage. <em>See State v. Brocuglio, </em>64 Conn.App. 93, 779 A.2d 793, 800 (2001) (holding that police violated Fourth Amendment by entering backyard enclosed by stockade fence posted with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d and \u201cKeep Out\u201d signs), <em>aff'd, </em>264 Conn. 778, 826 A.2d 145 (2003); <em>State v. Ridgway, </em>57 Wash.App. 915, 790 P.2d 1263, 1265 (1990) (holding that marijuana recovered from doorstep was subject to suppression because police observed marijuana only after walking around closed gate across driveway and evading guard dogs while approaching house).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">We emphasize that our holding is a narrow one. In particular, we do not hold that all enclosed areas are off limits to the police. An enclosed area outside the curtilage may be subject to warrantless intrusions even if the owner has posted \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs. <em>See Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 176-84, 104 S.Ct. 1735 (holding that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to searches conducted in enclosed areas remote from the defendants\u2019 homes). And, even within the curtilage, the police may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>traverse a fence if there is no clear indication that the homeowner intended to exclude uninvited visitors. For example, in <em>Rogers, </em>we upheld an entry into the curtilage for the purpose of conducting a \u201cknock and talk\u201d even though the property in question was surrounded by a fence and a privacy hedge. <em>See Rogers, </em>249 F.3d at 293, 294. But if a fence within or around the curtilage is locked and posted with signs in order to prevent access, this \u201cmanifest[s] an objective intent that the area be preserved as private.\u201d <em>Brocuglio, </em>779 A.2d at 800. When such intent would be apparent to a reasonable officer, the police may not enter the enclosed area without a warrant or exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">It may be that no such intent was apparent here, despite the locked gate and the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, because the gap between Edens\u2019 fence and the woods next to his house permitted relatively easy access to his front yard. We need not resolve that question, however, because Kennedy is entitled to qualified immunity even if Edens\u2019 intent to exclude uninvited visitors was plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">We have found only one case decided before October 6, 1999 (the date of the intrusion at issue here) that squarely supports Edens\u2019 claim. <em>See generally State v. Ridgway, </em>57 Wash.App. 915, 790 P.2d 1263 (1990). <em>Ridgway </em>was decided by an intermediate court in Washington State, and it therefore did not create clearly established law of which a reasonable officer in West Virginia should have been aware. <em>See Wilson v. Kittoe, </em>337 F.3d 392, 402-03 (4th Cir.2003) (\u201cIn determining whether a right was clearly established at the time of the claimed violation, courts in this circuit ordinarily need not look beyond the decisions of the Supreme Court, this court of appeals, and the highest court of the state in which the case arose.\u201d (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, <em>Ridgway </em>stands in contrast to numerous cases upholding the entry of police officers into areas enclosed by fences or marked with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs. <em>See </em>Vanessa Rownaghi, Comment, <em>Driving into Unreasonableness: The Driveway, the Curtilage, and Reasonable Expectations of Privacy, </em>11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol\u2019y &amp; L. 1165, 1183-85 (2003) (discussing cases). Although those cases are factually distinguishable, and thus do not preclude us from reaching the holding we have announced today, they do not support Edens\u2019 claim either. Accordingly, although Kennedy\u2019s entry on Edens\u2019 property may have violated the Fourth Amendment, Kennedy is entitled to qualified immunity. We therefore uphold the entry of summary judgment on Edens\u2019 claim arising from the first intrusion onto his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">III. <em>Kennedy\u2019s Second Entry onto Edens\u2019 Property</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">On October 6, 1999, Kennedy went to Edens\u2019 home with a search warrant and searched the premises, including the interior of the house. He did not find any evidence of marijuana use or cultivation. Edens claims that this search was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">\u201cWhen an officer acts pursuant to a warrant, the pertinent question is whether the officer could have reasonably thought there was probable cause to seek the warrant.\u201d <em>Smith v. Reddy, </em>101 F.3d 351, 356 (4th Cir.1996). Edens contends that such a belief was unreasonable here because (a) Kennedy never actually went to Edens\u2019 home before requesting a search warrant, so the averments in his warrant application \u2014 which depended heavily on his observations during the first entry \u2014 were all false;' and (b) the tip that induced Kennedy to make the search was verifiably false. Edens further contends that, even if prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>able cause existed, the warrant here was invalid because the magistrate\u2019s signature was forged. We affirm the entry of summary judgment as to each of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">A. <em>Alleged Misrepresentations about Previous Observations</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMV\">In his application for a search warrant, Kennedy relied on observations purportedly made at Edens\u2019 home earlier that day (during the entry discussed above in Part II). Edens alleges that Kennedy\u2019s description of the first entry is not credible for four different reasons. We find these considerations insufficient to create a material question of fact about whether the first entry occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\"><em>First, </em>Edens claims that Kennedy\u2019s deposition testimony that Trooper Frye accompanied him during the first entry is contradicted by a police report drafted by Kennedy in which he consistently referred to \u201cthis officer\u201d in the singular. <em>E.g., </em>J.A. 947a <em>(\u201cAlter </em>obtaining the information from the anonymous caller, this officer then traveled to ... the suspect\u2019s residence .... \u201d). We question whether the use of \u201cthis officer\u201d proves that only one officer was present, particularly in light of the limited role attributed to Frye in Kennedy\u2019s deposition (as well as Frye\u2019s). In any event, this alleged discrepancy in no way suggests that Kennedy did not visit Edens\u2019 home at all before obtaining a search warrant; it merely raises the question of whether Kennedy traveled alone or with another officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\"><em>Second, </em>Edens asserts that photographs allegedly taken by Kennedy during his first visit to Edens\u2019 home were shot in the afternoon. This is significant because it is undisputed that the search pursuant to the warrant occurred around 1:30 p.m.; thus, if Kennedy\u2019s first entry onto Edens\u2019 property occurred at all, it must have occurred in the morning or very early afternoon, in light of the tasks that Kennedy had to complete in order to obtain a search warrant. An expert hired by Edens, Ralph Bouwmeester, concluded that shadows in Kennedy\u2019s photographs prove that the photos could not have been taken at any time on October 6, 1999, and instead must have been taken around 2 p.m. on October 17, 1999, or February 24, 2000 (or perhaps on those same dates during other years). Bouwmeester\u2019s report was not admissible on summary judgment, however, as it was unsworn and was not accompanied by an affidavit affirming its authenticity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Scott v. Edinburg, </em>346 F.3d 752, 759 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Goel, </em>274 F.3d 984, 1000 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\"><em>Third, </em>Edens notes that the flowerpot allegedly seized during the first entry was listed on the property receipt that Kennedy prepared later when he executed the warrant. Kennedy testified at his deposition that he put the flowerpot on the warrant receipt, rather than on a separate property receipt, because the seizure occurred the same day as the search and \u201c[t]he time was irrelevant.\u201d J.A. 486a. On summary judgment, however, we are constrained to disregard this testimony and draw the inference proposed by Edens \u2014 namely, that Kennedy did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>seize the flowerpot until he executed the warrant. This may show that he <em>never saw </em>the pot until that moment, as Edens contends, but it is equally plausible that Kennedy <em>saw </em>the pot during the first entry but did not <em>seize </em>it until his return to the premises a few hours later. There is no evidence in the record that would allow a jury to choose the former inference over the latter without engaging in speculation. We therefore conclude that the inclusion of the flowerpot on the property receipt does not give rise to a material dispute of fact about whether the first entry occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\"><em>Fourth, </em>Edens contends that a log of radio communications between Kennedy and the dispatcher lists only one visit to Edens\u2019 home, around the time of the execution of the search warrant. Edens asserts that the absence of any reference to an earlier visit proves that the first entry never occurred. But neither the log itself nor Kennedy\u2019s deposition testimony about his procedures establishes that Kennedy reports all of his movements to the dispatcher. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence relied upon by Edens does not conflict with Kennedy\u2019s claim that he visited Edens\u2019 property before seeking a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">B. <em>Alleged Falsehoods in the Anonymous Tip</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Edens further asserts that even if the first entry occurred, there was no probable cause for a search because the information provided by the anonymous tip had been or could have been proven false. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">Edens initially maintains that the tipster\u2019s description of 50 marijuana plants behind the house was disproven when Kennedy went to the house and knocked on the back door, and again when Frye conducted the helicopter flyover. We agree that the failure to discover marijuana plants behind Edens\u2019 house undermined the tipster\u2019s reliability to some extent, as the tipster told Kennedy that \u201cthe homeowner was growing them indoors and was carrying them outside during the day for sunlight.\u201d J.A. 346a. But Kennedy was not required to infer from this tip that the homeowner took his plants outside <em>every day. </em>Consequently, the fact that there were no marijuana plants behind the house did not prove that the information from the tipster was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Edens also asserts that his meter box was installed in 1998, not on October 5, 1999 (the date indicated by the tipster). Even if this is true, however, there is no evidence in the record that the power company would have been willing to disclose this information to the police. Accordingly, Edens has not established that Kennedy could have investigated the veracity of the anonymous tip without searching the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">In any event, the warrant was supported by probable cause even if information available to Kennedy had substantially undermined the reliability of the tip. During the first entry, Kennedy personally observed marijuana plants on the doorstep and boards over the windows \u2014 and, as we have discussed, nothing in the record discredits his claim that those observations were made. These observations were sufficient in themselves to support the issuance of a warrant. <em>See United States v. Malin, </em>908 F.2d 163, 165-66 (7th Cir.1990) (holding that observation of marijuana plants in backyard sufficed to establish probable cause for search of home), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized in United States v. Monroe, </em>73 F.3d 129 (7th Cir.1995); <em>People v. Pannebaker, </em>714 P.2d 904, 907-08 (Colo.1986) (en banc) (noting that coverings on windows provided evidence of marijuana cultivation). Thus, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>the time Kennedy sought a warrant, the reliability of the tip was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">C. <em>Alleged Forgery of the Magistrate\u2019s Signature</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">The affidavit that Kennedy prepared to support his search warrant application bears the signature of Magistrate Traci L. Carper, affirming that the affidavit was \u201csubscribed and sworn\" in her presence. J.A. 860a. The search warrant issued upon that affidavit also bears Magistrate Carper\u2019s signature. Edens commissioned a forensic documents examiner, James Blanco, to determine whether these signatures (\u201cthe questioned signatures\u201d) were authentic. After comparing the questioned signatures to signatures on other court documents ostensibly signed by Magistrate Carper (\u201cthe known signatures\u201d), Blanco determined that the questioned signatures were forged.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Edens submitted Blanco\u2019s report to the district court along with other exhibits appended to Edens\u2019 answer to Kennedy\u2019s summary judgment motion. The district court refused to consider this report, however. The court reasoned that Blanco\u2019s conclusion was premised on \u201can error of logic\u201d in light of Magistrate Carper\u2019s testimony at her deposition that she had signed the affidavit and the search warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 981a. The court further noted that Blanco\u2019s report was not accompanied by an affidavit or otherwise substantiated by sworn declarations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">We cannot accept the first rationale employed by the district court. At her deposition, Magistrate Carper testified that both of the questioned signatures and seven of the eight known signatures were hers. (The eighth signature exemplar was not shown to her.) The district court apparently believed it was illogical for Blanco to accept Magistrate Carper\u2019s confirmation of the known signatures while disregarding her testimony concerning the questioned signatures. The jury, however, would be permitted to make such a determination, and we must give effect to this possibility on summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">Nevertheless, the grant of summary judgment was proper in light of the second ground noted by the district court. As discussed above, unsworn reports are inadmissible on summary judgment unless accompanied by affidavits or depositions swearing to their contents and conclusions. Thus, the district court properly refused to consider the Blanco report.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">After the entry of summary judgment, Edens moved for reconsideration pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). Appended to this motion was a transcript of Blanco\u2019s deposition, in which he affirmed his authorship of the report and attested to its contents. Edens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>asserted that this new document cured any technical defect in the admissibility of Blanco\u2019s report. The district court denied Edens\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">\u201cThere are three circumstances in which the district court can grant a Rule 59(e) motion: (1) to accommodate an intervening change in controlling law; (2) to account for new evidence not available at trial; or (3) to correct a clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Becker v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., </em>305 F.3d 284, 290 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1012, 123 S.Ct. 1929, 155 L.Ed.2d 848 (2003). We review a decision denying reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">We find no abuse of discretion here. Of particular significance is Edens\u2019 failure to account for the fact that Blanco\u2019s report was not timely authenticated. In this regard, a timeline of events is relevant. Kennedy noticed Blanco\u2019s deposition on July 8, 2003, with the deposition scheduled for July 22. Edens\u2019 counsel has indicated that the parties agreed on this date beforehand. <em>See </em>Br. of Appellant at 29. The deposition took place on the designated date, and the transcript was completed on August 4. Meanwhile, Edens filed his memorandum opposing summary judgment on July 7 (one day before the Blanco deposition was noticed), and the court issued its order granting summary judgment on August 6 (two days after the transcript was completed).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">If Edens knew of the impending deposition when he prepared this response, he could have filed an affidavit stating that he was temporarily unable to \u201cpresent ... facts essential to justify [his] opposition,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f). He certainly could have presented such an affidavit after Blanco\u2019s deposition was noticed, and he may even have been able to present the transcript of Blanco\u2019s deposition to the court prior to the entry of summary judgment. Indeed, Edens could have avoided all of this trouble by simply directing Blanco to provide an appropriate affidavit along with his report, or by obtaining such an affidavit later. In light of Edens\u2019 failure to perform any of these actions, it was within the discretion of the district court to deny Edens\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion. <em>See Looper Maint. Serv. Inc. v. City of Indianapolis, </em>197 F.3d 908, 915 (7th Cir.1999) (noting that movant\u2019s diligence is relevant factor in ruling on Rule 59(e) motion); <em>cf. Santiago v. Wood, </em>904 F.2d 673, 676 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (holding that denial of motion to reconsider was abuse of discretion, based in part on movant\u2019s evident diligence in filing motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">IV. <em>Kennedy\u2019s Response to the Newspaper Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Edens\u2019 final claim is that Kennedy violated Edens\u2019 First Amendment rights by filing an investigative report in response to a newspaper article describing Kennedy\u2019s search of Edens\u2019 property. We affirm the entry of summary judgment in Kennedy\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">On January 24, 2000, the <em>Charleston Gazette </em>published an article describing Edens\u2019 conflict with Carney Wright and his complaints against Kennedy. The text suggests that Edens was the prime source for this article, and perhaps the instigator of its publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">On the day the article was published, Kennedy forwarded to the prosecutor\u2019s office a report detailing the investigation he conducted after receiving the anonymous tip. The report described Kennedy\u2019s discovery of marijuana plants on Edens\u2019 doorstep but added that no evidence of criminal activity was found in Edens\u2019 house or its outbuildings. The report also noted that Kennedy chose not to arrest Edens be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>cause of his \u201ccooperative attitude, no prior drug history, and his personal request to submit to a polygraph examination compounded with the fact that no evidence was obtained from within the residence that could possibly link the marijuana in the portable container to being grown within the home.\u201d J.A. 950a.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Kennedy testified at his deposition that he was required to file an investigative report and send it to the prosecutor notwithstanding his conclusion that no arrest was warranted. He did not file this report promptly because he was \u201cbacklogged\u201d with other work and because, in light of his determination not to make an arrest,\u201d[i]t was a closed case to [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409a. Kennedy further testified that he wrote the report in response to a telephone call from a <em>Gazette </em>reporter and a subsequent instruction from his supervisor that \u201cyou\u2019d better go ahead and do a report and get it in writing because it sounds like something is going to come of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473a (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Edens has not been charged with any offense, nor is there any evidence that the grand jury has opened an investigation concerning Edens. Edens testified, however, that the report will \u201chang[ ] over my head for seven years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310a. Edens alleges that Kennedy filed this report to help Wright \u201ccommunicate to Edens that [Wright] had sufficient influence in the law enforcement community that Edens could be subjected to harassing prosecutions while Wright could not be touched.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">In order to prove a First Amendment retaliation claim, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-8\">First, the plaintiff must demonstrate that his or her speech was protected. Second, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s alleged retaliatory action adversely affected the plaintiffs constitutionally protected speech. Third, the plaintiff must demonstrate that a causal relationship exists between its speech and the defendant\u2019s retaliatory action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-13\"><em>Suarez Corp. Indus. v. McGraw, </em>202 F.3d 676, 686 (4th Cir.2000) (citations omitted). Edens\u2019 claim fails because there is insufficient evidence in the record to establish the second of these elements. The mere occurrence of retaliatory action is not sufficient to prove this element; instead, the action must have some \u201cadverse impact\u201d on the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 685. The only impact demonstrated here is Edens\u2019 fear that Kennedy\u2019s report might someday result in a prosecution, despite its inclusion of significant exculpatory evidence. Fear of this nature is not sufficient to support a First Amendment retaliation claim. <em>See Wade v. Goodwin, </em>843 F.2d 1150, 1152 (8th Cir.1988) (rejecting retaliation claim predicated on \u201cspeculative apprehensiveness as to future misuse of information\u201d). We therefore affirm the entry of summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">V. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-10\">. Kennedy testified that he brought the flowerpot back to his office, submitted its contents for testing, and discarded the pot itself. One lingering question about this pot concerns its color: Kennedy described it as \"lime green\u201d in his search warrant affidavit, <em>id. </em>at 861a; then said in a subsequent report that it was \"blue in color,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 948a; and then testified in his deposition that \"the color of the flower pot was actually a bluish-green, lime green. It was turquoise. I don't know.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370a-71a. Edens mentions these matters in his brief but apparently does not rely on them to support any of his appellate claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-7\">. Kennedy asserts that even if the Bouwmeester report was properly admitted on summary judgment, this court may not consider it because it does not appear in the joint appendix. We are permitted, however, to rely on material in the record that is not included in the appendix. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 30(a)(2). We also direct counsel\u2019s attention to Fourth Circuit Rule 30(c), which states, \u201cNotwithstanding that FRAP 30 provides that the appellant shall prepare and file the appendix, the Court considers the coordination of preparing the appendix to be the responsibility of both sides. The failure of a side to designate does not absolve the other side from the responsibility.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b917-9\">. The district court did not question, nor do we, that the search of Edens\u2019 home was unlawful if the magistrate\u2019s signature on the warrant was in fact forged. This is so regardless of whether the warrant application established probable cause for the search. <em>Cf. Groh v. Ramirez, </em>540 U.S. 551, 124 S.Ct. 1284, 1289-90, 157 L.Ed.2d 1068 (2004) (holding that search based on invalid warrant is unlawful even if warrant application establishes probable cause and adequately particularizes places to be searched).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b917-16\">. Kennedy notes that Blanco admitted that it was possible the questioned signatures were Magistrate Carper\u2019s. Blanco also acknowledged certain similarities between the questioned signatures and the known signatures and conceded that litigants can procure experts for any conclusion they desire. To the extent these statements raised questions about Blanco\u2019s credibility, the district court was obligated to resolve those questions in favor of Edens.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
