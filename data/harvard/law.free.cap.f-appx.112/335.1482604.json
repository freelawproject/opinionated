In addition to sentencing Rodriguez to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release, the district court ordered the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) to send 75% of Rodriguez\u2019s prison earnings to the mother of Rodriguez\u2019s children in order to help satisfy his child-support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-25\">Rodriguez\u2019s motion for leave to file a supplemental brief raising a new issue is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-26\">Rodriguez argues: (1) that the district court\u2019s order garnishing his prison earnings exceeded the statutory maximum sentence authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841; (2) that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and (b) are facially unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and (3) that his sentence was invalid under <em>Blakely v. Wash</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>ington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). As conceded by Rodriguez, his two latter arguments are foreclosed by precedent and are raised solely to preserve them for further review. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263); <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Although Rodriguez did not object to the district court\u2019s order, we review <em>de novo </em>whether the sentence exceeds the statutory maximum term. <em>See United States v. Ferguson, </em>369 F.3d 847, 849 (5th Cir.2004). The district court\u2019s order to the BOP must be vacated because it was not authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. <em>See United States v. Chandler, </em>125 F.3d 892, 894 (5th Cir.1997). The district court\u2019s judgment is MODIFIED to strike the order requiring the BOP to send 75% of Rodriguez\u2019s prison earnings to the mother of his children. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">MOTION TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF GRANTED; JUDGMENT MODIFIED; AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
