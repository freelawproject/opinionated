He reiterates many of the claims he raised in his complaint concerning his trip to the Clements Unit and his treatment by TDCJ officials after his arrival, and he contends that the district court erred in deciding the claims. However, Geiger has failed to show any error in the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 612-13 (5th Cir.1999); <em>McDonald v. Steward, </em>132 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-20\">Geiger also argues that (1) prison officials participated in \u201choe checking\u201d or \u201cgoing hard,\u201d which involved \u201cseeing how much gas a prisoner can take\u201d and \u201chow much force a prisoner can take from a [five] man assault team resulting in bloodshed,\u201d (2) he and others were punished and demoted before there was a disciplinary review or hearings, (3) parole eligibility and state records were \u201cmanipulated to imply assaultive or deviated conduct history and aggression solely for verbal conduct deemed a threat,\u201d (4) officers engaged in voyeurism, (5) mail was opened by officers after mail room inspection and taken, and prisoner meals were denied if prisoners questioned this, (6) he was attacked physically and his property was destroyed on July 9, 2002, before a court appearance, and (7) \u201csecurity\u201d instructed the medical staff and psychology department on which prisoners to treat and not to treat. However, he did not raise these claims in his amended complaint or at an evidentiary hearing, and he may not raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>them for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>188 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Geiger\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we DISMISS his appeal as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of his appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted constitute two \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Geiger is WARNED that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b988-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
