New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 430, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because his prior aggravated felony conviction was not alleged in the indictment. Vivar\u2019s challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 227-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>which the Supreme Court held that Congress intended to set forth sentencing factors in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), not a separate criminal offense, and that the sentencing provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) were not unconstitutional. The Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi </em>expressly declined to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must therefore follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984. Thus, to the extent Vivar challenges that district court\u2019s rejection of his <em>Apprendi </em>argument, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Vivar argues that the district court erroneously calculated his criminal history points when it assigned three criminal history points to his 1999 conviction for burglary. The plain error standard of review governs this issue since it was not raised below. <em>United States v. Wilder, </em>15 F.3d 1292, 1301 (5th Cir.1994). The Government concedes that there was an error, that the error was clear or obvious, and that the error affected Vivar\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (setting forth elements of plain error review).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The text of the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) states that for the offense at issue Vivar was sentenced to a total of seven months of incarceration. In accordance with the relevant sentencing guidelines, this conviction should have received only two criminal history points. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b) <em>&amp; </em>comment.; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(b)(l) <em>&amp; </em>(2); <em>United States v. Carbajal, </em>290 F.3d 277, 283 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 934, 123 S.Ct. 34, 154 L.Ed.2d 235 (2002) (if the guideline language is unambiguous, this court\u2019s inquiry begins and ends with an analysis of the plain meaning of that language). Thus, the guidelines indicate that there was an error in the PSR. The error also affected Vivar\u2019s substantial rights, since Vivar\u2019s sentence is greater than the upper end of the correct guidelines imprisonment range. Additionally, the fairness of the judicial proceeding was seriously affected because the increase in Vivar\u2019s sentence was erroneous and substantial. <em>See United States v. Aderholt, </em>87 F.3d 740, 744 (5th Cir.1996). We therefore VACATE the sentence insofar as its calculation includes three criminal history points for Vivar\u2019s 1999 burglary conviction and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED FOR RESEN-TENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
