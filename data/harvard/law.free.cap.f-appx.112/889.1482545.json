The Board reinstated the 1996 in absentia order of deportation. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) (1994),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">We conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the untimely motion to reopen for rescission of the in absentia order of deportation. The record reveals that Perdomo received actual notice of the hearing and did not timely move to reopen in accordance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(A) (1994). The Board did not abuse its discretion in holding that, without deciding whether the time limit set forth in \u00a7 1252(c)(3)(A) is subject to equitable tolling, Perdomo did not establish the due diligence necessary to invoke such an exception. <em>See Scorteanu v. INS, </em>339 F.3d 407, 413-14 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Jobe v. INS, </em>238 F.3d 96, 100, 101 (1st Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-9\"> While 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1105a, 1252b were repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-128, 110 Stat. 3009 (IIRIRA), effective April 1, 1997, because a final order of deportation was issued in this case before the effective date of the IIRIRA, these pre-IIRIRA provisions of the INA are applicable. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(a), (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
