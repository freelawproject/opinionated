Evans\u2019 attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s compliance with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 and the extent of the sentence departure granted pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2002). Evans was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record for meritorious issues. Finding none, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-19\">Evans first argues that the district court violated Rule 11 in accepting his guilty plea. We review the adequacy of a guilty plea proceeding de novo. <em>United States v. Damon, </em>191 F.3d 561, 564 n. 2 (4th Cir.1999). Rule 11 violations, however, are reviewed under a harmless error standard. <em>Id. </em>Any variance from the Rule 11 requirements that does not affect the substantial rights of the defendant is disre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>garded. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(h); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 117 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The Rule 11 colloquy was thorough and regular. The magistrate judge<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> established Evans\u2019 age and education, and that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The magistrate judge ensured that Evans was satisfied with his attorney and that he understood the terms of his plea agreement. The magistrate judge outlined the sentences that Evans faced, informed him of the rights he was waiving, and ensured that there was a factual basis for the plea. Evans never objected or exhibited the slightest hesitation or confusion, and he testified that he understood the consequences of his plea. In short, the magistrate judge did not violate Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Evans next contends that, in granting the Government\u2019s motion for a substantial assistance departure, the court should have reduced his sentences (which ran consecutively) on each count of conviction, instead of just reducing the firearm sentence. However, we do not review the extent of a departure unless the departure resulted in an illegal sentence or resulted from an incorrect application of the guidelines. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324 (4th Cir.1995). Here, the district court was well within its discretion when it structured Evans\u2019 departure to comport with similar departures for his co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Thus, we affirm Evans\u2019 convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court to withdraw from representation at that time. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Evans. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b948-7\"> Evans consented to the jurisdiction of the magistrate judge. <em>See United States v. Osborne, </em>345 F.3d 281, 285 &amp; n. 3 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
