See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b936-14\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">Jason Robert Goforth pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement to one count of bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (2000), and one count of knowingly possessing body armor after having been convicted of a felony, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 931 and 924(a)(7) (2000). He was sentenced to 113 months in prison. Goforth does not challenge his convictions but appeals the determination of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-16\">In its Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), the probation office recommended that Goforth be sentenced as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2002). The predicate crimes for this recommendation included Goforth\u2019s 1999 state court conviction for possessing a dangerous weapon while in prison. The district court decided to sentence Goforth as a career offender, holding, over defendant\u2019s objection, that the state conviction for possessing a dangerous weapon in prison qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2. Specifically, the district court held that possession of a weapon by an inmate is \u201ccategorically\u201d a crime of violence because of the \u201cdanger that is presented by the possession of a weapon in a prison setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-17\">Under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, a defendant is a \u201ccareer offender\u201d if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. In determining whether a predicate offense is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d a sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>court should use a categorical approach and look to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>953 F.2d 110, 114-15 (4th Cir.1991). The court determines if the statutory or common law definition of the offense \u201clist[s] as an element \u2018the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>951 F.2d 586, 588 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">If this inquiry is not determinative, the sentencing court must determine if the crime \u201c \u2018otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>215 F.3d 470, 472 (4th Cir.2000) (quoting USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)). In making this determination, the court must consider only the facts charged in the indictment, and \u201c[i]f that effort is unavailing, ... consider whether the offense of conviction is a crime of violence in the abstract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473. Whether a prior conviction is a crime of violence is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>77 F.3d 774, 775 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">We conclude the district court did not err in determining that possession of a dangerous weapon by a prisoner is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because of the inherent nature of the crime and its serious potential risk for physical injury to another. <em>See United States v. Kenney, </em>310 F.3d 135, 137 (3rd Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Vahovick, </em>160 F.3d 395, 397-98 (7th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Young, </em>990 F.2d 469, 471-72 (9th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Romero, </em>122 F.3d 1334, 1340-41 (10th Cir.1997) (holding that conveying a weapon in federal prison is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of applying the Armed Career Criminal Act). We therefore affirm Goforth\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b937-7\"> In light of the opinion issued by this Court in <em>United States v.

Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), does not impact Goforth's sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
