The district court imposed the condition of supervised release that Carrillo-Banuelos \u201cshall not possess a firearm, destructive device, or any other dangerous weapon.\u201d Carrillo-Banuelos argues that this condition must be vacated because it is vague and overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">Conditions of probation must be written and read in a \u201ccommonsense way.\u201d <em>United States v. Paul, </em>274 F.3d 155, 167 (5th Cir.2001). A' commonsense reading of the condition requires that the intent to cause harm be present before an instrument which is not dangerous when used in its customary manner may be found to be a dangerous weapon. Carrillo-Banuelos has not shown that the district court erred by imposing the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">For the first time on appeal, CarrilloBanuelos argues, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are elements of the offense, not sentence enhancements, making those provisions unconstitutional. He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but raises it for possible review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-13\">Carrillo-Banuelos also argues that his sentence violates <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because it is based on facts not admitted or found by a jury. As he concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1028-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
