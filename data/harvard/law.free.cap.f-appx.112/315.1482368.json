The district court properly noted that Williams was seeking relief only available under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). The court further properly noted Williams failed to seek authorization from this court for such a petition. On appeal, Williams fails to challenge the district court\u2019s findings in this regard. We have reviewed the record and find the appeal frivolous. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal as frivolous. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
