Taylor, federal prisoner # 02975-095, seeks leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on retroactive Amendment 591 to the sentencing guidelines. Taylor also moves for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) arising out of the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(e) motion as a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. Because Taylor devotes his argument to the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and does not challenge the denial of his post-judgment motion, COA is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-16\">By filing the IFP motion, Taylor is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5). However, Taylor has not demonstrated any nonfrivolous ground for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-17\">In 1998, Taylor pleaded guilty to distributing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and he was sentenced based on the PSR\u2019s determination that the offense involved 336.8 grams of cocaine base. Taylor argues that Amendment 591 dictates that he must be resentenced because <em>no </em>quantity of drugs was specified in the indictment. He is mistaken. Amendment 591 applies to the determination of the - appropriate Chapter Two offense guideline section, and Taylor was properly sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the appropriate offense guideline section for convictions under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Amendment 591 is irrelevant to the determination of base (or specific) offense levels within the applicable offense guideline section or to any consideration of relevant conduct. Taylor\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. We caution Taylor that further frivolous filings will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>COA DENIED AS UNNECESSARY; IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1013-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
