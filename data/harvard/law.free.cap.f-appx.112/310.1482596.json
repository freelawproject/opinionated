Tucker, </em>376 F.3d 236, 238 (4th Cir.2004). The district court should exercise that discretion to grant a new trial sparingly, and only when the weight of evidence is heavily against the verdict. <em>United States v. Perry, </em>335 F.3d 316, 320 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1185, 124 S.Ct. 1408, 158 L.Ed.2d 91 (2004). Gormley\u2019s motion was timely only as a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b). The district court properly considered this Circuit\u2019s five-part test for assessment of such a motion, <em>see United States v. Lofton, </em>233 F.3d 313, 318 (4th Cir.2000), to find that Gormley\u2019s allegations do not warrant a new trial. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Gormley\u2019s motion for new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>trial and his motion to reconsider that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In his motion to reconsider, Gormley also requested a writ of mandamus against the Bureau of Prisons. We review a denial of mandamus for abuse of discretion. <em>Marquez-Ramos v. Reno, </em>69 F.3d 477, 479 (10th Cir.1995). A plaintiff may be entitled to mandamus relief \u201conly if the defendant owes him a clear nondiscretionary duty.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. 602, 616, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984). As Gormley has not shown his clear entitlement to the specific relief requested, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Thus, we affirm the decisions of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
