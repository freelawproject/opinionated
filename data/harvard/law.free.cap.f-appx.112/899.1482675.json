The United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina sentenced him to five years of probation. In June 2002, the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina accepted transfer of jurisdiction. Barrow was before the court for violating the conditions of probation. The court revoked Barrow\u2019s probation, and he received a sentence of seven months in prison and one year of supervised release. As conditions of supervised release, Barrow was required to maintain employment and pay restitution in the amount of $24,311.46, at a rate of not less than $400 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">While Barrow was serving his term of supervised release, his probation officer filed a petition to revoke Barrow\u2019s supervised release. The petition alleged that Barrow had violated the conditions of supervised release by failing to maintain employment and failing to pay restitution as ordered. At his revocation hearing, Barrow admitted the violations and the court sentenced him to eight months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but asserting that the district court abused its discretion by revoking supervised release. Although Barrow was advised of his right to file a pro se brief, he has not filed such a brief. We review a sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995). We discern no abuse of discretion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-17\">Barrow admitted the charged violations; thus, a preponderance of the evidence established that he committed the supervised release violations as alleged. The district court accordingly was statutorily authorized to \u201crevoke ... supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the [original] offense ... without credit for time previous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>ly served on postrelease supervision.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2004). Because Barrow\u2019s conviction for failure to pay child support obligations exposed him to a maximum sentence of two years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 228(c)(2) (2000), the offense is a Class E felony. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3) (2000). Where the original offense is a Class E felony, the maximum term that can be imposed upon revocation of supervised release is one year. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Accordingly, after revoking Barrow\u2019s supervised release, the district court was statutorily authorized to impose an active prison term of up to one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The sentencing guidelines suggest that Barrow, whose criminal history category was Category I and whose 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 228(a)(3) conviction constituted a Grade C supervised release violation, should receive a prison term of three to nine months. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(3), p.s. (2003). However, \u201cChapter 7\u2019s policy statements are ... non-binding, advisory guides to district courts in supervised release proceedings.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>53 F.3d at 642. Thus, a court is free to exercise its discretion and, upon revocation of supervised release, sentence a defendant to imprisonment of up to the statutory maximum allowable. <em>Id. </em>at 642-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Here, the court followed the guidelines and sentenced Barrow not only within the statutory maximum, but also within the suggested guideline range. We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by revoking supervised release and imposing an eight-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
