The district court sentenced Montes to 121 months in prison and a five-year term of supervised release. Montes appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. Montes argues that the district court erred in determining both that the officials\u2019 search of his bags did not exceed that of the private parties and that he had abandoned these bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-22\">Our review of the record shows that the district court did not err in determining that the governmental search of Montes\u2019s bags was constitutionally permissible because it did not exceed the search conducted by private individuals. <em>See United States v. Runyan, </em>275 F.3d 449, 464 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Grimes, </em>244 F.3d 375, 383 (5th Cir.2001). Because this determination provides a sufficient basis to uphold the district court\u2019s denial of Montes\u2019s motion to suppress, there is no need to consider the parties\u2019 remaining arguments. <em>See United States v. Ibarra-Sanchez, </em>199 F.3d 753, 758 (5th Cir.1999). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1040-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
