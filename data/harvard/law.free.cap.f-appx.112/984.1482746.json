As an initial matter, Lopez argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Lopez concedes that this issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve it for further review. This court must follow the precedent in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">Lopez also argues that the district court should have suppressed his prior deportation as a violation of due process. This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Benitez-Villafuerte, </em>186 F.3d 651 (5th Cir.1999). Lopez\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">Lopez argues that the district court incorrectly increased his base offense level by 16 levels on the basis of his prior conviction in Georgia for family violence battery, an offense the district court deemed to be a crime of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Because Lopez raises this argument for the first time on appeal, the sentence imposed by the district court, based on the adjustment, should be reviewed under the plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 313 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">Lopez argues that Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-<em>23.1(f), </em>family violence battery, is not a crime of violence. The offense is defined as \u201cintentionally causfing] substantial physical harm or visible bodily harm to another\u201d person who is a family member. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23.1(a), (f). A crime of violence is defined as (I) \u201can offense ... that has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(ii)(I)). The use of force \u201crequires that a defendant intentionally avail himself of that force.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>356 F.3d 598, 602 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">The Georgia offense is results-oriented and does not contain a requirement that the offender apply force, but rather, leaves open the possibility that harm to the victim might result from omission or from the actions of another person or animal controlled by the offender.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> Therefore, it does not qualify for the 16-level adjustment under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 259-60 (5th Cir.2004)(en banc); <em>United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>The error is plain and must be corrected because the erroneous sentence affects Lopez\u2019s substantial rights and impugns the fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings. <em>See Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d at 313. Accordingly, Lopez\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the distric2t court for resentencing in accordance with <em>Calderon-Pena </em>and <em>Vargas-Duran.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED and REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1023-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
