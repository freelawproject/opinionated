Ben Yowel appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (2000) complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (2000) for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Yowel v. Johnson, </em>No. CA-04-147 (E.D.Va. Apr. 23, 2004). We deny Yowel\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
