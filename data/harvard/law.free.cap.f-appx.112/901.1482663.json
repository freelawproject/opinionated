California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but suggesting the district court may have failed to comply with Fed. R. Crim.P. 11 in accepting Mickens\u2019 guilty plea. Although advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Mickens declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-18\">Because Mickens did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, however, his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.) (holding that \u201cplain error analysis is the proper standard for review of forfeited error in the Rule 11 context\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>537 U.S. 899, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002). Before a reviewing court may correct a trial error to which there was no contemporaneous objection, three factors must be shown: (1) there was error, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these three factors are satisfied, an appellate court should exercise its discretion to correct the error when the error \u201c \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736 (quoting <em>United States v. Atkinson, </em>297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936)).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court fully complied with Rule 11, with one exception. It appears the court failed to apprise Mickens of the Government\u2019s right to use his statements made under oath in a prosecution for perjury or false statement. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(A). However, after a full review of the record, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>this omission did not \u201c \u2018seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Olano </em>at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case, including the transcripts, and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Mickens\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
