Goldsby argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Goldsby challenges the credibility of the testimony of his co-conspirator Aaron Christian. However, Christian did not testify as to \u201cfacts that [he] physically could not have observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Gadison, 8 </em>F.3d 186, 190 (5th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, the jury could choose whether to credit all or part of Christian\u2019s testimony, and that decision is not reviewable on appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">The evidence showed that Goldsby knowingly and voluntarily was involved in an agreement with Christian and another man to sell crack cocaine. Goldsby took an active role in the conspiracy and made the arrangements to deliver the crack cocaine. Goldsby actually possessed the drugs himself before giving them to Christian to deliver. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and giving the Government the benefit of all reasonable inferences, there is sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that Goldsby knowingly participated in a conspiracy to distribute and did distribute crack cocaine. <em>See United States v. Inocencio, </em>40 F.3d 716, 724 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Therefore, Goldsby\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence fails because a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (Former 5th Cir. Unit B 1982) (en banc), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>462 U.S. 356, 103 S.Ct. 2398, 76 L.Ed.2d 638 (1983). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
