The district court sentenced Ramirez to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The Federal Public Defender has filed a brief on Ramirez\u2019s behalf, raising the issues 1) whether the district court erred in denying Ramirez\u2019s motion for a downward departure and 2) whether a prior felony conviction is an element of the offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). The Federal Public Defender asserts that only the first issue is presented pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967); he argues the latter issue on the merits and without reliance on <em>Anders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\"><em>Anders </em>established standards for a court-appointed attorney who seeks to withdraw from a direct criminal appeal on the ground that the appeal lacks an issue of arguable merit. <em>See Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744. Because counsel does not seek to withdraw and because counsel does not suggest that this appeal is \u201cwholly frivolous,\u201d <em>Anders </em>is inapposite, and we therefore address the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">As Ramirez concedes, the record does not reflect that the district court misunderstood the scope of its authority to depart downward. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>302 F.3d 279, 291 (5th Cir.2002). Thus, this court does not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision to deny the motion for a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Buck, </em>324 F.3d 786, 798 (5th Cir.2003). The appeal is dismissed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">Ramirez argues that the prior conviction resulting in his increased sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) was an element of the offense that had to be alleged in the indictment. Ramirez acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Mandar-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. The Government\u2019s motion for dismissal or summary affirmance is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART, and the appeal is DISMISSED IN PART. MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
