The notice of appeal was received in the district court approximately seven days after the expiration of the appeal period. Under Fed. RApp. P. 4(c)(1) and <em>Houston v. Lack, 487 </em>U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), the notice is considered filed as of the date Rose properly delivered it to prison officials for mailing to the court. The record does not reveal if or when Rose complied with the requirements of Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we remand the case for the district court to obtain this information from the parties and to determine whether the filing was timely under Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1) and <em>Houston v. Lack. </em>The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b971-11\"> Although Rose indicates that he signed the notice of appeal on June 26, 2004, it is not clear whether he submitted the notice to prison officials in a timely manner or whether he even utilized his institution\u2019s internal mail system.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
