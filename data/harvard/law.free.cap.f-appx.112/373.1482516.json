A movant for IFP on appeal must show that he is a pauper and that he will present a nonfrivolous appellate issue. <em>Jackson v. Dallas Police Dep\u2019t, </em>811 F.2d 260, 261 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-18\">The documentation of Risby\u2019s prison account indicates that he cannot pay the filing fee without facing undue hardship. <em>See Adkins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 339, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948). However, Risby cannot establish that he would raise a nonfrivolous appellate issue. No error existed in the time it took the district court to consider his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243. Risby has not shown that the denial of relief constituted retaliation. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995). There is no evidence to show that the district court did not conduct a de novo review. <em>See Koetting v. Thompson, </em>995 F.2d 37, 40 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-23\">Risby contends that the district court erred in construing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. Because Risby is challenging proceedings giving rise to his conviction and sentence, the court properly construed his motion as arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Tubwell, </em>37 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir.1994). As Risby has not established that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d he may not proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b65; <em>see also 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 1; <em>Kinder v. Purdy, 222 </em>F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000). Because Risby\u2019s direct appeal was pending, the district court correctly concluded that it should not address the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion at this time. <em>See Fassler v. United States, </em>858 F.2d 1016, 1019 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-24\">Risby has not established that he will raise a nonfrivolous appellate issue. <em>Jackson, </em>811 F.2d at 261. Accordingly, we DENY the motion to proceed IFP on appeal and we DISMISS Risby\u2019s appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. We MODIFY the district court\u2019s dismissal from a \u201cdismissal for lack of jurisdiction\u201d to a \u201cdismissal without preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>dice.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ortega, </em>859 F.2d 327, 334 (5th Cir.1988). Risby\u2019s \u201cMotion to Take Judicial Notice\u201d of purportedly relevant case law is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">JUDGMENT MODIFIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION TO TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
