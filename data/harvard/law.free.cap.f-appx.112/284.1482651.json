Outler argues that the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition was based in part on a Southern District of Georgia district court\u2019s improper decision to recharacterize a motion for a new trial as a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). The Georgia district court did not give Outler notice of its intent to recharacterize the motion, warn him that the effect of the recharacterization is that any subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion will be subject to the restrictions on second or successive habeas motions, or provide him with an opportunity to withdraw or amend the motion. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003); <em>see also United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644, 649 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-22\">However, we find no reversible error in this case. Outler\u2019s convictions became final before the inception of the AEDPA; therefore, he could file a \u00a7 2255 motion no later than April 24, 1997. Outler did not file the \u00a7 2241 petition, in which he clearly sought habeas relief, until March 16, 1999, well beyond the one-year statute of limitations applicable to habeas motions. Thus, even if the Georgia district court had provided Outler with the notice and warnings required under <em>Castro </em>and <em>Emmanuel, </em>Outler could not have salvaged any habeas claim in his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See, e.g., Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d at 650 (providing that where the failure to provide notice to movant results in no adverse consequences, such failure is harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is a final order and subject to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(l)\u2019s certificate of appealability requirement. <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 369 (4th Cir.2004). A final order in a \u00a7 2255 action is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). Outler may satisfy this requirement by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Outler has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny Outler\u2019s motion for summary disposition and dismiss this appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
