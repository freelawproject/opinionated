Fiorani, Jr., appeals a district court\u2019s order construing his \u201cMotion for Reversal of Unconstitutional Conviction on Ineffective Assistance of Counsel, Prosecutorial and Judicial Misconduct, and Brady Violations\u201d as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, and dismissing it as successive, noting that Fiorani has not obtained authorization from this court to file such a motion. An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Fiorani has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b981-9\"><em> See Reid v.
