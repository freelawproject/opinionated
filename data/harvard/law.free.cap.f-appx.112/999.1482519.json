Paulos also concedes that as the standards for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT are higher than the standard required to obtain asylum, if she fails in her request for asylum, her requests for withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>removal and relief under the CAT likewise fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">Accordingly, Paulos\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1038-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
