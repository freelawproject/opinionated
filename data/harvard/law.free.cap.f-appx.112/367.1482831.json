Dupree\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). In his complaint, Dupree alleged that the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and its president, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Kwesi Mfume, violated his civil rights by refusing to provide him with legal representation to challenge his conviction and resulting incarceration on a drug charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">This court reviews the dismissal of a complaint as frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001). A complaint is frivolous if it lacks \u201can arguable basis in law or fact\u201d. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). The district court did not err in dismissing Dupree\u2019s complaint. Neither the NAACP, a private organization, nor Mfume, a private citizen, is a state actor. <em>Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830, 838, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 (1982); <em>Yeager v. City of McGregor, </em>980 F.2d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 821, 114 S.Ct. 79, 126 L.Ed.2d 47 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Dupree\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit, and the district court did not err in finding it was not taken in good faith. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Dupree\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of Dupree\u2019s appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). We CAUTION Dupree that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">\n<em>APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
