U.S. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541-12 (4th Cir.1999). We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find that the ruling of the immigration judge, affirmed by the Board, is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-24\">In addition, we uphold the denial of Medhana\u2019s application for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-25\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-19\"> Medhana asserts no arguments regarding the Convention Against Torture in this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
