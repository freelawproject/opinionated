Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>No. 99-653V (Sept. 26, 2003). Baker has not responded to the motion to dismiss but moves for an extension of time to file his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-18\">Baker filed a petition under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act in the United States Court of Federal Claims. A Special Master issued an order dismissing with prejudice Baker\u2019s petition. After the 30-day period prescribed for filing a motion for review in the Court of Federal Claims passed, the clerk of the Court of Federal Claims entered judgment on November 10, 2003. On December 29, 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>Baker filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the special master\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The Secretary states that the Vaccine Act requires that a party aggrieved by a decision of a special master file a motion for review of that decision by a judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims within 30 days of the special master\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Secretary argues that a party may not file an appeal in this court without first obtaining such review in the Court of Federal Claims. We agree. Pursuant to our decision in <em>Grimes v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., </em>988 F.2d 1196, 1198 (Fed.Cir.1993), the filing and resolution of a timely motion for review with the Court of Federal Claims is a prerequisite to appellate review in this court. Because Baker did not file a timely motion for review in the Court of Federal Claims, this court lacks jurisdiction to review his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">(2) Baker\u2019s motion for an extension of time is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b828-11\"> The Secretary indicates that after filing a notice of appeal to this court, Baker filed a motion for review of the special master's decision in the trial court. However, the Court of Federal Claims dismissed that motion for review as untimely. <em>Baker v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., </em>No. 99-653V (Jul. 7, 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
