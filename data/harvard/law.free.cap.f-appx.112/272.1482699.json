Russell appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. \u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions ... by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (2000). We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint without prejudice to allow Russell an opportunity to exhaust his administrative remedies, as required by \u00a7 1997e(a). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
