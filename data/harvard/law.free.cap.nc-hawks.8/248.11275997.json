Two of the witnesses stated, that in Newbern, a place which he often visited, and where they frequently met with him, they <em>never </em>liad seen him sober <em>; </em>and one of them further swore that he had never seen him in the town, when in his opinion, he was in a state competent to dispose of his property with reason and intelligence. These witnesses admitted he was parsimonious, disposed to use trick in his bargains, asking too much for what he had to sell, and unwilling to give the value for what he \u2022bought. The Defendant further proved, that James Heel came to Newbern 'at the election on the second Thursday in August, 1815, and remained there several days afterwards, during all which time he was seen drunk ,\u2022 that some time after the election, he came drunk to the house of one of the witnesses, who resided in New-bern, and' remained there during the night ; he then talked of his disease, said his home was a terror to him 5 while others slept he was walking, sometimes he thought himself in.Tennessee, sometimes in England, and sometimes in the West indies; he expressed a fear that the house of the witness was haunted, that he should be taken and carried away through the window in the night 5 he spoke of a design to travel for his health, and to make William Blackledge and Yine Allen, trustees to manage his business during his absence. 1 On the morning of tho succeeding day, Reel did not appear to have been reliev-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>cd by sleep, but talked as incoherently as on thcpreced-ing night, and left the witness to seek for Blackledge, after repeating his design of making Blackledge and Allen his trustees. This witness, who bad known Keel from bis childhood, was so struck by his strange demeanor, as to express, at the time, an opinion, that Reel was becoming crazy, or was about to die shortly. On the same day, this witness again met Reel, coming down the street that led from Blackledge\u2019s house, evidently intoxicated, and was informed by Reel that he had not completed his business, but would do it if he thereby was caused to remain a week longer. It was further proved, that in the afternoon preceding the morning on which the will was executed, Reel went to the house of Black-ledge, and there spent the night, that he and B. were in the front room alone, and that in the course of the evening Reel went into the supper room, sat at the table and took supper with the family ; that at the table he talked of making his will and leaving Blackledge heir to his property, and that he was then intoxicated. It was proved that Reel had been taught at school to read and write, and the elements of arithmetic ; that he could calculate with figures, read writing badly, that if sober he might possibly with much difficulty have read the will, but if drunk, it would be utterly out of his power. Other witnesses said, that when he was not too. much intoxicated to stand, he could read small pieces of writing, notes of hand, &amp;c. There was no evidence that the will had ever been read to him, the whole was in the hand-writing; of Blackledge, and no person besides saw any part of it written. It was proved that Blackledge had been Reel\u2019s lawyer on some occasion, and was a man in whom he placed much confidence.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b258-5\">James Reel died on the 30th of June, 1818, and it was proved by the Defendant, that repeatedly, from August, 1817, down to four days previous to his death, the supposed testator sent messages to Blackledge to bring or send him his packet of papers. It was not shewn that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>these messages had been received, farther than that if appeared, the supposed testator had expressed great dissatisfaction at one time- that Blackledge had not come as he said B. had promised <em>; </em>and at other times was angry at the failure of these attempts to procure the papers, and declared that Blackledge had treated him ill, and was not the man he had supposed. It was further proved in regard to the reason assigned in the will for making B. and A. residuary devisees and legatees <em>; </em>that the former had borne as great a part as any other individual of the expense and trouble of supporting what was called the Republican cause in the county of Craven ; but that the latter liad not contributed as much as others for that purpose. The Defendant then offered to prove, that at various times, between the date of the supposed will and the death of James Reel, the said James had repeatedly mentioned what he believed to be the substance of the will left in the hands of Blackledge; and that according to that representation, the said Reel understood the contents of the will as materially different, and indeed, utterly variant from what it appears on its face, particularly in regard to the residuary clause giving his estate to Blackledge and Allen, which Reel believed to be .a gift to the publick. This evidence the Court refused to receive, unless it should be of declarations immediately upon the transaction, or so soon thereafter as to form part of the <em>res </em>gestee, The residue given to B. and A. was supposed to be worth $3000 <em>; </em>the testator had no wife or children, but left brothers and sisters, and the children of deceased brothers and sisters, with whom, according to the Defendant\u2019s witnesses, he had always associated on terms of affection.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b259-3\">On the part of the executors, several witnesses testified that James Reel, though never a man of bright intellect, <em>hadrordinary </em>capacity, and whenever sober enough to stand, had understanding sufficient to manage his business <em>\u2022, </em>that he was the owner of a farm and a mill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>generally lived alone, sold the products of his farm and lent money at interest, took obligations for the pay-meat of it, was not easily defrauded, and took care of bis property. That at the periods of elections, he sometimes became angry with his brother the Defendant, because their political .sentiments were different, and that then he would declare, Defendant should have none of his property. .That the fit of sickness before spoken of, occurred about three years before his death, and that he complained that his relations neglected him. About, two months before he died, he gave the key of his chest, containing bonds, accounts and money, to a witness, with instructions to return the key to him when demanded, or to deliver it to iSlackledge ,\u2022 that <em>he </em>said he had a will in Blackledge's hands, and had told one of his sisters who had asked him for one half of his mill, that her legacy was in Newborn under three seals, and asked her what she would do with a mill. Some time before his death, on being told that if he disliked his will he had power to revoke it, and make another, he replied, lie knew that, but he believed his relations cared no more for him than for a brute, except for wiiat they might obtain from him, and that he was willing, and indeed preferred that his will should stand, remarking at the same time to the witness who proved this, that he should have as good a share of his property as any of them.</summary>\n<summary id=\"AnG\">The presiding Judge instructed the Jury, that the first point to be considered by them was, whether Reel had a capacity to make a will, and that if he had sense to make a legal contract, if he knew how to read, write, cypher, and manage a plantation, it was sufficient evidence he had capacity for such a purpose.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b260-6\">That the second enquiry was whether he was so drunk at the time of executing the will, as not to know what he was doing, and that as to the enquiry, the testimony of the subscribing witnesses, if believed, proved that he was not so drunk as not to, know what he was about.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Thirdly, that if the Jury could discover any evidence that the testator was imposed on by Biackledgc in making the will, so as to sign a disposition of his property which he did not intend, they might on that ground set the paper aside, but that there ought to be proof to that effect; and</summary>\n\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b261-9\"><em>Gaston, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n\n<summary id=\"b261-10\">The object of the evidence was to shew by Reel\u2019s repeated declarations what he believed to be the will he had signed, in order, with the other facts proved, to establish a fraud in the writer of the will, one of the executors and principal devisees.</summary>\n\n\n\n<summary id=\"b261-14\">That parol evidence may be received to shew fraud in obtaining a will, see <em>Small </em>v.

In the following particulars :</summary>\n<summary id=\"b262-7\">1. \u201c That if he was not so drunk as not to know what he was doing, he was lit to make a will.\u201d Now a degree of drunkenness which would not prevent him from knowing what he was doing, but deprive him of judgment to direct the disposition of his property, is sufficient to disqualify him from making a will. <em>\u201c </em>It is not sufficient that the testator be of memory, but he ought to have a <em>disposing </em>memory, so that be is able to make a disposition of his lands with understanding and reason, and that is such a memory winch the Law calleth sane and perfect memory.\u201d <footnotemark>||</footnotemark></summary>\n\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b263-5\"><em>Monlecai, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<summary id=\"b266-6\">The cases upon this point are <em>Gainsborough </em>v. <em>Gainsborough,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the testator charged his real estate with payment of his debts, and made his wife executrix. Evidence of his declarations that his wife should have the personal estate clear of debts, and that the person who wrote the will omitted it through- fraud or ignorance, was received. This was only to rebut the equity of the next of <em>kin; </em>and that the evidence was confined to what passed at the time the will was made, may be collected from the case itself, and moreover appears expressly by the case of <em>Lord Granville </em>v. <em>Dutchess of </em>Beaufort,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> which was decided soon after. In the latter case the Lord Chancellor says, that <em>Foster </em>&amp; <em>Murl, </em>the leading case, was an innovation, and that he yields to its authority contrary to his own opinion. The proofs taken in this cause, and which were thus reluctantly admitted by the Chancellor, were as to directions given to the person who wrote the will, and forming a part of the <em>res </em>gestee\u2014 not his <em>subsequent </em>declarations as to what those instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tions were. In the case of <em>Batchelor </em>v. Searle,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> evidence of the person who drew the will, as to the testator\u2019s declarations, evidently made at the time, was received. In the <em>Duke of Rutland </em>v. <em>Dutchess of Rutland,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the dec\u00eda-rations proved were made when the will was executed. Page 214, the Chancellor says, <em>\u201c </em>After all, I own that the allowing parol evidence is exceedingly dangerous, and <em>not to be done in cases of discourses at a different time from that of making the will .\u201d </em>In <em>Rachfield </em>v. <em>Careless,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>parol evidence of direction of testator to <em>the scrivenor, </em>that executor should have the surplus, was received.\u2014 <em>Blinkhorn </em>v. <em>Feast, </em>2 <em>Ves. 28 </em>\u2014 JYourse v. Finch, 1 <em>.Ves. jr. 358 </em>\u2014 3 <em>jSac. JSx\u2019r </em>&amp; <em>Jldm\u2019r, H. </em>5 \u2014 2 <em>Ibid, Evidence, </em>6f. In <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Bishop of Lincoln,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to explain.a latent ambiguity, evidence of what the testator directed <em>when he ordered his will to be written, </em>was received. And if a Chancellor is thus cautious in trusting himself with evidence of this kind, it cannot be said that we have too little reverence for the intelligence of a Jury, if we do not trust them with it.</summary>\n\n<summary id=\"b268-3\">The case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Kniffen,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em>- </em>is a very strong one. The testator was married to a second wife, by whom he bad no children : he was 80 years of age : he had been watched by his wife and a woman who lived in the house who had a legacy given her, aud his children debarred access to him. It was offered to be proved by one of the subscribing witnesses and others, that the testator liad frequently declared to them that he had been forced to execute the <em>will; </em>that he should have been murdered if he had not; and that an hour before his death, while expecting immediate dissolution, he called upon them to bear witness that the instrument was not his will j that it had been extorted from him through fear of being murdered. The evidence was rejected. Two of the Judges dissented one of them has given his opinion at length \u2014 he relies upon the authority of <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Oldfield</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which seems very questionable. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Oldfield, </em>was a will of personal property, the trial of the validity of which belongs <em>exclusively </em>to the Spiritual Court<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> The will had been proved in the Spiritual Court, and therefore, says the Chancellor, not to be,controverted in Chancery. Now the evidence, if admissible at all, could only be received for the purpose of shewing there was no will. This question had been decided in a Court not only competent but exclusively competent. And it is strange that when the Court was called upon to enforce the payment of a <em>legacy, </em>(a matter in which the Spiritual Court had concurrent jurisdiction,) it should acknowledge the validity of the will and refuse to respect it. The question was not made, the evidence was received sub <em>silentio. </em>We may infer that the evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>offered in the Court of Probate and rejected, and so far the case is in our favour.</summary>\n\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b269-10\"><em>Seatvell </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n\n\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b270-7\"><em>Gaston in </em>reply.</attorneys>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-16\"><em> </em>3 Rep. <em>77.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"Aj8\"> 8 Term Rep. <em>147.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"AaB\"><em> </em>Murphey\u2019s Cases, 1 vol. 150.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\"> 1 Swinb. 23, 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AFn\"> 7 Ves. jr. 518.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"b262-11\"> 2 Wm.

They believed that James Reel was not drunk, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>but sober, that they had no conversation with him, re-maiaed but a lew minutes, and left Reel and Blackledge together. One of the subscribing witnesses stated that ho believed, on his entering Blackledge\u2019s house, Reel met him at the door, and asked him to witness the paper 5 that the witness from a fear that he might be signing some obligation or instrument, whereby he might incur liability, attempted to look over the instrument before fixing his signature, when Reel intimated to him -not to do so, and said that it was nothing that could hurt him. It appeared further in evidence that Reel left Blackledge\u2019s house that morning before breakfast; that the will was left with Blackledge, and after Reel\u2019s death ivas produced by Blackledge, enclosed in an envelope, with three seals. The will was in the following words:</p><p id=\"b255-4\">\u201c I, James Reel, of Craven county, being of sound and disposing-t! mind and memory, do make and ordain this my last will and testa- \u201c ment, in manner and form following:</p><p id=\"b255-6\">\u201d <em>Item </em>\u2014 J give the sum of two hundred dollars to the children of my is brother John Reel, to them, their executors, administrators and as- \u201c signs forever. .</p><p id=\"b255-7\">\u201c <em>Item </em>\u2014 I give to my brother I,evi Reel one hundred dollars, to him, \u201c his heirs and assigns forever.</p><p id=\"b255-9\">\u201c <em>Item </em>\u2014 I give to my sister Sally Wintly fifty dollars, to her, her - heirs and assigns forever.</p><p id=\"b256-11\">\u201c Acknowledged by the testator at the same time, .</p><p id=\"b256-15\">\u201c As a further part of this will, X give to- my nephews Moses and Al- \u201c len Ernull, each twenty-five dollars, and to Stephen Ernull 1 give the , \u201c amount he owes.

That they might set aside the will for fraud if they could discover any \u2014 but th at there must be proof of it. While the Judge pronounce,? there is proof that Reel was sober, he in the strongest language intimates there is no proof of fraud. How can it be said there is no proof when it appears that Reel was a man of naturally weak intellect 5 a habitual drunkard <em>\u2022, </em>always drunk when in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>town; drunk for ten or eleven days without interimssion ; drunk and silly the night before the will was written; drunk and silly the next morning; drunk throughout that day; drunk on the night while the paper was written ; it is impossible that he sh\u00f3\u00fald not be besotted in the morning; he goes to Blackledge to got a power of attorney written; when he gets there the design is changed for a will; Blackledge, his attorney, in whom he reposes all confidence, writes it; Reel could not read it himself; there is no proof that Blackledge ever read it to him; the estate is all given away to Blackledge and his associate, and Reel\u2019s repeated efforts to procure the will are all ineffectual. And yet the Court tells the Jury if they could discover <em>any </em>evidences of imposition, they might say it was fraudulent, but they muSt.have proof! ?</p><p id=\"b263-4\">As to the finding of the Jury, if there be a well-founded doubt upon it, there ought <em>to- </em>be a new trial\u2014 inasmuch as the inheritance is forever bound by <em>it </em>\u2014 Ba<em>ker </em>v. <em>Hart,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 Pemberton v. <em>Pembsrton.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark></p><p id=\"AdF_\">Evidence of parol declarations, contradicting and subverting the written declarations of a party\u2019s intentions, executed and attested with all the solemnities which the law requires' for the purpose of preventing fraud, perjury, and imposition, should certainly be received with great caution.</p><p id=\"b263-6\">Such evidence introduces all the danger which can arise from false and corrupt witnesses, who will swear to declarations which they never heard \u2014 from the inattention, stupidity or forgetfulness of witnesses, who misrepresent what they did hear; and from loose and unguarded expressions of a testator, and expressions which he may have used purposely with the view of concealing the manner in which he has disposed of his property; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>to prevent dissatisfaction among those who hope to be the objects of his bounty.</p><p id=\"AEe\">It is contrary to the spirit of our statute laws to admit such evidence. Wills are required to be in writing : hut if you permit a will in writing to be set aside by evidence of parol declarations, you thereby set up the will which the Law makes, in place of that which the testator has <em>made; </em>and there seems to be little difference between setting up a parol will, and setting aside by parol a will made in writing. Again, our Law says that a will in writing shall not be revoked by parol: Why ? Because of the danger of perjury. But does not the same danger occur in such evidence as is offered here ? You shall not prove that a written will was revoked, for fear of perjured witnesses, but if the same <em>persons will </em>swear that the will never was made, it may be heard <em>; </em>because forsooth there is not the same danger : In fact, there is more, for while evidence of parol declarations of revocation was received, the Law had defined what expressions would amount to a revocation, but as to this evidence there is no guage. Estates will depend more than ever not only on the integrity and the understanding of witnesses, but on the whim of Jurors, the capacity of the Advocate and the integrity of the Judge \u2014 and although from the nature of things, this hazard must be encountered in all judicial proceedings, I should not be disposed to give greater credit or put more to risk in any case than, necessity demands. If such evidence is received at all, (which were it <em>res integra </em>I should think very questionable,) it should be confined to declarations made at the. time the will was made, or so near as to form a part of the <em>res gestee </em>\u2014 a time when the mind of the testator was called to the business in which he was engaged ; when it cannot be supposed he said any thing relative thereto with a view of concealing or misrepresenting the manner in which his property was disposed of: when the. attention of the bye-standers would probably be called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>to the matter in hand : when those whom the testator thought worthy of his confidence would be present, and when no expressions would probably be attributed to him unless they were actually used.</p><p id=\"b265-5\">But it is said the evidence is <em>relevant, </em>that the Jury should have heard it, and given it such weight as it merited. The evidence if admissible'is certainly relevant; but it by no means follows that all relevant evidence, by which I mean such evidence as, if true, will conduce to enable a Jury to arrive at a correct result, is admissible. Upon the principle of relevancy, if that were the sole test, hearsay evidence, the declarations of persons interested would be admissible, and if it were possible that a Jury could be composed of such materials as that they could sift the false from the true, such evidence should and would be received; for* as the object of evidence is to elicit truth, it makes no difference what the nature of the evidence is, provided the desired result Can be obtained. Evidence of hearsay or of declarations would be admitted, and their weight left for tire Jury to ascertain; but why are they rejected ? not because we will not respect truth when derived from such sources, but because it would be impossible for a Jury composed of mere men to ascertain what is true and what is false. Reasons of policy therefore direct its exclusion.</p><p id=\"b265-7\">As it cannot be assumed as a criterion of the admissibility of evideuce, that it tends, if true, to prove the issue; as the policy of our Law, as expressed in the acts of our Legislature, does not favour the introduction of such evidence as is offered here; as it appears to be of dangerous tendency, and reason would direct its exclusion ; let ns examine what is said by <em>authority, </em>the other witness of the Law\\ I had expected that the appellant would have produced some authority to shew that evidence of this kind has been received ; l^ut I have been disappointed.</p><p id=\"b265-8\">It is admitted that parol evidence of the declarations has been received, l. to rebufan equity ; 2. to explain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>latent ambiguity $ 3. to shew a fraud practised on the testator.</p><p id=\"AQM\">As to tlioso cases in which it has been received to rebut an equity, it will be found generally that they were confined to wiiat passed at the time of making the will, <em>or </em>so near as to form part of the <em>res gestae. </em>And these cases are stronger than that now presented to the Court. The legal operation of the will gives the property to the executor, but from some circumstances apparent upon it, the Court of Equity deems him a trustee for the next of ldn. The parol evidence which is received, is for the purpose of supporting the legal operation of the will, and rebutting an equitable presumption. The Court restrict it to what passed at tiie time; surely a greater latitude would not be allowed to evidence, the effect of which is to destroy the instrument altogether, than is allowed to evidence in its support.</p><p id=\"b267-6\">That the same course has been pursued by Judges in Courts of Law, appears from <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Thomas,</em><footnotemark><em>||</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which Lord Kenyon says, <em>\u201c </em>It seems the learned Judge did right in rejecting the evidence, the <em>supposed declarations having been made by the testator long before the will was made, </em>though had they been made at the time of making the will, I should have thought them admissible evidence.\u201d Now if declarations made before wrere not admissible, neither are those made after. If those made after are admissible, those made before would be, though they would not be entitled to the same weight, because the testator might have changed his mind. But both are equally <em>relevant. </em>In <em>Doe on demise of Small </em>v. <em>Allen,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00b6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>parol evidence was given of questions-asked by the testator at the <em>time of executing his will, </em>as to its contents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>to set it aside on the ground of fraud. And these two cases shew the distinction for which we contend \u2014 that evidence of what passed at the time, or so near as to form a part of the <em>res gestee, </em>is admissible \u2014 that evidence of declarations made at other times is inadmissible.</p><p id=\"b269-4\">The Judge <em>fin Jackson </em>v. <em>Kniffen) </em>adds, \u201cI think <em>\u201c </em>the evidence, should have been admitted, and especially <em>\u201c </em>after it had been proved, that the devisor had been <em>\u201c </em>guarded and watched over after the date of the will; <em>\u201c </em>that it had been taken out of his custody and detained, \u201c notwithstanding his application for it, for the purpose \u201c of cancelling it, and that his children were denied acs- <em>\u201c </em>cess to him.\u201d With humility, I must be permitted to question the correctness of this opinion, which makes the admission or rejection of this evidence dependant on any thing extrinsic. If it was not admissible without the existence of the other circumstances, I cannot see how their existence could make it so.</p><p id=\"b269-8\">There is another case upon the same point, decided by Judge Story, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Fenner,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an authority precisely in point, and no light one.</p><p id=\"b269-9\">It is true, that if evidence of this nature is rejected, fraud may be successfully practised, but many more will be effected if such evidence should be received: Perjuries will be encouraged \u2014 the last wills of testators (]e~ feated. Evils exist on both sides, a wise magistrate will choose the least.</p><p id=\"Ahn\">commented on the authorities cited by counsel for the appellant, contending that they did not apply, though some of them established the doctrine that parol evidence might be received of declarations <em>accompanying </em>acts, to shew the <em>intention </em>of the acts.</p><p id=\"b269-11\">That such evidence as was offered in the present caso was inadmissible, would appear from <em>Richardson's law of last wills, </em>279 \u2014 2 <em>Bac. M. </em>64 Revise,309.</p><p id=\"b269-12\">The rule of law as to drunkenness and capacity in a testator, is laid down in the very language used by the Court below, in. <em>Shep. Touch, </em>403.</p><p id=\"AeRs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The charge as to the testimony of the subscribing witnesses did not infringe the powers of the J ury, or violate the act of 17\"96. To say that the subscribing witnesses <em>J </em>\u00b0 <em>proved, </em>if believed, is in substance the same thing with saying, the subscribing witnesses <em>said.</em></p><p id=\"AYp\">It is in terms conceded that parol evidence is admissible to support the averment of fraud, and yet such evidence is asserted to be against the spirit of the statutes requiring wills to be in writing and forbidding parol revocations.</p><p id=\"b270-8\">There is no point of the law the <em>spirit </em>of which ought more to be observed than tiiat which declares its abhorrence of fraud, and pronounces all fraudulent acts void. If a signature be procured by fraud to a testament, it is not a written <em>will, </em>it is <em>no </em>will.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And as to the spirit of the statutes forbidding parol revocations, we had none sucli, and parol revocations were admissible.</p><p id=\"b270-9\">It is also conceded that where parol evidence is admissible, declarations of the testator may be received. Now it should be remembered that these are not received as a privileged sort of hearsay evidence. The rule as to hearsay evidence applies only to declarations of third persons, <em>witnesses </em>not on oath.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The exception as to <em>res gestae </em>applies only to hearsay evidence, and not to admissions of parties. Such declarations are received as admitted facts as against those admitting them and their privies.</p><p id=\"b270-10\">But it is insisted that the admissions of a testator arc not receivable unless made at the <em>moment; </em>and this is attempted to be supported by reason and by authority.</p><p id=\"b270-11\">1. By reason : St is said they &lt;e may not have been serious \u2014 may be misunderstood \u2014 may have been made to deceive.\u201d To this we answer \u2014 All this is possible, and it is right that such suggestions should be weighed. The same objections might be made to proof in a suit between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>A. ami 1?. of B\u2019s admissions, but yet the evidence would be received. -The whole foundation of-this objection is, that.those wild should <em>weigh </em>evidence, are not competent to do it. It is an objection to trial by Jury' \u2014 not to the admissibility of testimony. But it is said, <em>\u201c </em>there is the same reason against it as against a man\u2019s declarations to impeadh a <em>deed </em>he has made.\u201d To this wo answer\u2014 It is not <em>S(Y. </em>In <em>that </em>case he is making evidence by his own declarations <em>for Inins elf; </em>or tie-is disinterested, and therefore his <em>oath </em>is better than his mere declaration. A testator cannot be examined on oath when a will is in contest-. A testator cannot have an interest to make testimony against what he wishes to take\"place.</p><p id=\"b271-4\">2. <em>\u201c </em>By authority <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Kniffen,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in this case there was no argument,' it'was decided by a bare majority\", and that a vacillating majority.it goes <em>too far, </em>and therefore proves nothing \u2014 for it forbids <em>any </em>declarations of testator from being received. It purports to be founded solely on the statute of Frauds forbidding parol revocations, and therefore has no application here. It alleges to be supported by adjudications which do not uphold it.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> It differs materially from the present case, because he knew it was unduly obtained, and yet did not revoke<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> Hero Reel supposed his will to be, other than it was and therefore did not revokp. - The opinion of the minority is a cqjiciusive refutation.</p><p id=\"b271-6\">The case from <em>Gallison </em>is a mere'nisi' <em>prim </em>decision, made by a Jndge who is an eminent <em>civilian, </em>accustomed to decide both law' and fact.
