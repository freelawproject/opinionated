The trial court's judgment is hereby affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In June 2007, appellant was indicted on 72 counts by the Ashtabula County Grand Jury. Appellant entered into a plea agreement with appellee, the state of Ohio, and entered pleas of guilty to the following\n   34 counts: one count of Engaging in a Pattern of Corrupt Activity, in violation of R.C. 2923.32, a first-degree felony; seventeen counts of Burglary, in violation of R.C. 2911.12, second-degree felonies; five counts of Theft, in violation of R.C. 2913.02, fifth-degree felonies; nine counts of Grand Theft, in violation of R.C. 2913.02, third-degree felonies; one count of Theft, in violation of R.C. 2913.02, a first-degree misdemeanor; and one count of Tampering with Evidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12, a third-degree felony. The remaining counts were dismissed by the State. The parties stipulated to a prison term of nine years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A change of plea and sentencing hearing was held on December 13, 2007, and the sentencing entry was journalized on December 24, 2007. The trial court sentenced appellant to an aggregate prison term of nine years. Appellant did not file a direct appeal from the sentencing entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} According to appellant, he completed this prison term on March 30, 2016, but remains incarcerated on parole violations from a previous conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On August 29, 2016, appellant filed a pro se motion to vacate improperly imposed post-release control, arguing the trial court improperly advised him at his change of plea and sentencing hearing that he \"may\" have post-release control for \"up to three years.\" The trial court overruled this motion on November 11, 2016, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court incorporated that the offender\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be subject to a period of five years in its Judgment Entry of sentence. * * * Although the signed plea agreement does state that the defendant may have been subject to three years of post release control, the Court has reviewed the record, and the Court did advise the defendant, during both the plea and the sentencing portions of the hearing that he\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   be subject to five years of post release control. The defendant stated on the record that he understood that. [Emphasis sic.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant filed a timely appeal and raises one assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} \"The trial court erred in denying appellant's motion to vacate improperly imposed post release control as Appellant had a due process right to be notified of the mandatory nature of the post release control pursuant to the Ohio and United States Constitutions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant argues the trial court failed to properly notify him of the mandatory nature of his post-release control at the change of plea and sentencing hearing and also failed to journalize a proper notification into its sentencing entry. Appellant alleges this error renders the post-release control portion of his sentence void and the error cannot be resolved as he has completed his prison term. Thus, appellant asserts the imposition of post-release control must be vacated. When a sentence is contrary to law, a reviewing court, inter alia, \"may vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing.\" R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Void, Voidable, and Res Judicata\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} R.C. 2929.191 was enacted on July 11, 2006, as a result of H.B. 137, and provides a procedure for correcting sentences that fail to comply with statutory requirements for imposing post-release control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The Ohio Supreme Court subsequently held that R.C. 2929.191 cannot be applied retroactively.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, any error in the imposition of his post-release control should have rendered that portion of his sentence merely voidable, not void. Appellant did not file a direct appeal from his sentencing entry. In the event there was error, for the sake of analysis, appellant's argument should now be barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Parole Board Notification Statutes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Concluding that an erroneous judgment is both \"merely voidable\" and \"subject to res judicata\" is, generally speaking, a logical equivalence. Such a conclusion has nevertheless been rendered effectively meaningless when the alleged error involves improper notification of post-release control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Also included in H.B. 137 was an amendment to R.C. 2929.14(D)(1), which provides, in pertinent part, that \"on or after July 11, 2006, the failure of a court to include a post-release control requirement in the sentence pursuant to this division does not negate, limit, or otherwise affect the mandatory period of post-release control that is required for the offender under [ R.C. 2967.28(B) ].\" Similar language was included in the amendments to R.C. 2929.19(B)(2) regarding notification requirements at sentencing. To summarize, the plain language of these statutes indicates the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) The trial court's failure to include post-release control in the sentence \"does not negate, limit, or otherwise affect\" the mandatory period of post-release control the offender is statutorily required to serve.

[ R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(c) ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (3) The trial court's failure to notify the offender (either at the sentencing hearing or in the judgment of conviction) that the parole board may impose a prison term, as authorized by statute, for violating the terms of post-release control \"does not negate, limit, or otherwise affect\" the parole board's authority to impose that prison term-as long as the parole board provides notification to the offender prior to his release from prison. [ R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(e) ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   These statutes demonstrate the legislature's apparent intent to render mistakes in imposing mandatory post-release control \"nonproblematic\" and \"basically irrelevant.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singleton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 49-53 (Pfeifer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The Ohio Supreme Court subsequently held, however, that \"in the absence of a proper sentencing entry imposing postrelease control, the parole board's imposition of postrelease control cannot be enforced.
