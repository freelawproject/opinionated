Smithhisler appeals from the judgment entries of conviction and sentence entered in the Knox County Court of Common Pleas on August 22, 2016 and December 16, 2016. Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This case arose on September 16, 2015 when the Knox County Sheriff's Office performed an annual \"roundup\" of registered sex offenders in the county by checking each registered address to investigate whether the offenders actually lived at their reported addresses. Appellant is a Tier II sex offender and is required to register his address every 180 days. The address registered to appellant was 110 East Ohio Avenue, Apartment B (or \u00bd, as the apartment was also known), Mount Vernon, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Officers arrived at the apartment to find it vacant. The apartment manager was present and told them the occupant, appellant, had moved after providing a written 30-day notice. The apartment manager also provided appellant's forwarding address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Officers made contact with appellant at the new address. Appellant told them he had called the Knox County Sheriff's Office, spoken with Lt. Penny Lamp, and \"registered\" his new address over the phone. Sgt. Selby, an officer on the scene, challenged appellant's account and stated appellant knew he couldn't change his registered address by simply calling in to the Sheriff's Office, to which appellant reportedly admitted he knew the procedure required him to appear in person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Knox County Sheriff's Office personnel testified that registered sex offenders in the county are required to appear in person at the office for their required registration. Registration and address updates cannot be accomplished over the phone. It is not uncommon for offenders to call in to check on the viability of a potential address, i.e., whether a new address is too close to a school or day care center. In those cases, sheriff's personnel advise offenders of the suitability of an address over the phone but the offender must still report to the office personally to update and register the new address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Officers also testified to one instance in which offenders \"register\" their addresses by phone. Homeless offenders are required to call in with their location each day. They are not required to come into the office personally to update their addresses because the addresses change daily. (No argument has been made in this case that appellant is homeless or that the homeless offender policy ever applied to him.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Lt. Penny Lamp is the jail administrator at the Sheriff's Office and oversees the sex offender registration process. She testified on behalf of appellee and stated appellant did not call her regarding the change of address. The office has a voice message line and any phone call is logged into an investigative report. In appellant's case, as of June 17, 2015, he registered his address as 110 East Ohio Avenue, Apartment B, Mount Vernon. Lamp confirmed\n   sex offenders are not permitted to change their registered address by phone; even if they have called to verify the suitability of a potential new address, they must come to the office in person to register the new address. No investigative report was made regarding any calls from appellant in 2015 other than a report on March 2, 2015 in which a deputy reported appellant called in to advise of a new phone number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant testified on his own behalf at trial. He has been a registered sex offender since 2008 and has changed address \"four or five times\" since becoming required to register. Appellant stated that each time he planned to move, he called the sheriff's office to inquire whether the address was \"within [his] means,\" meaning whether the address was appropriate due to its proximity to schools, etc. Appellant insisted sheriff's office personnel would then \"update\" his address by phone, noting the change of address in his file. He testified he never once personally went into the sheriff's department to register a new address and always did so over the phone. He registered twice per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant acknowledged a prior conviction for failure to register in 2012 and said he was \"away from his residence for too long\" and had no transportation to get to the sheriff's office to register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Upon cross examination, appellant acknowledged appellee's Exhibit 8, a notice of registration requirements, which was read to and signed by appellant. Number 4 on the list states he is obligated to personally appear at the sheriff's office to update his registered address if the address changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant was charged by indictment with one count of failure to provide change of address pursuant to R.C. 2950.05(F)(1), a felony of the third degree. The most serious offense requiring appellant to register is a conviction of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, a felony of the fourth degree; the indictment further noted appellant's prior conviction of failure to provide change of address in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant entered a plea of not guilty and waived his right to trial by jury. The matter proceeded to bench trial on August 18, 2016 and appellant was found guilty as charged. The trial court ordered preparation of a pre-sentence investigation (P.S.I.) and sentencing was scheduled for December 16, 2016. On that date, on the record and in the sentencing entry, the trial court noted appellant's conviction carries mandatory prison time, appellant is not eligible for community control, and a prison term is consistent with the purposes of felony sentencing contained in R.C. 2929.11. Appellant was sentenced to a prison term of three years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant now appeals from the judgment entries of conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant raises three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} \"I.

SMITHHISLER.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"III. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN FINDING MR. SMITHHISLER GUILTY AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT AND SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues the trial court\n   erred in imposing the \"maximum\" sentence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In the instant case, appellant was found guilty of one count of failure to provide change of address pursuant to R.C. 2950.05(F)(1), a felony of the third degree. The penalty level of appellant's offense was enhanced because appellant has a prior conviction for the same offense in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Two provisions of R.C. 2950.99 apply to appellant in light of his prior convictions for unlawful sexual conduct with a minor and the 2012 prior conviction for failure to provide change of address. The statute provides that the\n   <strong>\n    minimum\n   </strong>\n   sentence available to the trial court in the instant case is three years:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (A)(1)(a) Except as otherwise provided in division (A)(1)(b) of this section, whoever violates a prohibition in [ section 2950.05 ] of the Revised Code shall be punished as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (ii) If the most serious sexually oriented offense or child-victim oriented offense that was the basis of the registration, notice of intent to reside, change of address notification, or address verification requirement that was violated under the prohibition is a felony of the * * * fourth degree if committed by an adult * * *, the offender is guilty of a felony of the same degree as the most serious sexually oriented offense or child-victim oriented offense that was the basis of the registration, notice of intent to reside, change of address, or address verification requirement that was violated under the prohibition * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (b) If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to * * * a violation of a prohibition in section * * * 2950.05, * * * whoever violates a prohibition in section * * * 2950.05 * * * of the Revised Code shall be punished as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (iii) If the most serious sexually oriented offense or child-victim oriented offense that was the basis of the registration, notice of intent to reside, change of address notification, or address verification requirement that was violated under the prohibition is a felony of the fourth or fifth degree if committed by an adult or a comparable category of offense committed in another jurisdiction, the offender is guilty of a felony of the third degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (2) * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (b) In addition to any penalty or sanction imposed under division (A)(1)(b)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section or any other provision of law for a violation of a prohibition in section * * * 2950.05 * * * of the Revised Code, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to, * * * a violation of a prohibition in section * * * 2950.05, * * * of the Revised Code when the most serious sexually oriented offense or child-victim oriented offense that was the basis of the requirement that was violated under the prohibition is a felony if committed by an adult or a comparable category of offense committed in another jurisdiction,\n   <strong>\n    the court imposing a sentence upon the offender shall impose a definite prison term of no less than three years\n   </strong>\n   .

We disagree with appellant's underlying premise that a three-year prison term is disproportionate punishment for what appellant terms \"miscommunication\" about a sex offender's location \"without any other societal harm.\" Brief, 4. As in\n   <em>\n    Koch\n   </em>\n   , appellant is a recidivist offender with a prior conviction for failure to report a change of address. Appellant minimizes his offenses. At trial, appellant claimed his prior conviction was through no fault of his own because he lacked transportation to fulfill his registration requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The terms of appellant's registration requirements were spelled out to him, and acknowledged by him, but he failed to comply with those terms. A prison sentence of three years is not cruel and unusual punishment for \"miscommunication\" about the location of a registered sex offender.\n   <em>\n    Koch,\n   </em>\n   supra, at \u00b6 19. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that the state's system of sex offender registration and address verification has been held not to constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article I, Section 9 of the Ohio Constitution.

Appellant's self-serving testimony about the alleged telephone procedure was contradicted by the evidence in the record. Although he claims he was told by sheriff's personnel including Lt. Lamp that he could call in and update his address by telephone, Lt. Lamp directly contradicted his account. Lamp testified appellant was never told he could update his address by telephone. Sgt. Selby testified that at the scene of the arrest, he confronted appellant about this claim and appellant admitted that he knew he was required to update his address in person. Appellant signed appellee's Exhibit 8, a form specifically telling him that address changes had to be made in person at the sheriff's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Finally, even assuming arguendo appellant could update his address by telephone, there is no evidence appellant called the sheriff's office at all to do so in 2015.
