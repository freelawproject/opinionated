Meddock appeals the sentence and judgment of the Pike County Court of Common Pleas after a jury found him guilty of one count of illegal manufacture of drugs, in violation of R.C. 2925.04(A), and one count of illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs, in violation of R.C. 2925.041. On appeal, Appellant contends: (1) the trial court erred when it permitted improper opinion testimony; (2) the trial court erred by permitting irrelevant and prejudicial evidence regarding a prior encounter with law enforcement; (3) the trial court erred by overruling Appellant's Crim.R. 29 motion; and (4) the trial court's cumulative errors violated Appellant's rights to a fair trial and due process. Upon review, we find no merit to Appellant's arguments. As such, the trial court did not err. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant's assignments of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 1, 2015, Appellant and Donald Entler, Appellant's codefendant, were indicted on one count of illegal manufacturing of drugs, a violation of R.C. 2925.04(A)(3) and a second degree felony, and one count of illegal assembly of one or more chemicals necessary for the manufacture of methamphetamine, a violation of R.C. 2925.041 and a third degree felony. The indictments arose from activities which occurred on or about April 5, 2015 in Pike County, Ohio. On that date, the Pike County Sheriff's office received an anonymous tip of an active methamphetamine lab in the Morgantown area of Pike County. Pike County deputies responding to the area caught a strong scent of ether coming eastbound across Morgan's Fork Road. The deputies eventually entered a house on 19 North Street owned by Robert Crabtree. Inside, officers discovered Appellant, Entler, and two women. Furthermore, officers discovered a one-pot methamphetamine lab in the second bedroom of the house where Appellant, alone, was hiding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant entered not guilty pleas to the above charges and eventually proceeded to trial on January 4 and 5, 2016. The State presented two witnesses, Corporal Adrian Cottrell and Corporal James Burchett, both of the Pike County Sheriff's Office. The defense did not present any evidence. At the close of trial, Appellant was convicted of both counts. Appellant was sentenced on January 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At sentencing, the trial court found the counts were allied offenses of similar import and should be merged for\n   sentencing. The prosecuting attorney elected to proceed upon the illegal manufacture count, R.C. 2925.04(A). The trial court then imposed a mandatory prison term of four years. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"I.

Did Officer Cottrell give improper expert opinion testimony?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant argues the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted Officer Cottrell to offer his professional opinion that the materials found in the second bedroom where Appellant was hiding were ingredients for the production of methamphetamine and were being used to that end when the officers arrived. Defense counsel repeatedly objected to Officer Cottrell's testimony. Appellant argues that the trial court erred by permitting the officer to testify as an expert pursuant to Evid.R. 702 and pursuant to the principles gleaned from\n   <em>\n    Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However,\n   since the officer was not previously disclosed as an expert and did not submit an expert report pursuant to Crim.R. 16, defense counsel was precluded from appropriate cross-examination. Furthermore, Officer Cottrell's conclusions were the only link between the common household items and the alleged methamphetamine lab. Appellant concludes Officer Cottrell's testimony was well outside the limited circumstances in which lay witness opinion is proper under Evid.R. 701.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Since the adoption of the Rules of Evidence, both on the state and federal levels, many courts have used an Evid.R. 701 analysis and have allowed lay witnesses to testify about, for example, the identity of a drug.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Eighth District Court of Appeals agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 18} After defining Evid.R. 701, the court explained at \u00b6 18 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"Under Evid.R. 701, courts have permitted lay witnesses to express their opinions in areas in which it would ordinarily\n   be expected that an expert must be qualified under Evid.R. 702.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, Vedder-apart from his 40 years as a firefighter with the Chagrin Falls Fire Department and 25 years as a hazardous materials specialist-testified as to his training and experience through the Ohio Fire Academy in methamphetamine labs. Further, Vedder also has served as an instructor for the Ohio Fire Academy, teaching specifically about methamphetamine labs and the chemicals that are involved, the precursor chemicals, and the hazards that are present from those chemicals. Therefore, Vedder's testimony that salt and Coleman lantern fluid are used in the methamphetamine process as well as his explanation of the one-pot method for making methamphetamine was based on his own personal knowledge and experience as established by the state. Additionally, Vedder's testimony related specifically to his own actions on the scene and why he undertook such actions, i.e., photographing items that are used in the methamphetamine process. Further, Vedder's testimony was helpful to determine the significance of the items found in Maust's bedroom. Accordingly, we find no error in the state's failure to provide an expert report with respect to Vedder; nor did the trial court abuse its discretion in allowing him to testify on these matters.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Here, we have reviewed the record and find that Corporal Cottrell's testimony was properly admitted lay testimony under Evid.R. 701 because the testimony was based on his training and experience, was related to his personal observations during the investigation, and was helpful to determination of facts in issue. The State laid a foundation for Cottrell's testimony. Cottrell testified he had completed basic peace officer training in 2011 and received his state certification. He was hired by the Pike County Sheriff's Department in January 2012. He had just been promoted to corporal. Corporal\n   Cottrell's duties included supervising the deputies on his shift, reviewing reports, and correcting paperwork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Specifically, Corporal Cottrell had received Advanced Clandestine chemical lab training at the Bureau of Criminal Investigations in Columbus in 2014. The training lasted two weeks and he passed a written test at the end. He was trained on the entire process of methamphetamine production, and the \"one-pot method.\" He was also trained as to how to package the hazardous materials for disposal. He had investigated approximately 50 actual methamphetamine labs, and observed the \"one-pot\" cook labs during the course of his duties. Corporal Cottrell testified the \"one-pot\" method takes 30-60 minutes and some common ingredients are pseudoephedrine and drain opener.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Corporal Cottrell's testimony also related to his personal observations at the house located on 19 North Street in the Morgantown area of Pike County. Cottrell testified after they received the tip and were en route to investigate, he caught the strong scent of ether coming eastbound across Morgan's Fork Road. He testified the smell of ether can be indicative of a methamphetamine lab. Based on the smell, he and other officers patrolled the area and determined the smell was coming from the house at 19 North Street owned by Robert Crabtree. Cottrell and another officer attempted to make contact at the house. Finally, the homeowner was found nearby and gave permission to enter the residence. Upon entering the house and going from room to room, Cottrell found 2 females. Donald Entler was hiding in the closet of a main bedroom. Appellant was hiding under the bed in a second bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Here, Corporal Cottrell's testimony was helpful to the jury's understanding and determination of facts in issue. Cottrell testified in the second bedroom, on a dresser, there was a soda bottle with a tube coming out of the top. It was giving off gas at the end of the hose and fumes could be seen in the air. Cottrell testified he had seen many of these and had never seen a pop bottle with a hose coming out that was not connected to a methamphetamine lab. Based on his training, Cottrell identified this bottle as an acid gas generator, a part of the one-pot method of producing methamphetamine. Cottrell testified the generator is used to convert the oil form of methamphetamine into usable water dissolvent form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Cottrell testified he performed a field test of liquid found in a mason jar in bedroom two. The jar is used in the initial assembly of the one pot method. He opined it was flammable liquid. The acid gas generator is used in the second phase. Based on his training and experience with multiple clandestine meth labs, he opined the acid generator was assembled and to the point where the liquid was extracted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Corporal Cottrell also identified Exhibit 11, a photograph of a backpack on the floor inside bedroom 2. He testified a one-pot bottle, an open bag of ammonium nitrate, lye, and starting fluid were found inside the back pack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 27} We find Corporal Cottrell's testimony regarding the one-pot method of methamphetamine production was properly admitted under Evid.R. 701. As in\n   <em>\n    Williams, supra,\n   </em>\n   Corporal Cottrell testified regarding the process used to manufacture methamphetamine and the materials commonly used for that process. His testimony was based on his training, certification, and experience of identification of clandestine methamphetamine labs. His testimony was also based upon his observations at the scene of Appellant's arrest in April 2015. And, as in\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   his testimony provided the context for the jury to appreciate the significance of otherwise\n   common household items found together in the house, and specifically the bedroom where Appellant was hiding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 28} We find Corporal Cottrell's testimony was proper lay opinion well within the providence of Evid.R. 601. Accordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Corporal Cottrell's testimony regarding clandestine methamphetamine labs and his observations upon arriving at 19 North Street. As such, we find no merit to Appellant's first assignment of error and it is hereby overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    2. Did Officer Cottrell give improper and prejudicial testimony about the marijuana pipe?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In Appellant's second assignment of error, he first contends the jury heard unrelated and prejudicial testimony about a marijuana pipe found in the second bedroom. The jury heard evidence that Appellant smoked marijuana, and a photograph of the marijuana pipe was admitted. The only evidence linking Appellant to the second bedroom was the marijuana pipe. Counsel argues the irrelevant material was prejudicial character evidence. Counsel concludes that since there was no overwhelming evidence of guilt, the photograph of the pipe, along with other matters to be discussed below, was overly prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The State responds that the photograph of the marijuana pipe was properly admitted because it was relevant evidence used to make the existence of a fact of consequence to the determination of the action more probable than it would be without the evidence. Appellant claimed he was only in the room to hide from law enforcement. However, the marijuana pipe establishes a link between Appellant and the second bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The trial transcript reveals that the State asked Corporal Cottrell to identify Exhibits 17, 18, and 19, which he identified as \"just basically a homemade marijuana pipe that was located in the bedroom, as well.\" While counsel interposed an objection shortly thereafter to a photograph of the acid generator on top of the dresser in bedroom 2, there was no objection to the photograph of the marijuana pipe until the close of trial. Later, in Corporal Burchett's testimony, a DVD of his recorded interview with Appellant was played for the jury. In the DVD, Appellant was questioned as to whether he smoked pot. While his verbal answer is inaudible, Appellant can be seen shaking his head affirmatively. Counsel did not interpose an objection as to the playing of the DVD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 32} When defense counsel objected to the admission of the marijuana pipe photographs at the close of trial, counsel argued Appellant was not charged with possession of drug paraphernalia and the photograph was confusing and prejudicial. The court overruled the objection as to Exhibit 17 and sustained objections to Exhibits 18 and 19 as \"surplusage.\" Counsel did not object to admission of the DVD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Evid.R. 404(B), dealing with the admissibility of \"other acts,\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \"Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.

Some of the evidence used against him was his travel history, the hotel room he reserved where a large amount of marijuana was found, and his wallet and other identifiers in the hotel room. On appeal, Rotarius complained that a Drug Enforcement Administration agent was allowed to testify about finding a glass pipe in a bag with Rotarius' name tag in the hotel room, and that the pipe tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine. Rotarius claimed that this evidence tended to show general bad character that tainted the decision-making ability of the jury by prejudicially depicting him as a person with a propensity for drugs and drug-related crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Rotarius objected to the admission of this testimony against the backdrop of his own argument at trial, that others may have had access to his hotel room, with his permission, and that any contraband recovered from the room was placed there upon the initiative of someone else, without his knowledge or consent. The appellate court disagreed. The court found, in light of the complete trial record and the extremely limited amount of testimony that this assigned error referenced (a total of two questions), the argument was not well taken. The court found any prejudice, in light of the compelling, obvious evidence presented against Rotarius, such as his personal identification in the hotel room, his flights and travel history, and the testimony of his co-defendant Richardson, was de minimus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 38} We find this to be a closer case than that presented by the facts in\n   <em>\n    Rotarius\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Rotarius\n   </em>\n   had other compelling evidence to consider. Here, ostensibly, Appellant's only connection to the room he was hiding in is the marijuana pipe. However, given Appellant's admission\n   that he used marijuana, and given the failure to object to the playing or admission of the DVD, we find the photograph of the marijuana pipe was admissible because it did tend to show a substantial connection to the second bedroom and the absence of any mistake that Appellant was found there. For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit to Appellant's argument that unfair prejudice outweighed the photograph's probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    3. Did Corporal Cottrell give improper and prejudicial testimony regarding a prior encounter with Appellant?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 39} During direct examination, Corporal Cottrell testified regarding State's Exhibit 12, a photograph. He testified: \"This is the bed inside the bedroom. Just another view of it. The mask is laying there. Uh, there's a leather jacket, uh, the knives. Uh, the last time I dealt with the Defendant, he had a knife.\" Defense counsel objected, moved to strike the testimony, and moved for a mistrial. Counsel argued the prior encounter testimony was highly inflammatory and prejudicial. The State argued that it would present testimony that Appellant had been removed from the exact same room previously and under Evid.R. 404(B), the State would show there was no mistake. Defense counsel stated that information had not been provided to her. The trial court ultimately overruled the motion for a mistrial and sustained the objection. When the jury was brought back in, the trial court instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \"Uh, there was an objection registered and a motion for mistrial in the presence of the jury just before you were asked to uh,-and a motion to strike-just before we went on recess, ladies and gentlemen. The court is sustaining the objection to the last statement of the officer and ordering it striken. The jury will disregard that last statement just made uh, prior to the defense counsel's uh objection and motion to strike. The jury will disregard that, not consider that statement for any purpose.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Appellant contends the testimony regarding a \"prior encounter with a knife\" was unfairly prejudicial and the trial court's instruction could not have cured the damage. The State argues that the knife and previous encounter had nothing to do with any of the offenses charged and would have had no bearing on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The First District Court of Appeals considered a similar scenario and the \"other acts\" analysis, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Dorsey appealed a misdemeanor conviction for possession of criminal tools. Dorsey argued that the trial court erred by admitting the investigator's testimony involving other acts that occurred in the summer of 2010. Dorsey argued the testimony was neither probative of his intent on October 27, 2010, nor was it admitted for any purpose other than an attempt to show Dorsey's general propensity to commit crimes, a purpose specifically prohibited by Evid.R. 404(A) and R.C. 2945.59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 42} The appellate court observed that the only witness at trial, an investigator, testified that in many of the automobile thefts that he had investigated through the years, a screwdriver had been shoved into the stripped steering column and used as the key, and a hammer had been found on the floor board. Further, the investigator also testified, over Dorsey's objection, that he had had contact with Dorsey sometime in the summer of 2010, when he had \"charged\" him with receiving stolen property for being in a stolen automobile with a stripped steering column. The officer admitted on cross-examination that he had not observed Dorsey breaking into an automobile on October 27, 2010, that he was\n   not aware that an automobile theft had been attempted or had occurred on that date, and that he had never known anyone to use a screwdriver or hammer to steal food from a store shelf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The appellate court observed that evidence of other acts, crimes, or wrongs is not admissible to prove the character of a person to show acts in conformity on a particular occasion, but it may be admissible for other purposes, such as those listed in Evid.R. 404(B) and R.C. 2945.59.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 404(A) and (B) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, the appellate court found the challenged testimony was not probative of the statutory inference set forth in R.C. 2923.24(B)(3), because it did not demonstrate the circumstances under which Dorsey possessed the hammer and screwdrivers in late October 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Further, the testimony involved Dorsey's mere presence in a stolen automobile with a stripped steering column one-to-four months before the investigator found him in possession of the hammer and screwdrivers. Dorsey was not \"charged\" with automobile theft at that time and there was no testimony that anyone, including Dorsey, had used a screwdriver or hammer to steal that automobile. At best, the State's theory of relevance involved an impermissible inference upon an inference.\n   <em>\n    Dorsey, supra,\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18 ;\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As such, it was not admissible to demonstrate Dorsey's intent or for any of the purposes recognized in Evid.R. 404(B), especially without any nexus between those facts and Dorsey's possession of the articles in late October 2010. The Dorsey court concluded there was no sound reasoning process to support the trial court's admission of the investigator's testimony. Therefore, the court's decision to admit the challenged testimony was unreasonable and an abuse of discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 47} In this case, we agree with Appellant that the vague description of a \"prior encounter with a knife\" was not\n   probative of his intent on April 5, 2015 and its elicitation was more than likely an attempt to show his general propensity to commit crime. As such, the testimony is forbidden by Evid.R. 404(A) and R.C. 2945.59.

He argues the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that Appellant was the individual responsible for the methamphetamine lab in question. Specifically he argues the evidence that he was hiding in the second bedroom fails to establish any connection between his presence and knowing participation in illegal activity. However, the State contends that the evidence demonstrates that none of the items consistent with the manufacture of methamphetamine were found in any area of the house besides bedroom two, where Appellant was hiding and fumes and gases were being actively omitted pursuant to the one-pot lab.

In evaluating the reliability of scientific evidence, several factors are to be considered: (1) whether the theory or technique has been tested, (2) whether it has been subjected to peer review, (3) whether there is a known or potential rate of error, and (4) whether the methodology has gained general acceptance.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n     at 593-594\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n     113 S.Ct. at 2797\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

The jury also heard testimony that the foil balls containing heroin were found after a physical struggle occurred between Cuffman and the officers. The jury also heard evidence that Cuffman was observed entering and leaving a known drug house after being there for no more than five minutes-typical of a drug transaction-just minutes before he was found with the heroin. The jury also heard evidence of Cuffman's nervous behavior during the stop; specifically, evidence that Cuffman would not remove his left hand from his pocket and later removed the contents of the pocket but tightly cupped the contents in his hand. All of this circumstantial evidence, along with the very close proximity of the drugs to Cuffman's person, could lead a rational trier of fact to conclude that Cuffman constructively possessed the heroin.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    Furthermore, at Weckner's trial, testimony revealed that this vehicle was seen near Weckner's residence on several occasions.
