Williams, appeals from an order of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas sentencing him to a total of nine years incarceration, pursuant to a bench trial verdict, finding appellant guilty of one count of rape with a firearm specification, one count of gross sexual imposition with a firearm specification, one count of kidnapping with a firearm specification, and one count of having a weapon under disability. For the following reasons, we affirm the convictions and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant was indicted on two counts of rape with firearm specifications, one count of gross sexual imposition with a firearm specification, one count of kidnapping with a firearm specification, and one count of having a weapon under disability. The indictment alleged that on May 19, 2015, appellant compelled the victim, J.H., by force to submit to vaginal intercourse, digital vaginal penetration, and sexual contact, and that he restrained J.H.'s liberty for the purpose of committing rape and gross sexual imposition. The indictment further alleged that appellant had a firearm on or about his person or under his control while committing these offenses and displayed, brandished, indicated possession of, or used the firearm to facilitate the offenses. The indictment asserted that appellant was prohibited from possessing or using a firearm because he previously had been adjudicated a delinquent child for having committed the offense of robbery. Appellant waived his right to a jury trial and the charges were tried before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} J.H. testified at trial that she met appellant, whom she knew as \"J.D.,\" shortly before May 19, 2015, and had exchanged text messages with him. A subsequent police report indicated that some of appellant's text messages expressed a desire to have sex with J.H. J.H. testified appellant had asked her age and told her his age. J.H. was 17 years old at the time and told appellant he was too old for her to be romantically interested, but they could be friends. J.H. arranged to meet appellant on May 19, 2015 at the home of appellant's sister-in-law, which was located behind J.H.'s house, to watch a basketball game. J.H. testified she and appellant smoked marijuana and watched the basketball game in the living room. J.H. indicated there were other people in the house at the time, but they were in different rooms. After the basketball game ended, appellant invited J.H. to stay and watch a movie. They went to the basement to select a movie, in a room containing a bed and a television. J.H. testified that while they were picking out a movie to watch, appellant touched her on the thigh; she declined appellant's advances multiple times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} J.H. testified appellant then went to an area near the bed and retrieved a gun. J.H. stated that when appellant leaned over to get the gun, she saw that a second gun was tucked into the front of his pants. J.H. testified one of the guns was silver and black and the other was all black, and she believed the guns were revolvers. Appellant forced J.H. to remove her clothes and told her she was going to have his son. J.H. testified that appellant climbed on top of her and forced his penis into her vagina; he had intercourse with J.H. until he ejaculated. While this was occurring, appellant pointed the gun at J.H.'s head. J.H. testified that when appellant was finished he kept touching her and talking, as though he was trying to explain himself. J.H. put her clothes back on and rushed out of the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} J.H. testified that she ran home and showered because she felt disgusted and wanted the night to be over. J.H.'s mother was home at the time, but J.H. did not want to talk to her about the incident. J.H. told some friends who were waiting at her house what had occurred, and those friends then told J.H.'s mother. J.H. testified that her mother then called police. J.H. indicated that the officer who responded on May 19, 2015 was rude and placed her in the backseat of the cruiser to conduct an interview. J.H. testified that she was not permitted to leave the cruiser. She stated she was very uncomfortable being in the police cruiser and did not want to talk to the officer. J.H. testified\n   that she lied to the officer and told him nothing happened because she was panicking and wanted to be left alone. J.H. testified that her mother called police again the following day and the officer who responded took her to the hospital, where she was examined. J.H. told her story to police officers and a nurse at the hospital. J.H. identified appellant in the courtroom as the man who raped her. On cross-examination, J.H. admitted that when the first responding officer was questioning her in the back of his cruiser, she told him that she felt pressured by appellant but that the sex was consensual. She further testified on cross-examination that she could not recall telling a police detective that appellant retrieved one gun from under the bed and the other from under a pillow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} J.H.'s mother, V.H., testified at trial that J.H. was angry when she returned home on May 19, 2015. V.H. asked what was wrong, but J.H. did not respond and immediately went upstairs and showered. One of J.H.'s friends, who had been waiting for J.H. in her room, told V.H. that J.H. had been raped. After hearing this, V.H. called police. V.H. testified that the responding officer placed J.H. in the back of his cruiser to speak with her, \"treating her like she's a prisoner.\" (Tr. at 17.) V.H. stated that the first officer left without transporting J.H. to the hospital or taking further action. V.H. called police again and complained that the first officer did not respond appropriately. V.H. stated that the next day a detective arrived with two police officers, and that J.H. spoke with a female officer. Officers collected J.H.'s clothing from the prior day and transported her to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The first responding officer was Columbus Division of Police Officer James Braskie. The dash camera recording of Officer Braskie's interview of J.H. in his police cruiser was played for the court. Neither J.H. nor Officer Braskie were visible in the video, but their statements were audible. During the interview, Officer Braskie asked J.H. multiple times whether she felt she was raped, and J.H. answered no. However, J.H. also answered no when asked whether she wanted to have sex with appellant. Although J.H. was not visible in the video, she clearly sounded upset, indicating that she did not want to talk about the incident. At one point, Officer Braskie left J.H. alone in the cruiser and went to call a detective; during that portion of the recording, J.H. could be heard screaming for her mother and asking to be let out of the cruiser. After listening to the recording of the interview at trial, J.H. confirmed that she answered no when Officer Braskie asked if she felt like she had been raped, but also answered no when asked if she wanted to have sex with appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} When V.H. called police on May 20, 2015, Columbus Division of Police Officer Heidi Dripps responded to J.H.'s home. Officer Dripps interviewed J.H. outside the presence of her mother. During the interview, J.H. indicated to Officer Dripps that she had a non-consensual sexual encounter with appellant. After interviewing J.H., Officer Dripps contacted the sexual abuse squad and spoke with a detective who advised her to transport J.H. to the hospital. Columbus Division of Police Officer Michael Cameron (\"Detective Cameron\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that he was a detective in the sexual assault unit in May 2015,\n   and interviewed J.H. after she was transported to the hospital on May 20, 2015. Detective Cameron testified that, in his initial interview with J.H., she told him she had a negative experience with another officer the prior evening. J.H. did not tell Detective Cameron that she denied having been raped when interviewed by Officer Braskie, but rather that Officer Braskie came to her home and refused to help her. Detective Cameron contacted Officer Braskie and then interviewed J.H. a second time; as part of that second interview, he confronted J.H. about her prior statement to Officer Braskie. Detective Cameron testified that he was satisfied with J.H.'s explanation of her prior statement to Officer Braskie. Detective Cameron further testified that testing of the sexual assault examination kit completed at the hospital identified semen and DNA, which was put into the offender database. Detective Cameron stated that another officer showed J.H. a photo lineup containing appellant's photo. J.H. identified appellant as the man who raped her and had an emotional reaction to seeing appellant's photo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} During the first interview with Detective Cameron, J.H. stated that appellant was seated on the bed and reached down beside the bed to retrieve a black handgun from between the mattress and box springs. She told Detective Cameron that appellant placed this gun on his lap, and then pulled another black handgun from under one of the pillows on the bed. J.H. told Detective Cameron that appellant pulled the slide on the second gun, as if to chamber a live round, and pointed it at her. Appellant then ordered J.H. to stand and remove her clothes. He kissed her neck and then pushed her onto the bed. J.H. told Detective Cameron that appellant held the gun to her head while kissing her neck and massaging her breast. Detective Cameron testified that J.H. did not mention appellant having a gun in the waist of his pants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The sexual assault nurse examiner who examined J.H. at the hospital testified she identified tenderness on J.H.'s external genitalia and bruising on her cervix, which were consistent with trauma. The nurse examiner testified that the location of these injuries was consistent with an assailant being on top of J.H. On cross-examination, the nurse examiner testified that these types of injuries could also occur during consensual sex. The nurse examiner's report, which contained the description of the events that J.H. gave to the nurse, was introduced into evidence. That report indicated J.H. told the nurse examiner that she and appellant were watching a movie when appellant grabbed her foot. Appellant then reached between the wall and the table and retrieved a gun; he then retrieved a second gun from under the mattress. Appellant pointed the gun at J.H. and told her to remove her pants. When she refused, he cocked the gun and told her to remove her clothes or he would shoot her. J.H. told the nurse examiner that appellant put the gun to her back and kissed her neck. Appellant pushed her onto the bed, then climbed on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina. Appellant indicated that he had ejaculated. J.H. told the nurse examiner she started crying and then put her clothes on and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Plaintiff-appellee, State of Ohio, and appellant stipulated that forensic scientists from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation identified the presence of semen on vaginal samples collected from J.H. at the hospital, that a DNA profile was extracted from the semen and compared with a known sample from appellant, and it was concluded that appellant's DNA was included in the mixture of DNA present on the vaginal sample. The state and\n   appellant also stipulated that appellant had previously been found to be a delinquent child, having committed the offense of robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} After the state completed its presentation, appellant's trial counsel moved for acquittal under Crim.R. 29. The trial court granted the motion with respect to the second count of the indictment, which asserted rape through digital penetration, finding there was insufficient evidence on that charge. The trial court denied the motion as to all other charges. Appellant's trial counsel introduced into evidence certain portions of the police reports related to the incident, but did not call any witnesses. The trial court found appellant guilty of rape through vaginal intercourse, gross sexual imposition, kidnapping, and having a weapon under disability. The trial court also found appellant guilty of the firearm specifications associated with the rape, gross sexual imposition, and kidnapping charges. The court concluded the kidnapping charge merged with the rape charge for purposes of sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The trial court sentenced appellant to 6 years of mandatory imprisonment on the rape conviction and 3 years of mandatory imprisonment on the firearm specification associated with that charge. The court further sentenced appellant to 17 months imprisonment on the gross sexual imposition conviction and 3 years imprisonment on the weapon under disability conviction. The court provided that the terms for the rape and weapon under disability convictions were to be served consecutively, and concurrently with the term for the gross sexual imposition conviction, for a total sentence of 9 years imprisonment. The court informed appellant he was subject to a mandatory period of 5 years of post-release control and notified him of his sexual offender classification. The court found that appellant was entitled to 20 days of jail-time credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant appeals and assigns the following four assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [I.] THE TRIAL COURT VIOLATED APPELLANT'S RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS AND A FAIR TRIAL WHEN IT ENTERED A JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION BASED ON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE IN VIOLATION OF APPELLANT'S RIGHTS UNDER THE UNITED STATES AND OHIO CONSTITUTIONS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [II.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, CONTRARY TO THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSES OF THE OHIO AND UNITED STATES CONSTITUTIONS, AND CONTRARY TO\n   <em>\n    STATE V.

Weight and sufficiency of the evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions and that the trial court's judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Although appellant purports to challenge both the sufficiency and the weight of the evidence, the majority of his argument centers on the weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"Sufficiency of the evidence is a legal standard that tests whether the evidence introduced at trial is legally sufficient to support a verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Force is defined as \"any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.\" R.C. 2901.01(A)(1). A person acts purposely when it is his \"specific intention to cause a certain result.\" R.C. 2901.22(A). J.H. testified that appellant climbed on top of her and forced his penis into her vagina. She further testified that appellant held a gun to her head during the rape. Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, this evidence, if believed by the trial court, was sufficient to establish the elements of rape as charged in the first count of the indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

For purposes of R.C. 2907.05, \"sexual contact\" means \"any touching of an erogenous zone of another, including * * * if the person is female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.\" R.C. 2907.01(B). Detective Cameron testified that J.H. stated appellant kissed her on the neck and touched her breast while holding a gun to her head. This occurred immediately before appellant raped J.H. Similarly, the sexual assault nurse examiner's report indicated that J.H. stated appellant held the gun against her back and kissed her neck. Although J.H. did not mention appellant kissing her neck or touching her breast\n   during her trial testimony, Detective Cameron's report, containing J.H.'s description of this contact, and the nurse examiner's report were both admitted into evidence. Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, this evidence, if believed by the trial court, was sufficient to establish the elements of gross sexual imposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Restraining an individual's liberty means limiting or restraining their freedom of movement. The restraint need not be for any specific duration or in any specific manner.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18, citing 2 Ohio Jury Instructions, CR Section 505.01(A) (Rev.

Appellant then obtained one of the guns from near the bed and J.H. saw a second gun in appellant's pants. Appellant ordered J.H. to remove her clothes at gunpoint, and he was on top of her with the gun pointed at her head during the rape. She stated, \"I was fighting, but then I couldn't fight no more because I was scared of the gun.\" (Tr. at 47.) J.H.'s testimony established that appellant restrained her liberty for the purpose of committing rape.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant notes that J.H. told Officer Braskie multiple times that she was not raped or forced to have sex, and that her primary concern was whether she would get pregnant.

A warrant was issued as a detainer to the Ross County jail that same day. Appellant\n   entered a not guilty plea in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas on November 6, 2015, and his bond was set at $150,000. The record includes multiple warrants to convey appellant from the Ross County jail to the Franklin County jail for various portions of the proceedings, thus reflecting that appellant was in custody in Ross County at times and in custody in Franklin County at times while this case was proceeding. At sentencing in the present case, on June 28, 2016, appellant's trial counsel informed the court that appellant had not been released from custody by Ross County on June 7, 2016, but continued to be held pursuant to the Franklin County detainer. This formed the basis for the 20-day request for jail-time credit made by appellant's trial counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Appellant argues that he was entitled to 236 days of jail-time credit in the present case, from November 6, 2015, to June 28, 2016, citing the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Failure to call Officer Braskie as a witness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Appellant first argues his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to call Officer Braskie as a witness at trial. Appellant asserts Officer Braskie could have testified that J.H. denied being raped multiple times when he was interviewing her in her house, before the portion of the interview that occurred in his police cruiser. Appellant claims Officer Braskie could have provided additional testimony about J.H.'s demeanor during the interview. Appellant also claims that Officer Braskie could have rebutted J.H.'s testimony regarding his conduct during the interview and her claim that he would not let her out of the police cruiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Generally, counsel's decision whether to call a particular witness falls within the purview of trial strategy, and a reviewing court will not second guess that decision.\n   <em>\n    State v.

No. 09AP-869,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-4734\">\n    2010-Ohio-4734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203834538\">\n    2010 WL 3834538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18. Additionally, \"a defendant is not deprived of effective assistance of counsel when counsel chooses, for strategical reasons, not to pursue every possible trial tactic.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1412080\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/38/305/#p319\">\n    38 Ohio St.3d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 319,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=528%20N.E.2d%20523\">\n    528 N.E.2d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). In this case, the video of Officer Braskie's interview with J.H. was played for the court. Although neither Officer Braskie nor J.H. were visible on the video, the trial court would have been able to make its own evaluation of J.H.'s demeanor based\n   on the audio of her statements on that video. Appellant's counsel cross-examined J.H. about the interview conducted by Officer Braskie and she admitted that she denied having been raped during that interview. While calling Officer Braskie as a witness may have served to reinforce these points, appellant's trial counsel had already raised them for the trial court's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Moreover, assuming for purpose of analysis that appellant's trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to call Officer Braskie to testify, that is only the first step of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel. Appellant must also demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for this failure, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\n   <em>\n    Bradley\n   </em>\n   at paragraph three of the syllabus. \"A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   at 694,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Appellant argues that Officer Braskie \"would have essentially testified J.H. was a liar.\" (Appellant's Brief at 41.) To the extent appellant's defense depended on challenging J.H.'s credibility, appellant's trial counsel pursued this strategy throughout the trial by the cross-examination of J.H. and the prosecution's other witnesses. The trial court was aware of the alleged inconsistencies in J.H.'s description of the events and still found her testimony sufficiently credible to find appellant guilty. Appellant has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that calling Officer Braskie to testify would have changed the trial court's credibility determination and resulted in a different outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Failure to object to trial court questioning witnesses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Appellant next argues his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to object to the trial court asking questions of witnesses, particularly J.H., during a bench trial. Appellant asserts the trial court's questions helped the prosecution in proving its case. Appellant cites the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   decision did not address the scenario of the trial court asking questions when conducting a bench trial. Contrary to appellant's assertion, the concerns identified in\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   do not apply with equal force in that scenario. It is less likely that the trial court would ask an inadmissible question. Similarly, it is unlikely that the trial court's questions would disrupt courtroom decorum or distort the court's own impartiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 50} In the present case, the court asked questions during direct examination of V.H., direct examination and cross-examination of J.H., direct examination of Detective Cameron, and direct examination of the nurse examiner. The trial court's questions appear to have been generally intended to clarify factual issues, such as the following questions posed to J.H.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court: Can you describe the gun for me, please?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [J.H.]: One of them was like a silver and black, and one was all black.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court: Do you know the difference between a revolver and a semiautomatic?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [J.H.]: It's not a semiautomatic.

In this case, the trial court proceeded directly to sentencing after announcing its verdict. Appellant's trial counsel expressed difficulty in transitioning immediately to the sentencing phase. Therefore, his failure to provide additional mitigating evidence may not have been a strategic decision. Assuming for purposes of analysis that appellant's trial counsel performed deficiently, however, appellant must also demonstrate a reasonable probability that the sentence would have been different if additional mitigating evidence was provided. The trial court announced his intention to impose a mid-range sentence, having concluded that the facts in the case were \"pretty egregious.\" (Tr. at 201.) The court initially announced it would impose a ten-year sentence, but after being informed that appellant would not be eligible for judicial release on the rape charge, modified the sentence to a total of nine years. Although appellant claims that his trial counsel could have argued that it was not one of the worst forms of the offense or provided background to establish that appellant was not likely to commit future crimes, the trial court appears to have had a firm position on the appropriate sentence. Under these circumstances, we conclude that appellant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that his sentence would have been different if his trial counsel had provided additional mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Failure to argue that weapon under disability conviction was unconstitutional\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Appellant further argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to challenge the constitutionality of his conviction for having a weapon under disability. Appellant's constitutional argument is based on an extension of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   decision was issued on August 25, 2016. The trial and sentencing in the present case were held on June 27th and 28th, 2016. Thus, the Supreme Court had not decided\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   at the time of appellant's trial and sentencing. Appellant argues, however, that his trial counsel could have objected to preserve a constitutional challenge to the weapon under disability conviction because, prior to his trial, the Supreme Court had accepted jurisdiction over the appeal in\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 55} As explained above,\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   involved a challenge to the constitutionality of R.C. 2901.08(A), whereas appellant was charged with having violated R.C. 2923.13(A)(2). An objection to appellant's conviction under R.C. 2923.13(A)(2) based on the fact that the Supreme Court had taken jurisdiction over the appeal in\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   would have been highly speculative-essentially arguing that the court\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   hold R.C. 2901.08(A) unconstitutional based on reasoning that\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   also apply to R.C. 2923.13(A)(2). Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that appellant's trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to\n   object to the constitutionality of appellant's conviction for having a weapon under disability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Failure to request additional jail-time credit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Appellant claims that his trial counsel also provided ineffective assistance during sentencing by failing to request more than 20 days of jail-time credit. As explained above, we conclude the trial court did not commit plain error by failing to evaluate whether appellant was entitled to jail-time credit for any of the period that he was held subject to the detainer issued by the Franklin County trial court. Our determination is based in large part due to lack of record regarding the Ross County case as well as the factual differences between this case and\n   <em>\n    Fugate\n   </em>\n   . With this in mind, on direct appeal, we cannot say that appellant's trial counsel performed deficiently by requesting only 20 days of jail-time credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Cumulative effect of ineffectiveness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Finally, appellant argues that the cumulative effect of his trial counsel's alleged errors deprived him of his right to a fair trial. However, as explained above, with the exception of the failure to request additional jail-time credit, which is rendered moot by our decision on the merits of that issue, none of appellant's individual claims of ineffective assistance of counsel has merit. Appellant cannot establish that he is entitled to relief simply by combining those unsuccessful claims together.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, at the heart of\n   <em>\n    Apprendi's\n   </em>\n   narrow exception is the concept that the prior conviction was the result of a proceeding in which the defendant had the right to a jury trial and the right to require the prosecutor to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Because, however, the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial is absent from juvenile adjudications,\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   determined that such adjudications could not be included in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi's\n   </em>\n   exception for actual convictions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Given the United States Supreme Court's emphatic pronouncements on the importance of the right to a jury trial, it is logical to conclude that the court meant to limit the prior-conviction exception to prior proceedings that satisfied the jury-trial guarantee.

The court further reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   The right to a jury trial is fundamental to due process just as the right to counsel is fundamental. But in juvenile proceedings, there is no right to a jury because the focus is on rehabilitation rather than punishment. To convert an adjudication into a conviction when the adjudication process did not provide the right to have a jury test the elements of that offense offends due process and\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and thus the state cannot treat a prior juvenile adjudication as a\n   prior conviction to enhance the penalty for a subsequent conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Applying these principles, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that R.C. 2901.08(A), a statute that treated a juvenile adjudication as a conviction for purposes of determining the offense level and sentencing, violated the Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   {\u00b6 66} In this case, Williams was convicted of having a weapon while under disability under R.C. 2923.13. The statute states that \"no person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any firearm\" in a number of circumstances. Relevant here is the prohibition on carrying a firearm if a defendant \"has been convicted of any felony offense of violence or has been adjudicated a delinquent child for the commission of an offense that, if committed by an adult, would have been a felony offense of violence.\" R.C. 2923.13(A)(2). The statute treats a defendant's previous conviction for a violent offense, or a delinquency adjudication of what would have been a violent offense if committed by an adult, as two alternatives to prove the same element of the offense. However, only the first alternative-actual conviction-results from a constitutionally sound process that affords a defendant all the rights to which he is entitled under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. Thus, Williams' conviction under the other element, which requires only a delinquency adjudication resulting from a process that did not include the right to a jury trial, violated his right to due process. In the juvenile court, no \"jury test[ed] the elements of that offense,\" and, under\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   , it cannot be treated as a prior conviction to support an offense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 67} The majority asserts that\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   does not control because it \"was limited solely to the statute treating a prior juvenile adjudication as a prior 'conviction' for purposes of determining the degree or the sentence for a subsequent offense committed as an adult,\" and, here, \"under R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), a prior juvenile adjudication does not result in an enhancement of the degree or potential punishment for an offense; instead, the fact of having been adjudicated a delinquent juvenile is one of the predicates for the offense.\" (Majority Decision at \u00b6 30.)

The United States Supreme Court stated this unequivocally in\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   when explaining\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   : \"In\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   , we held that a fact is by definition an element of the offense and must be submitted to the jury if it increases the punishment above what is otherwise legally\n   prescribed.\"\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   at 2158.\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   as well states that \"facts that expose a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were by definition 'elements' of a separate legal offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   at 483,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p490\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , fn. 10. The equivalency is sound, as it merely emphasizes the foundational principle that every element of a crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Gaudin\n   </em>\n   at 510,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564227\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/506/#p510\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   {\u00b6 69} Because every element must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the burden on the state to convict a defendant for robbery is not equivalent to, and is much heavier than, what it must prove to secure an adjudication of delinquency against a minor. R.C. 2901.08, the statute invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   , and R.C. 2923.13, the weapons while under disability statute, both equated convictions and delinquency adjudications. Thus, I disagree with the majority that\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   is limited to R.C. 2901.08, the statute it invalidated, and I would apply its reasoning to any conviction under R.C. 2929.13 based on a juvenile adjudication. For the foregoing reasons, I would sustain the second assignment of error, vacate Williams' conviction under R.C. 2929.13, and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
