On this record, defendant fails to meet that burden and his counsel's alleged out of court statements are \"dehors the record and beyond review by this Court on direct appeal\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

As we have stated, \"in the typical case it would be better, and in some cases essential, that an appellate attack on the effectiveness of counsel be bottomed on an evidentiary exploration by collateral or post-conviction proceeding brought under CPL 440.10\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Consequently, his challenge on this direct appeal fails to establish that counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.
