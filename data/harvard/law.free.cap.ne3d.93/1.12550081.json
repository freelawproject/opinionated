A jury found Aaron M. Taylor, defendant below and appellant herein, guilty of possession of heroin, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). Appellant assigns the following errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"THE COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT'S REQUEST TO PLEAD GUILTY AS CHARGED.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"THE COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN SENTENCING DEFENDANT TO A HARSHER SENTENCE DUE TO A JURY TRIAL.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On June 5, 2015, an Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper conducted a routine traffic stop of appellant's vehicle. During the stop, the trooper saw marijuana inside the vehicle. A subsequent search uncovered heroin in the vehicle and on appellant's person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Subsequently, an Adams County grand jury returned an indictment that charged appellant with possession of heroin, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). Appellant entered a not guilty plea and the trial court set the case for a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Immediately before the trial began, appellant's counsel informed the court that appellant wished to plead guilty. The court responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   No, we are done with those days where we wait until the last minute and we inconvenience 80 people or 100 people. He wanted a trial, he'll get a trial, but I am not going to, this is not going to be happening in this court any more where for some reason I think there was some late evidence on Friday, discovery since December 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   , we have had multiple hearings, so I don't know, it will be an interesting appealable issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellant's counsel clarified that he did not receive the \"late evidence\" that the court mentioned until 3:00 pm on the last business day (Friday) before the date the trial was set to begin (Monday). Appellant's counsel stated that \"if we had had [the evidence] brought to us earlier it might have been a different story.\" The court nevertheless denied appellant's request to plead guilty. The court did, however, grant appellant's request to prohibit the state from introducing the late evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After hearing the evidence, the jury found appellant guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court considered appellant's criminal history. The court noted that appellant (1) had been convicted of obstructing official business, and (2) had multiple traffic violations (i.e., speeding and seat belt violations, failure to control, failure to maintain an assured clear distance). The court further observed that in 2012, appellant was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and involuntary manslaughter, but due to a technicality (appellant's blood test apparently was misplaced), the case was dismissed with prejudice. Appellant admitted that he was on Methadone at the time of the accident that resulted in the involuntary manslaughter charge and that he continues to use Methadone to treat his addiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} With respect to appellant's current possession of heroin offense, the trial court determined that appellant did not display any remorse. The court also noted that the excluded videotape evidence shows appellant snorting heroin in the back seat of the police cruiser. The judge further pointed out that appellant knew exactly what happened and that the evidence on the videotape should not have been a surprise. The court thus discounted appellant's claim that he could not have made an informed decision whether to plead guilty without the earlier disclosure of the videotape. The court noted that appellant knew exactly what happened, yet decided to proceed to trial and inconvenience jurors-some \"80 people.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trial court additionally expressed its displeasure with the sentencing\n   provisions contained in House Bill 86. The judge informed appellant: \"I think you should go to prison. I think it should be for the maximum, and I think you should get your automatic appellate rights and see what they do.\" The court continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Taylor, you are a master manipulator, I see them all the time in here. But I see few as good as you. You are oblivious, you are self-serving. In order to protect the public from future crimes by you for awhile, and without the ability to send you to prison, to maybe shock your conscience, nothing has ever shocked your conscience. You're in jail for six months, we have a dead man, his family is grieving, and you're lit up on State Route 32 with heroine [sic] and syringes and doing heroine [sic] in the back of the patrol car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court thus sentenced appellant to serve four years of community control, two hundred forty hours of community service, pay a $750 fine, serve one hundred sixty days in county jail, and serve a three-year driver's license suspension. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by denying his request to plead guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Initially, we note that in general a criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to plead guilty.\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, had the trial court exercised its discretion instead of relying upon a fixed policy, we cannot state that the court would have determined to accept appellant's guilty plea. Second, even if the court should have exercised its discretion and accepted appellant's guilty plea, the court would have found him guilty of the same offense as the jury. Appellant would have had the same finding of guilt whether he was found guilty after a jury trial or after the court accepted his plea: appellant would have been found guilty of possession of heroin. Thus, the trial court's failure to exercise its discretion did not affect the outcome of appellant's finding of guilt. Therefore, the error is not prejudicial error, but instead, constitutes harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant nevertheless claims that the court's failure to exercise its discretion and failure to allow him to plead guilty increased the amount of his court costs and caused the court to impose a harsher sentence than it would have imposed if appellant had entered a guilty plea at an earlier stage of the proceedings. We note, however, that the record does not contain any evidence documenting the amount of court costs charged to appellant or the amount that would have been charged if the court had accepted his guilty plea. Moreover, we find it uncertain whether any difference that might exist between the two figures would affect \"substantial rights.\" Furthermore, appellant does not argue that the court would not have ordered him to pay any court costs, if it had accepted his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant also claims that if the court had accepted his plea, he would have received a less severe sentence. Thus, he contends that the sentence that the court imposed acts as punishment for his delayed request to plead guilty and the ensuing jury trial. We discuss this second assertion within appellant's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant's assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In his second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court's sentence is contrary to law. In particular, appellant contends that the court imposed a harsher sentence as punishment for appellant's failure to plead guilty before\n   a jury had been summoned, and thus, reflects vindictiveness. Appellant claims that the trial court would have imposed a less severe sentence if the court had accepted appellant's guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 21} R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) defines appellate review of felony sentences and provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The court hearing an appeal under division (A), (B), or (C) of this section shall review the record, including the findings underlying the sentence or modification given by the sentencing court.

Instead, our review of the sentencing hearing transcript reveals that the court considered a multitude of factors when it imposed appellant's sentence. The court examined appellant's criminal history and suggested that appellant has a deep-rooted substance abuse problem and indicated that he actually deserves prison time. However, the court noted that the sentencing statutes prohibit it from imposing prison time for appellant's drug possession offense and it expressed its extreme displeasure with this prohibition. While the court did mention that appellant inconvenienced jurors by failing to plead guilty at an earlier point in the proceedings, we believe that the overall context of the sentencing hearing demonstrates that the trial court was most disturbed by appellant's cavalier attitude and his past criminal charges. In sum, we find nothing in the record to indicate that the court acted vindictively when it imposed appellant's sentence, or that the court sought to punish appellant for deciding to plead guilty on the date of trial. The court may have been vehement, but it was not vindictive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Additionally, appellant cannot possibly know what sentence the trial court may have imposed if it had accepted his guilty plea on the day of trial. The record does not contain any evidence of a plea agreement between the state and appellant outlining an agreed-upon sentence or the court's indication of intent to impose a particular sentence. Thus, even if the court had accepted appellant's guilty plea, it may have imposed the precise sentence it imposed after the jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellant also argues that the sentence the court imposed is not consistent with other sentences imposed in similar cases. He points to a prior Adams County possession of heroin case where the court sentenced the defendant to two years of community control, one hundred eighty hours of community service, and a six month license suspension. Appellant claims that this type of sentence \"is the normal and customary sentence that has\n   been handed out by the trial court in recent cases.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 29} R.C. 2929.11(B) states that a felony sentence should be, inter alia, \"consistent with sentences imposed for similar crimes committed by similar offenders.\" We recently observed that \" '[a] consistency-in-sentencing determination * * * is a fact-intensive inquiry that does not lend itself to being initially reviewed at the appellate level.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.
