For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Mount Carmel owns and operates multiple hospitals in the Columbus area, including Mount Carmel West. On February 1, 2012, Mount Carmel contracted with Consultant Anesthesiologists, Inc. (\"CAI\"), a medical practice group, to provide professional anesthesiology services at Mount Carmel West (hereinafter the \"Services Agreement\"). The Services Agreement stated that all the anesthesiologists CAI selected to practice at Mount Carmel West would be subject to Mount Carmel's approval, and that Mount Carmel approved all of the CAI anesthesiologists currently practicing at Mount Carmel West. Among those approved physicians was Long, an anesthesiologist who CAI employed under a contract. Long was a member of the Mount Carmel West medical staff and had privileges at Mount Carmel West. After Mount Carmel and CAI executed the Services Agreement, Long practiced anesthesiology at Mount Carmel West pursuant to that contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In early April 2012, Mount Carmel removed Long from the Mount Carmel\n   West campus. Melissa W. Fleming, assistant general counsel at Mount Carmel, explained Mount Carmel's reasons for removing Long in an April 5, 2012 letter to Brandi Kondracke, CAI's chief executive officer. Fleming stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Sometime during the month of March 2012, Dr. Long took photographs on his cell phone of a Mount Carmel nursing employee, [A.M.],\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the OR while [A.M.] was bending over a patient on the OR table. Dr. Long then proceeded to send the photographs via text messaging to other members of your practice as well as show other Mount Carmel staff the photographs on his phone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   In mid-March, * * * [another CAI anesthesiologist] showed [A.M. and another nurse] another picture of [A.M.] that had been texted to him by Dr. Long and this photograph showed [A.M.'s] side exposed as she reached over a patient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Both physicians were instructed by the Chairman of the Anesthesia Department as well as the Anesthesia Medical Director earlier this week to cease the behavior and have no further communications with [A.M.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition, Dr. Long has been reported to have walked into an OR on April 3rd, and in front of everyone in the room, stated that he would have had a bad day if he had been assigned in the next OR because, \"that bitch\" (referring to [A.M.] ) is in the other room. * * * [T]his retaliation creates an uncomfortable work environment for all of the staff in the OR which leads to potential compromise in patient safety; therefore, Mount Carmel is removing Dr. Long effective immediately pending further investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Apr. 5, 2012 letter from Fleming to Kondracke, attached to Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Fleming also informed Kondracke that Mount Carmel had not yet completed its investigation into Long's actions. Fleming requested a meeting with Kondracke to discuss the situation, and she promised to provide Kondracke with the results of Mount Carmel's investigation prior to the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Melissa Stacy-Cull, the director of surgical services at Mount Carmel West, investigated Long's conduct. Stacy-Cull interviewed A.M., as well as other members of the nursing staff. Stacy-Cull neither viewed the photographs at issue nor spoke with Long or the physician who received the photographs from Long. At the conclusion of her investigation, Stacy-Cull drafted a report, dated April 11, 2012, that generally confirmed the conduct described in the April 5, 2012 letter. Mount Carmel sent a copy of the report to Kondracke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Mount Carmel representatives met with CAI representatives on April 13, 2012 to discuss Long. Prior to the meeting, Sean McKibben, president and chief operating officer of Mount Carmel West, and Larry Swanner, vice president of medical affairs at Mount Carmel West, had decided to permanently bar Long from practicing at Mount Carmel West. McKibben announced Mount Carmel's decision at the meeting. Thomas Englehart, CAI's then president, asked the Mount Carmel representatives to consider giving Long a second chance given the long length and high quality of Long's service at Mount Carmel West. Mount Carmel declined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Pursuant to Long's employment contract with CAI, Long was required to\n   \"devote his * * * full time and attention to the performance of professional services for\" CAI and \"be responsible for providing on call coverage.\" (July 21, 2009 Employment Agreement at Section 3, attached to the Compl.) Once Mount Carmel removed Long from Mount Carmel West, he could no longer perform those contractual duties. Consequently, CAI terminated Long's employment agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On October 24, 2013, Long filed suit against Mount Carmel, alleging claims for breach of contract and tortious interference with contract, and seeking a declaratory judgment. In his complaint and amended complaint, Long asserted that Mount Carmel failed to follow the process set forth in the Services Agreement regarding CAI physicians with alleged performance or behavior issues. Section 4.2 of the Services Contract provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (i) Should issues of performance or behavior with any of the Providers arise which, at the reasonable discretion of [Mount Carmel], affects the immediate safety of patients, staff or members of the Hospital's Medical Staff, or otherwise gives rise to a summary suspension action under the Medical Staff Bylaws, [Mount Carmel] shall immediately remove Provider from Hospital and provide written notice of such issues to Contractor and the affected Provider as set forth below in (iii) within twenty-four (24) hours of the removal (a \"Provider Adverse Act\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (iii) If [Mount Carmel] believes a Provider Adverse Act has occurred, [Mount Carmel] shall provide Contractor and Provider with a written notice describing Hospitals' concerns in sufficient enough detail to enable Contractor and Provider to assess the gravity of the situation (the \"Notice\"). Such Notice shall be given within two (2) business days (within 24 hours if the Adverse Act arises under subsection (i)) of the day when the Hospital learns of the Provider Adverse Act. Within two (2) business days of the Notice [Mount Carmel], Contractor and Provider (should Provider desire to do so) shall meet to review the pertinent information and discuss a resolution of [Mount Carmel]' s concerns (the \"Meeting\"). Prior to such Meeting, [Mount Carmel] shall provide Contractor and Provider with all reasonable information requested by such parties related to the alleged Provider Adverse Act. Within 3 business days from the Meeting, Contractor's President, or his/her designee, a senior executive of [Mount Carmel] designated by [Mount Carmel] and Provider shall work to mutually resolve the issues caused by the Provider Adverse Act. In the event the parties are unable to resolve the issues to the satisfaction of [Mount Carmel] within this time period, Contractor shall remove such Provider from providing the Services during further investigation which in all events shall be concluded within 30 days of the Meeting. If at the end of the 30 days from the Meeting the issue is not resolved by mutual agreement, [Mount Carmel] will issue to Contractor a decision on whether or not the Provider may return to Hospital(s) to provide Services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Feb. 1, 2012 Agreement for Anesthesia Services, attached to Mount Carmel's Mot. for Summ. Jgmt.) Long alleged that Mount Carmel breached Section 4.2 when it failed to: (1) provide him with any notice, (2) include him in the April 13 meeting, and (3) work with him to mutually resolve the issues caused by his alleged misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Long also asserted in his complaint that Mount Carmel's actions breached the Medical Staff Bylaws, which are the\n   rules, policies, and procedures governing the medical staff of Mount Carmel West. Long alleged that the Medical Staff Bylaws entitled him to certain protections, including notice and a hearing, which Mount Carmel denied him. Finally, with regard to his claim for tortious interference with contract, Long claimed that Mount Carmel's refusal to allow him to practice at Mount Carmel West improperly interfered with his employment contract with CAI. Long contended that, due to Mount Carmel's decision to bar him from Mount Carmel West, he could not perform his duties under the employment contract and CAI terminated the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 10} After conducting discovery, both parties moved for summary judgment. In a judgment dated June 17, 2016, the trial court granted Mount Carmel's motion and denied Long's motion. Long timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Long assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [1.] The trial court erred in finding Dr. Long was not an intended third-party beneficiary of the Agreement for Anesthesia Services between CAI and [Mount Carmel].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [2.] The trial court erred in finding [Mount Carmel] did not breach the services agreement between CAI and [Mount Carmel].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [3.] The trial court erred in finding [Mount Carmel] did not violate Dr. Long's rights under the Bylaws (Ex[.] 9) by violating his rights under Ex[.] 2 (contract) and Ex[.] 10-5, HR procedures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [4.] The trial court erred in finding [Mount Carmel] is entitled to Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's tortious interference with contract claim and in denying Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [5.] The trial court erred in finding [Mount Carmel] is entitled to Summary Judgment on Dr. Long's due process and equal protection claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [6.] The trial court erred in finding Dr. Long is not entitled to Declaratory Judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [7.] The trial court erred in finding [Mount Carmel] is entitled to Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's malice and punitive damages claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Each of Long's assignments of error challenge the trial court's ruling on the parties' motions for summary judgment. A trial court must grant summary judgment under Civ.R. 56 when the moving party demonstrates that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion when viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    Hudson v.

Our conclusion that Long cannot sue for breach of the Services Agreement renders moot the question of whether Mount Carmel committed a breach of that contract. Consequently, we find Long's second assignment of error moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Third Assignment of Error-Bylaws\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In his third assignment of error, Long argues that the trial court erred in finding that Mount Carmel did not violate Long's rights under the Medical Staff Bylaws. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 21} As we stated above, the Bylaws are the rules, policies, and procedures governing the medical staff of Mount Carmel West. The Bylaws specify the process for taking corrective action against, suspending, or terminating a medical staff member's appointment and/or privileges. Additionally, pursuant to the Bylaws, the medical executive committee may adopt, with the approval of Mount Carmel's board, policies to implement the general principals set forth in the Bylaws and for proper conduct of the medical staff. Long argues that Mount Carmel violated his rights under the Bylaws when it did not follow one such policy, entitled \"Disruptive Behavior,\" when responding to his alleged misconduct. Long also argues that Mount Carmel violated his rights under the Bylaws when it failed to comply with the process set forth in Section 4.2 of the Services Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On appeal, Long focuses on establishing that the alleged Bylaws violations actually occurred. Long, however, fails to point to any law that transforms the provisions of the Bylaws into legally protectable rights. If Mount Carmel owes Long no legal obligation to comply with the Bylaws, then Long cannot recover in a court of law for their violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alley v.

The Bylaws, however, provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Not a Contract\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : These Bylaws are not intended to and shall not create any contractual rights between the Hospital and any Practitioner.

Although Long argues he has presented evidence that Mount Carmel acted maliciously and therefore should be held liable for its interference with his contract with CAI, he does not challenge the underlying facts that indisputably formed the basis of Mount Carmel excluding him from its campus. Furthermore, considering Long derived no legal rights under Mount Carmel's contract with CAI, we are unpersuaded by his assertion that Mount Carmel acted maliciously by not providing him notice and a hearing under that contract before reaching its final decision to exclude him from Mount Carmel West. Because Long cannot demonstrate that Mount Carmel acted maliciously, the trial court did not err in its disposition of his tortious interference with contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Accordingly, we overrule Long's fourth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Those factors are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (a) the nature of the actor's conduct,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (b) the actor's motive,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (c) the interests of the other with which the actor's conduct interferes,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (d) the interests sought to be advanced by the actor,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (e) the social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the actor and the contractual interests of the other,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (f) the proximity or remoteness of the actor's conduct to the interference and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (g) the relations between the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, Section 767 (1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Importantly, the factors now used to determine whether a defendant has engaged in improper conduct largely mirror those considerations previously used to decide whether a defendant's conduct was privileged.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Restatement of the Law, Torts, Factors in Determining Privilege, Section 767\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, Factors in Determining Whether Interference Is Improper, Section 767. This is logical, as contemporary law has merely switched the burden of pleading and proving justification from the defendant, who once had the burden of establishing a privilege, to the plaintiff, who now has the burden of showing improper conduct. Although the burden shifted, the considerations underlying it remain the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 37} In shaping the tort of intentional interference with contract, the Supreme Court did not ignore the specific, established qualified privileges, such a fair competition, that developed under the traditional construction of the tort. Rather, the Supreme Court accommodated and continued certain former qualified privileges, which are set out in Sections 768 to 773 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. Where a defendant's conduct falls within the one of the special situations dealt with in Sections 768 to 773, a factfinder need not balance the factors set forth in Section 767 to determine if the conduct is improper.\n   <em>\n    Fred Siegel\n   </em>\n   at 179,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=707%20N.E.2d%20853\">\n    707 N.E.2d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Kenty\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fred Siegel\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court endorsed the modern construction of the tort, which makes consideration of justification (or the lack thereof) a prima facie element. However, in the period between the issuance of\n   <em>\n    Kenty\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fred Siegel\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Ohio appeared to revert to the traditional privilege formulation of the tort.\n   <em>\n    A &amp; B-Abell Elevator Co. v. Columbus/Cent. Ohio Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1740145\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/73/1/#p14\">\n    73 Ohio St.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=651%20N.E.2d%201283\">\n    651 N.E.2d 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) (stating that the tort of interference with contract occurs \"when a person, without a privilege to do so, induces or otherwise purposely causes a third person * * * not to perform a contract with another\"). Confusingly,\n   <em>\n    A &amp; B-Abell\n   </em>\n   did not mention, much less overrule,\n   <em>\n    Kenty\n   </em>\n   .

The majority decision, however, applies the formulation of the tort laid out in\n   <em>\n    A &amp; B-Abell\n   </em>\n   . Under that formulation, to avoid liability, the defendant must raise a qualified privilege, which the plaintiff may overcome by showing that the defendant acted with actual malice.\n   <em>\n    A &amp; B-Abell\n   </em>\n   at 14,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=651%20N.E.2d%201283\">\n    651 N.E.2d 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"Actual malice\" is defined as \"an unjustified or improper interference.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Walter v.

Thus, in the majority decision, justification is not a prima facie element of the tort, but rather, part of the privilege analysis.

The trial court concluded that Mount Carmel's actions were not improper without acknowledging, much less considering, the necessary factors. A determination of whether the alleged interference is improper requires \"an appraisal of the several factors and an evaluation of their comparative weight.\" Restatement, Section 767, Comment a. Thus, a trial court errs if it grants summary judgment without considering each of the factors set forth in Section 767.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Paramount Farms Internatl., LLC v.
