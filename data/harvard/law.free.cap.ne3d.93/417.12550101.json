Here, as quoted above, the text of the casino amendment expressly cites economic development and regulation of gaming to insure the integrity of casino gaming as important purposes served by the amendment. At the same time, the amendment limits the universe of casino gaming to four specific locations in the state. Appellant conceded at oral argument that a location restriction does not violate the equal protection clause if such a restriction serves a legitimate governmental purpose. Here, only four cities and locales are allowed to have casinos, and while there may be other locations in Ohio that would like to have a casino, appellees argue that this location restriction satisfies rational-basis review as it regulates gaming and protects the health and welfare of the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Because the state, as part of its police power, could, and at one time did, outlaw casino gambling altogether, it is permissible for the government to take the less inclusive step of allowing the conduct but reducing the demand through restrictions.\n   <em>\n    Posadas de Puerto Rico Assocs. v.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Artichoke Joe's California Grand Casino\n   </em>\n   at 718, a California amendment limited casino location to \"Indian lands\" and restricted casino ownership to \"Indian tribes.\" The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that such a preference did not violate the equal protection clause even though it granted Indian tribes a monopoly on certain types of gaming. The court held that the amendment was rationally related to the goals of encouraging tribal autonomy and economic development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In\n   <em>\n    Northville Downs\n   </em>\n   at 587, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the Michigan Constitution that limited casino gambling to three casinos in Detroit was rationally related to the economic goal of revitalizing Detroit with casino gambling and the state's legitimate interest in regulating gambling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Hope for Families &amp; Community Serv. v. Warren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089320\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/721/1079/#p1150\">\n    721 F.Supp.2d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1150 (M.D. Ala. 2010), the effect of the regulations at issue was to allow only four bingo licenses and grant a monopoly over electronic bingo operations. Nevertheless, the court held that regulation of gaming to protect the health, safety or welfare of its citizens was a legitimate government interest as was economic development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellant is essentially arguing that everyone must be permitted to operate a casino or no one can. Appellant relies on\n   <em>\n    Craigmiles v. Giles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9315463\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/220/\">\n    312 F.3d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2002) for the proposition that economic protectionism cannot survive equal protection scrutiny. In\n   <em>\n    Craigmiles\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a Tennessee statute that prohibited the sale of caskets by anyone other than a state-licensed funeral director failed rational basis review because the statute's only purpose was to protect a discrete interest group (funeral directors) from economic competition, and that was not a legitimate state interest.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 224. Businesses that sold caskets but did not provide funeral services were effectively cut off from competition. However, where a provision does not, on its face, protect a discrete interest group from economic competition,\n   <em>\n    Craigmiles\n   </em>\n   does not apply.\n   <em>\n    Northville Downs\n   </em>\n   at 587.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 32} \"Where there exists an appropriate connection to the state's police power, even the grant of a monopoly does not, in itself, offend equal protection principles.\"\n   <em>\n    Artichoke Joe's\n   </em>\n   at 736. Here, the state has\n   set forth the legitimate governmental interests of regulating gaming and pursuing economic development by limiting where casinos may be located to four locations in the state and further requiring that no fewer than two licensed casino operators can operate the state's casinos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 33} While one effect of the amendment may be to protect the current license holders from additional competition, that is not the only basis for the amendment. The appellees have shown that the state seeks to regulate gambling to promote the public welfare, while at the same time to allow casino gambling to encourage economic development within the state. This is a proper exercise of the state's police power and the two rationales are legitimate governmental interests. Thus, under a rational basis review, appellant has failed to negate every conceivable basis that might support the casino amendment and related legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Accordingly, the first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Privileges and Immunities Clause Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 35} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that he has stated a claim for a violation of the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Appellant contends that by quoting the Fourteenth Amendment in the seventeenth claim in his amended complaint, incorporating the facts alleged in the statement of facts, and alleging that the grant of monopoly violates the Fourteenth Amendment, he has sufficiently pled a violation of the privileges and immunities clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 1, prohibits the states from making laws which would abridge \"the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\" Appellant acknowledges that the\n   <em>\n    Slaughter-House Cases\n   </em>\n   , 83 U.S. (16 Wall) 36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"411261\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/83/36/\">\n    21 L.Ed. 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1872), restricted the coverage of this clause to only those rights peculiar to being a citizen of the federal government, and that it does not protect those rights which relate only to state citizenship. Appellant argues that the fact that this clause is largely dormant does not preclude an argument that the clause could be applicable given Justice Thomas' pronouncements on the applicability of the clause in\n   <em>\n    Saenz v. Roe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133435\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/489/#p521\">\n    526 U.S. 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 521,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133435\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/489/#p521\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133435\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/489/#p521\">\n    143 L.Ed.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (Thomas, dissenting). Thus, appellant seeks to preserve the issue in the event this case eventually reaches the United States Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Appellees argue that the court of common pleas correctly dismissed the alleged claim under the privileges and immunities clause for three reasons. First, the seventeenth claim in the amended complaint is titled \"grant of monopoly,\" and merely argues that the Casino Amendment violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 118-21.) This is the reason the trial court gave for dismissing the claim. (Sept. 26, 2016 Decision &amp; Entry at 9, n. 5.) Appellees argue that simply quoting the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment is insufficient to provide notice that appellant is relying on the privileges and immunities clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Second, even though appellant asserted before the Supreme Court of Ohio that he had standing to allege claims under the privileges and immunities clause and the equal protection clause, the Supreme Court of Ohio clearly and specifically restricted appellant's claim on remand to the equal protection claim. The Supreme Court of Ohio stated: \"We specifically reverse the Tenth District's judgment only to the extent that it affirms the trial\n   court's dismissal of Kinsey's equal protection claim, and we remand to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings on that claim.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
