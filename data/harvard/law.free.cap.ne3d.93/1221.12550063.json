We reverse the judgment in part, upon our determination\n   that the court abused its discretion in overruling the motion without first conducting an evidentiary hearing on West's claim of actual innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 1990, West was indicted on eight counts of rape. The offenses were alleged to have occurred between 1984 and 1987. The alleged victim, West's son Jason, was during those years, under the age of 13. Jason reported the offenses in 1989. But West had left the country in 1988 and did not learn of the indictment until late 1990. West then waived extradition, but the Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney did not seek to extradite him, and his finances prevented him from returning to the United States until May 1997.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In February 1998, West entered guilty pleas to four reduced charges of sexual battery and was sentenced to agreed concurrent terms of confinement of two years on each count. In the same proceeding, West also entered guilty pleas to three counts of intimidation, charged in a separate indictment in the case numbered B-9800303. For the intimidation offenses, the court imposed consecutive four-to-ten-year prison terms, suspended those sentences, and placed West on probation for five years, beginning upon his release from prison on the sexual-battery charges. Three days later, the trial court adjudicated West an habitual sexual offender under the version of R.C. Chapter 2950, Ohio's sex-offender-classification statutes, in effect from 1996 to 2007, commonly known as \"Megan's Law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.Sub.H.B. No. 180, 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2560, amended in 2003 by Am.Sub.S.B. No. 5, 150 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 6556.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In his direct appeal, we affirmed West's convictions, but reversed his habitual-sexual-offender adjudication.\n   <em>\n    State v.

On remand, the trial court determined that West was a sexually-oriented offender, requiring him to register annually as a sex offender for a period of ten years following his release from prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In September 2015, West filed with the common pleas court a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas, along with a motion to appoint counsel to assist him in withdrawing his pleas, on the grounds that his trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective in advising him to plead, and that he is actually innocent of sexual battery. In this appeal, he advances a single assignment of error, contending that the common pleas court abused its discretion in overruling his motion to withdraw his pleas without a hearing. The challenge is well taken in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Common Pleas Court's Jurisdiction to Entertain the Motion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} West did not designate in his motion a statute or rule under which he sought relief. But he argues on appeal that he was entitled to relief under Crim.R. 32.1. Thus, on his postsentence motion to withdraw his guilty pleas, West bore the burden of demonstrating that withdrawing his pleas was necessary \"to correct manifest injustice.\" Crim.R. 32.1 ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court acknowledged the doctrine of the law of the case, noting that \"[t]he judgment of the reviewing court is controlling upon the lower court as to all matters within the compass of the judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 97,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20N.E.2d%20162\">\n    378 N.E.2d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the court granted the writ upon the \"general rule\" that an appeal from a judgment of conviction divests a trial court of jurisdiction over the case, unless the appellate court remands the case to the trial court for a ruling on a pending motion, or the trial court's exercise of jurisdiction is in aid of the appeal or is otherwise \"not inconsistent with [the jurisdiction] of the appellate court to review, affirm, modify or reverse the appealed judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 97,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20N.E.2d%20162\">\n    378 N.E.2d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    In re Kurtzhalz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1028088\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/141/432/\">\n    141 Ohio St. 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20N.E.2d%20657\">\n    48 N.E.2d 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1943), paragraph two of the syllabus.

The claims could not be said to have been within the compass of this court's judgment affirming West's convictions in his direct appeal. Nor would a judgment by the common pleas court granting withdrawal be inconsistent with our judgment affirming his convictions. Consequently, our judgment would not, under the doctrine of the law of the case, operate to bar West's ineffective-counsel and actual-innocence claims. And it did not, under the rule of\n   <em>\n    Special Prosecutors\n   </em>\n   , deprive the common pleas court of jurisdiction to entertain those claims as presented in West's postsentence Crim.R. 32.1 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Accordingly, we hold that the common pleas court had jurisdiction to entertain the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     West's Crim.R. 32.1 Motion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Turning to West's challenge on appeal to the overruling of his Crim.R. 32.1 motion, we note that a counseled knowing, voluntary, and intelligent guilty plea constitutes a complete admission of the facts underlying the charged offense and thus effectively removes from the case any issue concerning the defendant's factual guilt of the offense.

The common pleas court, in deciding that issue, and this court, in assessing that decision, need not decide whether West's counsel had a duty to inform him that his Ohio sexual-battery convictions would subject him to a lifetime sex-offender-registration requirement in Florida. Even if the circumstances could be said to have given rise to such a duty, West did not demonstrate a deficiency in his counsel's performance in that regard, when he failed to support his motion with any evidence showing that counsel had failed to so inform him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The record may also be said to suggest that West would not have pled if he had known of Florida's lifetime registration requirement, because at his sex-offender hearing, conducted three days after he had entered his guilty pleas, he orally moved to withdraw his guilty pleas on the ground that his trial counsel had failed to advise him that he would be subject to Ohio's ten-year sex-offender-registration requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 28} West assigned as error in his direct appeal the overruling of that motion, and we held that the court had not abused its discretion.

Implicit in the common pleas court's judgment denying West relief under Crim.R. 32.1 upon his ineffective-counsel claim is the court's determination that West had failed to sustain his burden of demonstrating an outcome-determinative deficiency in his counsel's performance resulting in a manifest injustice. In the absence of some evidence that West's trial counsel did not advise him concerning Florida's sex-offender registration requirement, we can only concur in that assessment.

We, therefore, conclude that the court abused its discretion in denying relief under Crim.R. 32.1 on that ground without first conducting an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In support of his actual-innocence claim, West offered the affidavit of his son Jason West, who averred that he had \"NEVER been molested and/or touched in any form, type or manner sexually by [his] father,\" and that he had \"NEVER\" witnessed \"speech or behavior * * * of [his father] indicat[ing] any type, form or manner of any sexual interest in [him].\" Thus, West's actual-innocence claim may fairly be read to allege that his guilty pleas were not voluntarily entered, because he had felt compelled to accept a plea agreement offering reduced charges and agreed sentences based on his fear that his son would falsely testify against him and he would be convicted of multiple counts of rape if he insisted on going to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Throughout the proceedings resulting in his convictions, West consistently maintained that he was innocent of any sex offense involving his son. At the hearing on his motion to dismiss his rape indictment on speedy-trial grounds, West stated that when he learned that there was a \"warrant out for [his] arrest, on charges that [he] was not guilty of * * * [he] wanted to go back [to the United States] and clear [his] name.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 33} At West's plea hearing, the assistant prosecuting attorney stated that Jason West, who was by then an adult, was present at the hearing, and that Jason and his mother had \"both indicated that [the plea agreement was] a satisfactory way to resolve the case.\" But West expressed discomfort with pleading guilty to sexual battery and persisted in proclaiming his innocence. When asked during the Crim.R. 11 colloquy whether he had been \"forced\" or \"threatened\" to plead, West responded, \"No,\" but only after stating, \"Well, it seems I'm under the-either I go to trial and be framed or accept the plea.\" And when asked for his plea to the first sexual-battery count, he responded, \"Guilty,\" but only after stating, \"Well, I never molested my son, but I'm forced-.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Before he was sentenced, West again insisted that he \"didn't molest [his] son.\" He then went on to affirm his understanding of his guilty pleas, but added that \"circumstances here force me to enter this plea rather than stand trial and risk being wrongfully convicted on bad faith charges that carry severe penalties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Three days later, at his sex-offender hearing, West orally moved to withdraw his guilty pleas. He alleged not only that his trial counsel had misinformed him about Megan's Law, but that his pleas had been \"the result of coercion and intimidation, pressure, threats, et cetera, an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 36} West continued to proclaim his innocence in his direct appeal.

He also submitted, and we overruled, an assignment of error challenging his guilty pleas on the grounds that they were not voluntary, that trial counsel had been ineffective\n   in advising him to plead, and that he is actually innocent. We held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in accepting West's guilty pleas, because the record supported a determination that, despite his protestations of innocence, his pleas had been voluntary and intelligent, when he had been represented by competent counsel, had pled to reduced charges with agreed sentences, and had understood the nature of those charges.\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1060060\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/134/45/\">\n    134 Ohio App.3d at 49-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=730%20N.E.2d%20388\">\n    730 N.E.2d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v.

But the court has the discretion to judge the credibility of an affidavit without first conducting an evidentiary hearing on the motion. In assessing an affidavit's credibility, and thus determining the need for a hearing, the court must consider all relevant factors, including (1) whether the judge reviewing the motion also presided at the plea hearing, (2) whether multiple affidavits contain nearly identical language or otherwise appear to have been drafted by the same person, (3) whether the affidavit contains or relies on hearsay, (4) whether the affiant is related to the defendant or otherwise interested in the success of his efforts, (5) whether the affidavit contradicts defense evidence, (6) whether the affidavit is contradicted by any other sworn statement of the affiant, and (7) whether the affidavit is internally inconsistent.\n   <em>\n    Mynatt\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

But the common pleas court judge who reviewed West's Crim.R. 32.1 motion had not presided at his plea hearing. Jason West's affidavit was internally consistent, based on first-hand knowledge, and corroborative of West's constant and consistent protestations of innocence. While he is related to West, Jason West was also the alleged victim of the sexual-battery offenses to which West had pled guilty, and his interest would logically have lain with opposing, rather than supporting, the withdrawal of those pleas. And there is nothing in the record that would suggest that Jason had any other interest in West's success on his motion to withdraw, beyond remedying an injustice. We, therefore, conclude that the common pleas court abused its discretion in discounting the credibility of Jason West's affidavit without first conducting a hearing.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dye\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.
