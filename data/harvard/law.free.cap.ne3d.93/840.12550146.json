L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. Miranda, who has been convicted in the Superior Court of certain drug-related offenses, filed a motion to intervene in a separate criminal case also pending in the Superior Court at that time, apparently seeking to participate in postconviction discovery that was proceeding in that case. After a hearing, the motion was denied. Miranda's petition sought relief from that denial. As there is no basis in the Rules of Criminal Procedure or other law for a defendant to intervene in another defendant's unrelated criminal case, Miranda cannot show that relief in the nature of certiorari is necessary \"to correct [a] substantial error of law apparent on the record.\"\n     <em>\n      State Bd. of Retirement\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      Woodward\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783868\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/698/#p703\">\n      446 Mass. 698\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 703,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20N.E.2d%20298\">\n      847 N.E.2d 298\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2006).

Moreover, Mass. R. Crim.

The single justice neither erred nor abused his discretion by denying relief.\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
