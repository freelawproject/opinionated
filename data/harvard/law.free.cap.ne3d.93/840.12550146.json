L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. Miranda, who has been convicted in the Superior Court of certain drug-related offenses, filed a motion to intervene in a separate criminal case also pending in the Superior Court at that time, apparently seeking to participate in postconviction discovery that was proceeding in that case. After a hearing, the motion was denied. Miranda's petition sought relief from that denial. As there is no basis in the Rules of Criminal Procedure or other law for a defendant to intervene in another defendant's unrelated criminal case, Miranda cannot show that relief in the nature of certiorari is necessary \"to correct [a] substantial error of law apparent on the record.\" <em>State Bd. of Retirement</em> v. <em>Woodward</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783868\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/698/#p703\">446 Mass. 698</extracted-citation>, 703, <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20N.E.2d%20298\">847 N.E.2d 298</extracted-citation> (2006).

The single justice neither erred nor abused his discretion by denying relief.</p><p id=\"p-9\"><em>Judgment affirmed</em>.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
