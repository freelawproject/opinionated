He raises four assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas erred when it classified Edwin Golson as a Tier II sex offender registrant, as defined in R.C. 2950.01(F)(1), because the application of the adult registration requirements of R.C. Chapter 2950 to juvenile offenders creates an unconstitutional irrebuttable presumption in violation of the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 2 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas erred when it classified Edwin Golson as a Tier II sex offender registrant, as defined in R.C. 2950.01(F)(1), because the application of adult registration requirements of R.C. Chapter 2950 to juvenile offenders constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 9 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   3. Edwin Golson was denied the effective assistance of counsel when trial counsel failed to object to the imposition of an adult classification on a juvenile offender. Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; Ohio Constitution, Article I, Sections 9 and 10.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   4. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas erred when it failed to credit\n   Edwin Golson with time served in connection with his offense pursuant to R.C. 2929.19 and R.C. 2967.191 in violation of the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 2 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We find some merit to the appeal, affirm the trial court's judgment in part, reverse it in part, and remand the case to the trial court to grant Golson 308 days of jail-time credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Golson was charged in the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court with one count of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), one count of kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), one count of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), one count of aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(3), and one count of robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). Golson was 17 years old at the time the offenses were committed, and the state filed a motion to transfer the case to the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, General Division (\"adult criminal court\" or \"common pleas court\") pursuant to the discretionary bindover provision set forth in R.C. 2152.12(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In accordance with R.C. 2152.12(B), the court held a probable cause hearing. The victim, T.M.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that Golson attacked her on the night of August 24, 2015, while she was walking to MetroHealth Hospital to visit a family member. As T.M. was walking eastbound on Storer Avenue toward West 25th Street, she observed Golson, whom she knew from the neighborhood, riding a bicycle on the other side of the street. Golson crossed the street, approached T.M., and demanded that she give him her cell phone. T.M. described the ensuing struggle:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   He just told me to shut up and drop the phone. And I told him that I wasn't going to drop the phone, and then he started going down my pants, and I was trying to fight him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   And he's punching me with his left hand near my left eye. And then when he punched me on the right side, while he was trying to take my pants off is when I dropped my phone. And then after that, I don't remember what happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   T.M. explained that Golson strangled her until she lost consciousness. When she awoke, she found that her pants and underwear had been removed and placed beside her on the ground. She also realized that she awoke several feet away from where she lost consciousness and that her cell phone was gone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 4} T.M. was talking to her mother on the phone when Golson attacked her. After regaining consciousness, T.M. ran for help, and a man on the street allowed her to call her mother on his cell phone. Based on the conversation with her mother, T.M. estimated that she lost consciousness for approximately 20 minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 5} T.M.'s sister met T.M. at the scene and accompanied her to MetroHealth Hospital where a rape kit was collected. Golson's DNA was not found in any of the evidence. However photographs taken at the hospital depicted swelling and bruising on the left side of T.M.'s face, particularly around the left eye. Several photographs showed T.M. wearing a neck brace. T.M. testified she wore the neck brace for a week and a half after the incident for neck support and pain relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Based on T.M.'s testimony, the juvenile court found probable cause to believe\n   that Golson committed the offenses alleged in the complaint. In accordance with R.C. 2152.12(C), the court ordered a psychological evaluation and investigation to determine Golson's amenability to juvenile rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The investigating probation officer, Matthew Scarl (\"Scarl\"), testified at the amenability hearing that Golson had previously been adjudicated delinquent of two burglaries and one robbery. The burglaries were both second-degree felonies and the robbery was a third-degree felony. Golson also had five prior misdemeanors, and two probation violations. Although Golson had never been sentenced to an Ohio Department of Youth Services (\"ODYS\") corrections facility, he had previously been placed in community correctional facilities after running away while he was on home detention and after violating probation for negative behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Golson's trial counsel argued that Golson demonstrated amenability to juvenile rehabilitation because he successfully completed the services offered by the juvenile court system. The state argued that although Golson completed the services, he failed to benefit from them as evidenced by the fact that he continues to reoffend, and his offenses have become increasingly violent. The juvenile court agreed with the state, concluded that Golson was not amenable to juvenile rehabilitation, and bound him over to the adult criminal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Golson was subsequently indicted by a grand jury on one count of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), one count of kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), with a sexual motivation specification, one count of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), one count of aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(3), and one count of robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). Golson later pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping with the sexual motivation specification, one count of felonious assault, and one count of aggravated robbery. The state dismissed the remaining charges and stipulated that the felonious assault and aggravated robbery charges merged for sentencing. The court sentenced Golson to ten years on the kidnapping charge with the sexual motivation specification, and five years on the aggravated robbery charge, to be served consecutively. The court also imposed five years of postrelease control and classified Golson as a Tier II sex offender. Golson now appeals his sentence and Tier II sex offender classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Irrebuttable Presumption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In the first assignment of error, Golson argues the trial court erred when it classified him as a Tier II sex offender as defined in R.C. 2950.01(F)(1). He contends the application of adult registration requirements to him, a juvenile offender, violates his constitutional right to due process because it creates an irrebuttable presumption that he is as culpable as adults who commit the same offense, which is not necessarily true of all juveniles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Golson failed to object to the constitutionality of applying adult sex-offender registration and notification requirements to him. An appellate court will generally \" 'not consider any error which counsel for a party complaining of the trial court's judgment could have called but did not call to the trial court's attention at the time such error could have been avoided or corrected by the trial court.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Chapter 2950, the Adam Walsh Act. R.C. Chapter 2950 presumes that adults who commit certain sexually oriented offenses automatically pose a future threat to public safety. Thus, a sex offender's classification is automatically determined by the offense. R.C. 2950.01(E) - (G). The duration of the offender's obligation to register his personal information, as well as the frequency with which he must report to authorities, depends on his level of classification. R.C. 2905.04 through 2950.07. A Tier II sex offender must register for 25 years and verify his address every 180 days. R.C. 2950.07(B)(2) ; R.C. 2950.06(B)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Juveniles adjudicated delinquent of a first-time sex offense through a juvenile disposition are not subject to automatic tier classifications. This is because the goal of Ohio's juvenile justice system is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   to provide for the care, protection, and mental and physical development of children, to protect the public from the wrongful acts committed by juvenile delinquents, and to rehabilitate errant children and bring them back to productive citizenship, or, * * * to supervise, care for and rehabilitate those children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    In re C.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4117030\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/131/513/\">\n    131 Ohio St.3d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-1446\">\n    2012-Ohio-1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20N.E.2d%20729\">\n    967 N.E.2d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 77, quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Caldwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1749829\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/76/156/#p157\">\n    76 Ohio St.3d 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=666%20N.E.2d%201367\">\n    666 N.E.2d 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). In furtherance of these legislative purposes, the juvenile court must hold a hearing before classifying a juvenile sex offender. R.C. 2152.831. In determining the tier level of a juvenile sex offender, the juvenile court must consider, inter alia (1) the offender's age, (2) the offender's prior criminal or delinquency records, (3) the age of the victim or victims, (4) the nature of the sexually oriented offense, (5) whether the child has shown any genuine remorse for the offense, (6) the public interest and safety, and (7) the results of any treatment provided to the child and of any follow-up professional assessment of the child. R.C. 2152.83(D) ; R.C. 2950.11(K). Moreover, the juvenile court has discretion to decide the appropriate tier level of a particular juvenile offender depending on the circumstances of the case; it is not automatic.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Golson argues the irrebuttable presumption that applies to adult sex\n   offenders, i.e., that they pose a high risk of reoffending and therefore the public must be protected, should not apply to him because he was a juvenile at the time he committed the sexually oriented offense. He asserts there are \"reasonable alternative means\" set forth in R.C. 2152.82 through 2152.85, applicable to juvenile sex offenders, that should be applied to him instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 17} We previously addressed this argument in\n   <em>\n    State v. Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-922\">\n    2016-Ohio-922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20N.E.3d%20537\">\n    61 N.E.3d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Martin was automatically classified as a Tier III sex offender as a result of his rape and kidnapping convictions with sexual motivation specifications.

Chapter 2950 to him, a juvenile, violated his constitutional right to due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 18} We rejected Martin's argument on grounds that he was not classified as a Tier III sex offender in the juvenile court; but in the adult criminal court.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 18.

This court recognized that \"Martin's real contention is with the mandatory bindover statute, * * * not the 'automatic and lifetime requirement of sex-offender registration and notification.' \"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. However, Golson was not subject to a mandatory bindover and had the benefit of a hearing to determine his amenability to the care and rehabilitation services of the juvenile system before being transferred to the adult criminal court. Before transferring Golson's case to the adult criminal court, the trial court held a hearing and determined there was probable cause that Golson committed the offenses alleged in the complaint as required by R.C. 2152.12(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Having determined there was probable cause for the charges, the juvenile court ordered a psychological evaluation and investigation to determine Golson's amenability to juvenile rehabilitation and held an amenability hearing as required by R.C. 2152.12(C). Based on the investigative reports, the testimony of the investigating officer, and the arguments of counsel, the court concluded that Golson was not amenable to rehabilitation in the juvenile court. Golson does not challenge the propriety of the amenability hearing, the court's finding that he was not amenable to juvenile rehabilitation, or any other aspect of the discretionary bindover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Golson's right to due process was honored and protected by the discretionary bindover procedures followed by the juvenile court. Once Golson was transferred to the adult criminal court, he was no longer a \"child\" for purposes of juvenile rehabilitation and was lawfully subject to the adult sex offender classification. Therefore, even if Golson had objected to the constitutionality of applying R.C.
