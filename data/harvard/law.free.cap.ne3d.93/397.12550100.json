Wintermeyer. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On October 23, 2015, a Franklin County Grand Jury filed an indictment charging defendant with a single count of possession of heroin, in violation of R.C. 2925.11, a felony of the fifth degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On February 15, 2016, defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence. On February 22, 2016, the state filed a memorandum contra defendant's motion to suppress evidence. On April 5, 2016, the trial court held a hearing on defendant's motion to suppress. At the suppression hearing, Officer Ryan Wise of the Columbus Division of Police provided unopposed testimony as the sole witness called by the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Officer Wise testified that on March 8, 2014, he was working patrol from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. on the west side of Columbus. On that evening, he was dispatched to investigate a report that a vacant residence had an open window and may have been burglarized. Officer Wise met Officer Brad Foulk at the residence. The officers found an open window in the rear of the residence but were unable to gain entrance through the window. While they waited for someone to arrive with a key, Officer Foulk stood in front of the residence and Officer Wise stood behind the residence in the back yard, which abutted on an alley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Around 8:50 p.m., as he was standing in the back yard, Officer Wise heard individuals talking in the alley. Although it was dark, Officer Wise observed two individuals who stopped in the alley directly behind the yard in which Officer Wise was standing. While he was able to observe the individuals in the alley, Officer Wise thought that they did not see him. One of the individuals, later identified as defendant, walked through a back yard on the other side of the alley into a residence while the second individual, who was referred to at the suppression hearing as Mr. Carlson, remained in the alley. After \"approximately one to two minutes,\" defendant exited the residence on the other side of the alley and walked back into the alley. (Tr. at 11.) Officer Wise testified that as soon as defendant entered the alley, he handed something to the other person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Officer Wise testified he was approximately 10 to 15 feet away from where defendant and Carlson were standing in the alley. Based on his observations, Officer Wise thought \"they went inside the house and purchased narcotics,\" followed by \"[a]n exchange, hand-to-hand exchange.\" (Tr. at 12.) Officer Wise proceeded to shine his flashlight on defendant and\n   Carlson and began walking toward them. When he shined his flashlight on them, he saw \"a small plastic object\" in Carlson's hand. (Tr. at 12.) Officer Wise stated that the object was \"a small object, maybe the size of my pinkie there wrapped up in plastic wrap.\" (Tr. at 13.) Officer Wise also described the item as \"a plastic cellophane bag or Saran Wrap.\" (Tr. at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Officer Wise testified that \"[a]s I shined the flashlight and walked up to them I could see the individual was still holding the plastic baggie in his hand. At that point I reached down and grabbed it and observed it contain[ed] a brown substance, which was consistent with heroin.\" (Tr. at 14.) Officer Wise then radioed that he had two suspects detained in the alley and requested assistance. Officer Wise testified he detained defendant and Carlson \"[a]s soon as I walked up on them and saw the plastic baggie, which I suspected was heroin.\" (Tr. at 15.) Officer Foulk met Officer Wise in the alley and took the item confiscated by Officer Wise for testing. Officer Foulk reported that he received a positive field test for heroin. At that point, defendant and Carlson were placed under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On April 10, 2016, defendant filed a supplement to his motion to suppress. On May 10, 2016, the trial court filed a decision and entry granting defendant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The state appeals and assigns the following single assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court committed reversible error in sustaining Wintermeyer's motion to suppress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The state argues on appeal that the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to suppress because he lacks the requisite standing. \"[A] motion to suppress must 'state with particularity the legal and factual issues to be resolved,' thereby placing the prosecutor and court 'on notice of those issues to be heard and decided by the court and, by omission, those issues which are otherwise being waived.' \"\n   <em>\n    Columbus v.

As Officer Wise approached, he observed that the object Defendant Wintermeyer had handed to his companion appeared to be a small plastic bag. Officer Wise then reached out and took the bag from the companion's hand. After taking the plastic bag, Officer Wise was able to see that the bag contained a brown substance, which Officer Wise immediately suspected was heroin. Officer Wise arrested Defendant Wintermeyer, placed\n   him in the back of the cruiser, and had the contents of the plastic bag field-tested by another officer.

Here, the state admits that Officer Wise ultimately detained defendant,\n   but contends that \"[i]t is not clear exactly when Wise detained [defendant] and Carlson in relation to when he took the baggie of heroin from Carlson.\" (State's Brief at 13.) The trial court found that \"Officer Wise did not have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity until after [defendant] had been detained and Officer Wise had seized the small plastic object he had seen [defendant] carry from the house across the alley from where Officer Wise was standing.\" (Decision at 402.) Although the court did not determine the exact point of detention, from this statement, it is clear the trial court found that Officer Wise detained defendant prior to seizing the plastic bag.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The trial court's finding that Officer Wise detained defendant prior to seizing the plastic bag is supported by Officer Wise's testimony at the suppression hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [Defense counsel]: You immediately detained him, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [Officer Wise]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [Defense counsel]: Then you collected the plastic baggie?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [Officer Wise]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [Defense counsel]: Then after that you immediately recognized that it was an illegal narcotic, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [Officer Wise]: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [Defense counsel]: You did not upon approach ask them who they were, did you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [Officer Wise]: I don't remember.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [Defense counsel]: You didn't ask them anything with regard to why they were there or what they were doing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [Officer Wise]: I don't recall what I said to them specifically.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [Defense counsel]: But you did detain them, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [Officer Wise]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [Defense counsel]: And at that point in time the detention was based upon the handing over of a small object, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [Officer Wise]: And visibly seeing a small plastic baggie.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (Tr. at 24-25.)

Indeed, Officer Wise was not able to specifically recall saying anything at all upon approaching defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Officer Wise did specifically agree that he \"immediately detained [defendant]\" and \"then * * * collected the plastic bag.\" (Tr. at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 23} An officer's subjective intent is irrelevant in determining whether a seizure has occurred.

(finding detective's statement that the defendant would have been arrested if he attempted to leave supported conclusion that the encounter was not consensual, but rather an investigative stop).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Legality of the Detention\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Having found that defendant was subject to an investigative detention, we next consider whether such detention was supported by reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in or was about to be engaged in criminal activity. The state contends that Officer Wise reasonably suspected defendant was engaged in criminal activity because, prior to seizing the plastic bag, Officer Wise made the following observations: \"(1) [defendant] and Carlson approach a house at night through the alley, (2) [defendant] goes inside the house while Carlson waits in the alley, (3) [defendant] emerges from the house one or two minutes later, (4) [defendant] hands Carlson [an] object, (5) Wise sees in plain view Carlson carrying a small object that is wrapped in a plastic, cellophane baggie.\" (State's Brief at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Here, the state argues that \"the brief time that [defendant] was inside the house suggested that he was a 'short term visitor who may have been consummating a drug transaction.' \" (State's Brief at 14, quoting\n   <em>\n    Utah v. Strieff\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597903\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2056/#p2063\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2063,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597903\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2056/#p2063\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).) In\n   <em>\n    Strieff\n   </em>\n   , an officer conducted intermittent surveillance of a residence based on a tip of drug-related activity. Following his observation of frequent, short-duration visits to the residence by different individuals, the officer suspected the occupants of the residence were selling drugs. Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Strieff\n   </em>\n   , Officer Wise was not responding to a report of drug-related activity or conducting surveillance on the residence that defendant entered. Furthermore, Officer Wise's testimony does not reflect his knowledge of whether defendant lived at the residence in question or was merely a visitor. Thus, we do not construe\n   <em>\n    Strieff\n   </em>\n   so broadly as to find that a brief visit to a residence without more is indicative of the consummation of a drug transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The state also points to Officer Wise's observation of defendant handing Carlson a small object wrapped in plastic. Although Officer Wise observed defendant hand Carlson an object, he testified he was not able to observe whether the object defendant handed to Carlson contained illegal drugs. Specifically, on cross-examination,\n   Officer Wise testified regarding his written report of his observations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [Defense counsel]: You report: Several minutes later [defendant] exited the residence and met up with [Carlson]. Officer Wise observed [defendant] was holding a small object in his hand, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [Officer Wise]: Yes, correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [Defense counsel]: At no point in time do you identify at that time that the substance you believed was visibly heroin or any illegal drugs, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [Officer Wise]: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   [Defense counsel]: Continue: And was handing over the object to [Carlson], correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [Officer Wise]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [Defense counsel]: And at no point in time did you identify that you believed that that substance would be illegal drugs or heroin, right, in that sentence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   [Officer Wise]: Not in that sentence, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [Defense counsel]: Next sentence: At this time Officer Wise approached both subjects and observed the object [defendant] was holding was a small plastic baggie, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [Officer Wise]: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [Defense counsel]: Alright.

After pulling over the defendant's vehicle and ordering him out, officers seized a plastic bag they observed sticking out of the defendant's front pants pocket which they later determined contained illegal drugs.

The man gave the defendant money, she reached into her shirt pocket, pulled out a plastic bag, and gave the man something out of the plastic bag. Detectives approached the pair and identified themselves as police officers. The man ran away, and the defendant stuck the plastic bag in her shirt pocket. Initially, the defendant walked away from the detectives and did not comply with their request to stop. Upon approaching the defendant, the detectives observed a plastic bag protruding\n   from the defendant's pocket. Detectives asked the defendant for identification and inquired what was in her pocket. After the defendant stated that she did not have identification and denied that anything was in her pocket, the detectives removed the bag that was protruding from the pocket. The court found that the officers possessed probable cause to associate the visible plastic bag with criminal activity, thereby justifying its seizure under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Unlike both\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Barr\n   </em>\n   , there was no testimony that Officer Wise was surveilling an area known for a high rate of illegal drug transactions.

As we have previously discussed, in that case, an officer suspected that illegal drug activity was taking place at a residence following an anonymous tip and his observation of frequent, short-duration visits. During his surveillance of the residence, the officer observed Strieff exit the house and walk to a nearby convenience store. The officer detained Strieff in the store's parking lot, identified himself, and demanded to know what Strieff was doing in the residence. The officer requested Strieff's identification and Strieff complied. The officer used Strieff's identification to check for warrants and discovered that Strieff had an outstanding arrest warrant for a traffic violation. The officer arrested Strieff pursuant to the warrant and performed a search of Strieff incident to the arrest, discovering drugs and drug paraphernalia on Strieff's person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In that case, the United States Supreme Court examined the attenuation doctrine in considering \"whether the discovery of a valid arrest warrant was a sufficient intervening event to break the causal chain between the unlawful stop and the discovery of drug-related evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Strieff\n   </em>\n   at 2062. Applying the three factor test, the court found that although the temporal proximity between the stop and discovery favored suppression, that consideration was outweighed by the \"critical intervening circumstance\" of the pre-existing arrest warrant that was \"wholly independent of the illegal stop\" and the absence of \"flagrantly unlawful police misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9639\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/590/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the court held that \"the evidence [the officer] seized as part of his search incident to arrest is admissible because his discovery of the arrest warrant attenuated the connection between the unlawful stop and the evidence seized from Strieff incident to arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2064.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Applying the three-part test articulated in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9639\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/590/\">\n    422 U.S. 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9639\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/590/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to the facts of this case, we first examine the temporal proximity factor. In considering the temporal proximity factor, courts have looked to whether there was a \"substantial time\" separating the unlawful detention and the discovery of evidence.\n   <em>\n    Kaupp v. Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031233\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/626/#p633\">\n    538 U.S. 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 633,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031233\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/626/#p633\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031233\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/626/#p633\">\n    155 L.Ed.2d 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 422 U.S. at 604,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9639\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/590/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the record does not reflect there was any substantial break between the unlawful detention and the discovery of the evidence. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Strieff\n   </em>\n   , the temporal proximity between the unlawful conduct and the discovery of evidence favors suppression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Second, we consider whether there were any intervening circumstances. Following from our analysis of the first factor, there were no intervening circumstances present here. The record is devoid of any events or other circumstances separating the unlawful detention and the discovery of evidence. Significantly, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Strieff\n   </em>\n   , the record does not reflect that Officer Wise was acting pursuant to a search or arrest warrant.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Segura\n   </em>\n   at 815,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340278\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/796/#p804\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the second factor favors suppression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Finally, we examine the third factor, i.e. the purpose and flagrancy of the officer's actions. Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Strieff\n   </em>\n   , Officer Wise was not acting on the basis of a tip that drug activity was taking place. Furthermore, as discussed in our analysis of the good-faith exception, Officer Wise did not act on the basis of erroneous information from a third party, but rather based on his own inchoate suspicion. Thus, we find the third factor favors suppression.

Additionally, we find no merit to the state's argument that defendant's assertion of \"his\" constitutional rights in general was sufficient absent more to preserve the issue of standing.

There is no evidence that Officer Wise ordered the two suspects to remain where they were or told them they were not free to go, no evidence that he drew a weapon, no evidence that he physically restrained either Carlson or defendant, no evidence that he blocked their path, and no evidence of any other demonstration of authority by Officer Wise that would have caused a reasonable person in defendant's position to believe he was not free to go.

(Tr. at 17.) Officer Wise suspected that defendant \"went inside the house and purchased narcotics,\" based on the relatively short time of one to two minutes defendant had been in the house before returning to the alley to hand off the object to Carlson. (Tr. at 12.) Officer Wise acknowledged that when defendant handed the small object to Carlson, he was unable to see it well enough in the darkness to identify it as narcotics, but he suspected at that point in time he had observed a drug transaction. He testified that \"[w]hen I approached them and I could clearly see * * * Carlson was holding a plastic bag in his hand that was suspected narcotics.\" (Tr. at 27.) Officer Wise shone his flashlight on the object in Carlson's hand and he could see \"a small object, maybe the size of my pinkie there wrapped up in plastic wrap.\" (Tr. at 13.)

Officer Wise saw defendant go into a residence for one to two minutes and return to the alley where he immediately passed a small object to Carlson. Based on his experience as an officer who had made multiple previous drug arrests, Officer Wise suspected he had witnessed a hand-to-hand drug transaction and decided to further investigate by approaching the two individuals in a public place, lawfully utilizing his flashlight to illuminate the object defendant handed to Carlson. When Officer Wise saw in plain view a pinkie sized object wrapped in plastic wrap, he suspected it to be heroin. Officer Wise grabbed\n   the baggie from Carlson's hand and observed that the pinkie sized object was brown in color, indicating heroin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On these facts, the record establishes that Officer Wise was lawfully in a position where he could plainly view the object handed off from defendant to Carlson and, after lawfully illuminating the object, Officer Wise was able to observe a substance under circumstances which would warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that the substance was illegal narcotics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   {\u00b6 58} \"When * * * officers observe[ ] what could be interpreted as a drug-buy, they [have] a duty to investigate.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
