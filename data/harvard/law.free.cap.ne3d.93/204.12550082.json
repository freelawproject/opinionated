For the reasons set forth below, this Court reverses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Mr. Soto was indicted on two counts of rape involving a person less than 10 years of age. Prior to his arrest, Mr. Soto was interviewed by Detective Tabitha Angello at the Lorain Police Department. During the interview, Mr. Soto gave a videotaped statement wherein he admitted the allegations. Mr. Soto moved to suppress all of his statements made during the interview, arguing that Detective Angello did not inform him of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and his confession was induced by direct and indirect promises made by Detective Angello during the interview. The trial court concluded that Mr. Soto's confession was not induced by direct or indirect promises, but he was in custody and entitled to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights when he made his confession. The trial court granted Mr. Soto's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The State timely appeals the trial court's ruling and raises three assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING MR. SOTO'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS BECAUSE THE FINDINGS OF FACT ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY COMPETENT, CREDIBLE EVIDENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The State argues that the trial court committed two errors relative to the\n   findings of fact. First, the State asserts the trial court's findings of fact regarding Detective Angello's uniform are not supported by competent, credible evidence. Second, the State maintains the trial court failed to make certain findings of fact that were supported by the evidence. This Court disagrees with the first argument, but agrees with the second argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} A motion to suppress evidence presents a mixed question of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The video depicts Detective Angello wearing a black polo shirt with a large gold emblem shaped like a badge on her upper left chest and khaki pants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The State takes issue with the trial court's finding that Detective Angello was wearing \"her police uniform.\" While Detective Angello was not wearing a patrolman's uniform, the evidence before the trial court reflected she was dressed in her detective's uniform. The shirt displayed a prominent emblem identifying Detective Angello as a member of the Lorain Police Department. Additionally, Detective Angello stated her clothing identified her as a police officer. Her clothing, combined with the presence of her badge and sidearm functionally created a \"police uniform.\" Accordingly, the trial court's finding of fact that Detective Angello was wearing a police uniform is supported by competent, credible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Incomplete facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The State also argues the trial court failed to make any findings regarding ten facts that were supported by Detective\n   Angello's testimony and/or the videotape of the interview and such facts were relevant to making a determination of whether Mr. Soto was in custody during the interview. Mr. Soto concedes the trial court's findings of fact are silent as to these ten facts, but argues these facts are not relevant. Additionally, Mr. Soto asserts this Court has all the evidence before it and, thus, there is no prejudice to the State if any facts were omitted in the findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} As noted above, this Court will accept a trial court's factual findings if they are supported by competent, credible evidence.\n   <em>\n    Burnside\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1190316\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/100/152/\">\n    100 Ohio St.3d 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003-Ohio-5372\">\n    2003-Ohio-5372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=797%20N.E.2d%2071\">\n    797 N.E.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 8.

Other factors considered by courts when determining when a person is in custody include whether the suspect is informed he is not under arrest and may leave, the ability to leave at the conclusion of the interview, access to a cell phone during the interview, whether an officer is armed and displays the weapon in a threatening fashion, being in a room with a closed, unlocked door, and voluntarily going to the police station for the interview.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

When evidence of these factors are present in the record, it is necessary to examine such factors to determine, \" 'whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.' \"\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27, quoting\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The trial court's findings of fact, although supported by the record, are based almost entirely on the content of the videotaped interview. The limited findings about the location and atmosphere of the interview are that it was held at the Lorain Police Department headquarters in a conference room with the door closed and Detective Angello was in her police uniform complete with a badge and gun. The State argues there are multiple gaps in the findings of fact that are pertinent to the analysis of custodial interrogation. These facts include the size and the layout of the room, who was present in the room, the positioning of Mr. Soto and Detective Angello in the room, any obstructions to the exit, whether any restraints were used on Mr. Soto, when the door was open and closed during the duration Mr. Soto was in the room, how far the door was open, if the door was locked, whether Mr. Soto had access to his cell phone and whether he used it, how often and for how long Mr. Soto was alone in the briefing room, the length of the interview, whether Mr. Soto appeared voluntarily for the interview, Mr. Soto's means of travel to the police station, whether anyone accompanied Mr. Soto to the police station and was waiting for him at the station, what happened to Mr. Soto at the conclusion of the interview, whether Mr. Soto was arrested, Detective Angello's demeanor throughout the interview, and whether Detective Angello displayed her sidearm in a threatening fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} All of these factors were discernible upon reviewing the videotape of the interview and the testimony of Detective Angello and were pertinent to the analysis of whether Mr. Soto was in custody. However, the trial court made no determinations regarding any of these facts. Consequently, this Court cannot determine the extent to which they were considered. Accordingly, the trial court's findings of fact are incomplete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Further, the findings of fact contained no analysis or discussion of Detective Angello's testimony. Detective Angello testified that as they walked to the briefing room she \"thanked [Mr. Soto] for coming, told him [he] shouldn't be here too long[,] asked him if he had a ride or if he got dropped off[,] explained to him [they] were going to talk for a little bit, that he wasn't under arrest and [she] usually shut[s] the door for noise and privacy issues.\" Detective Angello testified this discussion occurred in the hallway and was not recorded. On cross-examination, Detective Angello conceded her report did not specify when or where this conversation occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Additionally, Detective Angello initially testified on cross-examination that she told Mr. Soto during the interview that he was free to leave. However, upon further cross-examination she conceded that the transcript of the interview does not contain any such statement by her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Detective Angello was the only witness at the suppression hearing. Detective Angello's testimony regarding the discussions immediately preceding the interview was crucial evidence regarding whether Mr. Soto was in custody. However, the trial court did not make any findings of fact as to any conflicting evidence or discrepancies and did not address witness credibility as it may have pertained to any discrepancies. Because the trial court is the trier of fact in a suppression hearing, it is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and evaluate witness credibility.\n   <em>\n    Burnside\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1190316\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/100/152/\">\n    100 Ohio St.3d 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003-Ohio-5372\">\n    2003-Ohio-5372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=797%20N.E.2d%2071\">\n    797 N.E.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 8.

It went on to address the objective circumstances of the interview by discussing the location and the atmosphere surrounding the interview. However, the trial court deviated from its objective analysis when it said \"[w]hat [Mr. Soto] was thinking is an important consideration.\" This is an improper inquiry into Mr. Soto's subjective view. The trial court incorrectly cited to\n   <em>\n    Berkemer\n   </em>\n   in support of this proposition. However,\n   <em>\n    Berkemer\n   </em>\n   stated that \"the only relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood his situation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338811\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/420/#p442\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338811\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/420/#p442\">\n    at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338811\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/420/#p442\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite the case law, the trial court considered \"[w]hat [Mr. Soto] was thinking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The trial court went on to state \"[t]he focus of a court's inquiry should be on the detainee rather than the interrogator.\" The court gave no legal citation\n   for this proposition. Nonetheless, this statement is incorrect. The subjective views of both the interrogator and the detainee are not relevant when determining if a person is in custody.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henry\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sublett\n   </em>\n   at *2. Instead, the court is to consider whether \"a reasonable person would have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interview and leave.\"\n   <em>\n    Hoffner\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Additionally, the trial court's confusion as to the correct legal standard arose during the suppression hearing.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE COURT: Well, really, the issue is for the [c]ourt to determine whether or not, based on the facts presented at this hearing, [Mr. Soto] would have thought whether he was free to leave or not, not what the detective thinks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, that's true, * * * but the law requires, and I'll show it to you, it's an objective analysis, not a subjective analysis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: Which is why I'm able to make the decision objectively, looking at the facts a reasonable person would believe that they got.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Reasonable person. Got it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: I understand that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But her position that he was not in custody, all right, is evidence to the [c]ourt, her thinking process on that issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: Well, what she thinks doesn't really matter to this court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   THE COURT: The facts you've laid out so far about her being in a uniform, where they were located, whether the door was open or shut, those are objective facts-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: -that I could consider. Whether [Mr. Soto]-whether the detective thought he was under arrest or not isn't the issue. She didn't give the statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While the trial court indicated the need to look at the objective circumstances of the interview and not to consider the subjective views of the detective, it appeared to have remained fixated on what Mr. Soto thought. That is an application of the subjective standard and not the objective reasonable person standard. The trial court then made a statement that it can \"make the decision objectively.\" This statement does not comport with the correct legal standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Mr. Soto \"[a]dmitted[ ] the trial court [ ] segued into the aforementioned language regarding Mr. Soto's subjective responses to this stimuli and the trial court's dubious assertion that what Mr. Soto thought is an important consideration.\" However, Mr. Soto attempted to minimize this incorrect statement of law by noting the remainder of the decision where the trial court recited the law correctly. While the trial court made correct statements of law, it also made incorrect statements of law and applied both to the facts of this case. This Court cannot separate out the incorrect statements of law from the correct statements of law as the trial court's analysis is intertwined with both. Nor can this Court ignore the incorrect statements of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Because the trial court improperly applied both the subjective and objective standards to the custody analysis, the trial court committed an error of law. Having concluded that the trial court applied the incorrect law, this Court concludes the trial court erred in granting Mr. Soto's motion to suppress. Accordingly, this Court must remand to the trial court for it to apply the correct law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The State's second assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING MR.

However, this Court's resolution of the State's first and second assignments of error renders the third assignment of error moot and this Court declines to address it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The State's first and second assignments of error are sustained.
