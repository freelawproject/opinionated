Specifically, appellant argues that the trial court imposed consecutive sentences without making the required findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) and that the maximum sentence imposed by the trial court is not clearly and convincingly supported by the record. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant was indicted, entered a plea, and was sentenced in two separate criminal cases: Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-14-592088-A and Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-15-597731-A. This appeal pertains to the sentence imposed in the latter case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    CR-14-592088-A\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On December 23, 2014, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned an eight-count indictment charging appellant with (1) drug trafficking, in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2) ; (2) drug possession, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A) ; (3) drug trafficking, in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2) ; (4) carrying a concealed weapon, in violation of R.C. 2923.12(A)(2) ; (5) improperly handling a firearm in a motor vehicle, in violation of R.C. 2923.16(B) ; (6) receiving stolen property, in violation of R.C. 2913.51(A) ; (7) having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(2) ; and (8) having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3). Counts 1 through 3 contained one-year firearm specifications and forfeiture specifications. Counts 4 through 8 contained forfeiture specifications. Appellant pled not guilty to the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 2, 2015, appellant entered a plea of no contest to all eight counts in the indictment. The trial court advised appellant of his constitutional rights and penalties implicated by his plea of no contest. Furthermore, based on the evidence proffered by the state, the trial court found appellant guilty on all counts and specifications. The trial court proceeded immediately to sentencing and imposed an aggregate three-year prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On June 30, 2015, appellant filed an appeal challenging his convictions. This court determined that the trial court's June 2, 2015 sentencing journal entry did not accurately reflect what transpired during the sentencing hearing, and remanded the case to the trial court for a nunc pro tunc sentencing entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On January 12, 2016, the trial court issued a nunc pro tunc sentencing entry indicating that Counts 1 and 2 merged for sentencing purposes, and the state elected to sentence appellant on Count 1; Counts 7 and 8 also merged for sentencing purposes, and the state elected to sentence appellant on Count 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In\n   <em>\n    State v.

On August 3, 2015, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned a 12-count indictment charging appellant with (1) murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A) ; (2) murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B) ; (3) felonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) ; (4) felonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) ; (5) voluntary manslaughter, in violation of R.C. 2903.03(A) ; (6) involuntary manslaughter, in violation of R.C. 2903.04(A) ; (7) discharge of a firearm on or near prohibited premises, in violation of R.C. 2923.162(A)(3) ; (8) aggravated assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.12(A)(1) ; (9) aggravated assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.12(A)(2) ; (10) tampering with evidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1) ; (11) having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(2) ; and (12) having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3). Counts 1 through 6 contained one- and three-year firearm specifications, notice of prior conviction specifications, and repeat violent offender specifications. Count 7 contained one- and three-year firearm specifications and a notice of prior conviction specification. Counts 8 and 9 contained one- and three-year firearm specifications. Appellant pled not guilty to the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The parties reached a plea agreement. The state amended Count 5 by deleting the one-year firearm specification and the notice of prior conviction and repeat violent offender specifications. On August 1, 2016, appellant pled guilty to Count 5, voluntary manslaughter, a first-degree felony, and the underlying three-year firearm specification. The remaining counts and specifications charged in the indictment were nolled. The trial court ordered a presentence investigation report (\"PSI\") and set the matter for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court held a sentencing hearing on August 31, 2016. The trial court sentenced appellant to a prison term of 14 years: three years on the firearm specification to be served prior to and consecutively with 11 years on the voluntary manslaughter count. The trial court ordered appellant to serve this 14-year sentence consecutively with his three-year prison sentence in CR-14-592088-A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On September 29, 2016, appellant filed the instant appeal challenging the trial court's sentence. He assigns two errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I. The trial court's imposition of consecutive sentences was contrary to law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   II. The trial court's imposition of maximum and consecutive sentences is clearly and convincingly unsupported by the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) provides that when reviewing felony sentences, a reviewing court may overturn the imposition of consecutive sentences where the court \"clearly and convincingly\" finds that (1) \"the record does not support the sentencing court's findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4),\" or (2) \"the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) provides that in order to impose consecutive sentences, the trial court must find that consecutive sentences are (1) necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender, (2) that such sentences would not be disproportionate to the seriousness of the conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public, and (3) that one of the following applies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (a) The offender committed one or more of the multiple offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under postrelease control for a prior offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (b) At least two of the multiple offenses were committed as part of one or more courses of conduct, and the harm caused by two or more of the multiple offenses so committed was so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender's conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   ( _ ) The offender's history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Compliance with R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) requires the trial court to make the statutory findings at the sentencing hearing, which means that \" 'the [trial] court must note that it engaged in the analysis' and that it 'has considered the statutory criteria and specifie[d] which of the given bases warrants its decision.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

A trial court is not, however, required to state its reasons to support its findings, nor is it required to give a rote recitation of the statutory language, \"provided that the necessary findings can be found in the record and are incorporated in the sentencing entry.\"\n   <em>\n    Bonnell\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In the instant matter, appellant concedes that the trial court made the first R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) finding. In making the first finding, the trial court stated, \"I find\n   that consecutive service is necessary to protect the public from future crime[.] * * * I also find it's necessary to adequately punish you for the crime.\" (Tr. 131-132.) Furthermore, regarding the third finding, appellant does not challenge the trial court's determination that R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(b) and (c) applied. In making the third finding, the trial court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   I also find that the crimes were-at least two of these crimes were committed as part of one or more courses of conduct. And I find that the harm caused by the multiple offenses was so great that no single prison term to these multiple offenses would suffice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, I also find that your history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary, as I said earlier, to protect the public from future crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Tr. 132.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant's challenge to the trial court's imposition of consecutive sentences pertains to the second R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) finding, commonly referred to as the \"disproportionate\" or \"proportionality\" finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, appellant argues that the trial court failed to find that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the danger he poses to the public. As such, appellant asserts that the trial court's proportionality finding was insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In support of his argument, appellant directs this court to\n   <em>\n    State v.

That consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime. That consecutive sentences are necessary to punish the defendant.

Accordingly, this court vacated the trial court's imposition of consecutive sentences and remanded the matter to the trial court to determine whether consecutive sentences were appropriate and, if so, to make the requisite R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) findings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In\n   <em>\n    State v.

In imposing consecutive sentences, the trial court stated that consecutive sentences \"are not disproportionate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. On appeal, the defendant-appellant argued that the trial court's proportionality finding was insufficient because the court did not specify whether its finding was related to the seriousness of his conduct, the danger he posed to the public, or\n   both.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.

Regarding the proportionality finding, the trial court stated, \"I also find that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of your conduct.

Specifically, appellant takes issue with the following statements made by the trial court at sentencing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   I mean, there is no question about it, this is a maximum sentence for the particular crime we're talking about. To me it seems the benefit you received of the plea bargain was the reduction in the crime charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   I don't know whether you are in fact guilty of murder. You are not being sentenced for murder, that's for sure. But there is evidence here that if you went to trial would have certainly created a genuine issue of material fact, and would have allowed a jury to decide that you did in fact commit a murder for which a life sentence would have been imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   My point is, not to say that it is guaranteed that you would have been found guilty and gotten a life sentence, but to say that a life sentence was possible. And here, to paraphrase [the victim's grandmother], 6, 11, 14 years, you are going to get out of prison. You are not going to spend the rest of your life in prison, whereas otherwise you might have. Again, recognizing explicitly that you weren't adjudicated guilty of murder, that is for sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (Tr. 132-133.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Appellant argues that the trial court concluded the benefit from the parties' plea agreement was \"one-sided,\" and that by pleading guilty, appellant eliminated the possibility of being convicted of murder and receiving a life sentence. Appellant contends that the benefit of the plea agreement was not one-sided, and that the state also benefitted from the agreement by avoiding the embarrassment of appellant being acquitted on all 12 counts at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Appellant further argues that the trial court failed to consider the possibility that he could have been acquitted at trial. In support of his argument, appellant contends that the limited record before the trial court at sentencing provided substantial evidence that the victim was the aggressor and that the victim beat, pistol whipped, and may have even fired a gun at appellant. As such, appellant asserts that \"voluntary manslaughter was likely the worst-case scenario for [him] if he'd gone to trial\" and suggests that he may have even prevailed at trial under a self-defense theory. Appellant's brief at 8. Finally, appellant asserts that by pleading guilty, he was \"foregoing the very real possibility of acquittal at trial.\" Appellant's brief at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Initially, we note that appellant's argument is premised on the assumption that the trial court imposed the maximum sentence because of the court's view regarding the benefit appellant received from the plea agreement, rather than the aforementioned factors and considerations that prompted the court to impose consecutive sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Generally, a trial court may not impose a sentence based upon a \" 'crime neither charged nor proven.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court's sentencing journal entry provides, in relevant part, \"the court considered all required factors of the law. The court finds that prison is consistent with the purpose of R.C. 2929.11.\" Aside from the trial court's notation in its sentencing entry that it \"considered all required factors of the law\" including, specifically, R.C. 2929.11, the record reflects that the trial court did, in fact, consider both R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 when sentencing appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Appellant acknowledges that during the sentencing hearing, the trial court referenced \"the provisions of Chapter 2929 of the Ohio Revised Code.\" (Tr. 129.)

The victim began shooting at [appellant], and [appellant] tripped. When he tripped, [appellant] fell to the ground, where the victim began pistol whipping him. [Appellant] stated someone knew him from the bar and pulled the victim off of him. The victim then started chasing that guy and the rest of the group, including [the Heartless Felons member], began jumping [appellant] again. According to [appellant, the Heartless Felon] had a gun. He fumbled with it and [appellant] ended up retrieving it from him. [Appellant] stated, \"[e]verybody was shooting. I ran and fired back behind me blindly. At least three or four others were shooting. I dropped the gun in the parking lot and ran.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The trial court stated that it considered the statements made by the state, defense counsel, appellant, the victim's fianc\u00e9e, and the victim's grandmother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The prosecutor asserted that appellant\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   has a prior record going back to 2003, receiving stolen property motor vehicle; 2006, a felony two drug trafficking; 2010, felony five drug possession; 2010, felony drug possession.

The prosecutor stated that there was a video of the altercation and that the parties disputed whether the video displayed the victim handling a gun. The prosecutor further explained that testing was conducted and there was no gunshot residue on the victim's hands. The trial court inquired as to whether the eyewitnesses who reported the victim had a gun were associated with appellant. The prosecutor asserted that \"[t]here [were] two sides to the story.\" (Tr. 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Defense counsel stated that appellant showed genuine remorse for the victim and the victim's family.

Once they confronted [appellant], a fight ensued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [Appellant] was tossed to the ground, and he was pistol whipped. There are three people that indicate that [the victim] had a pistol and was beating my client about the head.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (Tr. 110.) Defense counsel emphasized that one of the witnesses who did not know appellant and was not connected to appellant in any way observed the victim with a handgun. Finally, defense counsel opined that appellant was \"in fear of his life\" because the victim had a handgun and at least one shot was fired in appellant's direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 44} The trial court indicated that it considered the state's sentencing memorandum and defense counsel's sentencing\n   memorandum. Defense counsel's sentencing memorandum provided, in relevant part, that the eyewitnesses\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   each indicate that the victim * * * was: 1) the aggressor; 2) had a pistol; 3) was \"pistol whipping\" and beating [appellant] along with several of [the victim's] friends; 4) [e]ither [the victim] or one of his friends shot a weapon at [appellant]; 5) [appellant] attempted to escape but could not; 6) [d]ue to being beat up with a firearm and shot at, [appellant] fired a weapon in haste in order to keep his assailants away and to prevent death or great bodily harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   On the other hand, the state's sentencing memorandum provided, in relevant part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [p]olice and witnesses identified [appellant] fighting with the victim. The victim is seen with an out-stretched arm and what is believed to be a weapon. At one point in the altercation, [appellant] goes to the ground. [Appellant] walks away, but he does not leave. Instead, [appellant] returns armed with a firearm. When the victim turns and leaves the scene, [appellant] comes after the victim. [Appellant] fires a fatal shot into the victim's back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Upon investigation, police learn that the co-defendant hands [appellant] a firearm. [Appellant] shoots the victim in the back. [Appellant] runs away and tosses the gun. The victim dies from that gunshot wound.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The trial court considered that when appellant was arrested for drug trafficking on December 17, 2014, he was in possession of a different gun than the gun that had been used during the October 2014 nightclub shooting. Finally, the trial court considered appellant's criminal history, which the trial court described as \"unremitting\" and noted that it included violent crimes. Appellant's criminal history includes convictions for robbery, abduction, and having weapons while under disability;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   drug possession;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   drug trafficking and drug possession;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and receiving stolen property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Regarding appellant's assertion that a voluntary manslaughter conviction would have been the \"worst case scenario\" had he exercised his right to trial, we find that the limited record regarding the circumstances surrounding the nightclub shooting contained evidence upon which a factfinder could have rejected appellant's contention that he shot the victim based upon serious provocation or in self-defense. According to the PSI's offense summary, the victim was walking away from the fight when appellant began shooting at him. Furthermore, according to the state's sentencing memorandum, appellant walked away from the fight, obtained a firearm, returned to the fight, and shot the victim in the back as the victim was leaving the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 47} For all of the foregoing reasons, we cannot say that appellant's sentence is unsupported by the record or contrary to law. The trial court did not err by imposing the maximum 11-year sentence for appellant's voluntary manslaughter conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Appellant's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 49} After thoroughly reviewing the record, we find that the trial court did not\n   err by imposing consecutive sentences and appellant's sentence is not contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   TIM McCORMACK, P.J., and ANITA LASTER MAYS, J., CONCUR\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    CR-10-540745-A\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    CR-10-539842-A\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    CR-06-478998-B\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    CR-03-438546-ZA\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
