Roberts, defendant below and appellant herein. Appellant assigns the following error for review:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \"DID THE TRAIL [SIC] COURT ERR IN FAILING TO IMPOSE POST RELEASE CONTROL AT ROBERTS' SENTENCING HEARING AND/OR IN THE COURT'S JANUARY 26, 2006 'JUDGMENT ENTRY AND FINAL APPEALABLE ENTRY'?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In January 2006, appellant agreed to plead guilty to the following offenses: (1) two counts of fourth-degree-felony trafficking in crack cocaine; (2) four counts of third-degree-felony trafficking in crack cocaine; (3) first-degree-felony trafficking in crack cocaine; (4) first-degree-felony aggravated possession of crack cocaine; (5) third-degree-felony having weapons while under a disability; and (6) fifth-degree-felony possessing criminal tools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} At the change of plea hearing, the trial court informed appellant, inter alia, that \"[t]here are felonies of the first degree involved,\" which \"means if you are to enter a plea you could be subject to a period of post release control for up to five years.\" The court did not verbally advise appellant that he could be subject to any terms of discretionary postrelease control for the third, fourth, and fifth degree felonies. After accepting appellant's guilty plea, the court immediately sentenced appellant. When the court announced appellant's sentence, the court did not indicate whether any of the sentences included\n   mandatory or discretionary postrelease control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On January 26, 2006, the trial court entered a combined entry reciting its acceptance of appellant's guilty plea, finding appellant guilty, and imposing sentence. The court's entry states that the court advised appellant\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a felony of the first * * * degree, * * * post release control is mandatory, and [appellant] will be supervised under post release control upon release from prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Further, for a felony of the first degree * * * the mandatory period of post release control is five years * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court further advised [appellant] that if sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a felony of the third, fourth or fifth degree that is not subject to [R.C.] 2929.19(B)(3)(c), post release control is discretionary and the Court notified appellant that he * * * may be supervised under post release control for up to three years upon release from prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court then sentenced appellant to serve the following prison terms and ordered that he serve them concurrently to one another: (1) seventeen months in prison for each of the fourth-degree-felony trafficking in cocaine offenses; (2) four years in prison for each of the third-degree felony trafficking in crack cocaine offenses; (3) five years in prison for the first-degree felony trafficking in crack cocaine offense; (4) five years in prison for the first-degree felony aggravated possession of crack cocaine offense; (6) four years in prison for the third-degree-felony having weapons while under a disability offense; and (7) twelve months in prison for the fifth-degree-felony possessing criminal tools offense. The sentencing portion of the court's entry does not mention whether postrelease control accompanied the sentences. Appellant did not appeal the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Approximately ten years later, on February 23, 2016, appellant filed a \"motion to find the judgment entered on January 26, 2006 'not a final appealable order and void in-part,' where the trial court failed to properly comply with a number of statutory requirements.\" Appellant asserted that the court did not properly impose postrelease control and failed to comply with sentencing provisions regarding mandatory fines and court costs. Appellant requested the court to declare the judgment a \"non-final appealable order\" and void, in part, due to the court's failure to correctly impose postrelease control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant attached to his motion a copy of a July 27, 2015 warrant for his arrest that the Adult Parole Authority (APA) issued. The warrant indicates that on November 24, 2015, appellant was released from prison and placed under the APA's supervision. The warrant recites that the APA believes appellant violated the conditions of his release. Appellant requested the court to void the outstanding warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In response, the state argued that the trial court advised appellant of postrelease control pursuant to the rules in effect at the time of his sentencing. The state further asserted that the court does not \"impose\" postrelease control, but instead, the APA imposes postrelease control. The state claimed that the court is simply \"obligated to advise a defendant of the rules regarding post-release control.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On March 1, 2016, the trial court overruled appellant's motion. The court found that it did not have authority to impose postrelease control for a third, fourth, or fifth degree felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On March 14, 2016, appellant filed a \"motion to find post release control void, based on the fact that the trial court failed to impose post release control as to count seven and eight, which are felonies of a first degree in the judgment entry.\" Appellant observed that the court's March 1, 2016 entry indicated that it did not have authority to impose postrelease control for third, fourth, or fifth degree felonies. He asserted that the court does have jurisdiction to impose postrelease control for first-degree felonies and pointed out that he pled guilty to two first-degree felonies. Appellant argued that the court failed to impose the mandatory five-year term of postrelease control for the felonies and requested the court to find that the court failed to properly impose postrelease control and declare his postrelease control void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On May 6, 2016, appellant filed a \"motion for summary judgment and judgment on pleadings filed on March 14, 2016 regarding void judgment.\" Appellant alleged that the trial court's January 26, 2006 judgment is void due to the failure to properly impose postrelease control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On May 12, 2016, the trial court overruled appellant's summary judgment motion. The court determined that it resolved \"these matters\" in its March 1, 2016 judgment entry. The court also found that appellant currently is imprisoned in a federal corrections institution, with approximately five and one-half years remaining. The court additionally determined that \"summary judgment is not an appropriate remedy in a criminal action of this type.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In his sole assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court improperly overruled his motion that requested the court to void the postrelease control that the APA imposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant contends that the postrelease control portion of the court's 2006 sentencing entry fails to actually impose any term of postrelease control. Appellant thus contends that the court never properly imposed postrelease control and that the outstanding warrant for his arrest for violating the terms of his postrelease control is void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The state responds that the trial court did not err by overruling appellant's summary judgment motion. The state first contends that summary judgment motions are inapplicable to criminal proceedings. The state also disputes appellant's allegation\n   that his postrelease control is void. The state asserts that the trial court complied with the sentencing statutes in effect at the time of appellant's sentencing and provided appellant with appropriate notice concerning postrelease control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Initially, we do not agree with the state that the trial court properly denied appellant's motion solely on the basis that he styled it as a \"summary judgment\" motion. Instead, courts should \"recast irregular motions into whatever category necessary to identify and establish the criteria by which the motion should be judged.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Supreme Court did not explain what procedural rules apply to this type of motion, except to state that res judicata does not prevent a court from vacating a void judgment.

We therefore do not review this appeal as an appeal from a trial court's judgment denying a summary judgment motion. Instead, appellant's motion should be recast as a motion to correct an illegal sentence and review this appeal using the void-sentence doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
