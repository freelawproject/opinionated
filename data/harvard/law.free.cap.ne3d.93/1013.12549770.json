For the reasons set forth below, this Court affirms in part and reverses in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Raymond Lance (\"Uncle Bill\") never married and did not have any children. He, however, had siblings, nieces, nephews, and great nieces. Ms. Boldman was one of Uncle Bill's nieces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Uncle Bill resided by himself on the family farm. Following a fall at home, Uncle Bill was placed in a nursing home where he remained until his death. Prior to his admission to the nursing home, Uncle Bill appointed Roger Lance as his attorney-in-fact. Despite this appointment, Ms. Boldman was handling Uncle Bill's financial affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Shortly after Uncle Bill's admission to the nursing home, some of his family members filed an application for a guardianship, which Ms. Boldman contested on Uncle Bill's behalf. Following a family meeting, it was agreed that Ms. Boldman would handle Uncle Bill's affairs, he would remain in the nursing home, and the guardianship application was withdrawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Six months after his admission to the nursing home, Uncle Bill revoked the earlier power of attorney appointing Roger Lance as his attorney-in-fact, and executed a general durable power of attorney appointing Ms. Boldman and Mr. Johnson\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as his attorneys-in-fact. He also executed a new will the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} As his attorney-in-fact, Ms. Boldman assisted Uncle Bill with his finances. She facilitated the payment of the nursing home invoices through long term care insurance, income from social security and workers' compensation, Uncle Bill's own funds, and Medicaid. Prior to Uncle Bill passing away, Ms. Boldman closed his checking account and used the funds to pay his bills. The Complainants asserted that Ms. Boldman kept the monies from the insurance proceeds, refunds from the nursing home, and the funds from the closed checking account for her own use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Additionally, Ms. Boldman facilitated Uncle Bill's directives to gift a guitar and mandolin to his great nieces, Ms. Boldman's daughters, J.W. and J.C. Upon Uncle Bill's placement in the nursing home, Ms. Boldman removed the guitar and mandolin from his home to ensure they were not damaged or thrown out while the house was being cleaned. According\n   to Ms. Boldman and her daughters, during the preceding 20 years Uncle Bill had expressed to them on various occasions his desire to give the guitar to J.W. and the mandolin to J.C., he was aware that the guitar and mandolin were given to the great nieces, and he did not object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The eight Complainants filed a complaint against Ms. Boldman for concealing and/or embezzling the assets of the Estate, challenged Uncle Bill's competency to execute the general durable power of attorney, and claimed Mr. Johnson failed to file an inventory. A hearing was held on the complaint. Ms. Boldman, her daughters, J.W. and J.C., and Melodie Kinzel, one of the Complainants, testified at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The probate court dismissed the claim against Mr. Johnson because an inventory was filed subsequent to the complaint. Additionally, the probate court dismissed the claims of Joel Lance, Gregory Lance, Charles Lance, and Gary Lance for failure to prosecute, and they do not challenge that portion of the judgment. Accordingly, this Court declines to address the assignments of error as they relate to these Appellants and the probate court's dismissal of these Appellants' claims for failure to prosecute is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} As to the claims of Roger Lance, Todd Lance, David Lance, and Melodie Kinzel (\"the Heirs\"), the probate court found Uncle Bill competent to execute the power of attorney and Ms. Boldman not guilty of concealing/embezzling the Estate's assets. The Heirs have timely appealed this judgment by asserting two assignments of error. To facilitate the analysis, this Court will address the assignments of error out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE PROBATE COURT ERRED TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE ESTATE [ ] BY ADMITTING IN EVIDENCE THE HEARSAY STATEMENTS OF [UNCLE BILL], THE DECEDENT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In the second assignment of error, the Heirs argue that the probate court erred when it admitted certain testimony of Ms. Boldman and her two daughters, J.W. and J.C., regarding Uncle Bill's statements as to his intention to gift the guitar to J.W. and the mandolin to J.C. Specifically, they argue that the statements were hearsay and not subject to admission under Evid.R. 804(B)(5). For the reasons that follow, this Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The decision to admit or exclude evidence lies in the sound discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As to the guitar and mandolin, the Heirs limited their examination of Ms. Boldman to her and her daughters' possession of the musical instruments, their lack of payment for the instruments, and the value of the instruments. The Heirs did not make any inquiry as to why Ms. Boldman and her daughters possessed the instruments or Uncle Bill's intentions as to the instruments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} After the Heirs' examination of Ms. Boldman she was questioned by her attorney. With regard to the guitar and mandolin, Ms. Boldman's attorney specifically asked her why she gave the guitar and mandolin to her daughters, if Uncle Bill was aware of the gifting of the instruments, what Uncle Bill's intentions and wishes as to the disposition of the guitar and mandolin were, and if his intentions ever changed. Ms. Boldman testified that \"Uncle Bill had always said, [J.W.] was the only one in the family that\" he wanted to give the guitar to and it was his intention to give J.C. the mandolin. According to Ms. Boldman's testimony, Uncle Bill made his intentions regarding these instruments known on different occasions during the 20 years before his death and his intentions never changed. Ms. Boldman testified that Uncle Bill was aware that the instruments had been given to his great nieces and he did not object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Ms. Boldman's counsel asked similar questions to both of her daughters during their examinations. Both of the daughters' testimony mirrored Ms. Boldman's testimony as to Uncle Bill's donative intent relative to the instruments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The Heirs repeatedly asserted hearsay objections to this line of questioning directed to Ms. Boldman and her daughters. The probate court sustained the first objection, but overruled the remaining objections. At the conclusion of Ms. Boldman's examination by all of the parties, the probate court clarified its position regarding her testimony concerning Uncle Bill's statements: \"there were a series of objections to statements made by the deceased regarding his intentions and as [the court] said, [it would] admit those and assign [the] appropriate weight and [the court] believe[s] that falls within [Evid.R.] 804(B)(5).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In its decision, the probate court held that Ms. Boldman's testimony regarding Uncle Bill's statements was admissible because the testimony was derived while she was on cross-examination to rebut the assertion that she concealed assets. The probate court's ruling, however, is not supported by the law or the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} \" 'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Evid.R. 801(C). \"[S]tatements made by a decedent would fall under the general prohibition against hearsay.\"\n   <em>\n    Mancz v.

One such hearsay exception is found in Evid.R. 804(B)(5), the \"[s]tatement by a deceased or incompetent person\" provision, which excepts from the hearsay rule admissions of the statements of one who is now deceased.

Thus, Ms. Boldman was an adverse party opposing the Estate and not a party representing the Estate. Contrary to Ms. Boldman's argument, she was not Uncle Bill's representative because 1) she had resigned as the executor of the Estate and 2) her authority under the power of attorney ended upon Uncle Bill's death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lessee of Wallace v.

Ms. Boldman's purpose is inapposite to the hearsay exception, which only permits the Estate to offer Uncle Bill's statements to rebut the testimony of the adverse party to protect the Estate's assets. Because of the nature of a R.C. 2109.50 proceeding, Evid.R. 804(B)(5) does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mancz\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.

This Court agrees. Because Ms. Boldman\n   was Uncle Bill's attorney-in-fact, the gifting of the guitar and mandolin were presumed invalid and she must prove by clear and convincing evidence that Uncle Bill intended to gift the guitar to J.W. and the mandolin to J.C. and that the transfer of the instruments was fair.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20165024\">\n    1998 WL 165024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    Bacon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003-Ohio-1301\">\n    2003-Ohio-1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%201240142\">\n    2003 WL 1240142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The power of attorney granted Ms. Boldman the authority \"[t]o take possession of and exercise control over any and all moneys, goods, chattels and effects and all other property [ ] belonging to [Uncle Bill] wheresoever found.\" Ms. Boldman testified and her answers to the requests for admission confirm that she removed the guitar and mandolin from Uncle Bill's home when it was being cleared out by the other family members and gave the instruments to her daughters. Thus, Ms. Boldman initially \"[took] possession of and exercise [d] control over\" the guitar and mandolin pursuant to the authority granted to her by the power of attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 44} As to the subsequent gifting of the guitar and mandolin to J.W. and J.C., the Heirs contend that \"[Ms.] Boldman presented no evidence that [Uncle Bill] made a gift.\" The Heirs assert the self-serving statements of Ms. Boldman and her two daughters with respect to Uncle Bill's statements are inadmissible hearsay. Based on the analysis above, this Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The probate court held that \"even if * * * the statements made to Ms. Boldman [and her daughters] by the decedent constitute inadmissible hearsay, the evidence does support the position that Ms. Boldman gave [her daughters] the instruments with the intention of carrying out the wishes of the decedent.\" The probate court, however, did not identify any of the evidence that it relied upon to support its conclusion. While this Court agrees with the probate court that Uncle Bill retained the power to gift these instruments, a review of the hearing transcript and the admitted exhibits do not reflect any evidence beyond the inadmissible hearsay evidence offered by Ms. Boldman and her daughters as to Uncle Bill's donative intent. Accordingly, Ms. Boldman has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that Uncle Bill intended to gift the guitar to J.W. and the mandolin to J.C. and that the transfer of the instruments was fair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Checking Account\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 46} The Heirs argue that Ms. Boldman closed Uncle Bill's checking account and kept the balance of $665.88. Because Ms. Boldman does not have any written records to support the disbursement of the $665.88, the Heirs allege without further support, that Ms. Boldman concealed and/or embezzled the funds for her own use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Ms. Boldman testified that she did not keep the funds for her own personal use, and instead used the funds from the closed checking account to pay Uncle's Bill's outstanding debts, such as the nursing home and credit cards. Additionally, Uncle Bill received funds for his own spending needs. While Ms. Boldman did not produce receipts or records of these debt payments and the money provided directly to Uncle Bill, she was able to testify as to what debts were paid. The Heirs, however, were unable to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Ms. Boldman kept the money from Uncle Bill's closed checking account for herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Insurance Checks and Nursing Home Refunds\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 48} The Heirs allege that while Uncle Bill was a resident at the nursing home, Ms. Boldman received a total of $22,826.85 in checks from AF &amp; L Insurance\n   Co. made payable to Uncle Bill, but she only applied $9,572.00 of those insurance funds to the payment of the nursing home costs. Thus, the Heirs assert Ms. Boldman has kept the remaining $13,254.85 in insurance proceeds for her own use. Because Ms. Boldman does not have any written records to support the disbursement of the $13,254.85, the Heirs allege without further support, that Ms. Boldman concealed and/or embezzled the funds for her own use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 49} The Heirs contend that Ms. Boldman deposited the insurance checks, including one in the amount of $13,718.85, directly into her checking account, but only paid $9,572.00 to the nursing home. As to this insurance check, the Heirs argue that the \"balance [of] $4,146.85 was not accounted for\" from an insurance check issued by AF &amp; L Insurance Co. While the Heirs have made two separate arguments on appeal regarding the insurance proceeds, the record reflects the $4,146.85 alleged to have been embezzled/concealed is included in the total amount of $13,254.85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 50} The Heirs also complain that Ms. Boldman did not deposit the insurance checks into Uncle Bill's checking account. Ms. Boldman testified that Uncle Bill's checking account had been closed because his income from social security and workers' compensation was being sent directly to the nursing home and there was no need for a checking account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Further, Ms. Boldman testified that upon closing Uncle Bill's checking account she deposited Uncle Bill's funds into her own bank account and wrote checks to pay Uncle Bill's debts. Ms. Boldman testified that she used the insurance proceeds to pay Uncle Bill's nursing home costs. Ms. Boldman asserted that whenever she received an invoice from the nursing home she would pay it immediately to ensure Uncle Bill's continued occupancy at the nursing home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The Heirs concede the nursing home invoices were paid in full and in fact, were overpaid resulting in refunds. The Heirs allege Ms. Boldman, in her capacity as the attorney-in-fact and first executor of the Estate, \"[was] the only person that could have received the refunds totaling $2,315.49\" from the nursing home and that she has concealed these refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Ms. Boldman also testified that the insurance monies were used to pay Uncle Bill's extensive credit card debt. Ms. Kinzel confirmed that Ms. Boldman paid over $10,000 of Uncle Bill's credit card debt. Ms. Boldman affirmed that she did not keep any of the insurance money for herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 54} The Heirs attempted to show that Ms. Boldman converted Uncle Bill's funds to pay off his car and then gave the car to her daughter, J.C. However, Ms. Boldman testified that she used her own credit card to loan her daughter the funds to pay off Uncle Bill's car. Additionally, when asked if she used Uncle Bill's money to pay for an addition to her home, Ms. Boldman testified that the addition to her home was completed 20 years earlier and the garage was completed five years before she was appointed as the power of attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Accordingly, the Heirs were unable to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Ms. Boldman kept the money from the insurance proceeds and nursing home refunds for herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1999 Buick Car Insurance Payment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 56} In addition to the arguments above, the Heirs argue, for the first time on appeal, that Ms. Boldman should have been found guilty because she paid $72.58 for car insurance on the 1999 Buick while it was being used by her daughter, J.C. While evidence was presented at the hearing\n   as to this issue, the Heirs did not include any arguments or request relief on this basis in their written closing argument and memorandum of law. Despite Ms. Boldman bringing this to the Heirs' attention, they did not seek leave to add any argument regarding Uncle Bill's car in their reply to Ms. Boldman's written closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 57} \"Generally, an issue need not be considered on appeal when it was apparent at the time of trial but not raised.\"\n   <em>\n    Bauer v.
