Plaintiff-appellee Specialty Executives, Inc. has filed a cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant KDH Defense Systems, Inc. (\"KDH\"), which is located in North Carolina, is a designer and manufacturer of body armor that is used by the military and law enforcement. Appellee Specialty Executives, Inc., which is located in Morrow County, Ohio, is an employment recruiter\n   that specializes in the defense industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On or about December 15, 2011, appellant entered into a Placement Search Agreement with appellee. The Agreement provided that appellee would be compensated 25% of a hired candidate's first year contracted salary. The Agreement stated that it would \"act as the legal and binding contract for all placement services between SE [appellee] and CLIENT [appellant].\" The Agreement further stated that \"CLIENT will be able to terminate this AGREEMENT with 10 days written notice remitted to SE [appellee] by CLIENT via certified mail,\" and that \"SE will be able to terminate this Agreement with ten days written notice remitted to SE (sic) by CLIENT (sic) via certified mail.\" The Agreement also provided that it could be modified or amended by a writing signed by both parties. Moreover, the Agreement stated, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The AGREEMENT shall be construed under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio. The venue of any litigation related hereto shall be in the applicable State or Federal courts in Morrow County, Ohio. In the event SE must pursue collection or legal efforts to obtain payment hereunder, SE shall be entitled to receive from CLIENT all of its cost and expenses related to the collection, both prior to and during litigation, including reasonable attorney fees and applicable finance charges. There is no provision provided in this contract for arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellee placed seven employees with appellant in accordance with such Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On or about March 25, 2014, Travis Thomas, appellee's President, contacted David Herbener, appellant's President and CEO, via email to determine if he was interested in hiring Scott Wylie. In the e-mail, Thomas stated that if appellant was interested in hiring Wylie, who Thomas stated did not have a non-competition agreement with his current employer, appellee's fee would be 30% of his contracted first year salary. Thomas attached a copy of the Fee Agreement to the email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After appellant expressed an interest in hiring Wylie after interviewing him, Thomas sent an email to Herbener on April 18, 2014 stating, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} I would recommend the below listed schedule for the placement of Scott Wylie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} 1) 6 month guarantee (if KDH meets scheduled payments and pays in full).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} 2) 30% of guaranteed salary 178K (SE's base fee for senior level placements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} 3) 5 payments of $10,680.00. First payment due April 28\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   (Scott's Start Date). Each additional payment due on the 28\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of each month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Thomas ended the email by stating that he could have the agreement drawn up and emailed to Herbener for his signature. Later on the same day, Herbener sent an email to Thomas providing that \"I need you to get to 25% and we have a deal with all else the same as you listed below.\" In an email to Thomas from Herbener dated Monday, April 21, 2014, Herbener indicated that appellant would \"go along with your 30% with the conditions that you noted below in your Friday email.\" The \"Friday email\" referred to was the email from Thomas dated April 18, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On April 21, 2014 and May 22, 2014, appellee sent David Herbener copies of the Fee Agreement that contained Thomas' electronic signature. These versions were was more detailed than the\n   earlier version and indicated that appellant would be invoiced $53,400.00, which is 30% of Wylie's alleged salary of $178,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} It was discovered shortly thereafter that Wylie's previous employer alleged that he was bound by a non-competition agreement. Appellant, through Herbener, still expressed interest in hiring Wylie. Wylie subsequently filed a lawsuit in August of 2014 against his former employer to resolve the non-competition agreement. The lawsuit was resolved on October 6, 2014 and dismissed on October 30, 2014. Appellant hired Wylie as memorialized in an Employment Agreement dated October 6, 2014. His base salary was $160,000.00 a year plus guaranteed commissions of no less than $2,000.00 a month for the first six months. On or about October 15, 2016, appellee sent appellant an invoice in the amount of $44,500.00 for Wylie's placement. Appellee on or about the same date, allegedly sent appellant an invoice in the amount of $53,400.00. Appellant refused to pay either of the invoices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant never returned to appellee a signed version of the 2014 Fee Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On November 4, 2014, appellee filed a complaint for breach of contract and unjust enrichment against appellant based upon the 2011 Agreement, demanding compensation in the amount of $44,500.00, which represents 25% of $178,000.00, attorney's fees, and interest. Appellee, in its complaint, noted that the 2011 Agreement stated, in relevant part, as follows: \"This AGREEMENT shall be construed under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio. The venue of any litigation related hereto shall be in the applicable State or Federal courts in Morrow County, Ohio.\" On January 5, 2015, appellant filed an answer to the complaint. Appellant, in its answer, claimed, in part, that the 2011 Agreement did not apply to Wylie's placement and that the Morrow County Court of Common Pleas was not a proper venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On February 18, 2015, appellee filed a Motion for Summary Judgment against appellant. Appellant, on March 3, 2015, filed a combined Memorandum in Opposition to such motion and Motion for Summary Judgment, arguing that the 2011 Agreement did not apply to the Wylie placement and that, therefore, the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellee, on April 27, 2015, filed a Motion to Amend Its Complaint. Appellee sought to amend its complaint based on appellant's position that the 2011 Agreement did not apply because there were new negotiations between appellant and appellee. Appellee, in its motion, stated that \"to the extent that it does not apply, then the contract sent to KDH on no less than two occasions after\n   <em>\n    negotiations\n   </em>\n   would govern the transaction. That latter contract actually contains terms more favorable to Specialty than the 2011 contract.\" Appellee, in its motion, stated, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The 2014 contract would have been referenced in and attached to the original Complaint filed in this action, but for some confusion on the part of the undersigned attorney regarding the sequence of events. Specifically, there had been\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   proposed contract sent to KDH at the beginning of the 2014 negotiations. But the terms of\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   contract had clearly been rejected by KDH. Thus, it was never attached. Recently the undersigned counsel became aware of the most-recent proposed contract (attached), whose terms were never rejected by KDH.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The proposed contract was the Fee Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to the Motion to Amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The trial court, pursuant to a Journal Entry filed on August 7, 2015, denied both Motions for Summary Judgment, finding that there were genuine issues of material fact that needed resolved by a trial to the trier of fact. The trial court, as memorialized in a Journal Entry filed on September 22, 2015, granted the Motion to Amend the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellant, on October 14, 2015, filed a Motion to Dismiss appellee's complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction. Appellant, in its motion, noted, in part, that it maintained no office or business facility in Ohio, that none of its' employees or representative had ever traveled to Ohio for any purpose with respect to the Wylie transaction or any other transaction with appellee, and that its only communications with appellee in Ohio regarding the Wylie transaction were by email and phone. Appellee filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion on October 21, 2015, arguing that under the 2011 Agreement, appellant agreed as follows: \"This AGREEMENT shall be construed under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio. The venue of any litigation related hereto shall be in the applicable State or Federal courts in Morrow County, Ohio.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 21} An oral hearing on the Motion to Dismiss was held on November 12, 2015. After the hearing, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court, via a Journal Entry filed on January 26, 2016, overruled the Motion to Dismiss. The trial court found that it had personal jurisdiction over appellant because the 2011 Agreement specified that it would be construed under the laws of Ohio and that any litigation should be in Morrow County. The trial court noted that the Agreement was not terminated when the parties negotiated on the placement of Scott Wylie and concluded that the parties had negotiated in good faith based on the 2011 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Thereafter, a jury trial commenced on August 15, 2016. The jury, on August 17, 2016, returned with a verdict in favor of appellee and against appellant in the amount of $51,600.00. The jury found that the 2011 Agreement did not apply to Scott Wylie and that the parties had entered into a new contractual agreement based on the exchange of e-mails plus Exhibits 7 and F, which are e-mails. Appellant, on August 22, 2016, filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the trial court's January 22, 2016 Journal Entry denying its Motion to Dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, noting that the jury found that the 2011 Agreement, which contained the agreed venue provision, did not apply. Appellee filed a memorandum, in opposition to the same on August 25, 2016. On the same date, appellee also filed a Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict pursuant to Civ.R. 50(B). Appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to the same on September 7, 2016. Appellant filed a Conditional Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict on October 11, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Pursuant to a Journal Entries filed on September 21, 2016, the trial court denied the Motion for Reconsideration and granted judgment in favor of appellee and against appellant in the amount of $51,600.00 plus interest. As memorialized in a Journal Entry filed on October 17, 2016, the trial court denied both parties' Motions for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Appellant now appeals, raising the following assignments of error on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 25} I.

Appellant, in its third assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in denying its Motion to Dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 33} As an initial matter, we note that appellee had argued that appellant waived any objection as to personal jurisdiction. A court may obtain personal jurisdiction by service of process, voluntary appearance or waiver.\n   <em>\n    Maryhew v.

We note that appellant, in its answer and throughout this case, has raised the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. We find, therefore, that appellant had not waived such issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 34} A court must have personal jurisdiction over a defendant in order to hear and determine an action.\n   <em>\n    Maryhew, supra.\n   </em>\n   A trial court's determination of whether personal jurisdiction over a party exists is a question of law, and appellate courts review questions of law under a de novo standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Information Leasing Corp. v.

The agreement provided for a service fee of 30% and, among other terms, provided that Ohio's \"laws and courts\" would govern the parties' relationship. Subsequently, on April 18, 2014, Travis Thomas sent an e-mail to David Herbener stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 47} I would recommend the below listed schedule for the placement of Scott Wylie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 48} 1) 6 month guarantee (if KDH meets scheduled payments and pays in full).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 49} 2) 30% of guaranteed salary 178K (SE's base fee for senior level placements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 50} 3) 5 payments of $10,680.00. First payment due April 28\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   (Scott's Start\n   Date). Each additional payments due on the 28\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of each month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Thomas ended the email by stating that he could have the agreement drawn up and emailed to Herbener for his signature. In response, Herbener sent Thomas an email on April 18, 2014 indicating that \"I need you to get to 25% and we have a deal with all else the same as you listed below.\" In another e-mail to Thomas dated April 21, 2014, Herbener stated that appellant \"would go along with your 30% with the conditions that you noted below in your Friday email.\" The \"Friday email\" referred to was the email from Thomas dated April 18, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Although the proposed 2014 agreement was never signed by appellant, we find that there was competent, substantial evidence that the parties entered into a binding contract via their e-mails. We find that there was sufficient evidence supporting the jury's verdict that there was an offer, acceptance and consideration and that the jury's verdict was not contrary to law. The terms of the parties' agreement were sufficiently definite to be enforced. While appellee argues that the 2011 agreement applies because it was never terminated in writing as required by its terms, we agree with the trial court that substantial, competent evidence supported the jury's verdict and that reasonable minds could reach different conclusions about the evidence and that the jury's verdict, therefore, should stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Moreover, as noted by the trial court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Waiver of any terms of a contract may be either by subsequent contracts, written or oral, or by the acts and conduct of the parties\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . A waiver may be expressed or implied from conduct. There does not appear to be anything under Ohio law that would prevent a new contract from superseding the old contract for the implied or intended purpose of the new contract only. The jury in this case, as the trier of facts, determined that this was a new contract based upon the e-mails. Ohio law does not mandate that the former contract be extinguished, and Ohio law would allow for the provisions raised by the Plaintiff to be waived, specifically that all contracts for placement must be through the 2011 agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 54} We agree with the trial court that appellee, through its conduct, waived its right to have the 2011 Agreement to apply to all placements and to require a written termination of the same. It would be illogical for appellee to require appellant to provide written termination of the 2011 Agreement when it was appellee, and not appellant, that sought apply the 2011 Agreement to Wylie. Moreover, there was testimony at trial that appellee never intended the 2011 agreement to apply to Wylie's placement, but that appellee intended to enter into an entire new contract with respect to such placement. Transcript at 167-169. We note that the Fee Agreement electronically signed by Thomas on behalf of appellee that was sent via e-mail is specifically tailored to Wylie, stating what its commission would be based on his alleged salary. There further was testimony that, during the negotiations, the 2011 Agreement was never mentioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not err in denying appellee's Motion for a Directed Verdict or Motion for JNOV. We further find that the jury's verdict was not contrary to the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Based on the foregoing, appellee's first, second and third assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   APPEAL ASSIGNMENT II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Appellant, in his second assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in denying its post-trial Motion for Reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Appellant, on August 22, 2016, filed a Motion for Reconsideration, seeking reconsideration of the trial court's January 26, 2016 Journal Entry denying appellant's Motion to Dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Appellant, in its Motion for Reconsideration, argued that the trial court's decision to deny was based on its preliminary finding that the December 15, 2011 Agreement, which contained the forum selection clause, applied to the Wylie placement and that the jury determined that the 2011 Agreement did not apply. Appellant argued, therefore, that the trial court did not have personal jurisdiction over appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 59} As is discussed above, we find that the jury did not err in finding that a new contract was created by the e-mails exchanged by the parties. As part of the e-mails, appellee sent appellant a copy of its proposed Fee Agreement with respect to Wylie. The agreement provided that \"[s]ince we are performing our work in the state of Ohio, we both agree that its laws and the courts of the state of Ohio shall govern this relationship.\" We find that this language, which was not objected to by appellant, became part of the parties' 2014 agreement. Although not relating to venue, we find that appellant's due process rights were not violated in this case. As noted by the trial court, appellant was provided with notice and fully participated in the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss and the trial in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Appellant's second assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Accordingly, the judgment of the Morrow County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   By: Gwin, P.J. and Earle Wise, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    See Ohio Farmers' Ins.
