Additionally, Appellee/Cross-Appellant, Bank of America, N.A. (\"Bank of America\"), appeals from the court's judgment. This Court affirms in part and reverses in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On November 29, 2007, John Edwards signed a $151,800 note in favor of Ross Mortgage Corporation (\"Ross Mortgage\") for certain real property located on Cooper Foster Road in Vermillion (\"the Property\"). The FHA-insured loan was secured by a mortgage on the Property in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\"MERS\"), as nominee for Ross Mortgage. The mortgage identified John Edwards as the mortgagor, but Stacey Edwards also signed the mortgage for the purpose of releasing her dower interest. Both the note and the mortgage for the Property were later assigned to other banks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 12, 2014, Bank of America filed a complaint in foreclosure against the Edwards, alleging that it was the current holder of the note and mortgage for the Property. Bank of America alleged that the Edwards had defaulted on the note on September 1, 2009, and that it was entitled to accelerate the balance of the loan and seek a decree of foreclosure. The Edwards filed an answer with leave of court and raised numerous defenses. Relevant to this appeal, they alleged that Bank of America lacked standing and had brought suit without first satisfying certain conditions precedent to foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Bank of America ultimately moved for summary judgment, and the Edwards filed a brief in opposition. The court then received a reply brief from Bank of America, a sur-reply from the Edwards, and a response from Bank of America. Following its review of the filings, the trial court issued its judgment. The court found that Bank of America had standing to bring suit, but was not entitled to summary judgment. The court found that Bank of America had failed to prove that, before filing suit, it had complied with certain HUD regulations that were conditions precedent to foreclosure. The court wrote: \"[Bank of America's] Motion for Summary Judgement is denied, [and its] complaint is hereby dismissed without prejudice. This is a dismissal on the merits. Case Closed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After the court entered judgment, the Edwards filed a motion to clarify, noting that the court simultaneously had dismissed the matter without prejudice and had ordered a dismissal on the merits. The Edwards asked the court to specify that its dismissal was with prejudice rather than without prejudice. Before the trial court addressed the Edwards' motion, both the Edwards and Bank of America appealed from the court's original judgment entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} This Court consolidated the Edwards' and Bank of America's appeals for purposes of briefing, argument, and decision. Their appeals are now before us and, collectively, raise four assignments of error\n   for our review. For ease of analysis, we rearrange several of the assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Before turning to the merits of this appeal, this Court pauses to address two points that concern the scope of our review in this matter. First, a dismissal without prejudice is ordinarily not a final, appealable order because it \"constitutes a dismissal other than on the merits * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Smirz v. Smirz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-3869\">\n    2014-Ohio-3869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20N.E.3d%20868\">\n    18 N.E.3d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10. Here, however, the trial court specifically disposed of this matter \"on the merits\" with the intention of prohibiting Bank of America from proceeding against the Edwards on the basis of their current loan default. As further explained below, the court mistakenly referred to the dismissal as one \"without prejudice\" before later attempting to amend its entry to reflect that the dismissal was \"with prejudice.\" Under these particular facts and circumstances, the general bar against appeals from dismissals without prejudice does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20N.E.3d%20868\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court's judgment entry constitutes a final, appealable order from which the parties' may seek relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Second, this matter involves several procedural abnormalities that we note, but reserve judgment upon due to the arguments raised on appeal. We note that only Bank of America moved for summary judgment, but rather than entering judgment in its favor or finding genuine issues of material fact remained for trial, the court entered a judgment of dismissal in favor of a nonmoving party (i.e., the Edwards). We further note that the basis for the trial court's dismissal on the merits was that the bank had not satisfied a condition precedent to foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fifth Third Mtge.

Yagusic averred that she had personal knowledge of Bank of America's business records, including those records associated with the loan on the Property. She averred that Bank of America, directly or through an agent, held the note for the loan at the time of filing its foreclosure complaint and that \"the original note was sent to counsel for [Bank of America's] office prior to the filing of the Complaint at counsel's request.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yagusic attached a copy of the note to her affidavit and incorporated it by reference as a true and accurate copy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Yagusic also attached to her affidavit a copy of the mortgage that the Edwards signed and an assignment of that mortgage from MERS, as nominee for Ross Mortgage, to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, FKA Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP. Yagusic attested to the fact that, on July 1, 2011, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP merged with Bank of America. To evidence her attestation of the merger, she incorporated by reference (1) a copy of the Institutional History for BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP from the National Information Center; and (2) a copy of a Certificate of Merger from the Office of the Secretary of State in Texas. Both documents indicate that, effective July 1, 2011, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP merged with Bank of America.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The copy of the note for the Property that Yagusic attached to her complaint contains four endorsements. Specifically, it contains: (1) a special endorsement from Ross Mortgage to Countrywide Bank, FSB; (2) a special endorsement from Countrywide Bank, FSB to Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP; (3) a special endorsement from Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP to Countrywide Bank, FSB; and (4) a blank endorsement by \"Bank of America, N.A. successor by merger to Countrywide Bank, FSB.\" Although all four endorsements are undated, the blank endorsement by Bank of America is stamped below the other three endorsements that appear on the note. In her affidavit, Yagusic attested to the fact that, on April 27, 2009, Countrywide Bank, FSB was acquired by Bank of America. To evidence her attestation of the merger, she incorporated by reference a copy of the Institutional History of \"Centennial Branch\" from the National Information Center. The Institutional History indicates that, on April 27, 2009, Countrywide Bank, FSB was acquired by Bank of America.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, the endorsements on the note (1) from Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP to Countrywide Bank FSB, and (2) from Bank of America in blank are both signed by the same individual: \"Michele Sjolander.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The Edwards opposed Bank of America's motion for summary judgment on the basis that the bank had not shown that it was the current holder of either the note on the Property or their mortgage. The Edwards argued that Bank of America had failed to set forth \"legitimate summary judgment evidence\" that it had acquired Countrywide Bank FSB, such that it had the authority to endorse the note in blank following the last special endorsement to Countrywide Bank FSB. They asserted that none of the documents attached to Yagusic's affidavit were business records of Bank of America, such that she could attest to their veracity on the basis of personal knowledge. Likewise, they challenged Bank of America's evidence with respect to the chain of assignment on their mortgage. They argued that Bank of America failed to explain why BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP would have been assigned their mortgage when, according to the endorsements on their note, that entity never came into possession of their note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In response to the Edwards' brief in opposition, Bank of America filed a reply brief and another affidavit. Its second affidavit was from Celia Hernandez, another one of its assistant vice presidents. Hernandez averred that she had personal knowledge of Bank of America's business records and that she had personally examined the records before completing her affidavit. She further averred that \"from a review of the business records Countrywide Bank, FSB * * * merged with and into Bank of America, National Association.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Upon review, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred when it determined that Bank of America had standing to commence suit against the Edwards. \"The holder of a note endorsed in blank is the possessor of the note.

Bank of America set forth evidence that the Edwards' note was endorsed in blank and that it was in possession of their note when it filed its complaint. Further, it set forth evidence that it previously (1) had merged with Countrywide Bank, FSB, such that it had the authority to endorse the note in blank, and (2) had merged with BAC Home Loan Servicing, LP, such that it had an interest in the Edwards' mortgage. Its first affiant attested to the fact that Bank of America had merged with both entities and set forth documents confirming the mergers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.

In response, the Edwards failed to set forth any evidence showing that Bank of America had not, in fact, merged with those entities before filing its complaint. Thus, there was no conflicting evidence in the record so as to create a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether Bank of America was the holder of the note and mortgage at the time it filed its complaint.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PNC Bank, Natl.

The record supports the trial court's conclusion that the Edwards' answer satisfied the pleading requirements of Civ.R. 9(C). Thus, Bank of America's argument to the contrary lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 26} It was Bank of America's assertion that the Edwards defaulted on the loan on the Property on September 1, 2009. In seeking summary judgment, Bank of America set forth: (1) a copy of a notice of intent to accelerate the loan, dated November 24, 2009; and (2) a copy of a letter, dated March 8, 2012, from Bank of America to John Edwards, informing him that a representative from Titanium Solutions would be visiting his home within the next seven to ten days to review possible loan and assistance options. Yagusic, one of the bank's affiants, incorporated the documents by reference in her affidavit and attested to the fact that the letter dated March 8th was issued to John Edwards on that date and \"addressed a face to face meeting * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In their brief in opposition, the Edwards argued that none of Bank of\n   America's evidence showed that it had either conducted a face-to-face meeting with John Edwards or made a reasonable effort to do so \"before three full monthly installments due on the mortgage [were] unpaid.\" 24 C.F.R. 203.604(b). They noted that there was no evidence that the letter the bank allegedly sent on March 8, 2012, was sent by certified mail and, in any event, the letter was dated several years after the alleged default. They attached to their brief the affidavit of John Edwards. In his affidavit, he averred that he never had a face-to-face meeting with Bank of America or any other lender, never received a loan modification, did not recall ever receiving any letter regarding a face-to-face meeting, and did not recall any representative from Bank of America ever visiting his property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In response to the Edwards' brief in opposition, Bank of America filed a reply brief in which it included the affidavit of its second affiant, Hernandez. Hernandez averred that she had personal knowledge of Bank of America's business records and that those records showed that four field visits were made to the Property in an attempt to arrange a face-to-face meeting. She averred that those visits occurred on September 18, 2011, September 20, 2011, September 21, 2011, and March 12, 2012. She further averred that Bank of America sent two letters to the Edwards regarding a face-to-face meeting. She attested to the fact that those letters were sent on September 7, 2011, and March 8, 2012. She did not aver, however, that the letters were sent by certified mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 29} There is no dispute that the loan and the mortgage on the Property were subject to the regulations contained in 24 C.F.R. 203.604. As noted, 24 C.F.R. 203.604(b) specifically requires a lender to have \"a face-to-face interview with the mortgagor, or make a reasonable effort to arrange such a meeting,\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   three full monthly installments due on the mortgage are unpaid.\" (Emphasis added.) Bank of America's own evidence demonstrated that any attempts it made to arrange a face-to-face meeting with John Edwards came well after that three month deadline. Although the default on the loan occurred on September 1, 2009, the earliest date that Bank of America allegedly issued John Edwards a letter regarding a face-to-face meeting was September 7, 2011, more than two years later. Thus, the trial court correctly concluded that the undisputed evidence in the record established Bank of America failed to comply with 24 C.F.R. 203.604(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Bank of America asserts that the result in this case is unduly harsh because the \"timing aspect\" of 24 C.F.R. 203.604(b) itself \"is not a condition precedent to foreclosure * * *.\" The bank asks us to conclude that the three month deadline is merely aspirational in nature and that, so long as the bank complied with the face-to-face meeting requirement before filing for foreclosure, it should not be penalized for its failure to strictly comply with the deadline. Based upon this record, however, we need not decide that issue. Bank of America failed to set forth any evidence that a face-to-face meeting ever occurred with John Edwards. Therefore, to show that it had complied with 24 C.F.R. 203.604(b), it had to set forth evidence that it made a reasonable effort to arrange such a meeting. 24 C.F.R. 203.604(d), which defines a \"reasonable effort\" for purposes of the regulation, \"requires both a certified letter\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   at least one trip to the mortgaged property, unless an exception applies.\" (Emphasis sic.)\n   <em>\n    Awadallah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-3753\">\n    2015-Ohio-3753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20N.E.3d%20481\">\n    41 N.E.3d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 29. Bank of America never set forth any evidence that the letters it allegedly sent to John Edwards were sent by certified mail, despite the Edwards specifically raising that argument\n   in their brief in opposition. Accordingly, even assuming the three month deadline contained in 24 C.F.R. 203.604(b) is merely aspirational, Bank of America failed to set forth evidence that it\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   complied with 24 C.F.R. 203.604(d)'s reasonable effort requirements before filing suit. As such, the trial court did not err by dismissing the matter on the merits in favor of the Edwards.
