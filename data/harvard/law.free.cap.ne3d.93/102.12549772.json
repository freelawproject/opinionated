The issue before this court is whether a school district's hiring, retention, and/or supervision of a high school basketball coach is a governmental function for the purposes of sovereign immunity. For the following reasons, we reverse the decision of the court below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On June 12, 2015, plaintiffs-appellees, Jaimie Wilson and Elizabeth Ziemski, filed a Complaint in the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas against defendant-appellant, Jefferson Area Local School District-Board of Education, and others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint alleged, inter alia, that Donald McCormack sexually assaulted both plaintiffs while employed by the Jefferson Board of Education as the assistant girls' basketball coach at Jefferson High School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The plaintiffs raised claims against the Board of Education for the negligent hiring, retention, or supervision of McCormack (Count Twelve), the failure to report abuse as required by R.C. 2151.421 (Count Thirteen), for McCormack's conduct under various theories of vicarious liability (Count Fourteen), and wanton and reckless behavior in failing to take reasonable actions to prevent the sexual assaults (Count Fifteen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On July 23, 2015, the Board of Education filed its Answer, raising the affirmative defense of statutory immunity under R.C. 2744.01 et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 10, 2015, the Board of Education filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , based, in part, on the position that it \"is entitled to statutory immunity on all claims under R.C. \u00a7 2744.02(A)(1).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On October 6, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a Memorandum in Opposition to the Board of Education's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Thereafter, the Board of Education filed a Motion for Leave to File Reply in Support of Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings,\n   <em>\n    Instanter\n   </em>\n   on October 19, 2015, and a Supplement to Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on December 7, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On July 15, 2016, the trial court issued a Judgment Entry in which it granted, in part, the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and overruled the Motion for Leave to File Reply in Support of Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings,\n   <em>\n    Instanter\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court dismissed Count Thirteen as it pertained to plaintiff Wilson for the reason that R.C. 2151.421 (the mandatory reporting statute) was not enacted until after McCormack's abuse of Wilson had ended as averred in the Complaint and the statute did not apply retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court denied the balance of the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.

However,\n   <em>\n    Allied Erecting\n   </em>\n   did not overrule the holding in\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   that the sponsorship of cheerleading events constitutes a governmental function. Rather, the court in\n   <em>\n    Allied Erecting\n   </em>\n   took exception with conclusion that R.C. 2744.02(B) should be construed liberally in favor of political subdivisions defined as such by R.C. 2744.01(F).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead of promoting a liberal or narrow construction of a political subdivision's immunity (at least those specifically listed in R.C. 2744.01(F) ), the court reaffirmed the approach based on the statutory language of R.C. Chapter 2744: \"When deciding whether a political subdivision is engaged in a governmental or proprietary function pursuant to R.C. 2744.01(G)(1)(b), a court should look to the particular activity the subdivision is engaged in and decide whether that particular activity is of the type customarily engaged in by nongovernmental persons.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 31} This court takes no exception with the conclusion reached by\n   <em>\n    Allied Erecting\n   </em>\n   which does not alter the outcome of the present case. Here, the provision of a public system of education is expressly defined as a governmental function by R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(c), and, for the reasons set forth above, the hiring, retention, and supervision of a high school basketball coach is an inherent part of that activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The sole assignment of error is with merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 33} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas, denying the Board of Education judgment on the pleadings based on the immunity afforded by R.C. 2744.02(B), is reversed and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The original Complaint identified the Jefferson Area Local School District as a defendant. As part of its September 10, 2015 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, the Jefferson Area School District argued that \"a school district is not\n    <em>\n     sui juris\n    </em>\n    ; rather, it is the board of education that must be sued.\" An Amended Complaint was filed on October 16, 2015, with leave of the trial court, to amend the name of this defendant by adding the \"specifier\" Board of Education.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    This Motion was jointly filed with Defendants Locy and Holmes and asserted other grounds for judgment not relevant to this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Locy and Holmes were identified as appellants in the Notice of Appeal but were subsequently dismissed therefrom by this court on November 7, 2016.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    It should be noted that resolution of these cases ultimately turned on the applicability of immunities afforded to political subdivisions contained in Revised Code Chapter 2744.03, the provisions of which have yet to be considered in the course of the present proceedings. As noted by the trial court, the exceptions contained in R.C. 2744.03 typically require the \"development of facts through evidence\" and, therefore, are properly raised through a motion for summary judgment rather than judgment on the pleadings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    This conclusion was based upon an erroneous interpretation of the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Greene Cty.
