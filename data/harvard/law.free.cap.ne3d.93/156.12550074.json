R. 41, without the company's consent. As the Company's and BWC's assigned error is meritorious, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} While Antoun was working he was involved in a vehicle accident on September 17, 2012. Antoun's workers' compensation claim was initially allowed for cervical sprain /strain and lumbar sprain /strain, and later additionally allowed by the Industrial Commission for cervical disc displacement C5-C6. On November 14, 2013, the Company appealed the Industrial Commission decision allowing Antoun's claim for cervical disc displacement to the common pleas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Two years later, following the completion of discovery and several trial continuances as a result of Antoun changing attorneys three times and his separately pending personal injury case, on December 21, 2015, Antoun filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss his complaint, which he based on alternative grounds. Curiously,\n   he first relied on Civ. R. 41(A)(1)(a), which governs notices of dismissal and does not require judicial action, relying on\n   <em>\n    Ferguson v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-4499\">\n    2015-Ohio-4499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20N.E.3d%20804\">\n    42 N.E.3d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , noting that the Eighth District held that R.C. 4123.512(D) was unconstitutional, but Antoun made no argument to support that contention. Second, Antoun relied upon Civ. R. 41(A)(2) as the basis for his motion; that subsection of the rule controls motions for dismissal. The company did not consent to the dismissal of the administrative appeal and opposed Antoun's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Although it was the Company's appeal, a unique rule governs workers' compensation administrative appeals. After the employer files a notice of appeal with the Industrial Commission, the claimant must file a complaint with the common pleas court. R.C. 4123.512. Further, the appeal to the common pleas court is a complete de novo review which permits the parties to introduce new evidence, and the burden remains on the claimant to justify the award, regardless of which party is appealing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20N.E.3d%20804\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court granted Antoun's motion to voluntarily dismiss the complaint without elaboration, merely referring to Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a) rather than Civ.R. 41(A)(2). Also, there was no discussion or mention of\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Workers' Compensation System\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Some context before addressing the issue on appeal is beneficial. Ohio's workers' compensation system is a statutory scheme, the fundamental purpose of which is, inter alia to protect injured workers and employers from losses because of workplace accidents, to compensate injured workers and ensure employers pay premiums that reasonably correspond with the risk they present to the system. See\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Superior Foundry, Inc. v. Indus.

This vests jurisdiction in the common pleas court. But regardless of which party appeals, the claimant is always in the procedural posture as the plaintiff and the employer as the defendant. Therefore, the claimant must file a complaint stating why they are entitled to benefits or to continue to receive benefits. Even if the employer initiated the appeal, without any reference to the administrative hearings, the claimant must, \"in effect, re-establish his workers' compensation claim to the satisfaction of the common pleas court even though the claimant has previously satisfied a similar burden at the administrative level.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Zuljevic v.

Further pleadings shall be had in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure, provided that service of summons on such petition shall not be required and\n   <em>\n    provided that the claimant may not dismiss the complaint without the employer's consent if the employer is the party that filed the notice of appeal to court pursuant to this section.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   R.C. 4123.512(D) (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} At issue in this appeal is the interplay between the R.C. 4123.512(D) Consent Provision and Civ.R. 41, which must be examined through the lens of Civ.R. 1(C). While a claimant has control over the fate of their own appeal when they challenge an Industrial Commission determination and choose to voluntarily dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 41, such is not the case for the employer. Even when the employer appeals, the claimant is still the plaintiff who files the complaint in the common pleas court. Thus, Civ.R. 41 vests the claimant with control over the fate of the employer's appeal. Hence, the question before us is whether a claimant's attempt to voluntarily dismiss the employer's appeal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A) subparts (1) and/or (2) are prohibited by the R.C. 4123.215(D) Consent Provision. This is an issue of first impression in this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Antoun's motion to dismiss alternatively sought dismissal pursuant to Civ. R. 41(A)(1) and (A)(2). Antoun filed his contradictory pleading-a notice of dismissal which does not require judicial action and alternatively a motion seeking an order of dismissal by the trial court-in order to advocate the adoption by the trial court of the rationale articulated in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   , supra. Antoun reasoned that because the Eighth District held in a declaratory judgment appeal that the R.C. 4123.215(D) Consent Provision was unconstitutional, he was no longer precluded from filing a notice of dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1). Secondarily, Antoun sought a dismissal order from the court pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(2), but merely citied to the rule without articulating any argument in support. This was likely an attempt to persuade the trial court in this case to extend the holding in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   to subpart (A)(2); in the underlying workers' compensation administrative appeal in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson,\n   </em>\n   the claimant moved to dismiss the employer's appeal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(2), which the employer opposed and the trial court denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The administrative appeal proceedings in the underlying workers'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   compensation case were stayed pending resolution of the\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   declaratory judgment proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 13} However, on appeal, Antoun concedes the Consent Provision does preclude a claimant's unilateral voluntary dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1) of an employer's administrative appeal, citing\n   <em>\n    Thorton v. Montville Plastics &amp; Rubber, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4268830\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/121/124/\">\n    121 Ohio St.3d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-360\">\n    2009-Ohio-360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.E.2d%20482\">\n    902 N.E.2d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14 (2009) ( R.C. 4123.512(D) ended claimant's ability to unilaterally dismiss administrative appeal complaint in an employer appeal; employer must consent). Moreover, he has abandoned his constitutional challenge to the Consent Provision relative to subpart (A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Instead, Antoun contends there is an important distinction between a unilateral subpart (A)(1) dismissal which does not require judicial action, and a court order granting a motion for voluntary dismissal pursuant to subpart (A)(2). Antoun maintains that because he alternatively sought an order from the trial court voluntarily dismissing his complaint pursuant to Civ. R. (A)(2), this is judicial action rather than his unilateral action and thus not precluded by the Consent Provision. Antoun continues to challenge the constitutionality of the Consent Provision relative to subpart (A)(2), but limits his argument to separation of powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 15} BWC and the Company defended the constitutionality of R.C. 4123.512(D) in the trial court and on appeal, advancing due process, equal protection and separation of powers arguments, and contending that voluntary dismissals of an employer appeal by a claimant under Civ.R. 41(A)(1) and (2) both require employer consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Thus, we have before us an issue of statutory and rule interpretation as well as constitutional issues. Because we can resolve this appeal based upon the language in R.C. 4123.512(D), Civ.R. 41(A) and Civ.R. 1(C) without considering constitutional arguments, we will decline to address the latter. \"[W]hen a case can be decided on other than a constitutional basis, we are bound to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Thus, we will measure the pertinent language of the Consent Provision against Civ.R. 41(A)(1) and (2) in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Regarding a notice of dismissal, \"a\n   <em>\n    plaintiff, without order of court\n   </em>\n   , may dismiss all claims asserted by that plaintiff against a defendant by ... filing a notice of dismissal ...\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   [there is] a counterclaim which cannot remain pending for independent adjudication by the court[.]\" Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a) (emphasis added). Importantly, the Ohio Supreme Court held the Consent Provision prevented a claimant from unilaterally dismissing an employer's administrative appeal.\n   <em>\n    Thorton\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. We reach the same conclusion. A notice of dismissal is a unilateral action as it does not require judicial action; dismissal is accomplished by the claimant merely filing the notice. Further, the counterclaim referenced in Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a) is akin to the employer's administrative appeal; if the claimant-plaintiff dismisses the complaint, the employer's administrative appeal cannot remain pending for adjudication because it was dismissed. As an aside, it is debatable whether Antoun filed a notice of dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a), given that he moved for dismissal in the alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 23} We next direct the third inquiry of Civ.R. 1(C)(8) to Antoun's motion to voluntarily dismiss. \"[A]\n   <em>\n    claim shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance\n   </em>\n   except upon order of the court\n   <em>\n    and upon terms and conditions\n   </em>\n   as the court deems proper. Civ.R. 41(A)(2) (emphasis added). Where a claimant-plaintiff's motion for voluntary dismissal of the employer-defendant's appeal is opposed and granted, it is a unilateral act prohibited by R.C. 4123.512(D) because it was made\n   <em>\n    at the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    plaintiff's instance.\n   </em>\n   Further, as it was granted contrary to R.C. 4123.512(D), it was not dismissed upon proper terms and conditions as contemplated by Civ.R. 41(A)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The Consent Provision is the specific procedure designed to prevent workers' compensation claimants from unilaterally and unduly preempting the resolution of the employer's appeal. The statute serves the stated legislative purpose of timely resolving workers' compensation appeals, see R.C. 4123.512(I), as well as the practical purpose of protecting State funds from abuse. Thus, the third inquiry of Civ.R. 1(C)(8) dictates that the statute supersedes the rule. The Consent Provision prohibits Antoun from pursuing dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1) and (2); the rule is clearly inapplicable as it alters the basic statutory purpose of the Consent Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Moreover, the Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that where a statute specifically requires procedures different from the civil rules, the statute controls.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Fowler v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1726195\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/68/357/#p360\">\n    68 Ohio St.3d 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360-1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=626%20N.E.2d%20950\">\n    626 N.E.2d 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (\"[s]ince the paternity statutes specifically require a judgment regarding the existence or nonexistence of the father-child relationship unless a compromise is reached between the mother and the alleged father with approval of the court prior to a judgment, the different procedure, according to R.C. 3111.08(A), supersedes the voluntary dismissal provisions of Civ.R. 41(A).\") In a similar vein, R.C. 4123.512(D) supersedes Civ.R. 41(A), because the statute specifically requires the employer's consent before its workers' compensation appeal can be dismissed by the claimant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 26} As a final observation, the language of the Consent Provision is akin to language in Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(b) governing stipulated dismissals which requires consent of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   parties, as dictated by R.C. 4123.512(D). Accordingly, the trial court erred by granting Antoun's motion to dismiss, and BWC and the Company's assignment of error is meritorious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In sum, when applying the rule of construction in Civ.R. 1(C)(8), we hold that there is a direct conflict between Civ.R. 41 and R.C. 4123.512(D). A workers' compensation appeal is a special statutory proceeding; and, permitting a claimant-plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an employer appeal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1) and (2) in employer administrative appeals alters the basic statutory purpose for which the Consent Provision was enacted, see R.C. 4123.512(I) ; thus, Civ.R. 41 is inapplicable. Accordingly, the trial court should not have granted Antoun's motion for voluntary dismissal and Defendants-Appellants' sole assignment of error is meritorious. The judgment of the trial court is reversed and this matter is remanded for adjudication of the Company's administrative appeal on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Donofrio, J., dissenting; see dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Robb, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Ferguson,\n    </em>\n    the basis of the claimant's motion to voluntarily dismiss pursuant to Civ.R.41(A)(2) was two-fold; he needed surgery and his expert was not available; however, the claimant did not seek a continuance, opting to seek dismissal instead.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-48\">\n   DONOFRIO, J. dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   I respectfully dissent to the majority's opinion herein in that a plain reading of R.C. 4123.512(D) requires that the trial court's decision be affirmed. The so-called Consent Provision states in pertinent part: \"that the claimant may not dismiss the complaint without the employer's consent if the employer is the party that filed the notice of appeal\". The statute clearly states \"the claimant may not dismiss the complaint\" which clearly prohibits the claimant from filing a Civ. R. 41(A)(1)(a) unilateral notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice. In this case the trial\n   court granted a Civ. R. 41(A)(2) motion to dismiss without prejudice which I feel the statute clearly does not address. The court dismissed the action in this case, not the claimant which Civ. R. 41(A)(1)(a) permits.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
