Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Denver Ingram, appeals the judgment of the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas, sentencing him to 72 months in prison following his guilty plea to two counts of aggravated trafficking in drugs. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On July 1, 2015, the Sandusky County Grand Jury entered a seven-count indictment against appellant, charging him with two counts of aggravated trafficking in drugs in violation of 2925.03(A)(1)(C)(1)(b), felonies of the third degree; two counts of endangering children in violation of 2919.22(B)(6), felonies of the third degree; one count of illegal assembly of chemicals for manufacture of drugs in violation of 2925.041(A), a felony of the second degree; one count of illegal manufacture of drugs in violation of 2925.04(A), a felony of the second degree; and one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity in violation of 2923.32(A)(1), a felony of the first degree. The indictment specified that appellant manufactured methamphetamine, a schedule II drug, from supplies purchased by other persons involved in the criminal activity and sold half a gram of methamphetamine in the vicinity of a juvenile and less than 1,000 feet from an elementary school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On July 25, 2016, pursuant to appellant's application and based on his indigent circumstances, the trial court appointed counsel to represent appellant in this case. On September 15, 2016, appellant pled guilty to two counts of aggravated trafficking in drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1)(C)(1)(b), felonies of the third degree. The remaining counts in the indictment were dismissed. Following his guilty plea, appellant was sentenced to 36 months for each offense, to be served consecutively for an aggregate sentence of 72 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Subsequent to the trial court's imposition of sentence, appellant filed a pro se motion for delayed appeal which was granted by the court. Counsel was appointed for purposes of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On appeal, appellant assigns three errors for our review, which he groups together as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The convictions of Denver L. Ingram, Jr. (\"Appellant\") must be vacated on the basis that [ (1) ] Appellant was deprived\n   of his constitutional right to retain an attorney of his choice, [ (2) ] the Trial Court imposed an unconstitutional trial tax by threatening Appellant with additional prison time should Appellant not accept a plea bargain and be found guilty after exercising his constitutional right to retain an attorney of his choice, and [ (3) ] Appellant's statutory right to a speedy trial was violated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In the first assignment of error, appellant argues that he was deprived of his constitutional right to retain an attorney of his choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states: \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" This fundamental right is preserved in state actions by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Gideon v.

Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11640521\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/145/#p148\">\n    83 F.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148 (6th Cir. 1996).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Here, appellant contends that the trial court imposed upon him a court appointed attorney rather than allowing him to retain a paid attorney. In addition, appellant argues that the trial court exerted improper and significant pressure on him to accept a plea bargain imposing a six year sentence instead of retaining a new attorney and facing a harsher sentence at trial. Appellant specifically refers to the trial court's statement \"Well, how you going to feel if-if-you walk out of a trial convicted and you get 20 years, let's say? How will you feel then?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The state asserts that the trial court's comments were not threats or undue pressure for appellant to forego his constitutional right to an attorney of his choosing. In the context of the entire court proceedings, the state contends that the trial court's comments were offered to explain that going to trial with a new attorney would leave appellant susceptible to a harsher sentence than the negotiated sentence that would expire upon appellant's rejection of the proposed plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Having reviewed the entire record, we find the trial court did not violate appellant's right to retain an attorney of his choice. While appellant stated before the court \"Just, I need to seek-seek better counsel, Your Honor\" and stated his desire to retain a \"paid lawyer,\" he did not express any specific dissatisfaction or conflict with his appointed attorney's representation. In addition, the court pointed out that appellant had failed to request new counsel for several months leading up to the hearing. Indeed, the record shows that appellant's initial application for appointed counsel was granted on July 25, 2016. Appellant failed to request new counsel until September 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Moreover, we find no evidence that the trial court actually deprived appellant of his right to hire a lawyer of his choosing. In addressing appellant's belief that the six year sentence he was facing under the terms of the plea agreement was more then he deserved, the trial court discussed the maximum prison sentence it could impose upon appellant if he were convicted on all counts, as opposed to accepting the plea agreement. Thereafter, the trial court granted a recess for appellant to confer with his appointed counsel to discuss his options. Following the recess, appellant decided to accept the plea agreement and pled guilty to two counts of aggravated trafficking in drugs. During the Crim.R. 11 colloquy that followed his conference with his appointed counsel, appellant confirmed that he was satisfied with his appointed counsel's representation and he was entering his guilty plea of his own free will and choice. Thus, the trial court did not deprive appellant of his right to retain counsel of his choosing. Accordingly, we find appellant's first assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In appellant's second assignment of error, appellant asserts that he was subjected to an unconstitutional trial tax because the trial court threatened him with significant prison time if appellant requested an adjournment to retain a private attorney. Furthermore, appellant contends that he was subjected to prosecutorial vindictiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Concerning the validity of a guilty plea, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that \"unless a plea is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made, it is invalid.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843146\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/119/239/#p243\">\n    119 Ohio St.3d 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-3748\">\n    2008-Ohio-3748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20N.E.2d%20462\">\n    893 N.E.2d 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather than pressuring appellant to accept the plea agreement, the trial court's statements described appellant's available options and the potential consequences of those exercising those options. The trial court did not threaten or guarantee that appellant would receive a harsher sentence if he sought new counsel and proceeded to trial. As described above, the trial court explained appellant's constitutional rights pursuant to Crim.R. 11, and appellant's responses on the record confirmed that he entered the guilty plea voluntarily and knowingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Next, we turn to appellant's claim that he was a target of prosecutorial vindictiveness.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   To punish a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation \"of the most basic sort.\"\n   <em>\n    Bordenkircher v.

Therefore, R.C. 2941.401 is applicable in this case. The record also shows that appellant raised concerns to the trial court regarding his speedy trial rights. Specifically, appellant alleged that he was unaware of a holder or detainer to assert his notice under R.C. 2941.401 and also inquired about time credit from his previous sentence. However, following the prosecutor's response regarding sentencing credit only, appellant stated he still wanted to proceed with his guilty plea. As addressed under the first assignment of error, appellant's guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered. Therefore, while appellant raised an issue regarding his speedy trial rights under R.C. 2941.401, his right to challenge whether he received a speedy trial was waived upon entering his guilty plea.
