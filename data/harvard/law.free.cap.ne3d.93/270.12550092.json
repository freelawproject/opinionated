GALLAGHER, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 1} This is an appeal brought by appellant Alan Zebrasky (\"Alan\") from an order of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas dismissing a workers' compensation appeal filed by his wife, Michelle Zebrasky (\"Michelle\") on the ground that it abated upon her death. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Michelle filed a workers' compensation claim for injuries she allegedly sustained after she slipped and fell on ice outside of her place of employment in January 2014. Her workers' compensation claim was allowed for a left ankle sprain /strain and lumbar sprain. In March 2015, Michelle filed a motion seeking additional allowances for conditions described as a\n   left labral calcaneus contusion, closed fractures of the left second and third metatarsals, a left calcaneus fracture and left neuritis. Both the district hearing officer and staff hearing officer allowed her additional claim for a left labral calcaneus contusion but disallowed her claim for closed fractures of the left second and third metatarsals, a left calcaneus fracture and left neuritis. Michelle appealed the staff hearing officer's decision to the Industrial Commission of Ohio (the \"industrial commission\"). On July 7, 2015, the industrial commission issued an order refusing to hear the appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On July 29, 2015, Michelle commenced this administrative appeal in the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court pursuant to R.C. 4123.512, seeking review of the staff hearing officer's decision and requesting a finding that she be permitted to participate in the workers' compensation fund for the disallowed conditions of closed fractures of the left second and third metatarsals, left calcaneus fracture and left neuritis. Her employer, appellee Discount Drug Mart, Inc. (\"Discount Drug Mart\"), and appellee Administrator, Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (the \"BWC\") filed answers denying that Michelle sustained the disallowed conditions as a result of her workplace injury and denying that she was entitled to participate in the workers' compensation fund for these additional conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} While her administrative appeal was pending in the common pleas court, Michelle died. On January 13, 2016, Michelle's counsel filed a suggestion of death pursuant to Civ.R. 25(E), indicating that Michelle had died on December 16, 2015. On August 30, 2016, Discount Drug Mart filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that Michelle's workers' compensation claim had abated upon her death. Michelle's counsel opposed the motion, arguing that Alan, as her surviving husband, should be allowed to \"continue [her] workers' compensation appeal through R.C. 4123.60\" as her dependent. On September 16, 2016, more than nine months after the filing of the suggestion of her death, Michelle's counsel filed a motion to substitute Alan as the real party in interest pursuant to Civ.R. 25(A), asserting that Alan was \"entitled to pursue [Michelle's] workers' compensation claim as her dependent in accordance with R.C. 4123.60.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   That same date, Michelle's counsel filed a motion to consolidate this action with an administrative appeal Alan had previously filed in the common pleas court (Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-16-8686946) in which he sought judicial review of an industrial commission decision denying his claim for death benefits under R.C. 4123.59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 23, 2016, the common pleas court granted Discount Drug Mart's motion to dismiss concluding that \"[a]n employee-appellant's R.C. 4123 administrative appeal before a court abates with the death of the employee-appellant.\" The common pleas court ordered the case dismissed with prejudice and indicated that its judgment was final. The common pleas court thereafter entered a journal\n   entry denying Michelle's motion to substitute and motion to consolidate as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Michelle appealed the common pleas court's decision, raising the following two assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Assignment of Error I: The trial court erred, as a matter of law, by dismissing this workers' compensation appeal on the grounds that the claim abated upon death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Assignment of Error II: An abuse of discretion was committed when the unopposed motion to substitute the decedent's dependent was denied as moot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although she was deceased, the notice of appeal was filed in Michelle's name, by her counsel. On May 16, 2017, Michelle's counsel filed a motion with this court, requesting that we substitute Alan as the appellant in this appeal pursuant to App.R. 29(A). This court granted the motion to substitute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} As a general rule, Ohio workers' compensation claims abate upon the death of the claimant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Adm.Code 4123-5-21(A) (\"When a claimant dies, action on any application filed by the claimant, and pending before the bureau of the industrial commission at the time of his death, is abated by claimant's death.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hlatky v.

He does not, however, explain how or why he believes the revisions made to R.C. 4123.60 in 1993 undermined these decisions regarding abatement. The prior version of R.C. 4123.60 stated, in relevant part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    * * * In all cases of death from causes other than the injury or occupational disease for which award had theretofore been made on account of temporary, or permanent partial, or total disability, in which there remains an unpaid balance, representing payments accrued and due to the decedent at the time of his death, the commission may, after satisfactory proof has been made warranting such action, award or pay any unpaid balance of such award to such of the dependents of the decedent, or for services rendered on account of the last illness or death of such decedent, as the commission determines in accordance with the circumstances in each such case. If the decedent would have been lawfully entitled to have made application for an award at the time of his death the commission may, after satisfactory proof to warrant an award and payment, award and pay an amount, not exceeding the compensation which the decedent might have received, but for his death, for the period prior to the date of his death, to such of the dependents of the decedent, or for services rendered on account of the last illness or death of such decedent, as the commission determines in accordance with the circumstances in each such case, but such payments may be made only in cases in which application for compensation was made in the manner required by sections 4123.01 to 4123.94 of the Revised Code, during the lifetime of such injured or disabled person, or within one year after the death of such injured or disabled person.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    In his brief, Alan highlights the language in R.C. 4123.60\"to have applied for an award at the time of his death\" and \"which the decedent might have received, but for his death.\" However, similar language was in the prior version of the statute as well. Other than minor language revisions and the substitution of \"administrator\" for \"commission,\" the only changes to R.C. 4123.60 in 1993 were (1) elimination of the requirement that the claimant's death be \"from causes other than the injury or occupational disease\" on which the award is based to recover under R.C. 4123.60 and (2) the addition of language indicating that an order issued by the administrator under R.C. 4123.60 is appealable to the industrial commission under R.C. 4123.511 but not appealable to the court of common pleas under R.C. 4123.512. These revisions do not impact the abatement issue that is the subject of this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    To further support his position, Alan cites\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.
