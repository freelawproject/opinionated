STEWART, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant DeWayne Thomas and six codefendants were named in a 25-count indictment on a fraudulent check scheme perpetrated against multiple defendants. Thomas pleaded guilty to 18 of the counts, including 10 counts of forgery. The court sentenced him to a total of five years in prison and ordered him to pay restitution in the amount of $5,941.38. In his three assignments of error, Thomas challenges his sentence, his restitution order, and the imposition of court costs. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In his first assignment of error, Thomas argues that some of his convictions should have merged for purposes of sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2941.25(A). He complains that each forgery count in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(2) is allied with\n   each respective forgery count in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(3), and thus should have been merged at sentencing. Thomas failed to raise the issue of allied offenses before the trial court. He has, therefore, forfeited the right to raise the issue now on appeal except for plain error.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As Thomas notes, in\n   <em>\n    Underwood\n   </em>\n   , the state agreed that \"[t]he two counts * * * would be considered allied offenses of similar import and would require the Court to sentence the defendant to only one of the thefts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. The facts here differ from\n   <em>\n    Underwood\n   </em>\n   in that the state has made no such concession. Contrary to\n   <em>\n    Underwood\n   </em>\n   , there is no discussion of allied offenses anywhere on the record in this case. As such, Thomas cannot meet his burden of affirmatively demonstrating plain error. Finding no merit to his argument, we overrule his first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In his second assigned error, Thomas complains about the amount of restitution he was ordered to pay. At sentencing, Thomas did not dispute either the court's order that he pay restitution or the amount he was ordered to pay. Now on appeal, Thomas argues for the first time that the trial court erred by not apportioning the amount of restitution between codefendants. By not making his argument to the trial court, Thomas once again forfeits all but plain error on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Pollard\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

To the contrary, Thomas seems to confirm that the court followed the law: in his brief he states that his restitution order is for the \"full amount of loss.\" Thomas's claims about what his codefendants were or were not ordered to pay as restitution are unsubstantiated and outside of the record. As such, Thomas has not met his burden of establishing any plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353553\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/143/385/\">\n    143 Ohio St.3d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-2459\">\n    2015-Ohio-2459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20N.E.3d%20860\">\n    38 N.E.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 22. Accordingly, we overrule this assigned error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In his third and final assignment of error, Thomas argues that the court erred by imposing the cost of prosecution \"outside of his presence.\" R.C. 2947.23(A)(1)(a) requires that all criminal defendants pay for the cost of prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The transcript reflects that the trial court did not impose court costs on Thomas during his sentencing hearing; however, the journal entry confirms that the court did, nevertheless impose costs. Because of this, Thomas complains that he did not have the opportunity to seek waiver of court costs. Citing to\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although R.C. 2947.23 no longer places limits on when a defendant can move for a waiver of court costs,\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   has not been overruled, and I cannot agree that a defendant suffers no prejudice when the trial court imposes court costs in his or her absence.
