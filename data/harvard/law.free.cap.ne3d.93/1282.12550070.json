Leon Wilson, appeals the August 2, 2016 judgment of conviction and sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Ohio. Plaintiff-Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On July 17, 2015, the Delaware County Grand Jury indicted appellant on three counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05. Counts 1 and 2 pertained to E.C., four years old, and Count 3 pertained to K.P., seven years old. Each count included a school safety zone specification ( R.C. 2941.143 ). The charges arose from separate incidents between appellant and E.C. and appellant and K.P. while at school. Appellant was their chess teacher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On April 9, 2015, E.C. told her parents her chess teacher touched her, demonstrating the touch by placing her hand on top of her clothes between her legs and moving her hand up and down. E.C. told her forensic interviewer the same story.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Following appellant's arrest which was publicized in the press, K.P.'s father asked K.P. if anything had happened to her since she had been a student in appellant's chess class in February and March 2015. K.P. stated it happened once. K.P. told her forensic interviewer that appellant asked her for permission to touch her vagina and when she gave him permission, he rubbed her vagina over her clothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On August 31, 2015, appellant filed a motion to sever Counts 1 and 2 from Count 3. A hearing was held on September 21, 2015. By judgment entry filed September 24, 2015, the trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On December 5, 2015, appellant filed a motion for competency hearings of E.C. and K.P. prior to either being permitted to testify. A hearing was held on January 4, 2016. The state indicated it would not be calling E.C. as a witness. The trial court conducted an examination of K.P. and determined K.P. to be competent to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On January 4, 2016, appellant filed a motion to compel confrontation, objecting to the playing of E.C.'s videotaped forensic interview during the trial. A hearing was held on February 11, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On January 21, 2016, appellant filed a supplemental motion on the issuance of severance. By judgment entry filed February 22, 2016, the trial court again denied the motion to sever, and denied appellant's motion to compel confrontation,\n   finding E.C.'s out-of-court statements were admissible as pertaining to medical diagnosis or treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} A jury trial commenced on February 23, 2016, but the jury could not reach a verdict on any of the counts and a mistrial was declared. Thereafter, a different judge was assigned to the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On May 27, 2016, appellant reasserted his motion to exclude E.C.'s videotaped interview, claiming it violated his right to confrontation and it did not fit the medical diagnosis or treatment exception to the hearsay rule. Again, the trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} A second jury trial commenced on June 6, 2016. The jury found appellant guilty of Counts 1 and 3, and not guilty of Count 2. The jury also found the offenses were committed in a school safety zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On June 24, 2016, appellant filed a motion for judgment of acquittal and motion for new trial. By judgment entry filed July 21, 2016, the trial court denied the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} By judgment entry filed August 2, 2016, the trial court sentenced appellant to an aggregate term of eight and one-half years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant filed an appeal and this matter is now before this court for consideration.

The indictment filed July 17, 2015 indicated the incident with E.C. occurred between March 31, 2015, through April 7, 2015 when she was four years old. Defense counsel was put on notice in January 2016 that E.C.'s recall ability was limited. This was nine months after the dates in the indictment. If five year old E.C. had limited recall after nine months, it was not a surprise that she could not recall appellant and/or the incident sixteen months (sentencing) or seventeen months (memorandum contra) after the dates listed in the indictment. We do not find appellee withheld evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellant argues in the alternative, his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to present evidence of E.C.'s lack of memory to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The standard to establish ineffective assistance of counsel is set out in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellee presented redacted copies of the videotaped interviews of both E.C. and K.P., editing out possible statements not covered under a hearsay exception. T. at 43-44.
