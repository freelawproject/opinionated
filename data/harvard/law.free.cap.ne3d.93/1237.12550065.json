Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Kim Chalmers, acting individually and on behalf of the wrongful death beneficiaries of her father, John Costell, Sr., appeals the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, granting summary judgment to appellees, HCR ManorCare, Inc., HCR Manor Care Services, Inc., Heartland Employment Services, LLC, Heartland of Waterville OH, LLC, Becky Ziviski, John Does 1 through 10, and unidentified entities 1 through 10, on appellant's claims for wrongful death, medical malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and premises liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The prominent facts of this case are largely undisputed. On May 11, 2013, Costell was transported to the University of Toledo Medical Center (UTMC) because he was having difficulty breathing. Costell suffered from advanced COPD. According to the emergency room physician's notes found in Costell's medical records, Costell \"was critically ill and required critical services including evaluation and management of [patient] with [respiratory] failure and atrial fibrillation with [rapid ventricular response].\" Further, the record reveals that Costell was awaiting a lung transplant at the time of his admission to the hospital, although at least one of Costell's physicians was skeptical as to whether Costell would survive a transplant surgery. Notably, the aforementioned medical records indicate that Costell had no history of falling and was therefore not a fall risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Costell was eventually transferred to Toledo Hospital. On May 18, 2013, Costell was released from Toledo Hospital and admitted into skilled nursing care at Heartland of Waterville (Heartland), a nursing home located in Lucas County. The record reveals that Costell was suffering from pneumonia at the time he entered Heartland's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 6, 2013, appellant took Costell to a doctor's appointment at which he discussed the possibility of undergoing a lung transplant procedure. According to appellant's deposition testimony, Costell complained that he was experiencing dizziness while at the doctor's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The following day, June 7, 2013, employees at Heartland discovered Costell lying on the floor of his bathroom bleeding from the side of his head. According to appellant, Costell became dizzy while making his way to his bathroom. Upon entering the bathroom, Costell passed out and hit his head in the ensuing fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Shortly after the fall, Costell began complaining of left hip pain. Costell remained at Heartland for several hours while he awaited the arrival of an x-ray technician to take an x-ray of his hip. Once the technician arrived, she determined that it would not be possible to take an on-site x-ray of Costell's hip. Consequently, Costell was transferred to UTMC, where he was eventually diagnosed with a fractured left hip. While in the hospital, Costell developed a C. difficile infection. The infection eventually went septic. Unfortunately, Costell succumbed to the sepsis on June\n   16, 2013, nine days after being transferred from Heartland to UTMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Thereafter, on June 11, 2014, appellant filed a 61-page complaint with the trial court in her individual capacity and as a representative of Costell's wrongful death beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In her complaint, appellant asserted 11 counts. The first two counts, styled as corporate negligence, generally alleged that Costell was injured and ultimately died as a direct and proximate result of the entity appellees' failure to provide adequate staffing at Heartland and failure to implement adequate guidelines, policies, and procedures for identifying and correcting nursing home deficiencies and alerting residents to such deficiencies. A similar claim was brought under count three against Heartland's administrator, Becky Ziviski.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In Counts 4 and 5, appellant alleged that the entity appellees breached their duty to provide Costell with certain residents' rights under contract and applicable state and federal statutes. Once again, appellant asserted that the breach was due to inadequate staffing, failure to implement proper nursing home guidelines and procedures, misallocation of nursing home resources, and failure to recognize, report, and correct instances of non-compliance with applicable statutes and regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Counts 6 and 7 were styled as medical malpractice claims against the entity appellees. In these claims, appellant alleged that the entity appellees failed to meet the applicable standard of care by, among other things, (1) failing to notify a doctor of significant changes in Costell's medical condition; (2) failing to respond to such changes; (3) failing to develop, implement, and update an appropriate care plan to meet Costell's needs; (4) failing to maintain appropriate records; (5) failing to provide sufficient staffing to care for Costell; (6) failing to adequately assess, evaluate, and supervise the nursing staff to ensure compliance with corporate policies and applicable regulations; (7) failing to take measures to prevent Costell's infection and, after said infection set in, failing to adequately treat the infection; and (8) failing to prevent Costell from developing pneumonia. Appellant went on to allege that the foregoing failures proximately caused Costell's fall. As such, appellant asserted that these failures were \"negligent, grossly negligent, willful, wanton, malicious and reckless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant's eighth count was a \"malice\" claim premised on the aforementioned conduct, which appellant alleged demonstrated appellees' gross disregard for Costell's safety. The ninth and tenth counts alleged claims for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, respectively, against the entity appellees. In the fraud claim, appellant asserted that the entity appellees \"misrepresented the material fact that they were willing to, and would, provide the proper care, treatment, and services to [Costell], when, in fact, [appellees] knew that they would provide as little care, treatment, and services as possible in order to maximize [appellees'] profit at the expense of [Costell].\" Appellant also contended that the entity appellees breached their fiduciary duty to Costell by failing to provide him with the appropriate level of care to which he was entitled, by accepting payment for services that were not provided, and by concealing their abuse and neglect of Costell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} For her eleventh and final count, appellant asserted a premises liability claim against appellees. This claim was essentially based on appellant's prior allegations that Heartland was insufficiently staffed, lacked an appropriate allocation of resources to care for the residents, and was staffed by unqualified nursing personnel. Appellant alleged that appellees failed to warn Costell of these conditions, which led to his eventual fall and ultimate demise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Attached to appellant's complaint was an affidavit of merit in which Holly Brown, a geriatric nurse practitioner and registered nurse, indicated that she reviewed Costell's medical records from Heartland and UTMC. Based upon her education, training, and experience, as well as her review of Costell's medical records, Brown opined, within a reasonable degree of nursing probability, that appellees \"did deviate from the accepted standards of nursing care in the treatment of [Costell] and these deviations did result in and proximately caused [Costell] to suffer severe injuries and damages.\" Brown went on to specify several examples of appellees' alleged deviations in the standard of care. According to Brown's affidavit, appellees' deviations from the standard of care proximately caused Costell to suffer injuries including a left hip fracture, dehydration, sepsis, and pneumonia. Notably, Brown did not opine as to whether appellees' conduct was the proximate cause of Costell's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} One month after appellant filed her complaint, appellees filed their answer, in which they generally denied appellant's allegations and asserted several affirmative defenses. Relevant here, appellees urged that the claims contained in appellant's complaint were barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Further appellees asserted that appellant's claims were procedurally deficient under Civ.R. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Following extensive pretrial discovery, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on October 30, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their motion, appellees argued that they were entitled to summary judgment as to all claims contained in appellant's complaint. Specifically, appellees urged that Counts 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, and 11 all constituted medical claims subject to a one-year statute of limitations, which expired before appellant filed her complaint. Appellees next argued that appellant's malice claim contained in Count 8 amounted to a request for punitive damages and should be dismissed because independent claims for punitive damages are not recognized in Ohio and punitive damages are not available in association with the wrongful death claims that remained after dismissing the medical claims. Finally, appellees asserted that appellant's complaint was insufficiently pleaded because Brown's affidavit of merit did not establish the cause of Costell's injury or death and Brown acknowledged that she was not competent to opine as to the cause of Costell's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On November 17, 2015, appellant filed a response in opposition to appellees' motion for summary judgment. In the response, appellant conceded that her malice claim could not stand as an independent claim. Appellant indicated that she included such a claim in her complaint to put appellees on notice that she was seeking punitive damages in this action. Additionally,\n   appellant argued that appellees could not establish that HCR ManorCare, Inc., HCR Manor Care Services, Inc., Heartland Employment Services, LLC, and Becky Ziviski were medical providers under R.C. 3721.01(A)(6). Consequently, appellant argued that the claims brought against appellees in Counts 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, and 11 were not medical claims subject to the one-year statute of limitations pursuant to R.C. 2305.113. Further, appellant insisted that all but two of her claims fell outside the realm of medical claims because they did not arise from Costell's receipt of care, treatment, or diagnosis. Instead, appellant claimed that \"the majority of [her] allegations are that [appellees] were negligent in their corporate and administrative capacity which caused systemic operational failures at Heartland of Waterville.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} As to the wrongful death claims that appellees argued should be dismissed based upon appellant's failure to attach an adequate affidavit of merit to the complaint, appellant argued that an affidavit was not required as to most of the claims because such claims were not medical claims. Moreover, appellant asserted that any deficiency in the affidavit was cured by the coroner's report and the testimony of her physician expert, William Fannin, M.D., in which Fannin testified as to causation, opining that Costell's fall ultimately led to his death. Finally, appellant contended that Brown's affidavit of merit was sufficient to satisfy Civ.R. 10(D)(2) because the issue of causation was within the common knowledge of a layperson and did not require the expert testimony of a physician. Alternatively, in the event that the trial court agreed with appellees that Brown's affidavit of merit was defective, appellant urged that she should be granted a reasonable time to cure such defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On June 1, 2016, the trial court issued its decision on appellees' motion for summary judgment. In its decision, the court found that appellant's survivorship claims found in Counts 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, and 11 of the complaint constituted medical claims under R.C. 2305.113(E)(3). As such, the court found that these claims were subject to dismissal because they were filed outside of the one-year statute of limitations applicable to medical claims. Further, the trial court found that appellant's remaining wrongful death claims were subject to dismissal because they were not supported by an adequate affidavit of merit under Civ.R. 10(D)(2). Specifically, the court concluded that Brown was incompetent to opine as to the cause of Costell's death, a necessary element in a wrongful death action. Moreover, the court was not persuaded by appellant's assertion that the defect was cured by Fannin's testimony and the coroner's report. The court noted that such evidence was not attached to the complaint and was therefore not relevant for purposes of determining whether the complaint was sufficient. Finally, the trial court rejected appellant's contention that she was entitled to be provided with a reasonable amount of time to cure the defect in the affidavit. In rejecting this argument, the court found that Brown's incompetency did not constitute a curable defect, and therefore appellant was left without an affidavit of merit. The court also found that appellant was not entitled to additional time to file an affidavit of merit because appellant failed to establish good cause to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In light of its finding that appellant's survivorship claims were time-barred and the wrongful death claims were subject to dismissal due to the lack of an affidavit of merit, the trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment as to all of the claims contained in appellant's complaint. Appellant timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Dismissal of Survivorship Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In her first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to appellees on her survivorship claims by finding that these claims constituted \"medical claims\" as defined by R.C. 2305.113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Under R.C. 2305.113(E)(3),\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Medical claim\" means any claim that is asserted in any civil action against a physician, podiatrist, hospital, home, or residential facility, against any employee or agent of a physician, podiatrist, hospital, home, or residential facility, or against a licensed practical nurse, registered nurse, advanced practice registered nurse, physical therapist, physician assistant, emergency medical technician-basic, emergency medical technician-intermediate, or emergency medical technician-paramedic, and that arises out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person. \"Medical claim\" includes the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (a) Derivative claims for relief that arise from the plan of care, medical diagnosis, or treatment of a person;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (b) Claims that arise out of the plan of care, medical diagnosis, or treatment of any person and to which either of the following applies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (i) The claim results from acts or omissions in providing medical care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (ii) The claim results from the hiring, training, supervision, retention, or termination of caregivers providing medical diagnosis, care, or treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (c) Claims that arise out of the plan of care, medical diagnosis, or treatment of any person and that are brought under section 3721.17 of the Revised Code ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (d) Claims that arise out of skilled nursing care or personal care services provided in a home pursuant to the plan of care, medical diagnosis, or treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 25} \"The term 'medical claim' as defined in R.C. 2305.113(E)(3) has two components that the statute states in the conjunctive: (1) the claim is asserted against one or more of the specifically enumerated medical providers and (2) the claim arises out of medical diagnosis, care, or treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Stevic v.

Rather, appellant argues that the trial court disregarded the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Stevic\n   </em>\n   test set forth above and failed to consider whether the three remaining entity appellees (HCR ManorCare, Inc., HCR Manor Care Services, Inc., and Heartland Employment Services, LLC) were medical providers given the fact that they are not licensed by the state of Ohio to provide skilled nursing care and personal care services and, thus, do not meet the definition of a \"nursing home\" under R.C. 3721.01(A)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In its decision granting summary judgment, the trial court stated the following with respect to the argument appellant raises on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff wishes to argue that her claims against the corporate Defendants cannot be considered medical claims because such Defendants do not fall within the categories of medical care givers or facilities to which statutorily defined medical claims are limited. However, it is well-established that creative or artful pleading will not change the nature of a claim. Regardless of the various failures alleged in Plaintiff's survivorship claims, the only potential negligence supported by the evidence directly relates to Heartland's diagnosis, medical care, and treatment of Mr. Costell. The established facts of this case in no way support a claim that ordinary negligence on the part of any actor proximately caused Mr. Costell's fall and resulting injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Referring to this portion of the trial court's decision, appellees argue that summary judgment was proper because appellant failed to advance evidence in support of her allegedly non-medical claims against HCR ManorCare, Inc., HCR Manor Care Services, Inc., and Heartland Employment Services, LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Having reviewed the record in this case, we agree with the trial court that appellant's various non-medical claims against the aforementioned entities are not supported by the evidence. Under these claims, appellant asserted that Costell's injuries resulted from (1) a lack of staffing and failure to implement administrative guidelines; (2) a failure to provide Costell with certain residents' rights; (3) an exaggeration of the entities' ability to provide the appropriate level of care to meet Costell's needs when, in fact, the entities would provide the least amount of care possible in order to maximize profit; and (4) the entities' failure to warn Costell of the inadequate staffing and unqualified nursing personnel. However, the record\n   contains sparse evidence to support such causation arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 30} On the issue of causation, the only tenable argument to be made from the evidence is that Costell was injured following a lack of adequate supervision from Heartland's nursing personnel. This is precisely the nature of the time-barred medical claim brought against Heartland of Waterville OH, LLC. The claims for negligence, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and premises liability against the remaining entities lack evidentiary support on the issue of causation, and were therefore appropriately dismissed on summary judgment. Accordingly, appellant's first assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In addressing the issues raised in the dissent, App.R. 16 states that the appellant's brief shall include a \"statement of the assignments of error presented for review\" and \"[a]n argument containing the contentions of the appellant with respect to each assignment of error presented[.]\" Under App.R. 12(A)(1)(b), an appellate court's review is limited to the assignments of error, the trial court's record, and, unless waived, oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The parties' arguments as to the first assignment of error center on the issue of whether the claims raised by appellant are medical claims and whether they were properly dismissed for want of evidence as to causation.

First, the patient in\n   <em>\n    Dimora\n   </em>\n   was clearly incapable of walking on her own accord, even with the assistance of a walker. Such was not the case here where the record establishes that Costell did not have the same history of falls and lack of balance. Second, the causal connection between Dimora's fall and her subsequent injuries was direct and obvious; the causal connection between Costell's fall and eventual death was uncertain and was further complicated by his unrelated preexisting conditions including terminal end-stage COPD and pneumonia, among other things.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murray v.

How Costell's hip fracture (which could perhaps be deemed to be an obvious consequence of the fall) led Costell to subsequently develop sepsis, dehydration, and worsening pneumonia resulting in his death would be unclear to the layperson. Therefore, we find that this case is distinguishable from those cited by appellant, and we conclude that the common knowledge exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Regardless of our conclusion as to the inapplicability of common knowledge exception, appellant argues that the express terms of Civ.R. 10(D)(2) make it clear that expert testimony is not required as to the ultimate cause of Costell's death. Rather, appellant urges that the rule merely requires expert testimony that appellees' negligence \"caused some injury.\" Because Brown opined in her affidavit that appellees' deviations from the standard of care caused Costell to suffer severe injuries, appellant argues that the affidavit establishes the adequacy of the complaint as to the wrongful death claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In support of her argument, appellant cites the First District's decision in\n   <em>\n    Tranter v. Mercy Franciscan Hosp. W. Hills\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-061039,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-5132\">\n    2007-Ohio-5132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202812912\">\n    2007 WL 2812912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, Tranter brought a medical malpractice action alleging that the nurses' negligence caused the decedent to fall and sustain injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. The trial court dismissed the action with prejudice based on its finding that Tranter's nurse expert lacked the qualifications to render an opinion on the issue of proximate cause in her affidavit of merit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. On appeal, the First District held that the trial court erred in dismissing the action because, even if the expert was not qualified to express the opinion that the fall caused the decedent's death more than a year later, she was qualified to state that the nurses' negligence \"caused injury to the plaintiff\" within the meaning of Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(a)(iii). In so holding the court emphasized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [U]nder the language of Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(c), the purpose of the affidavit is \"solely to establish the adequacy of the complaint and shall not otherwise be admissible as evidence or used for purposes of impeachment.\" The requirement of the affidavit, then, is to winnow out utterly frivolous claims; its purpose is not to test the sufficiency of the plaintiff's evidence on the ultimate issue of the defendant's liability. Under that standard, [the nurse expert's] affidavit was sufficient to withstand a challenge under Civ.R. 10(D)(2).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 43} However, this holding is not universally embraced throughout the state. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    McKay v. Ohio State Univ. Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   , Ct. of Cl. No. 2013-00120,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2010734517\">\n    2013 WL 10734517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Apr. 22, 2013), the Court of Claims examined the sufficiency of a nurse's affidavit of merit, which contained her opinion that \"the standard of care was breached by the Defendant to the action and * * * said breach proximately caused the injury to the Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Upon examination, the court held that the plaintiff's wrongful death action was not supported by a sufficient affidavit of merit under Civ.R. 10(D)(2) because the nurse was not competent to opine regarding the cause of death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Although the nurse opined as to the proximate cause of injury, no expert testimony was offered by way of affidavit attached to the complaint as to the cause of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Likewise, the affidavit attached to appellant's amended complaint in this case does not include expert testimony as to the cause of Costell's death. Moreover, Brown has acknowledged that, as a nurse, she is not competent to render such expert testimony. We disagree with the court in\n   <em>\n    Tranter\n   </em>\n   that such testimony is not required under Civ.R. 10(D)(2), especially in cases such as the one at bar, where the only remaining claims are claims for wrongful death in which appellant is required to establish that appellees' breach of the standard of care proximately caused Costell's death. Under Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(a)(iii), expert testimony is required on the element of causation, and in this case the threshold issue under that element is the cause of death. By her own admission and appellant's acknowledgement, Brown is not competent to render expert testimony on that issue. Therefore, we agree with the trial court that appellant's affidavit of merit was defective under Civ.R. 10(D)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 45} As her final argument under the second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in failing to afford her an opportunity to cure the defect in her affidavit of merit prior to granting summary judgment. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Under Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(e), if an affidavit of merit is determined to be defective under Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(a), \"the court shall grant the plaintiff a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty days, to file an affidavit of merit intended to cure the defect.\" Here, the trial court concluded that appellant, in submitting an affidavit of merit from a nurse who was not competent to render an expert opinion on the issue of causation, effectively failed to attach an affidavit of merit. Therefore, the court concluded that it was not required to provide appellant with an opportunity to cure under Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 47} In\n   <em>\n    Chapman v.

Thus, under Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(e), appellant is permitted to cure the defective affidavit of merit by securing a new affidavit of merit from a competent expert that includes the missing causation testimony.

I write separately to clarify that I would affirm summary judgment in favor of defendants HCR ManorCare, Inc.; Heartland Employment Services, LLC; and HCR Manor Care Services, Inc. (the \"HCR Corporate Defendants\") because those entities had no legal duty to Costell-each for different reasons. And while I agree with the majority's reversal of summary judgment in favor of defendant Heartland of Waterville, OH, LLC on Counts 2, 5, and 7, I would reverse because I believe that Civ.R. 10(D)(2) is inapplicable to a motion for summary judgment under Civ.R. 56 -and, therefore, I dissent from the majority's order that appellant must cure the alleged deficiencies in the affidavit of merit within 60 days to avoid dismissal with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The HCR Corporate Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 54} In the trial court and on appeal, appellant argues that her claims against the HCR Corporate Defendants are \"ordinary negligence claims\"-not \"medical claims\" under R.C. 2305.113 -because the HCR Corporate Defendants are not statutorily-enumerated medical providers and because her negligence claims against these defendants do not arise out of \"the plan of care, medical diagnosis, or treatment\" of Costell as required for a claim under R.C. 2305.113. The trial court not only found that appellant's claims against the HCR Corporate Defendants are time-barred medical claims under R.C. 2305.113, but it also concluded that appellant's theory of direct negligence against these entities is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Although the trial court focused on the causation element of negligence, we are not confined by that analysis on appeal. \"[S]ince an appellate court's review of a summary judgment exercise is de novo, we can substitute the proper analysis for the trial court's analysis on this specific point, and then affirm on that basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Portage Cty.

When considering a negligence claim, any discussion of causation necessarily assumes the existence of the predicate elements of (1) a legal duty and (2) a breach of that duty.

Thus, HCR ManorCare, Inc. had no independent duty to appellant and may be held liable for the alleged misdoings of Heartland of Waterville, OH, LLC only if there is evidence sufficient to pierce the corporate veil. In Ohio, a plaintiff seeking to pierce the corporate veil must show (1) the parent's control over the subsidiary was so complete that the corporation has no separate mind, will, or existence of its own; (2) the parent exercised control over the subsidiary in such a manner as to commit fraud, an illegal act, or a similarly unlawful act; and (3) injury or unjust loss resulted to the plaintiff from such control and wrong.\n   <em>\n    Dombroski v.

And even if such evidence arguably presented a question of fact on the control element, the record is lacking any evidence to demonstrate that HCR ManorCare, Inc. exerted control over Heartland of Waterville, OH, LLC in such a manner as to commit fraud, an illegal act, or a similarly unlawful act.\n   <em>\n    Dombroski\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

There is no evidence that HES actually directed or controlled Heartland of Waterville, OH, LLC's nursing home staff in their development of a care plan for or supervision of Costell. Moreover, although appellant alleges that Costell was injured because the nursing home was purportedly understaffed, there is no evidence that HES had any involvement in determining staffing levels; HES merely provided whatever personnel that Heartland of Waterville, OH, LLC deemed necessary to operate its nursing home. Accordingly, based on this record, HES had no duty to appellant and cannot be held vicariously liable for the alleged negligence of any nursing personnel it leased to Heartland of Waterville, OH, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    C. HCR Manor Care Services, Inc.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 62} In their summary judgment briefing, the appellees argued that HCR Manor Care Services, Inc. should be dismissed because it ceased to exist on November 16, 2009, when it converted from a corporation to a limited liability company. But as appellant correctly argued, this is irrelevant because HCR Manor Care Services, LLC, the successor entity that was in existence while Costell was a patient of Heartland of Waterville in 2013, appeared in this case and answered the complaint as \"improperly named as 'Inc.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Appellant's only substantive argument against summary judgment, however, was that HCR Manor Care Services, LLC provided certain services to Heartland of Waterville, OH, LLC under a written contract. But that merely establishes that HCR Manor Care Services, LLC had a legal duty to Heartland of Waterville, OH, LLC; the record lacks any evidence that appellant is entitled to claim any rights under that contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reeves v.

I agree. Indeed, because a Civ.R. 56 motion for summary judgment is expressly designed to test the sufficiency of the evidence, I would hold that it was error for the trial court to consider the Civ.R. 10(D)(2) affidavit of merit because it is not \"evidence\" and is therefore inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Under Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment may be granted only if \"it appears from\n   <em>\n    the evidence\n   </em>\n   or stipulation, and only from\n   <em>\n    the evidence\n   </em>\n   or stipulation, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion * * *.\" (Emphasis added.) And Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(d) expressly provides that \"[a]n affidavit of merit is required to establish the adequacy of the complaint and\n   <em>\n    shall not otherwise be admissible as evidence\n   </em>\n   or used for purposes of impeachment.\" (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that \"[t]he proper response to the failure to file the affidavit required by Civ.R. 10(D)(2) is a motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    Fletcher v.

At the summary judgment phase of a wrongful death case, the relevant inquiry with respect to causation should be whether the plaintiff put forth\n   <em>\n    admissible evidence\n   </em>\n   , including expert testimony if required, to establish that the defendant proximately caused the injury and, ultimately, death. But appellees moved for summary judgment-and the trial court granted the motion-for the sole reason that the Civ.R. 10(D)(2) affidavit of merit, attached to the complaint, lacked expert testimony regarding cause of death. Even if that somehow caused the pleading to be deficient, it was not a basis to grant summary judgment. By doing so, the court wholly ignored the actual evidence in the record-including deposition testimony from appellant's physician expert and the coroner's death certificate and autopsy report-that may or may not have been sufficient to withstand summary judgment on the issue of causation.\n   <em>\n    That\n   </em>\n   is where the focus should have been under Civ.R. 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 67} I therefore concur in the majority's reversal of summary judgment in favor of the only remaining defendant, Heartland of Waterville, OH, LLC, on the non-time-barred wrongful death claims in Counts 2, 5, and 7, but dissent from the majority's order that appellant must cure the affidavit of merit in response to the Civ.R. 56 motion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Ziviski was made a party to this action upon the filing of appellant's amended complaint on January 15, 2015.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Along with the motion for summary judgment that is at issue here, which was filed on behalf of all appellees collectively, three additional motions for summary judgment were filed with the trial court, each seeking relief on different bases and for certain individual appellees.
