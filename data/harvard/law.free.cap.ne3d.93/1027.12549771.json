Appellant contends the court erred in taking judicial notice and admitting the speed measurement obtained by the trooper from the radar device installed in his cruiser as there was an inadequate foundation on the scientific reliability of the device. Appellant also argues the state failed to show the device was operated by a properly certified user and claims his conviction was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. For the following reasons, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 24, 2014 at 3:20 p.m., Appellant was issued a speeding citation by a trooper with the Ohio State Highway Patrol while traveling on State Route 800 in Belmont County. Appellant did not appear in court on the date listed on the citation. Instead, he faxed a request to set the matter for trial. The court set the matter for trial, but entries sent to Appellant at the Texas address he provided to the trooper were returned by the postal service. The court issued a non-resident violator compact notice of suspension in August 2014. In July 2016, Appellant contacted the court seeking a trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Trial to the court proceeded on October 18, 2016. The trooper testified he was travelling in the opposite direction of Appellant whose vehicle was approaching him on State Route 800. The speed limit was 55 miles per hour. The trooper visually estimated Appellant's vehicle to be travelling in excess of the speed limit and activated his radar device, which measured Appellant's speed at 67 miles per hour. (Tr. 23, 33, 40). The trooper testified his cruiser had a BEE III radar device installed, which operated on Doppler principles. (Tr. 25, 38). He testified about his training, certification, and experience with radar devices and with this type of device. He also explained how the device takes the \"closing speed\" and subtracts the cruiser's speed to obtain the target's speed; he checks his cruiser's speedometer to ensure it matches the speed the device provides as the cruiser's speed. (Tr. 38, 45, 67). The court took judicial notice of a past finding by the court that a radar device using this Doppler effect was a scientifically accepted method of determining the speed of a motor vehicle, citing its\n   <em>\n    Cuiksa\n   </em>\n   case. (Tr. 31-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} As for accuracy of the specific device, the trooper testified he activated\n   the radar device causing it to internally check itself at the start of his shift. He also used tuning forks to check the calibration of the device at the beginning of his shift at 2:00 p.m. and at the end of his shift at 10:00 p.m. (Tr. 25-26, 41-42). The troopers do not keep a daily log of these checks. (Tr. 41, 46). He explained that this is not the calibration of the device but is the test to ensure the device is maintaining an accurate calibration. (Tr. 47, 68). A radio technician checks the calibration every six months and performs any necessary recalibration. (Tr. 26, 28-29); (State Ex. 4-6). For instance, a \"radar and tuning fork frequency measurement report\" was issued by a radio technician who checked the device on March 11, 2014 and on November 18, 2014. (State Ex. 4). The trooper attested the radar device was working properly and correctly calibrated on the day in question. (Tr. 26, 31, 101).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The owner's manual for the radar device was admitted into evidence by Appellant, who represented himself. (Def. Ex. 4). Appellant questioned the trooper on his knowledge of various scenarios that could potentially cause interference and asked him to read excerpts from the owner's manual. Appellant presented a witness in his defense, who said she was the front seat passenger on the day Appellant received the citation. She testified Appellant was travelling at 55 miles per hour and was using his cruise control at the time in question. (Tr. 111-113).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The court issued a judgment entry concluding the trooper was properly trained to operate the radar device and properly operated it in a manner consistent with his training. The court credited the officer's testimony that he used the tuning forks to check calibration before and after his shift, concluding his testimony on frequent measurement checks is enough to show the device was working. Upon researching law cited by Appellant, the trial court found no support for his suggestion that a written log must be kept on the use of tuning forks. Citing its\n   <em>\n    Cuiksa\n   </em>\n   case, the court reiterated its prior recognition of Doppler radar as a commonly accepted scientific method for measuring the speed of a motor vehicle. The court noted that Appellant elicited from the trooper possible items that can affect a scientific instrument such as the radar device but this did not indicate any error occurred that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant was found guilty of speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D). A fine of $100 was imposed (plus costs of $139.50). Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from the December 28, 2016 sentencing entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    GENERAL LAW ON RADAR EVIDENCE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In 1958, the Ohio Supreme Court was presented with the question: \"May a defendant be convicted of speeding solely upon evidence obtained from a radar speed meter, in the absence of expert testimony with respect to the construction of the meter and its method of operation?\"\n   <em>\n    City of E.

In answering this question in the affirmative, the Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The radar speed-detecting devices commonly used in traffic control operate on what is known as the Doppler effect and utilize a continuous beam of microwaves sent out at a fixed frequency. The operation depends upon the physical law that when such waves are intercepted by a moving object the frequency changes in such a ratio to the speed of the intercepted object that, by measuring the change of frequency, the speed may be determined. * * * In operation, the radar device * * * is set up along the side\n   of a road or street, usually in or upon a parked police car, with the beam being played along the highway. When a moving vehicle crosses that beam, the speed of the vehicle is registered * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 300,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20N.E.2d%20630\">\n    154 N.E.2d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (also noting the Doppler effect has been used for over a century in determining the speed of stars and for over a decade in measuring the speed of airplanes and their height above the ground).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} When a witness testifies as to information from an instrument constructed on knowledge of scientific laws, \"three fundamental propositions apply\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A.

After reviewing decisions of other state courts, the Ohio Supreme Court stated, \"We are in accord with the trend of the most recent decisions that readings of a radar speed meter may be accepted in evidence, just as we accept photographs, X rays, electroencephalographs, speedometer readings, and the like, without the necessity of offering expert testimony as to the scientific principles underlying them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 303,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20N.E.2d%20630\">\n    154 N.E.2d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631. (There was no indication the trial court had taken judicial notice in any manner aside from allowing the officer to testify, just as a court does not announce it is taking judicial notice that an x-ray or camera works on established scientific principles.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The remaining issues for the\n   <em>\n    Ferell\n   </em>\n   Court concerned the second and third prongs of the test, which were described as questions involving: \"the sufficiency of the evidence concerning the accuracy of the particular speed meter involved in the instant case and the qualifications of the person using it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20N.E.2d%20630\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In finding compliance with the second proposition, the Court said the city electrician explained how he checked the calibration of this particular device on the morning of the violation and found it was in proper working order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20N.E.2d%20630\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the third proposition, the Court concluded, \"the officer in charge of the radar car was merely required to read the dial on the meter in the same way that a speedometer is read. A police officer with five years of experience is certainly qualified to do that.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 303-304,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20N.E.2d%20630\">\n    154 N.E.2d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Accordingly, upon finding Doppler radar devices for ascertaining the speed of a vehicle need no longer be established as scientifically reliable in speeding cases, the Court expressed the two issues left for the prosecution in presenting the speed measurement generated by the device was to show the particular device was\n   working accurately at the time (through evidence on calibration checks) and the officer was qualified to use the device.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 301-304,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20N.E.2d%20630\">\n    154 N.E.2d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} At the time of the\n   <em>\n    Ferell\n   </em>\n   decision, the radar devices were operated while the user was stationary. Law enforcement thereafter began using radar devices that provided speed measurements while the user was moving. Although the Ohio Supreme Court eliminated the need for expert testimony to prove scientific principles of the Doppler radar technology used by police radar devices in order to admit speed measurements, it was concluded by various appellate districts this holding would \"not apply to a device which not only measures speed but adjusts such speed measurement to compensate for the speed of the moving vehicle in which it is mounted\". Thus the state was required to present \"expert testimony with respect to construction of the device and its method of operation with respect to its ability to differentiate the speed of a vehicle approaching the moving patrol car from the opposite direction from the combined speed at which the two vehicles are moving toward each other.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nevertheless, some courts began requiring testimony for new models of moving radar device prior to the taking of judicial notice. Other appellate districts concluded judicial notice is not device-specific as judicial notice involves the scientific principle upon which the device operates when the scientific principle has been accepted as dependable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant argues the trooper's certificate of training form presented as an exhibit at trial revealed the trooper was not adequately trained to use the radar device operated on the day Appellant was cited. He contends the trooper's certificate of training form only shows one day of training on the BEE III radar device (in February 2012). He concludes the \"paucity of training on the BEE III radar device used at the time of his traffic stop is in and of itself sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to the reliability and accuracy of the reading taken by [the trooper] in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 38} The trooper testified to his 18 years of service with the Ohio State Highway Patrol (16 years at the time of the ticket). He was trained to use radar devices at the police academy and identified a certificate he received for a course on electronic speed measuring devices in February 1999. (Tr. 26-27); (St. Ex. 1). Every year thereafter he received training in his vehicle on the installed radar device and on visually estimating speeds. (Tr. 26-28, 83); (St. Ex. 2-3). The state submitted his \"instructor's and operator's certificate of training form\" which certified his hours of annual radar training since June 1999. (St. Ex. 2-3). He passed his radar training courses every year since his first course in 1999. (Tr. 100). The trooper attested he\n   was proficient and current in his training on this radar device. (Tr. 30, 101).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 39} The certification entry for the February 2012 training specified the trooper received four hours of training on \"BEE III\" which was the device used when Appellant was cited for speeding. Appellant discounts any experience an officer gains by years of training on a prior model of radar device and believes it is significant that entries subsequent to February 2012 did not specify the model of radar involved in the training. On this point, however, the trooper testified his subsequent training sessions were all on this same individual device, noting the training occurred in his cruiser and this was the device installed in his cruiser on and after the February training date. (Tr. 62, 73-74).

Until a version approaches the unbelievable, the incentive to intervene does not arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Appellant states the only evidence of speeding was the measurement from the radar device and the trooper's visual estimation testimony. He then relies on his prior argument that the radar measurement was inadmissible to conclude the finding of guilt was not based upon competent, credible evidence. He compares the trooper's testimony on visual estimation of speed with his witness's testimony that he was traveling 55 miles per hour and using cruise control. Noting the time that had passed since the citation was written (almost two years) and the many vehicles encountered by the trooper since the stop in question, Appellant urges the trooper's testimony was less credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Initially, it should be pointed out there was briefly a Supreme Court law holding mere visual estimation of speed could constitute a sufficient means to prove a speeding violation where the officer was trained, certified, and experienced in making such visual estimates.\n   <em>\n    Barberton v.

However, the legislature responded in 2011 with the following statutory amendment: \"No person shall be arrested, charged, or convicted of a violation of any provision of divisions (B) to (O) of section 4511.21 or section 4511.211 of the Revised Code or a substantially similar municipal ordinance based on a peace officer's unaided visual estimation of the speed of a motor vehicle, trackless trolley, or streetcar.\" R.C. 4511.091(C)(1). Notably, the amendment specifically states that it does not prohibit the use of visual estimation testimony; rather, the estimate cannot be \"unaided.\" The amendment additionally states: \"This division does not * * * Preclude the use by a peace officer of a stopwatch, radar, laser, or other electrical, mechanical, or digital device to determine the speed of a motor vehicle * * *.\" R.C. 4511.091(C)(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Consequently, where the allegation involves a vehicle travelling over a speed limit, such as Appellant's citation under R.C. 4511.21(D), visual estimation alone is not sufficient to prove the violation.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   R.C. 4511.21(A) (speed greater or less than is reasonable or proper, and speed greater than will permit the person to stop at an assured clear distance). For purposes of this case, without the radar measurement, the visual estimation of speed alone could not be used to\n   sustain the speeding conviction under R.C. 4511.091(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Appellant's manifest weight of the evidence argument relies upon the elimination of the radar speed measurements from consideration under prior assignments. As his arguments against admitting the measurement are overruled, a review of the weight of the evidence would include the speed measurement of 67 miles per hour where the speed limit was 55 miles per hour. Although a specific argument on weight of the evidence with the speed measurement was not clearly made, we reviewed the weight of all the evidence. The trial court heard the testimony of the officer and the defense witness and could choose to believe the trooper's testimony. The trooper viewed Appellant's vehicle approaching him, visually estimated his vehicle as speeding, activated his radar device, and obtained a reading of 67 miles per hour on a road with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour. As aforestated, his testimony on calibration checks and his qualification and proper usage of the radar device was believable. The trooper was familiar with topics discussed in the owner's manual. The court was not required to adopt a theory of external radar interference. The read-out of the cruiser's speed as clocked by the radar was separately displayed on the device, and this was checked against the cruiser's speed displayed on the vehicle's speedometer. In sum, this assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 49} The trial court's judgment is hereby affirmed\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Waite, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   DeGenaro, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Similar holdings were made as to laser speed measuring devices as their use grew.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    We note the quote refers to a \"municipal court case\" but clearly a case out of the pertinent\n    <em>\n     trial\n    </em>\n    court (whether it be county court, common pleas court, or municipal court) would be appropriate as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The Supreme Court designated its own website as the Ohio Official Reports for opinions of the courts of appeals and the court of claims.
