Yet it may be doubted whether the facts as they appeared, even giving all reasonable weight to defendant\u2019s testimony, would warrant the application of that rule at all; it appearing that the killing was a brutal, cold-blooded murder without semblance of justification on the ground of self-defense, and that to hold deceased to he in any sense an aggressor would be a gross distortion of the facts.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b76-9\">Id.\u2014Prior Assault to Avenge Insult to Woman\u2014End of Affair\u2014 Ample Time to Cool Blood\u2014Motive of Killing.\u2014When the affair of a prior assault made by the deceased without a weapon, to avenge an insult by defendant to a woman, had come to an end, and deceased was no longer an aggressor, and defendant had ample time to cool his blood, if such prior affair can be brought into the question at all, it tends merely to furnish the probable motive of the killing, as having been in retaliation for the prior assault by deceased after he had ceased to be the aggressor.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b76-10\">Id.\u2014Evidence of Previous Good Character\u2014Aid of Presumption of Innocence\u2014Proper Refusal of Requested Instruction.\u2014Evidence of good character is admissible as coming to the aid of the presumption of innocence, and as bearing on the question whether guilt is proved beyond a reasonable doubt; but it was proper to refuse a requested instruction that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s character outweighs the evidence against him, even if the evidence outside of the evidence of good character conclusively establishes his guilt.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Id.\u2014Instruction Given not Required to be Repeated.\u2014When the court had properly instructed the jury upon the weight to be given to evidence o\u00a3 the previous good character of the defendant, it was not required to give so much of a requested instruction on that subject as repeated the charge given.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b77-5\">Id.\u2014Evidence\u2014Cross-examination\u2014Turning op Deceased at Dependant\u2019s Approach\u2014Object op Turning\u2014Conclusion op Witness.\u2014Where the evidence showed that deceased was standing unarmed with others and was warned that defendant was approaching with a pistol, and turned around, when defendant came up and shot him three times, it was proper to refuse a question on cross-examination of a witness for the prosecution, whether at the time deceased turned round, \u201chad he started back to renew the fight?\u201d as calling for the conclusion of the witness.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Mendocino County, and from an order denying a new trial.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak7\">Defendant was convicted of the crime of murder and sentenced to imprisonment for life. He appeals from the judgment on bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">It is complained that the court erred in giving the following instruction: \u201cIf you believe from the evidence that at the time of the killing, the defendant could with safety to himself have avoided such killing, and that the defendant knew, or as a reasonable man could have known, that he could with perfect safety to himself and his person have avoided such killing, then if you find all these facts, the defendant cannot justify such killing on the grounds of self-defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">It is necessary to a right understanding and appreciation of the instruction objected to that the facts be stated. Defendant was a boarder in the house of one Gonelli -and wife. On the afternoon of the day of the homicide there were also present five other Italians, named Cinquini, Falleri, Bonturi, Pardeni and Del Debbio, all of whom, except Del Debbio and Cinquini, were witnesses at the trial and were assembled in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the dining-room of Gonelli at the time of the homicide. Defendant was in an adjoining bedroom dressed, but lying on the bed. He called for a glass of water, which was sent to him by a little girl, whom he sent away, saying he wanted a glass of wine, which she took to him, and he then said he wanted to see Mrs. Gonelli. She went to the room, and soon came out crying and said defendant had struck her. Cinquini went into the room and str\u00fack defendant while lying on the bed and an altercation ensued. Falleri testified: \u2018 \u2018 They scuffled out through Baldocchi room into the kitchen, where they were separated. I took hold of defendant and the others took Cinquini and went out through the kitchen on the porch.\u201d Defendant drew his revolver in the kitchen and made some threats that he would shoot Falleri if he did not let him loose, which Falleri did and defendant returned to his room, but in about two or three minutes jumped out through a window to the porch. Witness Falleri testified: \u201cI went from the kitchen out on the porch and warned deceased that Baldocchi was coming with a pistol to shoot him. The defendant came around the corner of the house begun firing at deceased. Deceased was not doing anything and had his hands by his side. I did not see Cinquini (deceased) have any pistol or knife or weapon of any kind at any time; he did not make any motion to draw any weapon.\u201d Pardeni and Bonturi testified substantially as did Falleri up to and including the time of the separation of the parties in the kitchen. Both of them testified to the warning given by Falleri to deceased. They testified that deceased was standing between them, that they saw no weapon in his hands and that he made no motion to draw a weapon. Bonturi testified that his hands were down at his side; that he did not start toward Baldocchi nor make any motion to draw any weapon. Bonturi testified: \u2018\u2018Deceased was standing with his back against the wall, Falleri came running out of the kitchen door and called to Cinquini to look out that Baldocchi was coming, with a pistol to shoot him. Cinquini just started to turn around when defendant came around the corner of the house and began shooting. He shot five times. . . . Cinquini fell at the first shot and Baldocchi kept shooting at him after he was down. He said as he was shooting \u2018take that\u2019 and \u2018are you satisfied?\u2019 One shot also struck Del Debbio. Defendant told us all to leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>or we would get some too.\u201d One shot took effect in the abdomen, another in the breast and a third in the mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Defendant testified to the occurrence on the porch: \u201cI jumped through the window of my room and came right around the porch, and when I got right to the corner I saw Cinquini. ... I was going around to the corner to wash my face, and when I got to the corner I saw Cinquini, he had his hand in his pocket and he offered to shoot me and I shoot him first. ... At the time I shot Cinquini he was standing between two men and had got his hand in his pocket. I was afraid of all of them. I thought Cinquini was going to shoot me, I saw he had a pistol in the house that day; I saw it in' the morning. ... I was five or six feet from him when I shot him. Cinquini did not say anything just dropped dead. I don\u2019t know whether he moved after I shot him the first time or not. I hit him in the stomach the first time where I aimed to shoot him. The next shot I shot him in the stomach. The next shot was, he was on the floor, I don\u2019t know that I hit him in the mouth. I don\u2019t know what became of that bullet that was shot toward the floor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention is that the instruction complained of \u201celiminates entirely the right of defendant to stand his ground and places upon him the duty to flee when attacked. \u2019 \u2019 And it is argued that \u201cin requiring retreat of defendant, the trial court impliedly found as a fact that appellant was the aggressor in the fatal combat, for this court has held that unless a party be the aggressor, he has the right to stand his ground and need not flee, and even in some cases this fight is accorded the aggressor.\u201d (Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>117 Cal. 191, [59 Am. St. Rep. 167, 48 Pac. 1088]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Newcomer, </em>118 Cal. 263, [50 Pac. 405]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Maughs, </em>149 Cal. 253, [86 Pac. 187].)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The cases showing under what circumstances \u2018it becomes the duty of the defendant to flee, and when he has the right to stand his ground and even to pursue his aggressor, are not to be misunderstood, for they leave no obscurity as to their meaning. The learned trial judge was not unmindful of these decisions nor did he deprive the defendant of their benefit, for he gave the following instructions: \u201cI instruct you that the defendant has the right to stand his ground if assaulted, or threatened with an assault which might produce death or great bodily injury, and that he is not required to retreat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>when so threatened or assaulted, from a place in which he has a right to he, even if such retreat would relieve him from the necessity of acting in self-defense. It is the law of this state that a man has the right to stand' his ground if assaulted or pursued by another, even if to do so it becomes necessary to take the life of his assailant. \u2019 \u2019 Again, the court told the jury: \u201cI charge you that if the defendant believed that he was in imminent danger of being killed or of suffering great bodily injury, and the circumstances were such as to excite the fears of a reasonable man that to stand his ground would further imperil him, that he would have the right to pursue his adversary until he had secured himself - from all danger. \u2019 \u2019 Bead in connection with the foregoing, the instruction complained of is the statement of an obviously sound principle and could by no possibility have prejudiced the defendant. He had the benefit of the doctrine contended for to the fullest extent. Indeed, it may be doubted whether the facts as they appeared, even giving all reasonable weight to defendant\u2019s testimony, would warrant the application of the rule at all. Defendant commenced shooting as soon as he saw deceased, following up his brutal assault even after his victim lay prostrate before him. All that even defendant states as justification is that deceased had his\u2019 hands in his pocket. He made no move to draw a weapon; he did not start toward defendant nor did he indicate any intention to assault defendant, whose fears seem only to have been based upon his having seen a pistol in the hands of deceased the morning of that day. The killing was a brutal, cold-blooded murder without semblance of justification on the ground of self-defense. To hold that the deceased was in any sense an aggressor would be a gross distortion of the facts. It is true that in the first altercation, when deceased assaulted defendant to avenge the insult to Mrs. Baldocchi, deceased was the aggressor. But that affair had ended, deceased was no longer an aggressor, and defendant had ample time to cool his blood. If it can be brought into the question at all, it tends to furnish the probable motive of the killing as having been in retaliation for the assault by deceased, who had ceased to be the aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Complaint is made that the court refused to give the instruction found at folio 71 of the transcript upon the weight to be given to evidence of previous good character. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>instructed the jury fully and correctly upon the subject and was not called upon to repeat the instruction. Besides, the instruction asked stated: \u201cI further instruct you that the jury have the right to say by their verdict, that the defendant\u2019s character outweighs the evidence against him, even if the evidence outside of the evidence of good character, conclusively establishes his guilt.\u201d It is difficult to see how such a statement of the law can be upheld. Evidence of good character comes to the aid of the presumption of innocence and is a fact to be proven, as tending in a greater or less degree to establish innocence, and cannot be put aside by the jury in order to ascertain if the other facts and circumstances, considered by themselves, do not establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, as the court instructed the jury. But where guilt is conclusively established, to say that evidence of good character alone will warrant a jury in acquitting the defendant is to turn the jury loose, Avithout bridle or bit, to follow whatever whim may strike them. However this may be, it is sufficient to say that the jury were fully instructed upon the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Witness Bonturi was asked on cross-examination this question: \u201cAt the time Ginquini had turned around, had he started back to renew the fight?\u201d The court sustained an objection made on the ground that it calls for a conclusion of the witness. It would have been proper to ask the witness to state what deceased did when he turned around upon the approach of defendant and to ask the witness whether he-started back, but it could not be assumed by the witness that it was to renew the fight or for any other purpose. Defendant did not attempt to ascertain further what deceased did at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">There are some other rulings objected to, but we find in none of them occasion for further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Hart, J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
