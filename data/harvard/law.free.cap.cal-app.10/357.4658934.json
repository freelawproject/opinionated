The respondent upon the hearing made no objection to the consideration of questions involved in this form of proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The information is based upon section 563 of the Penal Code of this state, which provides that \u201cevery director, officer, or agent of any corporation . . . who, with intent to defraud, . . . makes, or -concurs in making, any false entries ... in any book of accounts, or other record or document kept by such corporation, ... is punishable,\u201d etc. It is petitioner's contention that under this section the false entry to be criminal must have been in a book of account, or other record of account, and that unless the information shows that the book, record, or document in which the false entry was made was one containing accounts; that is to say, a detailed statement of mutual demands in the nature of debit and credit between the parties arising out of contract or fiduciary relationship, no offense is charged. With this we do not agree. Section 377, Civil Code, requires all corporations for profit to keep a record of all their business transactions; a journal of all meetings of the directors, members, or stockholders; the record must embrace every act done, or ordered to be done, who were present, etc. And by section 316, Civil Code, any officer making an entry in the records or books of a corporation false in any material representation is made liable for damages. We think the language of section 563, Penal Code, broad enough to cover any record or document which by law is ordered to be kept by a corporation for profit, and especially should this be true with reference to a record embodying, as does the record alleged to have been falsified in this ease, statements relative to the financial condition of the corporation, and involving contract rights with the corporation and the liability of the corporation with its servants and employees as to salary and compensation; that even under the restricted construction contended for by petitioner, this record alleged to have been falsified was a record containing business transactions in the nature of debit and credit between the corporation and those dealing therewith arising out of contract; and, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>sense, while a record and minute-book, was also a book containing memoranda of financial transactions which would render it, to a limited extent, a book of account.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Writ denied and petitioner remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
