The point, however, has been decided contrary to appellant\u2019s contention in the ease of <em>Pio </em>v. <em>Aigeltinger, </em>97 Cal. 81, 83, [31 Pac. 895], and the rule is precisely the same now as it was when that ease was decided, (64 Cal. 639 and 144 Cal. xliii, xliv, [78 Pac. ix]). The court there held that the certificate was merely evidence of facts, and that it was unnecessary to file or present it before the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Upon the authority of that case we hold that the objection to the hearing of the motion is untenable; and that as the transcript was not filed within the prescribed time the motion to dismiss should be granted, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">Hall, J., and Cooper, P. J., concurred,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
