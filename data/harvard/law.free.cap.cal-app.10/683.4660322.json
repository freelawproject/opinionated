App. 655, [88 Pac. 991], the writ being denied. As one of the reasons given for denying the writ, it was said that petitioner had a remedy by appeal from the judgment of the superior court, if the writ should be denied by that court, and the proceeding was, in accordance with the suggestion in the opinion, prosecuted to a judgment in the superior court, and is now before us on appeal. With the reasons stated in the opinion filed on the former application we are entirely satisfied, and think they fully answer all the questions here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In the federal case cited by appellant <em>(Dobbins </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>195 U. S. 223, [25 Sup. Ct. 18]), the distinction between ordinances which regulate \u201cuseful business enterprises\u201d and those which are not to be so classified is expressly recognized, and the law of that ease is made applicable only where a \u201cuseful\u201d enterprise or business is under consideration. It is only where a business is lawful and has no injurious tendency that the governing body cannot say who shall and who shall not exercise the right itself. <em>(Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Hollywood etc., </em>124 Cal. 344, [71 Am. St. Rep. 75, 57 Pac. 153].)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Public billiard-halls and poolrooms have been distinctly classified by this court as among those which cannot lay claim to being within the rule applicable to \u201cuseful\u201d enterprises, in two decisions filed since the former opinion in the controversy before us was filed. <em>(Ex parte Meyers, </em>7 Cal. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>528, [94 Pac. 870]; <em>Ex parte Murphy, </em>8 Cal. App. 440, [97 Pac. 199]); and the views expressed in the latter case are approved by the supreme court in an application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>made to it in the same matter. <em>(In re Murphy, 155 </em>Cal. 322, [100 Pac. 1134].)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Conceding that no arbitrary discretion can be exercised by the board of police commissioners in applying the ordinance in question, the reasons assigned by the answer for denying the application for a license were exactly such as should actuate a police department in denying a permit or license to keep a place of amusement which is liable to become the scene of disorderly conduct and disturbances of the peace. It cannot be urged that, though the ordinance be fair and lawful in its terms and provisions, it was so enforced as to work a discrimination against a part of the community or some particular member or members thereof, for no <em>lawful reasons. (Yick Wo </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>118 U. S. 356, [6 Sup. Ct. 1064]; <em>Dobbins </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>195 U. S. 223, 240, [25 Sup. Ct. 18].)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">We are of opinion that the writ was properly denied by the superior court, and its judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Allen, P. J., and Shaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
