Damon, deceased, to pay $1172, \u201cinheritance tax,\u201d under the act of the legislature approved March 20, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Appellant\u2019s only contention seems to be that said law is repugnant to the constitution of the state and especially to the fourteenth amendment of the constitution of the United States. The argument is based principally upon the theory that there is a discrimination between the citizens of this state and those of other states, but it would be a sufficient answer to say that it does not appear to which class appellant belongs and hence\u2014granting such discrimination\u2014it cannot be determined that appellant is an aggrieved party. What was said in <em>Estate of Johnson, </em>139 Cal. 534, [96 Am. St. Rep. 161, 73 Pac. 425], might well, therefore, be invoked: \u201cA court will not decide a constitutional question unless such construction is absolutely necessary; and in the Mahoney case, since the appellants were aliens and claimed no protective rights as citizens, no constitutional question was involved. It would have been sufficient in disposing \u00f3f their appeal to have said, as was said by the federal court in the case last cited: \u2018When a nonresident of the state assails the constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>ality of a statute upon the ground that it denies to him the privilege granted to the citizens of this state, it will be time enough to consider the constitutional question suggested. Courts will not listen to those who are not aggrieved by an invalid law.\u2019 As the Supreme Court of the United States has said in <em>Chicago Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Wellman, </em>143 U. S. 339, [12 Sup. Ct. 400]: \u2018But exercise of the power to declare the statute unconstitutional and void is the ultimate and supreme function of courts. It is legitimate only in the last resort and as a necessity in the determination of a real, earnest and vital controversy between individuals.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">But again, appellant admits that \u201cthe validity of said law has been upheld by several decisions of the Supreme Court,\u201d and therefore she hardly expects \u2018.\u2018the court to go back of their own rulings.\u201d With less reason, of course, could she expect us to overrule those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">All the questions, indeed, discussed by counsel have been settled adversely to appellant\u2019s contention in the following cases: <em>Estate of Wilmerding, </em>117 Cal. 281, [49 Pac. 181]<em>; Estate of Stanford, </em>126 Cal. 112, [54 Pac. 259, 58 Pac. 462], and <em>Estate of Martin, </em>153 Cal. 225, [94 Pac. 1053].</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Chipman, P. J., and Hart, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
