The record does not disclose that the woman was crying, but states that the court told her that no one was going to hurt her, and that she must not cry. \u201cNow, little girl,\u201d said the court, \u201cspeak loudly, so that these gentlemen here can understand what you have to say.\u201d The judge also carefully explained to her that she could not be compelled to give evidence of her own wrongdoing, if she were guilty of any wrongdoing, and that she could claim the right to refuse to answer questions which would incriminate her. The argument of the defendant is that \u201cthe attitude of the judge and the manner of addressing the Chinese woman in the presence of the jury\u201d prejudiced the jury against the defendant. But, in the absence of some substantial showing, it is not for this court to infer that tire trial judge assumed a manner whereby the defendant\u2019s rights were disregarded. If the witness was nervous or timid, it was. wholly proper for the\u2019judge to assure her that no one wished to harm her, and that she must speak so that the jurors could hear her. We cannot see tirat by addressing her as \u201clittle girl\u201d the court could have prejudiced the jury against the defendant. No possible intimation of a belief in the guilt of the defendant was conveyed by the use of the language, and there is nothing to justify any opinion other than that the judge was merefy trying to have the. witness appreciate that she need feel no fear while in the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The evidence in support of the verdict was very strong. It showed that the defendant and the woman were alone at night; that defendant took the woman to a house some distance away from the point where he met her; that defendant left his automobile with the lights turned off and under some trees; that the two remained in the house some time; that the officers found them together in a room with the door locked; that the lights were dimmed; that when discovered they were in such conditions of dress and in such positions in the room as to indicate adulterous relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Variance between the allegations of the indictment and the evidence is urged, because the indictment alleged that defendant was married to Wuai Kam Let, while the proof showed that the wife\u2019s name. was Foo Kwai Kim. But as there was evidence that at the time of the offense charged the defendant was lawfully married to a woman other than the alleged paramour, the variance between the name of his wife as pleaded in the indictment and as shown on tire trial was immaterial.\u2019 Bodkins v.
