To the plaintiff\u2019s petition the defendant interposed a plea denying the alleged indebtedness, and also a plea of recoupment seeking, to recover of the plaintiff an amount greater than that claimed in the plaintiff\u2019s petition. The plaintiff demurred to the last-mentioned special plea as it was amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-17\">With reference to this demurrer the record shows that the court \u201cordered that the demurrer be and it is hereby sustained.\u201d Other than the quoted order, the record does not show any disposition of the issues raised by the pleadings in the case. So far as appears from the record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the case stands at issue in the District Court, and the whole of it has not been finally determined by that court. We are of opinion that the order mentioned is not such a final decision as is required to support a writ of error. Judicial Code U. S. \u00a7 128; La Bourgogne, 210 U. S. 95, 28 Sup. Ct. 664, 52 L.
