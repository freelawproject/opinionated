From a decree for complainant, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Ai\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">The appellee herein, who was complainant below, was, on and prior to May 10, 1.915, in the employ of the appellant, the Great Northern Railway Company, as a cook on one of its work trains. While the company was moving the car on which appellee was working about the switch, it was derailed, and he was thrown against the sink in the car. The top cover of the stove fell upon Ms right foot, and, withal, he received certain physical injuries. To recover damages for such injuries as he received, he instituted an action against the company. The company by its answer pleaded a release of liability executed by appellee. The release is in language following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">\u201cKnow all men by these presents, that in consideration of the sum of ton and no/100 dollars to mo in hand paid by the Groat Northern Railway Company, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, have released, acquitted, and discharged, and do by those presents release, acquit, and discharge, said railway company, its successors and assigns, of and from any and all liability, causes of action, costs, charges, claims, or demands, of every name and nature, in any manner arising or growing out of, or to arise or grow out of, personal injuries received by me (W. J. Keid) at or near Geyser, in the state of Montana, on or about the 10th day of May, 1915, while acting as a cook, I met with an accident whereby I sustained personal injuries, or arising, or to arise, out of any and all personal injuries sustained by me at any time or place while in the employ of said railway company prior to the date of these presents. No promise of future employment has been made to me by said railway company as part consideration of this settlement and release, or otherwise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">The back of the release contains an indorsement in appellee\u2019s handwriting, namely:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">\u201cI have red within Releas before signing and fully understand that the sum of ten dollars is in full settlement of all claim of every kind.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-10\">\u201cW. ,T. Reid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-11\">In addition, appellee signed a voucher which contained substantially this provision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-12\">\u201cFor and in consideration of any and all claims, past, present, and prospective, against the Great Northern Railway Company, arising or to grow out of personal injuries received by me at or near Geyser, Montana, on or about May 10, 3915, $10.00.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-13\">For the purpase of having the release canceled, this suit was instituted against the company. Among other things, it is alleged, in effect, that appellee suffered the following injuries: A double inguinal hernia, a broken arch of the right foot, a severe wrench of the back, a severe shock to the nervous system, and, as resulting from such injuries, a semi-paralyzed condition of both legs; that on the same day the claim agent of the company took appellee to the office of its physician and surgeon, who, upon a cursory examination of appellee, informed Mm that his injuries were slight, and amounted to nothing more than a nervous shock and a slightly sprained ankle and instep, that he would be entirely recovered in a day or two; and that the claim agent would give him $19, representing two or three days\u2019 work, and would hold open his position for him ; that appellee accepted the $10 from the claim agent, for no other purpose than as pay for Ms time, and signed, the papers in question. It is further alleged that, at the time of signing the papers, appellee was not aware that he had broken the arch of his right i'oot, or had suffered double inguinal hernia, or any oilier injury which might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>cause any disability to Ms earning power, and that such or any injuries were never taken into consideration by Mm at tbe time of signing tbe documents in question, nor by tbe claim agent of tbe company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-4\">Tbe appellee\u2019s testimony is quite brief. He says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">\u201cTbe trucks ran off tbe. rails, and practically masbed tbe biggest part of tbe disbes. Tbe top of tbe stove fell across my foot, and it threw me up bodily against tbe sink, which was near tbe side of tbe car, and it burt me. I got burt on my foot, and I was shaken up completely, my nerves, nervous shock, and I have been sick practically ever since. Worked a little off and on. * * * They took me to tbe doctor\u2019s office in an automobile; examined my foot, bound it up, and told me I was badly shaken up, and said, \u2018You will be all right to work to-morrow, if necessary.\u2019 Just examined my foot, that was all. * * * And. after tbe doctor examined me tbe claim agent took me right up to bis office. He asked me to sign some papers. I don\u2019t know what they was. I was too confused. I can\u2019t remember one thing I signed, or anything. Q. State what be said to you. A. Why, be said it was necessary to send these back to St. Paul. That is what be said to me. Q. Did be offer you any money? A. No; be said, \u2018You better take $10 for to get some liniment,\u2019 and something like that \u2014 $10 to get some liniment to rub on my feet. Q. Did be say anything to you about your working or anything? A. Yes; be did; said I could just stay around town two days and go back to work whenever I wanted to. I have stated everything that tbe doctor told me about my condition then. * * * I believed tbe statements made to me in regard to my condition by the doctor. * * * Q. When did you first know, Mr. Eeid, that you had a double hernia? A. I don\u2019t know now. Tbe next day; I' didn\u2019t know what it was. I discovered something down there where it burt. I bad a very small rupture before on tbe right side, about tbe size of a marble. I bad worn an elastic truss. Q. Had you ever been bothered with it? A. Never; part of tbe time I would leave it in bed\u2014 wouldn\u2019t use it. When I went from Geyser to Great Falls, my foot was swollen up, so it burt me, and X cut my shoe- right up there. It swelled up a bit; bandaged it up. I went back to work that same day, because tbe doctor told me there was nothing tbe matter with me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">As to tbe writing, be says be just looked it over; that be could not read very well, and just signed it as it was written, and that it was not read to him. On cross-examination, be testified that be had bad a hernia on tbe right side for three years before.tbe accident, and told bow be came by it. As to the hernia on tbe left side, he said it did not bother him much \u2014 it was only a small one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">Dr. Downs, who examined appellee on February 26, 1916, states that Eeid was suffering from a right and left inguinal hernia; was in a very nervous condition, and very poorly nourished; bad a slight swelling in the right foot, wbicb be found to be a flatfoot. Tbe hernia on tbe right side was tbe larger one; tbe one on tbe left not so large \u2014 about tbe size of a walnut. Tbe arch on Ms foot was flattened out and broken down. This condition generally prevailed as to his left foot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">Dr. Longeway, tbe company\u2019s physician, testified that be examined appellee on tbe day of tbe accident; that appellee told him be bad a bruise about tbe shoulder and arm; that be examined Ms foot, and found that it was injured and bruised, and tbe ankle slightly sprained \u2014 and continued as follows: \u201cHe was walking on it; walked on it to tbe office. I asked him about Ms arm, and be said that didn\u2019t amount to anything. I asked him to take off bis coat, and be said that didn\u2019t amount to anything; bis injuries were not bad and be wouldn\u2019t take off bis coat and let me examine it He said that be would be all right; be was. just bruised about the right arm and shoulder. Consequently be didn\u2019t take off bis coat, and I didn\u2019t examine his arm. He said it didn\u2019t amount to anything and would be all right. I bandaged his foot and told him to stay around two or three days- and let me watch him. \u2018No,\u2019 be said, \u2018it is all right.\u2019 He wanted to get right back to work, and be left my office, and that wds tbe last I ever saw of him. His right foot then was practically the same as it is now, except it was more swollen around tbe ankle at that time than it is now. He bad a pretty flat foot. * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>He didn\u2019t at that time complain to me about any hernia, or any other injury than these that I have testified to. * * * I didn\u2019t make any statement to him that ho could go right back to work; that his injuries were slight. \u00ae \u00ae * I believed he would be all right in a lew days.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">P. B. Foley, the claim agent, testified that, after appellee had been to the doctor\u2019s office, Burton brought him into his office, and then as follows: \u2018T asked him, \u2018Hid the doctor look you over?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes. sir.\u2019 I said, \u2018What did he tell you?\u2019 \u2018He said my ankle was sprained a little; said he thought it would ,i&gt;e all right in a little while, and advised me to stay around a few days.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018I think you better do that.\u2019 I said, \u2018I think you better stay around here a few days and have the doctor attend you.\u2019 Ho says: \u2018No; I am anxious to get back to the job. I will be all right; it is a little sprain; I will be all right; I want to get back on the job.\u2019 I says, \u2018All right; suit yourself.\u2019 Then I said, \u2018Well, what do you want us to do for you?\u2019 He hesitated a little while, and he says: T don\u2019t know. I will only lose this day.\u2019 Then I says, \u2018Well, I would like to know what you want us to do for you in settlement, that is in the line of settlement.' He says. \u2018Well, how will i?10 do?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I says, \u2018if that is what you want,\u2019 I says, \u2018it is all right.\u2019 \u201d The release and oilier papers were then made out and signed. Burton corroborates this statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">Hr. H. P. Marshall, who made a recent examination, found appellee suffering from arteriosclerosis, double inguinal hernia, and double ilatfoot.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-7\">Charles S.

The release itself is as broad as it could be made, acquitting the company of all liability arising on account of the injuries received by appellee, whether then appearing or growing out of the same by development in the future, or arising or to arise out of any and all personal injuries sustained at any time or place while in the employ of the railway company prior to the date of the release. In such a release, however, the general language will he held not to include a particular injury, then unknown to both parlies, of a character so serious as clearly to indicate that, if it had been known, the release would not have been signed. This was the conclusion reached in Lumley v. Wabash R. Co. (C. C. A. 6th Circuit) 76 Fed. 66, 22 C. C. A. 60. See, also, Tatman v. Philadelphia, B. &amp; W. R. Co. (Del. Ch.) 85 Atl. 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> From the testimony, it is perfectly apparent that there was no fraud whatever attending the transaction of giving the release. Considerable concern was manifested by the claim agent that the affair should be speedily closed, but the appellee suffered no disadvantage by reason thereof. The appellee had come to Great Falls, a distance of 40 miles, of his own accord, with a view to getting relief of some sort from the company for his injuries. Having met Burton, he was taken to the office of the company\u2019s physician, and, after examination, repaired to the claim agent\u2019s office, where the release was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>soon signed. That he understood what he was signing, and the nature and purpose thereof, can scarcely be gainsaid. It is evident that he believed he was but slightly.hurt, and was seemingly anxious to get back to his work, and, so believing, he was willing to accept $10 and acquit the company of further liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Whether he knew and understood the full nature and extent of the real injuries sustained is the vital question for consideration. The proofs fall far short of substantiating the complaint as to the nature and extent of his injuries, and at present, according to the medical experts, his physical afflictions consist of arteriosclerosis, double inguinal hernia, and double flatfoot. It is not at all probable that the first of these conditions was superinduced by the accident. The evidence does not, in any substantial way,' indicate that such was the case. The third, namely, double flatfoot, existed prior to the accident, and was not caused thereby, while as to the right foot the condition may have been, and probably was, somewhat aggravated. As to the hernia, he had been so afflicted upon the right side for the space of three years, and thus far the accident has not contributed consequentially to his ailment. The hernia upon his left side had not developed prior to the accident. The first indication that he had of its existence was the next day,' when he says he \u201cdiscovered something down there where it hurt.\u201d Later, however, the trouble became well defined, and on February 26, 1916, when he was examined by Dr. Downs, it was about the size of a walnut. It further appears, however, that at the time of the trial appellee\u2019s body was poorly nourished, and that his general health and physical condition were far from good. Such was not the case to the same degree at the time of the accident, for he was doing his work, with some inconvenience only in getting about on account of his feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The rule unquestionably applies to settlements of the kind here involved that they neither can nor ought to be impeached and set aside for fraud or mistake, except upon clear and convincing proofs. Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. Wilcox, 116 Fed. 913, 54 C. C. A. 147. Has the. appellee met the exigency ? For upon him was devolved the burden of so impeaching the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">As we have seen, no conceivable fraud has been established. That appellee did receive a shock from being thrown against the sink, resulting in some distress to himself, can scarcely be questioned. At that time he was not afflicted with an inguinal hernia on his left side. The following day he experienced pain in that region of his person, and later the hernia developed, so that it became well defined. That he was so afflicted on February 26, 1916, is shown by Dr. Downs, who is corroborated in this by Dr. Longeway and Dr. Marshall. So it appears reasonably clear and certain that the development of this particular trouble began at least about the time of the accident, and that he was then afflicted in a way that was not known to him, and which for that reason ,was not disclosed to tire physician, and consequently not taken into consideration when he settled with the claim agent and gave the release. We think that, under the authorities, there is here sufficient to impeach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the settlement in so far as it relates to this phase of the controversy, and to that extent the release should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> We agree with the court below that it should not be disturbed as it respects the injury to his foot. Lumley v. Wabash R. Co., supra, is authority for the partial impeachment of the release. Upon the general question of annulling such a release, see, further, Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Fowler, 136 Fed. 118, 69 C. C. A. 106, where the authorities are aptly and clearly discussed and distinguished; also Tatman v. Phil., B. &amp; W. R. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> Another contention of appellant is that appellee is estopped from urging the annulment of the release on the ground that he refused to remove his clothing, so that the physican might examine his arm and shoulder, which appellee seemed to think were injured somewhat. That particular supposed injury, however, was not taken into account at the time of the settlement, and no question is made of it in this proceeding, and the incident is not of sufficient consequential importance to base an estoppel upon it against inquiry as to the real injuries sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b98-21\">&lt;\u00a9=&gt;For other cases see same topic <em>&amp; </em>KEY-NUMBER in all Key-Numbered Digests &amp; Indexes</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
