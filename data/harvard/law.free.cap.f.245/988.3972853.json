The record satisfies us that the inventions for which the said patents were granted show some patentable advance even in this very much crowded art, that appellant\u2019s infringement of the first-named patent is plainly apparent, and that unfair competition appears in the very close simulation by appellant of appellee\u2019s product in respect to unessential and nonfunctional details. We find that the issues presented by this controversy were properly disposed of by the decree entered in the District Court, and that decree is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
