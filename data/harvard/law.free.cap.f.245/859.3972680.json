But appellee had no monopoly of the news that he had obtained such a patent. Appellant\u2019s real offense therefore was in publishing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>description without stating at the same time that the structure was patented.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">No proof is in the record that appellant either had built or was threatening to build a garage of the patented type. Consequently there was no basis for a finding of direct infringement, actual or impending. For one to be guilty of contributory infringement, there must be a direct infringement, existing or threatened \u2014 something to which to contribute. No proof was made that any reader had-erected or was about to erect such a garage; or that any reader was accustomed to avail himself of the instructive matter in Popular Mechanics beyond his fireside and easy chair; or that the bare possibility that there was somewhere a reader who some time might act upon the information was in truth a greater possibility than if the article had also stated that appellee had obtained a patent on the structure. \u201eBut at all events a possibility is not a threat. In our judgment, therefore, no basis existed for a finding of contributory infringement. Compare Luten v. Town of Lee (D. C.) 206 Fed. 904; Walker on Patents, \u00a7 407; Toppan v. Tiffany Car Co. (C. C.) 39 Fed. 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The decree is reversed, and the cause remanded, for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"Aqfx\">oilier cases see same topic &amp; KEY-NUMBER in all Key-Numbered Digests <em>&amp; </em>Indexes</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
