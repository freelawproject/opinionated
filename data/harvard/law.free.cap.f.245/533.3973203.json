Pey, Contracting Agent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-14\">There is no dispute as to the accuracy of the above letters, nor as to their contents. On September 19, 1916, defendant in error filed its amended complaint, in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, against plaintiff in error, alleging substantially as follows: That plaintiff entered into a contract with defendant to furnish the labor and equipment to erect, rivet, and paint the structural steel to be used in the terminal buildings of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company at Prince Rupert, B. C., at an agreed price of $18 per ton, which price was based upon the understanding that the steel would be delivered completely fabricated, and that if extra work was necessary, other than for the erection of said steel, plaintiff would be allowed a reasonable amount for such extra work; that thereafter, when the erecting plans were received, plaintiff discovered that the steel would not be received at Prince Rupert completely fabricated, and thereupon notified defendant that plaintiff would charge defendant for the extra work required in fabricating the steel, and defendant, through its agent, Overmire, promised and agreed that said matter would be satisfactorily adjusted and instructed plaintiff to proceed with the work: that plaintiff fabricated and assembled the steel for the various buildings at an actual and reasonable expense of $3,330.69.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-15\">For a second cause of action it is alleged in the complaint that it was understood that the erecting under the above contract should begin when three pontoons had been floated in the dry docks of said terminal, and that defendant would not order plaintiff to begin work until such time as plaintiff could continuously keep at work until the completion of the job, and that defendant would reimburse plaintiff for any delays in the work; that it was further understood and agreed that defendant would furnish plaintiff with adequate space for the purpose of assorting and handling the structural steel when it was unloaded on the dock of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company; that defendant thereafter instructed plaintiff to commence work, and plaintiff did commence work, upon the buildings, and completed the same before three pontoons of the dry docks had been floated; that because of the premature instructions, and the delays in the completing of said pontoons, plaintiff\u2019s equipment was compelled to lie idle and remain in disuse from September 1, 1914, to November 5, 1914; and that the reasonable rental of said equipment for said period of time was $2,123.64.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-16\">For a third cause of action it is alleged in the complaint that plaintiff was compelled to return the laborers who were employed upon the work at Prince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Rupert, B. C., to Vancouver, B. C., and pay the railroad expenses and wages of the men while in transit, at a cost of $918, on account of the breach of the contract by defendant as set forth in the preceding paragraph.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-4\">For a fourth cause .of action it is alleged that, notwithstanding it was provided in the contract above mentioned that defendant would furnish plaintiff with adequate space for the purpose of assorting and handling the structural steel when it was unloaded on the dock of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, defendant disregarded this understanding and agreement, in that it failed to provide adequate space for such purpose, necessitating plaintiff\u2019s using extra time and labor in assorting and handling the steel; the reasonable value of said extra time and labor being $2,459.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-5\">For a fifth cause of action it is alleged that plaintiff, at the special instance and request of the defendant, performed extra work during the months of April, May, June, and July, 1915, for which it was understood and agreed that defendant should pay, and which amounted in the aggregate to the sum of $400.70.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-6\">Wherefore plaintiff prayed judgment in the sum of $9,232.03.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-7\">Defendant answered, alleging that it was understood between plaintiff and defendant that the latter should deliver the steel to plaintiff by water transportation, and that said steel should be delivered as completely fabricated as it was defendant\u2019s custom to ship by water transportation similar steel for similar work, and that defendant did in fact deliver the steel as completely fabricated as it was defendant\u2019s custom when shipping by water transportation; that plaintiff\u2019s construction operations were conducted under the orders and instructions of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and not under the orders and instructions of defendant; that the pontoons and space for storing mentioned in the complaint were to be furnished and provided by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and not by defendant, and that plaintiff\u2019s loss or damage mentioned in the second, third, and fourth causes of action was not occasioned by defendant; and that plaintiff\u2019s claim of $400.70 for extra work was duly allowed by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and the amount thereof deducted from certain indebtedness due from plaintiff to the railway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-8\">The case came on for trial before a jury, who thereafter returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $7,000. Defendant alleges error in the admission of certain testimony over defendant\u2019s objection, in the giving of certain instructions, and in the refusal by the court to give certain other instructions requested by defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-9\">Teal, Minor &amp; Winfree and Rogers MacVeagh, all of Portland, Or., for plaintiff.in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-10\">McDougal &amp; McDougal, of Portland, Or., for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b548-11\">Before GILBERT, MORROW, and HUNT, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b548-12\">MORROW, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ao8\">(after stating the facts as above). <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The defense that the work was done for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and not for the defendant, cannot be sustained. The plaintiff had no contractual relations whatever with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. It is true the work was done under the terms of a subcontract provided for in an original contract between the defendant and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway; but the contract in suit was between the plaintiff and defendant. This is expressly admitted in a number of paragraphs in defendant\u2019s answer, and particularly in paragraph 4, where it is alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-13\">\u201cPlaintiff submitted to defendant written proposals for the performance of a part of said contract between defendant and Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, which proposals were accepted in writing by defendant, and said proposals and acceptance constituted and do now constitute the contract between plaintiff and defendant mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s said amended complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The main question for this court to determine is whether or not the contract between the parties, and under which the work in question was done, was entirely in writing; that is, whether the four letters introduced in evidence and relied upon by the defendant contained the completed contract. If that question can be answered in the affirmative as a matter of law, then it was the duty of the trial judge to construe such contract; but, if it must be answered in the negative, it was within the province of the jury, and its duty, under proper instructions from the court, to determine what the contract was, not only from the writings introduced as setting forth the alleged agreement, but from all the evidence produced in connection with such writings and the subject-matter thereof. Etting v. United States Bank, 11 Wheat. (24 U. S.) 57, 75, 6 L. Ed. 419; Rankin v. Fidelity Ins. Trust &amp; Savings Deposit Co., 189 U. S. 242, 252, 23 Sup. Ct. 553, 47 L. Ed. 792; American Bridge &amp; Contract Co. v. Bullen Bridge Co., 29 Or. 549, 46 Pac. 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> That the contract was not entirely in writing we think is admitted by the defendant in its answer, wherein it states, in paragraph VII, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">\u201cIt was mutually understood and agreed by and between plaintiff and defendant, at the time said contract between plaintiff and defendant was entered into, and said contract between plaintiff and defendant was made upon the express understanding, that defendant should deliver said steel to plaintiff by water transportation, and that said steel should be delivered as completely fabricated as it was defendant\u2019s custom to ship by water transportation similar steel for similar work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Again, in paragraph IX, allusion is made to the fact that \u201csaid contract between plaintiff and defendant was made with the express understanding\u201d that certain conditions existed, while in paragraph X it is positively set forth as a defense that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cIt was mutually understood and agreed by and between plaintiff and defendant, at the time said contract between plaintiff and defendant was entered into, and said contract between plaintiff and defendant was made with the express understanding, that the pontoons for the wing of the dry dock should be furnished and provided by Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and not by defendant, and said pontoons are the pontoons mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s said amended complaint; and it was mutually understood and agreed by and between plaintiff and defendant, at the time said contract between plaintiff and defendant was entered into, and said contract between plaintiff and defendant was made with the express understanding, that space for storing, assorting, and handling said steel on the dock of Grand Trunk Pacific Railway at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, should be furnished and provided by Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and not by defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">These allegations in themselves disclose the fact that the contract under which the work in question was done was not fully expressed by the writings, and that the court could not as matter of law exclude evidence of the oral agreements and mutual understanding of the parties upon which such writings were based, and in accordance with which said work was done; nor could the court decline to submit to the jury the question of what the real contract was between the parties, and whether the terms of that contract had been properly carried out. That the execution of a more formal instrument by the parties was contemplated is shown in a paragraph of one of the letters of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>fendant set forth in the pleadings, where it is said that \u201cour formal contract with you for the erection will be drawn up as soon as conditions permit.\u201d The testimony shows that the plaintiff tried repeatedly to have such an instrument prepared and executed, but defendant failed, for some reason not disclosed, to comply. Having had ample opportunity to reduce to writing the full details of their agreement, and failed to do so, the defendant is not now in a position to invoke the rule of law which prohibits the introduction of oral evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument. That rule does not apply to the facts of this case, from any standpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The first, second, third, and fourth causes of action are based upon the agreement alleged by plaintiff to have been made, and the court having properly instructed the jury in regard thereto, tire findings of the jury as to the facts will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The fifth cause of action relates to the performance of extra work by the plaintiff at the alleged instance and request of the defendant, outside of the alleged contract, for which a charge is made of $400.70. The defendant admits that this work was done at its request, but alleges that the work was ordered at various times by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and such orders merely transmitted by defendant to plaintiff; that after said work was completed plaintiff\u2019s claim of $400.70 therefor was presented by plaintiff to the said Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and duly allowed, and the amount thereof deducted from certain indebtedness due from plaintiff to said railway. Evidence was introduced upon this matter, and the question submitted to the jury under proper instructions from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Finding no error in the instructions of the co\u00fcrt below, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b545-26\">\u00ae=&gt;For other oases see same topic &amp; KEY-NUMBER in all Key-Numbered Digests &amp; Indexes</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b546-25\">(gs^For other cases see same topic &amp; KEY-NUMBER in all Key-Numbered Digests &amp; Indexes</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
