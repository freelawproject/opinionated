One thing that veteran ballplayers and fans know, long before the opening pitch, is that there are dangers on the base path. That is illustrated by this case of 13 year old St. Mark\u2019s Parish second baseman Tara Kelly, whose ankle fractured when a St. Joseph\u2019s Parish player slid into her as she made the tag.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Seeking to revive their $10 million lawsuit, Tara and her parents, Daniel and Terry Kelly, ask us to reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of all five defendants/appellees: St. Mark\u2019s Parish; St. Joseph\u2019s Parish; Phillip John Welch, manager of the St. Joseph\u2019s team; the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, D.C. (the Archdiocese); and the Catholic Youth Organization (CYO). Restated, the Kellys\u2019 contentions are that the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County erred in disregarding evidence supporting inferences that Tara was injured as a result of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">I. \u201cCoaching\u201d failures in training players and coaches to safely execute the slide and tag-out play, and in matching players of uneven skill;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">II. Failure to equip the diamond with \u201cbreakaway bases\u201d that might have prevented Tara\u2019s injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">III. Improper care of Tara in the aftermath of the on-field collision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">As to the first and second liability theories, we agree with the circuit court that the Kellys assumed the risks of Tara\u2019s injury, as well as the risk of playing on a field with stationary bases. As to the third theory, we see nothing in the summary judgment record to suggest that the injuries for which the Kellys seek compensation resulted from any breach of the defendants\u2019 duty of care to Tara after her injury. We shall affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Tara was hurt in an April 22, 1997 fast pitch softball game at St. Joseph\u2019s Parish. She was playing second base for the St. Mark\u2019s Parish 7th and 8th grade team in a CYO league. In the bottom of the first inning, with no outs, St. Joseph\u2019s was already beating St. Mark\u2019s badly. According to Tara, Amy G., a good player for St. Joseph\u2019s, hit the ball, rounded first, and headed for second base. Amy slid into the base feet first, colliding with Tara, who made the tag for the first out of the inning.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Tara\u2019s right foot had been positioned on the back corner of the stationary base, which was anchored by a stake into the ground. She placed it along the side toward first base, but left most of the base open along the base path, so that she did not obstruct Amy\u2019s path. In the collision, Tara\u2019s ankle was severely fractured.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Terry Kelly, Tara\u2019s mother, was watching the game. She had just arrived and was in the process of setting up her chair when she looked out on the field, just in time to see Amy G. sliding into second. Tara and Terry both described Amy\u2019s slide as curved instead of straight.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Although Tara\u2019s ankle was not bleeding and the break was not compound, it was immediately identified as a serious injury. As Tara recalled it, after a just \u201ccouple of minutes,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>she was carried from the field by Coach Welch from St. Joseph\u2019s and a woman whom she did not know.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Terry Kelly, in an effort to get Tara to the hospital as quickly as possible, brought her car up next to the field. Tara was carried five or six more steps to the car, then driven by her mother to the emergency room at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After three surgeries, Tara has intermittent pain and some activity limitations as a result of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The Kellys filed a nine count complaint against CYO, St. Joseph\u2019s Parish, its coach, and St. Mark\u2019s Parish, as well as the Archdiocese of Washington, under whose supervision the parishes and their staffs work. The counts included negligence allegations that the defendants failed to train players and coaches how to safely play softball, failed to ensure that Tara\u2019s team was not scheduled to play against teams with more skilled players, failed to equip the field with breakaway bases that may have prevented Tara\u2019s injury, and failed to ensure that coaches and volunteers were trained to handle emergencies involving game injuries. Extensive discovery ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Tara testified at her deposition that she loved playing sports. She regularly followed and watched professional baseball. Tara\u2019s grandfather was a professional baseball player, and her father occasionally played softball. She knew \u201cthe rules of softball,\u201d including that she had to tag the runner with the ball to make the out. She did not \u201cremember ever being told it, but [she] knew the rule\u201d because she had \u201ckind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>grown up with baseball\u201d and \u201cthe rules are very similar\u201d to softball.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Before her injury, Tara had played CYO softball the three previous years, and T-ball before that. She \u201c[mjainly\u201d played second base and shortstop. She liked softball and considered herself a good player. She was on St. Mark\u2019s \u201cA\u201d team in both her seventh and eighth grade years. That year, the St. Mark\u2019s team was one of the average teams in the league, not the worst, but not the best.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Later, in an affidavit opposing summary judgment, Tara declared that she was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">never trained by [her] softball coach, Mrs. Brady, in the \u201crules of softball\u201d and did not know the actual rules of softball. This is apparent since I thought I had to keep my foot on the base in order to tag out a runner. It is clear that I was given the wrong instruction on how to tag out a runner sliding into second while avoiding the runner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Daniel Kelly, Tara\u2019s father, testified at his deposition that he was not at the game when Tara was injured. But he was the St. Mark\u2019s Parish softball commissioner at that time. He had watched some of the St. Mark\u2019s practices, and hit ground balls for the players. He recounted that one of St. Mark\u2019s coaches taught Tara how \u201cto get a foot and one corner\u201d of the base. Tara also learned \u201c[t]o reach into the base to tag out and there should be no problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Tara\u2019s coach, Patricia Brady, testified at her deposition that she considered the CYO league to be for \u201cdevelopmental instruction,\u201d \u201cparticipation,\u201d and \u201cfun.\u201d She described Tara as \u201cone of the better skilled\u201d players on the St. Mark\u2019s team.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">With respect to instruction and training, Brady explained that she \u201cwork[ed] with [her] infield girls .... a lot[,]\u201d and specifically coached Tara in how to play second base. Brady\u2019s daughter, who played second base on her high school softball team, also \u201chad come ... at least on two occasions specifically to work with Tara\u201d on fielding at second base.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>One constant and transcending lesson was \u201cnot to block the base,\u201d which Brady taught to avoid injury. In addition, Brady coached Tara \u201cto stand either in front of the base, behind the base, or ... on the side of the base where the runner would not be coming.\u201d When asked whether she \u201ctrain[ed] her, in terms of how she would know where the runner was going to be coming,\u201d Brady replied, \u201cNo, I did not. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a skill that needs to be trained.\u201d In her view, the \u201celement of risk\u201d involved in fielding against a sliding base runner was a matter that \u201ceverybody knows\u201d as a matter of \u201ccommon sense[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Thomas Manco, director of CYO programs, testified in deposition that, \u201c[ujnder the rules, the batter/runner has the right to reach the base without obstruction by the fielder.\u201d The rules in use for the CYO league stated that \u201c[rjunners are never required to slide,\u201d but also provide that a base runner is required to \u201clegally attempt to avoid a fielder in the immediate act of making a play on her.\u201d Sliding is one common way to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Phillip Welch coached both the St. Joseph\u2019s team and a \u201cselect\u201d team in a different competitive league called the \u201cMarylanders.\u201d The Marylanders team was not affiliated with CYO or any of the parishes. Tara recalled that one of her St. Mark\u2019s teammates and another of her St. Mark\u2019s classmates played for the Marylanders. After she was injured, Tara also came to believe that Amy G. was on the Marylanders; Welch, however, testified that she was not on his Marylanders team that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Welch instructed his players to slide \u201c[a]ny time there is a play at the bag that they are going to,\u201d for \u201c[sjafety reasons.\u201d He pointed out that \u201c[t]he alternative is the two girls running into each other, versus sliding into the base.\u201d Welch told his team that sliding \u201cwas mandatory\u201d because \u201cNational High School Federation rules require you to slide into a bag ... at any time during a play at any bag. You cannot go in and run over a player at a bag or you\u2019re automatically thrown out of the game.\u201d He \u201cspent hours on sliding drillsf,]\u201d telling the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>players that \u201cthe sliding was for their safety, as well as the other player.\u201d He taught them to go into the bag with their lead foot, which in Amy\u2019s case was her right foot. Welch told her that she should \u201c[ajlways\u201d aim for the bag. He \u201c[njever\u201d told his players that they were allowed to try to knock the fielder down.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County granted summary judgment on all counts to all defendants. As to the negligent training and mismatch claims, the court concluded that \u201ca person of normal intelligence, in a similar position as [the Kellys], would clearly have comprehended the danger\u201d in tagging out a sliding base runner. Citing Tara\u2019s four years in softball and her \u201cnormal intelligence,\u201d the court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">[t]he issue of whether [Tara] had knowledge of the danger and appreciated that risk, and thus, assumed the risk is for the Court.... [The Kellys] clearly understood the risk of injury by participating in softball and especially when Tara Kelly positioned herself in front of or in the path of a runner that could result in a collision. Contact between a runner and the base defender is a risk incidental to the game of softball, which is obvious and foreseeable. Furthermore, sliding is a part of softball....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">[The Kellys] had knowledge of the risk of collision and injury, appreciated that risk and voluntarily participated and permitted Tara Kelly to expose herself to that risk by participating in the softball game.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">As to the negligence and premises liability claims relating to the use of stationary bases, the court also held that the Kellys had assumed the risk of playing on field with them. Even \u201c[a]ssuming the use of the non-breakaway bases created a dangerous condition[,]\u201d the stationary staked bases \u201cwere open and visible and available for inspection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">With respect to the negligent training in emergency care claim, the court concluded that the Kellys \u201cfailed to present admissible evidence of negligence\u201d to show either that \u201cthe [defendants breached their duty of care in the manner in which Plaintiff Tara Kelly was treated after sustaining an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>injury\u201d or that Tara\u2019s \u201cinjuries were worsened when she was removed from the field or thereafter.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The Kellys noted this appeal, in which they challenge the judgments on their training, mismatch, breakaway bases, and emergency care claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">Assumption Of The Risk</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u201cAssumption of the risk negates the issue of a defendant\u2019s negligence by virtue of a plaintiffs previous abandonment of his or her right to maintain an action if an accident occurs.\u201d <em>McQuiggan v. Boy Scouts of America, </em>73 Md.App. 705, 710, 536 A.2d 137 (1988). The concept</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASA\">is grounded on the theory that a plaintiff who voluntarily consents, either expressly or impliedly, to exposure to a known risk cannot later sue for damages incurred from exposure to that risk.... \u201c[The defense] rests upon an intentional and voluntary exposure to a known danger and, therefore, consent on the part of the plaintiff to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward him and to take his chances from harm from a particular risk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-8\"><em>Crews v. Hollenbach, </em>358 Md. 627, 640-41, 751 A.2d 481 (2000) (citations omitted). Thus, if the plaintiff \u201c(1) had knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the risk of danger, (2) appreciated that risk and (3) voluntarily exposed himself to it[,]\u201d then assumption of the risk has been established. <em>Liscombe v. Potomac Edison Co., </em>303 Md. 619, 630, 495 A.2d 838 (1985) (citation omitted); <em>see McQuiggan, </em>73 Md.App. at 710, 536 A.2d 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Whether a risk has been assumed in a particular situation is measured by an objective standard.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See ADM P\u2019ship v. Martin, </em>348 Md. 84, 91, 702 A.2d 730 (1997); <em>Saponari v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>126 Md.App. 25, 32, 727 A.2d 396, <em>cert. denied, </em>353 Md. 473, 727 A.2d 382 (1999). \u201c \u2018[A] plaintiff will not be heard to say that he did not comprehend a risk which must have been obvious to him.\u2019 \u201d <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 91, 702 A.2d 730 (citation omitted). \u201cAlthough the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>question of whether the plaintiff assumed the risk is normally for the jury, if it is clear that an individual of normal intelligence, in the plaintiffs position, must have understood the danger, then the issue is for the court.\u201d <em>Saponari, </em>126 Md.App. at 32, 727 A.2d 396; <em>see ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 91-92, 702 A.2d 730; <em>Schroyer v. McNeal, </em>323 Md. 275, 283-84, 592 A.2d 1119 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Assumption of the risk principles apply to children as well as adults. <em>See Bliss v. Wiatrowski, </em>125 Md.App. 258, 273, 724 A.2d 1264, <em>cert. denied, </em>354 Md. 571, 731 A.2d 970 (1999); <em>McQuiggan, </em>73 Md.App. at 710-12, 536 A.2d 137. Like adults, children are held to an objective standard, albeit one reflecting the child\u2019s age, mental capacity, experiences, and circumstances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For example, in <em>McQuiggan, </em>we held that a 12 year old boy assumed the risk of an eye injury that occurred shortly after he decided to stop playing a rubberband-paper clip shooting game with his friends. <em>See McQuiggan, </em>73 Md.App. at 711, 536 A.2d 137. In doing so, we recognized that \u201cthere is no doubt that a child of that age can assume the risk of his or her actions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In <em>Bliss v. Wiatrowski, </em>we approved the following jury instructions in a case involving a 16 year old passenger\u2019s negligence claim against the intoxicated driver with whom she accepted a ride:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">[Assumption of the risk ... may bar recovery by a guest passenger of a drunken driver, who knows or should know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>of the driver\u2019s condition, if the driver\u2019s negligence, due to intoxication, is the cause of the accident causing injury.... A child, however, is not to be held to the same standard or degree of care that an adult would have used.... A child should be deemed to have assumed the risk if another child of similar age, intelligence, experience and development, would have acted differently, under the same circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><em>Bliss, </em>125 Md.App. at 273-74, 724 A.2d 1264 (emphasis added). These instructions \u201caccurately set[] forth the separate standard of care for minors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Assuming Sports Risks</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Among the dangers commonly cited to illustrate assumption of the risk concepts are the physical risks intrinsic to the sport of baseball. <em>See, e.g., </em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 68, at 488 (5th ed. 1984)(\u201cThere are some things, as for example the risk of injury if one is hit by a baseball driven on a line, which are so far a matter of common knowledge in the community, that in the absence of some satisfactory explanation a denial of such knowledge simply is not to be believed\u201d); <em>Yount v. Johnson, </em>121 N.M. 585, 915 P.2d 341, 345 (App. 1996)(\u201cA baseball can be hit or even thrown with bone-crushing velocity. Rules permit hard sliding, even the occasional close pitch. It is all part of the game, and its contours are commonly understood, whether in the stadium or in the sandlot\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">But softball and baseball players do not assume all risks of injury simply by participating in a game. <em>See McQuiggan, </em>73 Md.App. at 711, 536 A.2d 137. With respect to athletes injured during play, the general rule is that \u201c \u2018[a] voluntary participant in any lawful game, sport or contest, in legal contemplation by the fact of his participation, assumes all risks incidental to the game, sport or contest which are obvious and foreseeable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nesbitt v. Bethesda Country Club, Inc., </em>20 Md.App. 226, 232, 314 A.2d 738 (1974)(quoting 4 Am.Jur.2d \u00a7 98)(emphasis added). Thus, the risks assumed by participating in a game are only the \u201cusual\u201d and foresee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>able dangers that a similarly situated player reasonably would expect to encounter during that game. <em>See McQuiggan, </em>73 Md.App. at 711, 536 A.2d 137. These foreseeable dangers include risk of injury resulting from the type of physical contact that is an integral part of the sport as it is typically played. <em>See Hammond v. Bd. of Educ. of Carroll County, </em>100 Md.App. 60, 69-70, 639 A.2d 223 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">We have applied these principles in cases involving a variety of injuries incurred during voluntary games. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>(general rule supported summary judgment against 16 year old girl severely injured during contact football scrimmage); <em>McQuiggan, </em>73 Md.App. at 712, 536 A.2d 137 (affirming summary judgment against 12 year old who assumed risk of eye injury during rubberband-paper clip shooting game); <em>Nesbitt, </em>20 Md.App. at 232, 314 A.2d 738 (rule supported summary judgment against 15 year old golfer who assumed risk of injury during driving range practice). The Kellys, however, have eschewed the \u201cnegligent play,\u201d \u201cnegligent supervision,\u201d and \u201cfailure to warn\u201d claims that we addressed in those cases, in favor of negligent training, matching, and equipping claims. Moreover, instead of suing her coach or the player who injured Tara, the Kellys sued only the St. Joseph\u2019s coach, the parishes who sponsored the two teams, the CYO league, and the Catholic Archdiocese, which is the sponsoring organization for the CYO league and the two parishes. The Kellys contend that, even if they assumed the risk of injury resulting from negligent play, they could not have assumed the risk of injury from failing to adequately instruct players and coaches how to avoid this type of sliding injury, failing to match players of similar skill, or failing to use the safer breakaway bases.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">We found no Maryland precedent considering assumption of the risk, or the \u201cno duty\u201d principles underlying that concept, in the \u201cnegligent coaching\u201d context. In <em>Hammond, </em>we did recognize the viability of an assumption of risk defense to a negligent coaching claim. In that case, we affirmed summary judgment against the family of a 16 year old girl who was permanently injured while playing in her first varsity football scrimmage. <em>See Hammond, </em>100 Md.App. at 70, 639 A.2d 223. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Although the Hammonds had signed a written consent and waiver form permitting their daughter to play on the boys\u2019 team, they claimed that the waiver was invalid because school officials failed to adequately warn them about the risk of such a serious injury. We rejected that claim, observing that \u201c \u2018the law does not make a school the insurer of the safety of pupils at play[,]\u2019 \u201d and that \u201ccourts have been extremely inhospitable to claims that properly equipped, injured ... players should be able to recover from school officials for injuries sustained during an ordinary, voluntary contact sport game.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 66-67, 639 A.2d 223 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">We also emphasized what is obvious to anyone who plays and watches sports \u2014 that many games require physical contact between opposing players, so that participants are presumed to know that \u201c \u2018there is no other way to play\u2019 \u201d without some risk of physical injury during such contact. <em>See id. </em>at 66-67, 639 A.2d 223. \u201c[Pjermeating the sports injury cases is the recognition that \u2018[pjhysical contact in ... an athletic contest is foreseeable and expected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Albers v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 302 of Lewis County, </em>94 Idaho 342, 487 P.2d 936, 939 (1971)). Moreover, \u201cit is \u2018common knowledge that children participating in games ... may injure themselves and ...

In California, where sports law concerning assumption of inherent risks has been developed through case law, the Supreme Court has held that \u201ca sports instructor or coach owes a duty of due care not to increase the risk of harm inherent in learning an active sportf.]\u201d <em>Kahn, </em>4 Cal.Rptr.3d 103, 75 P.3d at 39.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">[A]s a matter of policy, it would not be appropriate to recognize a duty of care when to do so would require that an integral part of the sport be abandoned, or would discourage vigorous participation in sporting events. Accordingly, defendants generally do not have a duty to protect the plaintiff from the risks inherent in the sport, or to eliminate risk from the sport, although they generally do have a duty not to increase the risk of harm beyond what is inherent in the sport.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 103, 75 P.3d at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">For example, in <em>Balthazor v. Little League Baseball, Inc., </em>62 Cal.App.4th 47, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 337, 340-41 (1998), a California appellate court held that a baseball league did not have a duty to decrease the inherent baseball risk of being hit by a wild pitch. The court concluded that the league had not increased the inherent risk of harm by failing to end the game as sunset approached, or by failing to remove a pitcher who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>had previously hit batters, since changes in lighting conditions are inherent in the game and requiring pitching accuracy would \u201calter the fundamental nature of the game and most certainly chill vigorous participation.\u201d Similarly, the <em>Foronda </em>Court observed \u201c[t]he coaching and supervision during the fatal accident did not ... create a new risk or exacerbate an inherent risk.\u201d <em>Foronda, 25 </em>P.3d at 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Negligent Instruction And Training</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The Kellys argue that \u201c[t]he court made a fundamental logical and legal error in holding that by participating in the softball game for which she and [Amy were] inadequately prepared/trained ..., Tara or her parents \u2018assumed the risk\u2019 of the consequences of that inadequate and negligent training.\u201d In their view, a young infielder like Tara cannot assume the risk of being injured by her own improper fielding techniques, or by the base running of an opponent, when that conduct resulted from a coach\u2019s negligent failure to train these players in how to safely handle a contested play at second base. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">As a threshold matter, we are not persuaded that there was a material dispute about what the Kellys knew and appreciated regarding the danger of injury. That the Kellys may not have anticipated the precise nature, severity, or source of Tara\u2019s injury is immaterial if a reasonable person would have known and appreciated that injury could occur in the manner that it did.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See McQuiggan, </em>73 Md.App. at 711, 536 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>137. It was not necessary for defendants to prove that the Kellys had prescient knowledge of the precise accident and injury that occurred. The \u201cspecificity, particularity, and magnitude\u201d of risk that must be shown to establish knowledge and appreciation of the risk \u201crefer to the scope and source of possible dangers.\u201d <em>Tavernier v. Maes, </em>242 Cal.App.2d 532, 51 Cal.Rptr. 575, 582 (1966). \u201c \u2018It suffices if it is known to be within the range of possibilities; neither sure nor necessarily apt to happen; but one that will happen if the conditions are ripe for it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). If there was no dispute as to whether a reasonable person in their respective circumstances must have been aware of the dangers in defending against a sliding base runner, summary judgment was appropriate. <em>See, e.g., Rosenblatt v. Kahn, </em>245 A.D.2d 438, 666 N.Y.S.2d 666, 667 (1997)(affirming summary judgment against experienced softball player who \u201cassumed the risk that he might be injured by a sliding opposing player\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In support of their motion, the defendants submitted evidence that the Kellys knew, as any reasonable person with their respective experiences in the sport would have, that Tara could be hurt during the tag-out play that she would be called upon to execute at second base. The circuit court correctly noted that sliding is an integral and well known part of softball and baseball. Though there is no direct Maryland authority recognizing that fielders and base runners assume some risk of being injured in a tag-out and slide, there is ample persuasive authority for this common sense proposition. <em>See, e.g., Martino v. Vonnes, </em>298 A.D.2d 505, 748 N.Y.S.2d 512 (2002)(experienced second baseman injured when defendant slid into him \u201cassumed the risk that he might be injured by a sliding opposing player\u201d); <em>Picou v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>558 So.2d 787, 790-91 (La.Ct.App.1990)(same); <em>cf. Totino v. Nassau County Council of Boy Scouts, </em>213 A.D.2d 710, 625 N.Y.S.2d 51, 52, <em>cert. denied, </em>86 N.Y.2d 708, 634 N.Y.S.2d 442, 658 N.E.2d 220 (1995)(minor plaintiff who was aware that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201c[sjliding into base is an integral part of the game of softball\u201d assumed the risk of sliding injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Indeed, there is no dispute that the tag-out play at issue here required the type of physical contact that we contemplated in <em>Hammond. </em>When there is no force play, the only way to defend second base against a base runner is for the fielder to tag the runner. Tara testified that she knew from growing up with the game that she had to tag the runner to get the out. This is a routine, if not easily executed, play in both softball and baseball; it is a potentially dangerous but integral part of the game.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Moreover, the Kellys must have understood that base runners would be likely to slide into second base. It is common knowledge to players and fans alike that, in order to avoid being either hit by the ball thrown to second or tagged by the fielder, the base runner usually slides.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Sliding in these circumstances not only increases the runner\u2019s prospect of a successful steal under the tag, but it also protects the vulnerable fielder from more serious injury that might occur if a stand-up runner collided at full speed into a fielder just as she extended her arm to catch the ball or reached toward the runner to make the tag. For this reason, sliding is often considered to be a necessary safety precaution.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">That conclusion is reflected in <em>Picou v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>558 So.2d 787 (La.Ct.App.1990). There, a second baseman suffered an ankle injury when a base runner dove or slid into her as she tried to tag the bag for a force out. The court held that the risk that a base runner would collide with her while sliding into second was inherent in the game of softball. <em>Id. </em>at 790.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">\u201cThe closer the play, the more likely a collision; and the runner is not obliged to sacrifice himself or \u201csurrender\u201d an out by running outside the line to avoid collision with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>fielder.... Accordingly, the closer the play, the more wary and self-protective the fielder must be to catch the ball while in contact with the base so as to remove himself with dispatch[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 790-91 (citation omitted). The injury was simply an \u201cunfortunate result of two women who played the softball game competitively and ... with diligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791. <em>Cf. Bourque v. Duplechin, </em>331 So.2d 40, 42 (La.Ct.App.), cert. <em>denied, </em>334 So.2d 210 (1976)(inherent risks of softball include risk of \u201cstanding in the base path and being spiked by someone sliding into second base[,]\u201d but not having the base runner run full speed into second baseman standing outside base path by five feet).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The summary judgment record here similarly shows that Tara and her parents understood that players trying to reach second base might be sliding toward Tara as she was trying to catch the ball and make the tag. Tara acknowledged generally that she was aware that \u201cit was possible that you could get hurt playing the game[.]\u201d She was a veteran second baseman, having played that and other infield positions for St. Mark\u2019s in previous CYO games. Thus, the slide and tag-out play, and its inherent risk for fielders, had been a routine part of the games that the Kellys watched, played, and prepared for.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">We agree with the circuit court that, given the Kellys\u2019 experience and familiarity with the sport as it is commonly played, they must have understood and appreciated the danger that Tara could be hurt as she tried to tag out a sliding runner. There was undisputed evidence here that Tara and her parents knew that base runners would be sliding into second as Tara tried to tag them out, that they appreciated the obvious risk of injury in that play, and that they knowingly assumed it by choosing to play the game. The deposition testimony of Tara, her father, and her coach established that Tara had played and trained at second base. She and her parents understood that a second baseman must know how to position herself so that she can safely defend the base against a sliding runner. Tara\u2019s coach testified that she instructed her infielders not to place themselves in a base runner\u2019s path <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>and, more specifically, not to place a foot on the runner\u2019s side of the base. For safety reasons, she trained them to place their feet in front of, behind, or on the far side of the base. Similarly, Phillip Welch testified that he spent considerable time instructing and training his players during regular sliding drills.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The Kellys did not rebut that evidence. There was no evidence to refute Welch\u2019s testimony that he trained Amy G. how to slide safely into second base feet first. Significantly, the Kellys offered no evidence that Patricia Brady or anyone else associated with CYO, St. Mark\u2019s, or the Archdiocese told her that, in order to get the out, she had to touch the base as well as tag the runner. Tara notably did not dispute Coach Brady\u2019s description of her specific training of Tara and other infielders in how to avoid dangerous contact by keeping her foot away from the side of the base facing the sliding base runner. Nor did she deny that she received second base fielding instruction from Brady\u2019s daughter. Nor could she claim that this tag-out play was a new experience for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The only evidence that the Kellys offered to dispute the testimony that Tara received instruction and training in how to field when a runner is approaching second base was the awkwardly worded affidavit that the Kellys filed in opposition to summary judgment. In that affidavit, Tara states only that it \u201cis apparent\u201d that her coach did not train her \u201cin the \u2018rules of softball\u2019 \u201d and that she \u201cdid not know the actual rules of softball,\u201d because she \u201cthought [she] had to keep [her] foot on the base in order to tag out a runner.\u201d This was a combination of vague generality <em>(i.e., </em>her coach \u201capparently\u201d did not train her in \u201cthe rules\u201d) and impermissible speculation <em>(i.e., </em>the fact that she misunderstood the rules must mean that her coach did not give her the right instruction). What it is not, however, is admissible evidence of a matter within Tara\u2019s personal knowledge. <em>See Tennant v. Shoppers Food Warehouse Md. Corp., </em>115 Md.App. 381, 386-87, 693 A.2d 370 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>At this stage of the litigation, Tara\u2019s inability to offer any evidentiary link showing that her misunderstanding of the rules was directly attributable to one or more of the defendants, rather than to another source (such as herself or her family), was fatal to her inadequate training claims.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Tara was an experienced second baseman who had a long familiarity with the sport. Given the obvious danger involved in this play, she must have understood not only that danger, but also that, if she needed further instruction on the \u201crules of softball\u201d pertaining to it, she could and should ask questions before taking the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><em>Vendrell v. Sch. Dist. No. 26C, </em>233 Or. 1, 376 P.2d 406 (1962), is instructive on this specific coaching issue. A high school football player who suffered neck injuries when he was tackled in a game sued the school district, complaining that the coach failed to provide adequate instruction. Citing the player\u2019s extensive training, practice, and play, the Oregon Supreme Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">[n]o one expects a football coach to extract from the game the body clashes that cause bruises, jolts and hard falls. To remove them would end the sport. The coach\u2019s function is to minimize the possibility that the body contacts may result in something more than slight injury.... The purpose of the extensive instructions and arduous practice was to enable the player not only to make for his team the maximum yardage but also to reduce to the minimum the possibility that an injury would befall him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 413. The court specifically rejected the athlete\u2019s argument that the coach was negligent because he \u201chad not told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>him that if he used his head as a battering ram an injury might befall him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413. Emphasizing that the coaches were the player\u2019s teachers, the court explained that sports instruction is not a one way street.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\">[The plaintiff] had the right \u2014 in fact, the duty \u2014 to ask the coaches questions concerning any matter which was not clear. In turn, the coaches had the right to assume that he possessed the intelligence and stock of information of a normal young man[.] Thus, they had the right to assume that he knew of the possibility of injury that comes to an individual who uses his head as a battering ram.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXO\"><em>Id. </em>at 413-14 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We decline the Kellys\u2019 invitation to hold that a coach may be held liable for negligent instruction based solely on the fact that the injured athlete claims that she silently misunderstood the rules governing a frequently occurring play in which the coach has given instruction and training. We also reject the Kellys\u2019 more general contention that, although they may have assumed the risk that Tara would be injured as a result of her own play or Amy\u2019s play, they did not assume that risk if the play was the result of negligent failure to instruct and train these athletes.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Coaches and leagues are not insurers of athletic prowess; they cannot be expected to train players in a manner that eliminates all dangers created by misplay, whether that misplay is caused by a young athlete\u2019s physical error or by her mental error.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is no mystery to any coach, ball player, fan, or youth league parent that miscues on the field often reflect such mistakes. Thus, \u201cthe risks associated with <em>learning </em>a sport may themselves be inherent risks of the sport[.]\u201d <em>Kahn, 4 </em>Cal.Rptr.3d 103, 75 P.3d at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Sound public policy supports that conclusion. Much as they might wish otherwise, coaches cannot guarantee that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>athletes will learn all the rules of the game, remember them in a game situation, and then properly execute the play according to those rules. It would unquestionably harm the sport to lay legal responsibility for an athlete\u2019s failure to understand a particular rule at the cleats of a coach who has offered that athlete time to learn the rule and to ask about it during practice and game situations. Indeed, if coaches and their sponsoring leagues can be held liable for a single player\u2019s unstated misunderstanding of rules governing a complex sport like softball, the type of instructional league that the Kellys joined may quickly become a thing of the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Case law and commentary also support our decision. We reviewed cases and treatises discussing the circumstances in which a coach has been sued for failing to prepare players to safely encounter specific physical dangers that commonly occur in a particular sport.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We found that inadequate instruction and training claims have progressed to trial only when a coach provided little or no training before asking the injured athlete to engage in a significantly dangerous play, and compounded that omission by failing to adequately supervise that play. <em>See, e.g., Leahy v. School Bd. of Hernando County, </em>450 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>So.2d 883 (Fla.Ct.App.l984)(question of fact raised by evidence from which it might be inferred that football coach\u2019s lack of instruction, along with his failure to properly supervise and equip a young player, increased the risk of injury created by an agility drill that he designed).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Coaches generally have a duty to \u201cinstruct and train their players with respect to the fundamentals of the particular sport[,]\u201d including teaching rules and skills necessary to the game, as well as methods to reduce the risk of injury. <em>See </em>Anthony S. McCaskey &amp; Kenneth W. Biedzynski, <em>A Guide to the Legal Liability of Coaches for a Sports Participant\u2019s Injuries, </em>6 Seton Hall J. Sports L. 7, 23-24 (1996). But courts often apply the \u201cinherent risk\u201d limitation on the duty of care in rejecting negligent instruction and training claims. As the <em>Foronda </em>Court concluded, coaching cannot insure against certain risks that are inherent to a sport. <em>See Foronda, 25 </em>P.3d at 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Courts also often find that there is insufficient evidence to raise an inference that additional instruction would have avoided the injury. For example, in <em>Sanders v. Kuna Joint Sch. Dist., </em>125 Idaho 872, 876 P.2d 154 (App.1994), a student playing a recreational game of softball, in lieu of his usual weight lifting class, slid into first base, breaking his ankle. He sued the teacher and school district, asserting that he had not been properly instructed in how to play softball. Summary judgment was affirmed on causation grounds because there was no evidence that such instructions would have prevented the injury, which occurred during the inherently risky slide. <em>See id. </em>at 156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">A comparison with two cases in which summary judgment on a negligent training claim was held inappropriate provides instructive contrast with the Kellys\u2019 case. In <em>Taylor v. Massapequa Int\u2019l Little League, </em>261 A.D.2d 396, 689 N.Y.S.2d 523 (1999), a 10 year old Little Leaguer was injured when he slid into third base at his coach\u2019s direction. There was evidence that the boy was in his first year at the minor league division level, that the coach told the boy that he \u201chad to slide into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>bases or else [he] would be automatically \u2018out[,]\u2019 \u201d that the coach did so for the first time during the game in which the boy was injured, and that the coach had never given the team any instruction in how to slide. <em>See id. </em>at 524. From this evidence, an inference could be drawn that sliding was not an expected part of the game at this young level, so that the player and his parents may not have made an informed decision to assume the risk of a sliding injury. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Similarly, in <em>Kahn v. East Side Union High Sch. Dist., </em>31 Cal.4th 990, 4 Cal.Rptr.3d 103, 75 P.3d 30, 32 (2003), the California Supreme Court held that summary judgment was inappropriate against a 14 year old novice swimmer whose neck broke after her coach commanded her to dive into a shallow racing pool -with no training or instruction. Long before that dive, the swimmer expressed to the coach her great fear of shallow water racing dives. The coach had allowed her to practice -without doing these dives and promised her that she would not be required to do them at competitions. But at a swim meet, in the heat of competition, the coach told Kahn that she would be taken out of a relay if she did not do a racing dive. The court concluded that there were factual disputes regarding whether Kahn voluntarily encountered the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Tara\u2019s injury did not result from an analogous lack of instruction or training. Tara was not injured during the type of specially designed practice drill that the Kellys might not have anticipated, or because she was required to perform a risky play for the first time, without prior notice or training. To the contrary, she was hurt during a routine game play that the Kellys knew was an integral part of the sport.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">We need not decide the broader issue raised by the Kellys regarding whether an athlete can ever assume the risk of negligent coaching. Even if a coach might be held liable in some circumstances for negligently failing to give safety instruction and training, we agree with the circuit court that there could be no such liability in this instance. <em>Cf Southwest Key Program, Inc. v. Gil-Perez, </em>81 S.W.3d 269, 272 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>(Tex.2002)(similarly declining to decide whether \u201cmerely negligent\u201d conduct is a sufficient basis for sports-tort liability because claim \u201cfails even under the negligence standard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">There is no question that Tara participated voluntarily in CYO league play generally, and in the St. Mark\u2019s Parish v. St. Joseph\u2019s Parish game specifically. Here, the circuit court correctly determined that the defendants satisfied their summary judgment burden of showing that the Kellys must have understood the danger that a runner attempting to slide into second base could injure Tara, and that they also understood that proper training in the rules governing tag-out play was necessary to reduce the risk of Tara being injured. The Kellys\u2019 vague and speculative affidavit did not raise a material factual dispute regarding her claim of \u201cfailure to instruct.\u201d The defendants therefore established the necessary three elements of assumption of the risk. We hold that the Kellys assumed the risk that training and instruction would not prevent all mistakes that could result in injury on the base paths. <em>See Foronda, </em>25 P.3d at 845; <em>Vendrell, </em>376 P.2d at 413-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Negligent Mismatching</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The Kellys argue alternatively that the circuit court erred in holding that they assumed the risk of playing against \u201copposing players who were substantially beyond [Tara\u2019s] level of skill.\u201d They particularly complain that the court failed to make any independent analysis of whether Tara could have voluntarily agreed to play \u201can aggressive Marylanders player\u201d like Amy G. We find no merit in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">\u201cThe duty not to place players in a non-competitive setting, otherwise known as the duty not to \u2018mismatch,\u2019 can be understood as a coach\u2019s responsibility not to pit players of unequal skill, size, weight, or strength against one another.\u201d McCaskey &amp; Biedzynski, <em>supra, </em>6 Seton Hall J. Sports L. at 36-37. The few cases we have found in which courts have ruled that coaches might be held liable for \u201cnegligent mismatching\u201d only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>underscore that this is not such a case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Tepper v. City of New Rochelle Sch. Dist., </em>143 A.D.2d 133, 531 N.Y.S.2d 367 (1988), a 130 pound rookie lacrosse player asserted a negligent mismatch claim against his high school after his coach required him to go one on one in a ground ball drill, against a 260 pound senior with three years of varsity experience. After the coach tossed a ball onto the field, both players sprinted toward it. The senior collided with Tepper, \u201cuse[d] an advanced \u2018[checking]\u2019 technique to subdue\u201d him, and in the process, broke his arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The appellate court noted that the coach segregated varsity players from the younger, smaller, and less experienced junior varsity players because \u201che believed the superior varsity skill level of play would be too advanced for inexperienced players[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368. The coach also did not allow seniors to play on the junior varsity team, and restricted varsity to those players \u201cwith sufficient skill and physical prowess.\u201d <em>See id. </em>He also \u201croutinely warned the smaller players about going head-to-head with a larger player.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBased upon this unique factual scenario, [the court] eonclude[d] that the plaintiff ha[d] raised an issue of fact as to whether the coach was negligent in permitting the ... player of slight build and very limited experience, to go head-to-head with the 260-pound senior varsity team member, a player possessing substantially greater experience[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that, \u201cin light of this peculiar factual setting, it cannot be said as a matter of law that the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Tara was not injured in analogous circumstances. To the contrary, her injury occurred during a routine game situation, not a contact drill contrived by the coach, in which two particular players of grossly disparate size, physical ability, and experience were unnecessarily matched against each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The evidence here that there were more skilled and competitive players on St. Joseph\u2019s middle school team was not sufficient, by itself, to raise an inference that these two teams were unreasonably mismatched. We see no other evidence of mismatch in this record. To the contrary, according to Tara, even though St. Joseph\u2019s was one of the best teams in the league that year, St. Mark\u2019s was an average team, not \u201cone of the worst.\u201d Even though Amy was a good player on a good team, according to Tara\u2019s coach, Tara was \u201cone of the better\u201d players on St. Mark\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Tara and her parents knew that Marylanders players played on teams in the CYO league, including the St. Joseph\u2019s team. One of Tara\u2019s own St. Mark\u2019s teammates was a more skilled player who also played Marylanders ball. In addition, Tara admitted that she attended school with Amy Welch, who played for the St. Joseph\u2019s teams and Marylanders teams coached by her father, appellee Phillip Welch.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Furthermore, there was no allegation or evidence that Tara\u2019s injury resulted from any disparity in skill or aggressiveness. The Kellys have never claimed that Amy\u2019s superior talent or competitiveness caused Tara to misunderstand that she had to keep her foot on the bag while making the tag.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Moreover, we reject the Kellys\u2019 suggestion that recreational coaches and leagues have a duty to exclude more skilled players that are otherwise eligible by age and other objective criteria. That, too, would fundamentally alter the game. Uneven matches of player talent in sporting events are as common as lopsided scores. But they do not always dictate the outcome of a particular game, as any delighted coach can attest when a \u201cDavid\u201d player plays a pivotal role in a win over a team led by one or more \u201cGoliaths.\u201d If recreational league coaches are pressured by liability threats to subjectively segregate \u201cbetter\u201d players from \u201caverage\u201d players, instructional leaguers would lose the opportunity to play with and against more skilled players in an effort to improve their game to \u201cthe next level\u201d demonstrated by the more skilled players. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>would defeat one of the primary reasons for instructional leagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">From the objective perspective of a reasonable person, we also agree with the circuit court that Tara and her parents must have understood that she would be playing against better softball players who might be not only more skilled, but also more \u201caggressive\u201d (whatever that subjective term may mean). We concur with the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts that aggressive play and coaching are inherent and foreseen aspects of any organized team sport.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">Just as players are entitled to play aggressively without fear of liability, a coach properly may encourage players to play aggressively. Indeed, a coach\u2019s ability to inspire players to compete aggressively is one of a coach\u2019s important attributes. The mere possibility that some players might overreact to such inspiration or encouragement should not, by itself, suffice to impose liability on a coach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\"><em>Kavanagh v.

In Counts III and IX, the Kellys assert negligence and premises liability claims, alleging that all four defendants failed either to use the breakaway bases or to warn them about the hazards of stationary bases that are staked into the ground.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> They argue that the record did not show that, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the time of her injury, Tara or her parents knew and appreciated the risk posed by \u201cthe danger that existed as a result of [defendants\u2019] use of stationary basest.]\u201d We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The principles governing negligence, premises liability, and assumption of the risk apply equally to owners and operators of athletic facilities. In determining whether an athletic facility has violated a duty of care by allowing an athlete to encounter a dangerous condition on the playing field, we ask whether the condition was one that was either concealed or exceeded the usual dangers inherent in the sport. <em>See Morgan v. New York, </em>90 N.Y.2d 471, 662 N.Y.S.2d 421, 685 N.E.2d 202, 208 (1997). Rephrased in the context of determining whether an athlete has assumed the risk of injury from the allegedly dangerous condition, we ask whether she knew about the condition and appreciated the risk it posed, taking into account her age and experience. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Evidence that an athlete was familiar with the athletic facility, the condition of a field, the inherent risks of the sport, the existence of the allegedly dangerous condition, and the possibility of injury from it indicates that she has assumed the risk, even though there were other safety measures that the facility could have installed. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 421, 685 N.E.2d at 209 (veteran bobsledder assumed risk of injury from crash through opening in wall of bobsled run, given his experience in sport and on the particular sled run on which he was injured); <em>Mauller v. City of Columbus, </em>552 N.E.2d 500, 503-04 (Ind.Ct. App.l990)(base runner who knew about uneven field conditions surrounding home plate assumed the risk of injury from catching foot on base); <em>Robinson v. Town of Babylon, </em>166 A.D.2d 434, 560 N.Y.S.2d 507, 507 (1990)(second baseman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>assumed risk of injury from stationary base that shifted slightly as he attempted to make double play).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The defendants presented unrebutted evidence that the Kellys knew that the field was equipped with stationary bases. Tara routinely played on fields with stationary bases, including the St. Mark\u2019s and St. Joseph\u2019s fields. Daniel Kelly admitted that he had personally installed stationary bases on fields. He also knew that all of the CYO fields used stationary bases. Terry Kelly had \u201cseen them in previous games put them in\u201d and \u201cassume[d] that it was that type of base since they had used it at all the other games.\u201d None of the Kellys knew that breakaway bases existed, or that St. Joseph\u2019s may have had breakaway bases available for use at the time of Tara\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Given the Kellys\u2019 experience and knowledge that the fields were equipped with stationary bases, they must have understood that a sliding player could pin Tara\u2019s leg against the base. This was yet another obvious and well known risk inherent in the game.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> They chose to let Tara take the field, and in doing so, assumed that open and obvious risk of injury. The fact that there may have been breakaway bases available and that the defendants may have known about them does not negate the Kellys\u2019 assumption of the risk, because the Kellys remained free to decline to participate based on their knowledge that the game would be played with stationary bases. <em>See, e.g., West v. Sundown Little League of Stockton, Inc., </em>96 Cal.App.4th 351, 116 Cal.Rptr.2d 849, 856, <em>cert. denied, </em>2002 Cal. LEXIS 3610 (2002)(league had no duty to decrease risk of injury by providing players safety sunglasses so they would not lose baseball in the sun); <em>Balthazor v.

State Fair &amp; Agricultural Soc., Inc. v. Lee, </em>29 Md.App. 374, 381, 348 A.2d 44 (1975), cited by the Kellys for our observation that, \u201c[a]bsent proof of sufficient expertise, an invitee ... cannot be said to have fully appreciated certain dangers merely because he or she was aware of them,\u201d does not require a different conclusion. In that case, we were asked to decide whether a 24 year old horse exerciser assumed the risk of the fatal injuries that occurred when a runaway horse threw her onto a stone wall surrounding the Timonium race track barns. Based on the open and obvious nature of the track conditions and the decedent\u2019s riding experience at that track and others, we recognized that the decedent knew about the allegedly negligent track conditions. <em>See id. </em>at 379-81, 348 A.2d 44. We held nevertheless that the question of whether the decedent assumed the risk was properly submitted to the jury because there were disputes regarding both the appreciation and the voluntary exposure elements. <em>See id. </em>at 380-82, 348 A.2d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">With respect to the appreciation requirement, \u201cthe record [did] not show that the dangers posed by negligent conditions such as those alleged would be necessarily comprehended by \u2018any person of normal intelligence in ... [the decedent\u2019s] position.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 348 A.2d 44. With respect to the voluntariness requirement, the record showed that, \u201cwhile [the decedent\u2019s] use of the track may have been \u2018voluntary\u2019 in one sense, it cannot be said Timonium was the \u2018choice\u2019 of\u2019 either the horse owner or the decedent, given that Pimlico race officials determined the location of each race entrant\u2019s training site. <em>See id. </em>at 384, 348 A.2d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The Kellys\u2019 case is materially different. Unlike the Timonium track, the St. Joseph\u2019s diamond was an agreed upon field of amateur recreational play that day, as it had been on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>previous occasions. Unlike the unusual risk of being thrown onto the perimeter wall outside the Timonium track, the risk of being hurt on the field during this play was so common that it was an expected part of the sport. Before Tara took her position at second base, all three Kellys knew that the field was equipped with stationary bases, and must have understood the danger of precisely what happened during this frequently occurring game situation \u2014 that Tara could be injured as a result of some misplay during a tag-out and slide.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Post-Injury Care</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In Count V, the Kellys allege that the Archdiocese, CYO, and both parishes negligently failed to train managers, coaches, and volunteer staff \u201cto reasonably handle emergencies involving physical injuries to players during games.\u201d The circuit court pointed to undisputed evidence that both coaches on the field had received first aid training. It held that the Kellys (1) \u201cfailed to present even a scintilla of evidence that the [defendants breached their duty of care in the manner in which Plaintiff Tara Kelly was treated after sustaining an injuryU\u201d and (2) \u201cfailed to present admissible evidence that Plaintiff Tara Kelly\u2019s injuries were worsened when she was removed from the field or thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The Kellys challenge both holdings on a host of grounds, none of which explain why they failed to allege or offer evidence to show that Tara suffered injury as a result of the training that both coaches received for game injury emergencies. We agree with the circuit court that there is no evidence that Tara\u2019s injuries were either caused or exacerbated by any care that she received from these defendants, by any care that she did not receive from them, or by any lack of training in emergency care.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">In particular, we reject the Kellys\u2019 argument that summary judgment was improper because Tara suffered some amount of additional pain as a result of being carried off the field and then transported to the hospital by her mother, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>being left on the field until emergency medical technicians arrived to take her by ambulance. We see absolutely nothing in this summary judgment record to indicate that there was any delay in Tara\u2019s treatment attributable to the manner in which she either left the field or traveled to the emergency room, or to a lack of emergency care training.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Derivative Counts</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Because Counts VI and VII of the Kellys\u2019 complaint were derivative claims for subrogation and reimbursement of medical expenses, we shall affirm those judgments as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\">. Other accounts of the play differed from Tara\u2019s. Mrs. Kelly testified in her deposition that Amy had not hit the ball, but was trying to steal second from first. Mrs. Kelly also recalled that the umpire called Amy safe. Phillip Welch, the St. Joseph's manager who was coaching third base, also testified that Amy was trying to steal from first base, and that he had given her the steal sign. Patricia Brady, Tara's coach, did not recall whether Amy had batted or was stealing from first. We find any factual dispute regarding whether Amy was stealing from first or trying to stretch a hit into a double immaterial to the issues raised in this appeal, because the salient and undisputed fact is that Amy slid into second base. <em>See Scroggins v. Dahne, </em>335 Md. 688, 690-91, 645 A.2d 1160 (1994)(disputes regarding facts that will not affect the outcome of the case do not foreclose summary judgment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\">.

The court did not address whether appellee Welch had statutory immunity from negligence liability. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2003 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 5-406, \u00a7 5-407, \u00a7 5-802 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (limiting personal liability for certain agents and volunteers and officials of charitable, recreational, athletic, and civic organizations). <em>See generally </em>Howard P. Benard, <em>Little League Fun, Big League Liability, </em>8 Marq. Sports L.J. 93 (1997)(advo-cating immunity legislation and a liability scheme other than ordinary negligence for volunteer coaches); Jamie Brown, <em>Legislators Strike Out: Volunteer Little League Coaches Should Not Be Immune from Tort Liability, </em>7 Seton Hall J. Sports L. 559, 580-81 (1997)(opposing immunity based <em>inter alia </em>on the availability of insurance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b115-10\">. The circuit court also granted summary judgment on the Kellys' claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and for reimbursement of medical expenses. The Kellys have not challenged the judgment on the intentional infliction claim (Count IX).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b116-6\">. Assumption of the risk frequently is described as either \"primary\u2019' or \"secondary,\" although the Court of Appeals has decided assumption of the risk cases without finding it necessary to adopt that distinction. <em>See Crews </em>v. <em>Hollenbach, </em>358 Md. 627, 641-42, 751 A.2d 481 (2000). Because many decisions do discuss these concepts in examining assumption of particular sports risks, an understanding of the distinction is helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The distinction arises from both the source and the effect of an assumed risk. Either a reasonable plaintiff understood and agreed that the defendant had no duty to her in the particular circumstances that gave rise to the injury (primary assumption), or alternatively, the plaintiff deliberately chose to accept the known risk that the defendant might behave in the manner that caused her injury (secondary assumption). <em>See id. </em>at 641-42, 751 A.2d 481. The \"no duty\u201d rationale for primary assumption of the risk generally arises from a \"judicially-crafted public policy .... designed to limit the duty of care that the public owes to certain classes of plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642, 751 A.2d 481; <em>see also Turcotte </em>v. <em>Fell, </em>68 N.Y.2d 432, 510 N.Y.S.2d 49, 502 N.E.2d 964, 968 (1986)(assumption of the risk in this sense is based on plaintiff\u2019s consent to relieve defendant of a legal duty to protect him from certain future sports risks). The alternative \"voluntary exposure\" rationale for secondary assumption of the risk focuses on the individualized factual question of whether this particular plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily exposed herself to the danger that culminated in her injury. <em>See Crews, </em>358 Md. at 641, 751 A.2d 481. <em>See also Knight v. Jewett, </em>3 Cal.4th 296, 11 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 834 P.2d 696, 708 (1992)(ex-plaining that focus in primary assumption of the risk cases is not whether the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in choosing to encounter the risks of the game was reasonable, but \"whether, in light of the nature of the sporting activity ..., defendant's conduct breached a legal duty of care to plaintiff\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b117-9\">. We reject the Kellys\u2019 suggestion that the assumption of risk standard for children is subjective. The Kellys misunderstand our observation that \" 'no very definite statement can be made as to just what standard is to be applied to [children].\u2019 \u201d <em>See McGarr v.

We did not intend by that statement to change the objective standard for assumption of the risk by a child that we recognized in <em>McQuiggan v. Boy Scouts of America, </em>73 Md.App. 705, 536 A.2d 137 (1988). In that case, decided just before <em>McGarr, </em>we affirmed summary judgment on the ground that the child assumed the risk as a matter of law even though he subjectively decided to stop playing the dangerous game before he was injured. <em>See id. </em>at 711, 536 A.2d 137.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\">.

In any event, the record does not support the Kellys' contention that Tara\u2019s injury was unanticipated.
