On November 29, 2001, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. In this appeal, appellant poses three ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tions for our review, which we have reordered and reworded slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\">I. Did the trial court err in not granting a mistrial after a witness made a statement bolstering another witness\u2019 reputation for truthfulness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">II. Was there legally sufficient evidence to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for first degree murder absent a body or other physical evidence indicating that a murder occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">III. Did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the jury that it could not convict the appellant of murder based solely on statements he made to others absent some corroboration of the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">For the reasons set out below, we shall affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">GENERAL FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A2K\">The Case Begins</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">According to appellant, at approximately 6:00 a.m. on the morning of July 2, 1996, he returned to his home in Howard County after working the night shift as a \u201cyard jockey\u201d at the Patapsco Waste Water Treatment Plant (\u201cPWWTP\u201d) in Baltimore City.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He noticed that the front door of the house was slightly ajar. At approximately 7:00 a.m., appellant found his five-year-old daughter in her bedroom.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The victim was not in the house. Appellant took his daughter to day care, returned home, vacuumed the inside of the minivan, loaned a power washer to his neighbor, informed his neighbor that the victim had left him, and fell asleep for the remainder of the day. Later, a friend watched appellant\u2019s daughter so that appellant could go to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>On July 3,1996, appellant called 911 and reported the victim missing. Despite extensive attempts to locate the victim, including checking all motor vehicle administration records throughout the United States and tracking her name, date of birth, and social security number, the victim was never located. After a four-year investigation by the Howard County Police Department (\u201cHCPD\u201d), appellant was arrested on September 21, 2000, and charged with first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The Discovery of the Ongoing Affair</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In 1992, Amy Cole, then a minor,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> began babysitting appellant\u2019s daughter. Subsequently, appellant and Cole began a sexual relationship. According to Cole, she \u201cloved\u201d appellant and he \u201cloved\u201d her. As their relationship progressed, Cole visited appellant\u2019s house when his wife was at work, visited appellant at work so that they could spend the evening together,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and visited with appellant and the victim when she was not hired to babysit. Appellant introduced Cole to coworkers as his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Appellant told Cole that he and the victim were \u201cno longer sleeping together, they didn\u2019t get along, and that [the victim] was going to leave [him].\u201d At such time, when the victim allegedly left him, appellant wanted Cole to \u201cmove in with him and take care of [his daughter] and take care of the house, and [they] would get married.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">In 1995, during Cole\u2019s first year of college, she began dating another man, which disturbed appellant. The following year, appellant told Cole that the victim planned to move to Pennsylvania and that Cole could move into the house and take care of appellant\u2019s daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">A few months prior to her disappearance in 1996, the victim had approached appellant, inquiring about his relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>with Cole. He denied that he and Cole had a relationship. Upset about the suspected affair, the victim told others that she was going to report appellant to the police and divorce him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When he told Cole about that confrontation, appellant stated \u201cthat he wanted to kill [the victim],\u201d and that he would either \u201cshoot\u201d or \u201cstrangle her\u201d and \u201cput her body in the truck with the waste, and nobody would ever find her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">In June 1996, appellant called his friend Leon Adams and asked him if he could borrow a handgun for a \u201cturkey shoot.\u201d Adams suggested that he purchase a gun from a pawn shop. A few days later, appellant contacted Adams and again asked about obtaining a handgun. Appellant also approached Ernest Stovall, Jr. and Christopher Alexander about obtaining a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Brian Waugh, a PWWTP yard jockey who worked with appellant,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> testified that, sometime in 1996, appellant asked him what was the \u201cbest way to get rid of [appellant\u2019s friend\u2019s] wife.\u201d Waugh responded that the friend should \u201cget a divorce.\u201d Appellant responded, \u201c[N]o, no, I don\u2019t mean like that. Get rid of her, get rid of \u2014 dispose of her.\u201d Waugh then advised appellant that \u201ca lot of people connected with murder, just can\u2019t, can\u2019t get away with it.\u201d Appellant then asked him \u201cif you put a body in a hole and you put lime in it, would it eat the body?\u201d Appellant also approached Waugh about getting a gun and asked him \u201cif a .22 would kill somebody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">On June 30, 1996, the victim called Cole, and informed her that appellant had told her about their affair. Cole responded that it was a \u201cone-time affair that had happened a couple months ago.\u201d After her discussion with the victim, Cole visited appellant at PWWTP, where they discussed the situation. Appellant stated that \u201che\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Events occurring from July 1 through July 5, 1996</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Upset that she had lied to the victim about the duration of her affair with appellant, Cole called the victim on July 1, 1996, and told her that the affair with appellant had been going on for four years. Later that evening, the victim called Cole back. She told Cole that she planned to inform Cole\u2019s mother about the affair, which she did later that evening. Following her conversation with the victim, Cole called appellant and informed him of the victim\u2019s intention to report the affair to Cole\u2019s mother. Appellant responded, \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it, [I\u2019ll] take care of it,\u201d and requested that Cole meet him at 10:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">On that same day, the victim informed her fried and coworker, Margaret Speakes, that, because appellant was having a relationship with Cole, she intended to end the marriage and was going to contact an attorney regarding a divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Appellant reported to work for the shift beginning at 6:00 p.m. on July 1 and ending at 6:00 a.m. on July 2, 1996. When he arrived at work, he asked Brian Waugh to come in early the next day because appellant had to take his daughter to daycare. Appellant stated that he had to make such arrangements because the victim was \u201cfed up with him and she was going to leave him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">At approximately 9:00 p.m., the victim spoke on the phone with Christopher Riggins, appellant\u2019s brother. She told him that she planned to leave the house because of the affair between appellant and Cole. Although she stated that she intended to leave appellant, Christopher Riggins testified that it was not in the victim\u2019s character to \u201cjust leave\u201d and that the victim and her daughter had a \u201cvery tight relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">At 10:00 p.m., John Mark Thomas,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a friend of appellant, spoke on the telephone with the victim. He described her as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>being \u201cvery upset\u201d and \u201ccrying.\u201d She stated that she was going to leave appellant and go to Pennsylvania with her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">After getting off from work, Cole \u201cstole\u201d some beer and met appellant at 10:15 p.m. at a local food store. They discussed appellant moving out of his house and whether Cole would go with him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cole then went home and watched appellant pull down the driveway of his house. Cole remained outside until 12:00 a.m. or 1:00 a.m., talking to her boyfriend, who was living with her at her parents\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">July 2</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">At approximately 10:00 a.m. on July 2,1996, appellant called Thomas at work and told him that the victim was gone. Because there was no one there to watch his daughter, appellant requested that Thomas come over.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">At lunch time, appellant visited Cole at work and told her that when he arrived home from work that morning, his daughter was in bed asleep and that the victim \u201cwas gone.\u201d Cole did not observe any marks, scratches, or bruises on appellant. According to Cole, appellant was \u201chappy\u201d that the victim was gone. He then stated to Cole that the victim left him a note stating that \u201cshe was gone, to watch [their daughter], and she\u2019d never come back.\u201d Appellant then asked Cole to move into his home \u201c[a]s soon as possible\u201d and \u201chelp take care of [appellant\u2019s daughter].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Thomas arrived at appellant\u2019s house at 4:00 p.m. Appellant went to work while Thomas watched appellant\u2019s daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">July 3</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Appellant called 911 and reported the victim missing. At approximately 9:00 a.m., Howard County Police Officer Karen Johnson arrived at appellant\u2019s home. Appellant told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>officer that he had last seen the victim on July 1,1996, at 8:00 p.m. He did not know she was missing until the morning of July 2, 1996. He informed Officer Johnson that approximately $300, some clothes, and a computer were missing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The victim\u2019s car was in the garage and her wedding ring was upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The officer asked appellant if he had contacted the victim\u2019s family or friends or area hospitals. Appellant then contacted the victim\u2019s parents in Pennsylvania and a sister in California. Appellant told Officer Johnson that he had waited to report the victim missing because he believed that he had to wait forty-eight hours. He then stated that he was having an affair, that his affair caused tension in the couple\u2019s marriage, but that they had planned on working it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">According to Officer Johnson, appellant \u201cappeared very calm, very normal,\u201d and \u201cnot too overly concerned.\u201d In addition, the officer did not notice any signs of a physical altercation in the house or any marks, cuts, or abrasions on appellant. The officer subsequently contacted cab companies and area hospitals to see if the victim had been admitted as a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Later that day, Cole came to appellant\u2019s home to watch his daughter. She did not notice anything missing from the home.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">July 4</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Cole told appellant that her father believed appellant had killed the victim. According to her, appellant \u201claughed\u201d and stated: \u201c \u2018[D]o you think that I would be that dumb to risk my freedom, my daughter, to kill [the victim]. Do you actually think I could do that and get away with it?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>During the afternoon, Corporal Luther Johnson and Detective Pete Wright went to appellant\u2019s home for a routine followup investigation into the victim\u2019s disappearance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant told Corporal Johnson that approximately $2,500 in cash was missing from the house. Appellant also advised the officers that he had spoken with the victim about his affair and that, based on a telephone call from the victim\u2019s friend, Mary Hand, he believed that she might have gone to Virginia. Appellant indicated that the last time he had seen the victim was during the morning of July 1, 1996, but that he had spoken to her on the telephone several times that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Appellant showed Corporal Johnson around the house mentioning missing items, including money, the victim\u2019s fanny pack, medication, shoes, clothes, and suitcases. Appellant cried during part of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">July 5</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Cole and appellant continued to see each other. On July 5, 1996, upon a request of law enforcement officials, Cole agreed to tape telephone conversations with appellant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Later that day, Cole placed a call to appellant in an attempt to obtain information about the victim\u2019s disappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">On or about July 5, 1996, appellant called John Muzzi, a manager where the victim worked, requesting \u201cany monies that were due [the victim] either by normal pay, vacation pay, [or] any other monies that might be available that would go to [the victim].\u201d Appellant further requested that the victim be placed on sick leave and that her \u201csick leave pay [be forwarded] to him.\u201d Muzzi responded that he could not place the victim on sick leave without documentation from a doctor and that any pay would have to be given to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>The Ongoing Police Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">On July 8, 1996, appellant was questioned at the police station. Detective William Walsh, a member of the Criminal Investigations Bureau, had appellant complete the interrogation waiver form and then questioned him about the victim\u2019s disappearance. Appellant told Detective Walsh that the last time that he had seen the victim was on July 1, 1996, and that he had called her at 5:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m., and sometime after 6:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Appellant then recited the events of July 2, 1996. In an attempt to locate the victim, appellant called her boss and found out that she did not report to work. Appellant stated that the victim\u2019s mother called at 10:00 a.m. and he informed her that the victim was out shopping. Consistent with his earlier story, appellant informed the detective that Mary Hand had mentioned that the victim had talked about going to Virginia. Appellant also informed Detective Walsh that the victim left a handwritten note near the coffee pot, saying \u201cgoodbye, take care of [the couple\u2019s daughter], I won\u2019t be coming back.\u201d Appellant stated that \u201che threw [the note] in the kitchen trash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Sergeant Charles Jacobs, one of the lead investigators in the case,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> went door to door throughout the neighborhood talking with neighbors to discover any information about the victim\u2019s whereabouts or if they had observed anything suspicious on the night of the victim\u2019s disappearance. Flyers were distributed throughout the area, a commercial billboard was leased on southbound Route 1, and the local and national news media aired and wrote stories about the victim\u2019s disappearance. In addition, Sergeant Jacobs contacted Brett Kirby, an FBI Special Agent, in an effort to locate the victim through the FBI\u2019s databases. Other search techniques included seven searches using K-9 dogs and heat sensing equipment. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>efforts produced no evidence and no information concerning the victim\u2019s disappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">On July 9, 1996, the HCPD obtained and executed a search and seizure warrant for appellant\u2019s house and the family vehicles, looking for any \u201csigns of foul play\u201d or \u201ca struggle that may have occurred in the residence.\u201d Additionally, the police \u201csearch[ed] for documentation, bank records, possibly a note, or anything of that nature to assist [them] in possibly locating the whereabouts\u201d of the victim. During the search, the officers removed vacuum cleaner bags, the victim\u2019s hairbrush, and a Rolodex. The cars were towed to the HCPD\u2019s crime lab in Ellicott City, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">A second search and seizure warrant was executed on July 23, 1996, and several shovels and garden tools were seized. Soil samples were taken from the rear of the house. A landfill in York, Pennsylvania, was searched on July 18, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Despite her ongoing sexual relationship with appellant, Cole continued to cooperate with the HCPD by wearing a body wire. On one occasion, appellant suggested what Cole should say to authorities about her July 1, 1996 conversation with the victim, but appellant \u201cnever came out and said that he killed [the victim].\u201d Appellant indicated to Cole that the victim was seeing someone named \u201cBob\u201d and that \u201cshe could have possibly run away with him.\u201d He further suggested that the victim could be in Florida or in \u201cdrug rehab\u201d in Ohio.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">On January 15, 1997, the FBI conducted a third search of appellant\u2019s home. A \u201cluminal\u201d scan of the residence was conducted, in which a chemical compound was sprayed \u201cin an effort to locate any trace evidence\u201d that could not be seen \u201cwith the naked eye.\u201d After the application of the chemical compound, bodily fluids such as blood would glow under certain lighting. Most of the house was scanned, but, because of the toxic nature of the chemical compound, the kitchen and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>living room were not tested. No evidence was discovered in this search.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In 2000, Sergeant Charles Jacobs located David Marshall, a former inmate at the Howard County Detention Center who had been incarcerated when appellant was serving his eighteen-month sentence for sexual child abuse. Marshall was informed that his cooperation was needed in the investigation of the victim\u2019s disappearance. The State assisted Marshall in getting a bond review in an unrelated case, and in turn, Marshall promised to testify before a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Lieutenant Greg Marshall, who supervised the investigation of the victim\u2019s disappearance and was not related to David Marshall, testified that he assisted David Marshall in receiving a bond reduction hearing, gave him approximately $200 to pay bills, and drove him to a halfway house.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">On December 7, 2000, the HCPD executed a search and seizure warrant for two PWWTP waste tanks in search of human remains. No evidence was found. On April 25, 2001, based on an alleged statement made by appellant, the Baltimore County Police Department dive team searched an area of the Chesapeake Bay near PWWTP. Again, the search did not yield any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">A fourteen-day trial began July 2, 2001, and ended July 20, 2001. The State called over fifty witnesses, many of whom testified about the days leading up to and following the victim\u2019s disappearance, the victim\u2019s close relationship with her daughter, and the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">David Marshall was a key witness.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He stated that, in April or May 1998, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>[appellant] told me that, he told me what happened the night he came home early from work, and he was sitting in the living room in the dark, he had been drinking. And he wanted to confront his wife about her going to the police about her finding out about the baby sitter.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Well, he said that, that when he, you know, he heard her come in, and she turned the lights on, and he came up behind her. He startled her, because she thought he was at work. And he, you know, said he wanted to talk to her, you know. He wanted to talk to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">About the situation with the baby sitter. She had found out that he had an affair with her, and that he, and he didn\u2019t want her to go to the police. I don\u2019t know if she was, I think she was planning on leaving and taking his daughter with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Well, he said he tried to talk to her, you know, and she wouldn\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t listen to him. And, you know, he tried, she just wouldn\u2019t listen to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">He said he got angry and he, he choked her.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Well, he told me that \u2014 he said, he, like, he zapped out, said he chocked [sic] her. He didn\u2019t realize, you know, what he was doing, and he choked her, and he \u2014 when he took his hand off her neck she fell down, bumped her head. He went to check her pulse, he didn\u2019t feel anything....</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>He said, then he said, he told me, he put her, he put her in the trunk. And I got up, and I looked at him, and told him, I didn\u2019t want to hear anymore, and I went back to my bunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Marshall testified that he did not receive any assistance or help from the State regarding his case, but he had received approximately $200 from Lieutenant Marshall.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">John McKenny, an inmate at the Howard County Detention Center from March 12 through April 23, 2001, testified that appellant talked about suing Howard County and receiving a large monetary award. Appellant said that, because he was not supervised at work, he needed McKenny\u2019s help in establishing an alibi. Appellant said that he would share some of the money with McKenny if he provided appellant with an alibi. Appellant and McKenny worked out an elaborate story in which they were together from the morning of July 1 through July 2,1996. McKenny further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">Well, at another conversation, he told me that I had asked him where she was, what he did with the body? And he said it\u2019s in a place where nobody would ever find it. He don\u2019t [sic] have to worry about anybody ever finding it. And I said that must, that must be interesting. And he told me that at work his alibi, his boss, could see him somewhere, wherever he was at in the yard or wherever, driving his truck. His boss was \u2014 in visual of his boss, [sic] And when his boss left from where he could see him, he got out of one side of his truck, went to the other side, and took her out and threw her over the wall into the water. His exact words, the bitch became fish food. And I asked him what, asked him what would happen to a body, wouldn\u2019t it float or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>whatever? Between salt water and the fish eating, to [sic] body would deteriorate, and so would the bones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">And he also said the skull would be the hardest thing, the last, and the hardest thing to go, but with the current and the tides, it wouldn\u2019t be in the same place where it was dropped at.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Tony Ross testified that he had shared a \u201cdormitory\u201d with appellant at the Howard County Detention Center.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In response to Ross\u2019 questions about the victim, appellant \u201cnever gave [him] a yes or no answer,\u201d but stated that \u201cshe left, and the bitch is never coming back.\u201d Appellant later stated to Ross, \u201cif I wanted to kill my wife, think about it, I\u2019d just burn her body.\u201d That information was provided to the HCPD without Ross receiving any consideration in his pending criminal case. Ross, a self-admitted drug dealer, said he had been arrested approximately twenty times, had thirteen convictions, and was serving eight years at the Eastern Correction Institute.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Members of the victim\u2019s family testified that she \u201cstayed in contact often,\u201d that she \u201calways returned calls,\u201d that she would \u201c[n]ever\u201d walk out on her daughter, and that no one had been in contact with the victim since her disappearance. Although the victim was close to her family, she did not always share personal information with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Cole testified that only days after the victim disappeared, appellant proposed marriage to her and on two separate occasions gave her rings. On the first occasion, appellant gave Cole an engagement ring and a wedding band that had belonged to his former wife, Amaryllis. Appellant took those rings back and gave Cole another engagement ring, which she believed had belonged to the victim. Appellant also planned a honeymoon in Florida. Concerned with how a honeymoon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>would be perceived by others, they discussed telling law enforcement officials that he was going to Florida to look for the victim and that Cole was going with him to watch his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In the weeks after the victim\u2019s disappearance, appellant sold the family minivan and asked a co-worker about the length of time required before a family member could place a claim for insurance money.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">On July 25, 1996, Sharon Kurinij responded to a classified ad to rent a room at appellant\u2019s house.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Appellant told Kurinij that the victim had left him, that he had observed her getting into a car with \u201cBob,\u201d that he believed they had gone to Berkeley Springs, West Virginia, and that \u201cshe\u2019s never coming back.\u201d Appellant stated that Kurinij could take whatever she wanted from the victim\u2019s wardrobe because he was \u201cgoing to get rid of it or trash it.\u201d Kurinij and her two children moved into appellant\u2019s home on July 26, 1996. Later, appellant informed Kurinij that he was going to stop seeing Cole. Cole ceased all contact with appellant on February 17, 1997, the date that the State brought charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The State rested its case-in-chief on July 18, 2001. Appellant moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to convict and that an extrajudicial confession of the accused could not warrant a conviction unless corroborated by independent evidence establishing the <em>corpus delicti.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because there was no evidence about what tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>spired on the evening of July 1, 1996, appellant contended that the case was nothing more than an \u201cunexplained disappearance.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cSo even in a light most favorable to the State at this point, the best evidence ... would suggest not premeditated first degree murder, but would suggest only second degree murder.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">The trial court responded, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">The Appellate Court said in <em>[Lemons v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 467, 433 A.2d 1179 (1981) ] that it is possible to prove the corpus delicti of a homicide even in the absence of finding a corpse. The other cases that have been mentioned, <em>[Hurley v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 539, 483 A.2d 1298 (1984); <em>Tu v. State, </em>336 Md. 406, 648 A.2d 993 (1994) ] also speak to murder cases where a body is not found. In <em>[Hricko v. State, </em>134 Md.App. 218, 759 A.2d 1107 (2000) ], which is a 2000 case, ... there \u2014 the issue there was the toxic agent, succinylcholine, that was ultimately determined to have been used to have killed the victim. And the reason that that case, in my opinion, has some significance, is because in that particular case, the Court said that, even if proof of the death may be circumstantial, so may proof of the cause of death be circumstantial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">The determination then goes on to be whether or not there has been, if you will, enough circumstantial evidence to present. In other words, how circumstantial can circumstantial be before or distinguished from speculation. And if the Court, at this juncture, were to adopt [appellant\u2019s] argument, in essence, the Court would be attributing a higher standard of proof to circumstantial than to direct evidence, and that\u2019s simply not the state of the law. Supreme Court says that the weight to be given to circumstantial evidence is no less than that to be given to direct or vice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>versa. And that the finder of fact should take all evidence into account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The evidence in this case is certainly circumstantial. The family and friends, acquaintances of [the victim] have testified that she was not the type or character of individual who would up and go without any type of note, word, communication and continual communication with her family of origin, as well as her immediate family, particularly her daughter Amanda, how devoted she was to her daughter. Her coworkers at the Giant organization uniformly and consistently state how rehable, punctual, even-tempered, helpful, courteous and cordial she was to everyone. There is, there is nothing to show that she had, other than any medical condition, which was able to be controlled by medication, and even her physician, Dr. Levine, who testified today said that it was a moderate blood pressure, or mild, in one aspect he used, blood pressure condition, and even that was controlled with medication. Defense, on cross examination, elicited testimony from Dr. Levine saying that, well, if you don\u2019t take your medication, can\u2019t you up and die? Well, the doctor said, there could be the variety and variability of symptoms from absolutely nothing to sudden death. But there is nothing to indicate that the alleged victim ..., had any medical problem that would have shown an immediately [sic] cause of death. There was nothing to show that she was of the type of temperament, mental or emotional state, where she would have committed suicide, either because of her own health, and she wouldn\u2019t have left Amanda.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We\u2019ve also had testimony of [appellant\u2019s] interest in killing his wife, to what agency he might be able to use, whether it was by gun, or if he could not stand the sight of blood, by strangulation or suffocation, to indicate, at least from the State\u2019s portrayal of the case, that there had been some thinking, some discussion, some planning, some plotting, some premeditation. Further testimony of State\u2019s witnesses to indicate that [appellant] indicated that he had done the completed act, and disposed of the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>For all of these reasons, the Court finds that the State has made a prima facie case, and thereby denies [appellant\u2019s] Motion for Judgment of Acquittal as to all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The defense then rested and renewed its motion for judgment of acquittal, which again was denied. The jury convicted appellant of first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ApY\">I. Witness Bolstering</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Appellant claims that the trial court erred in allowing Lieutenant Marshall to bolster the credibility of David Marshall, the State\u2019s key witness. The State argues that the admissibility of evidence falls within the sound discretion of the trial court and that the court neither erred nor abused its discretion in overruling appellant\u2019s objection and denying his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">When Lieutenant Marshall was asked on direct examination to describe what inmate David Marshall was told by the State regarding his testimony, the following colloquy occurred between the court and counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">[STATE]: Was there an occasion in which you were present at a meeting between Sergeant Jacobs, David Marshall, yourself and representatives of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">[LIEUTENANT MARSHALL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">[STATE]: Can you tell the jury what, what David Marshall\u2019s legal status was at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">[LIEUTENANT MARSHALL]: His legal status was he was pending charges. He had a shoplifting charge in, in Howard County. And I believe he also had a violation of probation charge. And to my best recollection, I think, that is what his legal status was at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">[STATE]: By that point, had he made a statement to, to Sergeant Jacobs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-14\">[LIEUTENANT MARSHALL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-15\">[STATE]: Did he ask for a deal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>[LIEUTENANT MARSHALL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">[STATE]: Were you present when that was discussed with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">[LIEUTENANT MARSHALL]: Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">[STATE]: And what was he told?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">[LIEUTENANT MARSHALL]: He was told he would not be given any deal. That the only thing we would be able to do for him would be to represent to, to anyone who wanted that knowledge that he offered truthful testimony in a homicide case, and that the State would represent that to anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">THE COURT: Basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">THE COURT: Um-hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">(Bench conference. [Appellant] present.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, now I am [motioning] for mistrial, instead of [Defense Counsel], in light of the fact he\u2019s now saying this guy is truthful\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">[STATE]: No, that he had offered\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That he had offered truthful testimony. Now, he\u2019s judge, jury, fact finder and grand jury person all in one. He can (inaudible) and he\u2019s vouching now for this gentleman comes in to testify (inaudible) reliability, credibility, veracity in this (inaudible) guy. He\u2019s truthful because he just said it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-16\">[STATE]: They have already \u2014 first of all, I want to advise the Court that this witness has been taken out of order, in part, because of the defense proper objection that they didn\u2019t want Lieutenant Marshall\u2019s appearance to be serial in this case. He \u2014 they have already, in their cross examination of Sergeant Jacobs, attempted to impeach the credibility of David Marshall, and it was proper of them to do so. Because he, because of the suggestion that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>received benefits from the State, this witness has testimony of, of his own direction [sic] knowledge of, of the discussion of, of benefits to be offered to Mr. Marshall in return for his cooperation. And the lieutenant was merely trying to answer my question to address that issue, which has already been raised by the defense, and which we feel is proper for us to, to raise since we won\u2019t be, by their objection and our understanding of the Court\u2019s ruling, able to bring Lieutenant Marshall back on future occasions to rehabilitate those State\u2019s witnesses who had been in the jail with [appellant], whose credibility will be impeached in this fashion. And Mr. Marshall\u2019s credibility has already begun to be impeached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It isn\u2019t those issues. It really it comes down to a very limited statement that Detective Marshall said \u2014 saying \u2014 if he said if he had prefaced the word truthful testimony, if he. But he said, had, that he had offered truthful testimony in this case. I just think that\u2019s a, ultimately, that\u2019s a determination for the fact finder to determine whether or not Detective Marshall or any of the other witnesses are truthful. For this witness to definitively state that he had offered truthful testimony is truly a form of vouching to put the official Howard County Police Department informant on the testimony of David Marshall, and that is the inappropriate comment that is the subject of this objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">[STATE]: May I suggest a remedy, because I take [Defense Counsel\u2019s] point, Your Honor, as, as a valid one. It was not the intention. That\u2019s the way it came out. If I can be given a little room to lead, 1 think I can rectify that and clear that up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">THE COURT: What I was going to ask you was how do you distinguish the difference between what the witness\u2019s opinion of the testimony was versus what the actuality of the testimony was in terms of its truthfulness or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think that there should not be an opinion that should be permitted to be elicited from the witness, Your Honor. I think if he comes in and then offers and cooperates fully, consistent with what he said before or something like. I mean there\u2019s ways of them to identify that he \u2014 I mean I believe that Lieutenant Marshall is of the opinion that it\u2019s truthful, which was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">THE COURT: That\u2019s what I was getting at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: \u2014 which is not appropriate for him to testify as to the truthfulness of any witness\u2019s testimony. And, therefore, it would be inappropriate for him to say anything about the \u2014 whether it was truthful or not truthful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">THE COURT: Frankly, I received his meaning as \u2014 I understand what your point is, but I received his meaning as that was his opinion. So motion for mistrial denied. There\u2019s no basis, again. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The trial court directed the State to \u201cclarify\u201d the matter. Accordingly, the State asked Lieutenant Marshall whether \u201c[David Marshall] was told that the only deal that would be offered was that representatives of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office would go to any judge, anywhere, anytime to give an account of David Marshall\u2019s cooperation, period?\u201d Lieutenant Marshall replied: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">In Maryland, \u201c[i]n a jury trial, judging the credibility of witnesses is entrusted solely to the jury, the trier of fact; only the jury determines whether to believe any witnesses, and which witnesses to believe.\u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>354 Md. 287, 313, 730 A.2d 181 (1999). Witness bolstering is not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">In <em>Bohnert v. State, </em>312 Md. 266, 277-78, 539 A.2d 657 (1988), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">In a criminal case tried before a jury, a fundamental principle is that the credibility of a witness and the weight to be accorded the witness\u2019 testimony are solely within the province of the jury.... It is ... error for the court to permit to go to the jury a statement, belief, or opinion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>another person to the effect that a witness is telling the truth or lying. [Internal citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">It is the settled law of this State that a witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth. Testimony from a witness relating to the credibility of another witness is to be rejected as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\"><em>Bohnert </em>is distinguishable because, in that case, the State obviously sought to bolster the credibility of an allegedly abused child through an \u201cexpert\u201d opinion of a social worker that the child had been abused. The social worker\u2019s opinion was not based on any objective tests, nor on a review of the medical reports, but rather on the child\u2019s statement to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 153, 729 A.2d 910 (1999), a police officer testified that he was able to verify certain statements made by the defendant\u2019s cellmate, relating to inculpatory statements made by the defendant, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">Yes, sir. There was a significant number of statements that were made by Mr. Johnson, some factual statements that were made by Mr. Johnson that were not included in the application for statement of charges and/or the affidavit, for the search and seizure warrants that myself and my partner obtained. <em>These statements which I knew upon hearing them from Mr. Johnson to be truthful, and I was able to verify each and every statement that he gave us. </em>[Emphasis in original]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The Court of Appeals determined that Conyers\u2019 reliance on <em>Bohnert </em>was misplaced because the police officer was not offering an opinion about the cellmate\u2019s credibility. Rather, the officer was \u201cstating that certain information [that the cellmate] had supplied [the officer] with prior to trial was not contained in Appellant\u2019s papers and, because [the officer] was able to confirm that information, [the officer] regarded it as accurate and, therefore, truthful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154, 729 A.2d 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>In <em>Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 759 A.2d 764 (2000), the Court of Appeals considered whether the testimony of a critical witness for the State was admitted in error. The witness testified that he had given certain law enforcement officials truthful information and that they had testified at a hearing in an unrelated case. The Court of Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">[W]e do not think the testimony was proper. Nevertheless, the form of the evidence reduced its prejudicial impact. Anderson made a self-serving statement to the effect that certain persons not present once affirmed, on an unknown basis, his truthfulness in making the statements he again made at trial. Such a statement, by a witness whose credibility is in question, is far less weighty than the expert testimony in <em>Boknert, </em>and its effect on the jury was likely to be insignificant. Moreover, it is implicit that the police believed Anderson or they would not have gone to bat for him at the hearing on his motion to reduce his sentence. Although error, we hold that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We are \u201csatisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of ... may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aok\"><em>Id. </em>at 679-80, 759 A.2d 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Here, the lieutenant\u2019s statement regarding David Marshall and \u201ctruthful testimony\u201d was offered to explain what consideration the State would give Marshall for his assistance in the case against appellant. The State, as it should with all witnesses, desired and expected Marshall\u2019s testimony to be truthful. It was not the intent, nor do we believe the effect, of Lieutenant Marshall\u2019s testimony to convey his belief or opinion that David Marshall was a \u201ctruthful\u201d witness. Moreover, the issue was clarified by restating the question using the word \u201ccooperation,\u201d rather than \u201ctruthful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Reviewing Lieutenant Marshall\u2019s testimony in context and the State\u2019s rephrasing of the question, we perceive no error or abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion for a mistrial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Had we found error or abuse of discretion, we would deem the error to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because we are satisfied that, in context and as clarified, there was no reasonable possibility that the testimony contributed to the guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"A8k\">A. Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Appellant argues that the State\u2019s evidence was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction of first degree murder. Specifically, he contends that, absent a body or some other physical evidence, there was no evidence indicating that the victim was murdered. As stated in his brief, \u201c[i]t is not enough for the State to establish that <em>if </em>a crime took place, the defendant committed it; the State must first establish that a crime <em>did in fact </em>take place.\u201d Appellant further contends that, because \u201cthe only evidence establishing that a murder occurred in this case, [was] the testimony of David Marshall\u201d and that testimony was not independently corroborated, \u201cthe evidence in this case was simply insufficient to sustain the appellant\u2019s conviction for first-degree murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In reviewing a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, we do not \u201cundertake a review of the record that would amount to, in essence, a retrial of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478, 649 A.2d 336 (1994). Rather, \u201cwe review the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>478, 649 A.2d 336. \u201c[W]e accord deference to the factual findings of the jury and recognize its ability to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and to assess their credibility.\u201d <em>Streater v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 267, 275, 704 A.2d 541 (1998), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>352 Md. 800, 724 A.2d 111 (1999). So long as we are satisfied that \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, the appellant\u2019s conviction must be upheld.\u201d <em>Cooper v. State, </em>128 Md.App. 257, 266, 737 A.2d 613, 617 (1999) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>B. Corpus Delicti and the Missing Body</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">We recognized in <em>Lemons v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 467, 486-87, 433 A.2d 1179 (1981), that the State could prove a homicide in the absence of a body, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">In every Maryland case reported thus far involving the corroboration rule in the context of a homicide, the victim\u2019s body had been recovered and there was other independent evidence, either direct or circumstantial, to suggest that the death was not the result of accident or suicide. This, of course, does not imply that the inability to produce a body is an insuperable obstacle, in itself, to the obtention and sustention of a murder conviction. This Court, as well as the Court of Appeals, has repeatedly said that the independent evidence of the <em>corpus delicti </em>\u201cmay be circumstantial in nature when direct evidence is not available.\u201d ... Moreover, courts from other jurisdictions that have been confronted with the \u201cmissing body\u201d problem have unanimously concluded that the death of the alleged victim need not be evidenced directly by the production of the body. Nevertheless, it is clear from these cases that there must be independent evidence, at least circumstantial in nature, that relates to both elements of the <em>corpus delicti. </em>[Internal citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In <em>Hurley v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 539, 550-51, 483 A.2d 1298 (1984), we again affirmed a conviction for manslaughter where the victim\u2019s body was never discovered. Writing for the Court, Judge Alpert stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">Our decision in <em>Lemons </em>and here \u2014 that failure to recover the victim\u2019s body is not fatal to the State\u2019s case in a homicide prosecution \u2014 is in accord with other states that have addressed a similar situation. As the California Court of Appeals succinctly stated: \u201cThe fact that a murderer may successfully dispose of the body of the victim does not entitle him to acquittal. That is one form of success for which society has no reward.\u201d We concur with this view and with the admonition espoused by the Appellate Division of New Jersey\u2019s Superior Court when it stated that \u201csue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>cessful concealment or destruction of the victim\u2019s body should not preclude prosecution of his or her killer where proof of guilt can be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d [Internal citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><em>See Tu v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 486, 505, 631 A.2d 110 (1993) (affirming the second degree murder conviction when there was no witness to the alleged murder and no body was found), <em>aff,d, </em>336 Md. 406, 648 A.2d 993 (1994). Clearly, a murder conviction is not dependent upon the recovery of the victim\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">C. <em>Corpus Delicti</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIi\">Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\"><em>Corpus delicti </em>translates from the Latin as \u201cthe body of crime.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>346 (7th ed.1999) defines <em>corpus delicti </em>as the \u201cfact of a transgression; actus reus.\u201d Although its practical significance arises most often, as in this case, in connection with the use of extrajudicial confessions in homicide cases, the concept is applicable to any crime. Generally, <em>corpus delicti </em>is the fact of specific loss or injury and the criminal agency of someone. As discussed in more detail below, in Maryland, proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>of a crime does not require evidence that the defendant was the criminal agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">\u201c \u2018In a homicide case the proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>is sufficient if it establishes the fact that the person for whose death the prosecution was instituted is dead, and that the death occurred under circumstances which indicate that it was caused criminally by someone.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lemons, </em>49 Md.App. at 473, 433 A.2d 1179 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>188 Md. 263, 272, 52 A.2d 484 (1947)). The State may establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>by either direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Lemons, </em>49 Md. App. at 486, 433 A.2d 1179. <em>See Woods v. State, </em>315 Md. 591, 616, 556 A.2d 236 (1989); <em>Pierce v. State, </em>227 Md. 221, 226, 175 A.2d 743 (1961). The <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime of murder is ordinarily established through the presence of the victim\u2019s body and by direct evidence establishing that death resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>from criminal activity. Although it is certainly more difficult to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>of homicide when the victim\u2019s body is missing, it is not impossible. <em>See Whittlesey v. State, </em>326 Md. 502, 562 n. 11, 606 A.2d 225 (1992) (Bell, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">D. The Corpus Delicti Rule:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Corroboration of the Extrajudicial Confession</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">There was no physical evidence that the victim in this case had been murdered. In addition to the circumstantial evidence and the statement to John McKenny, the State relied heavily on appellant\u2019s confession to David Marshall. Appellant argues that his statement was not independently corroborated and was insufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">In Maryland, \u201can extra-judicial confession of guilt by a person accused of crime, uncorroborated by other evidence, is not sufficient to warrant his conviction.\u201d <em>Pierce, </em>227 Md. at 225, 175 A.2d 743. <em>See Warszower v.

State, </em>333 Md. 567, 577, 636 A.2d 474 (1994), the Court of Appeals explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8q\">[t]he Maryland corroboration requirement, operating in homicide cases as above described, does not require that every element of the consummated crime be independently established. Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Ball v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 338, 470 A.2d 361 (1984), <em>modified on other grounds sub nom. Wright v. State, </em>307 Md. 552, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>515 A.2d 1157 (1986), correctly rejected an argument in a felony murder case that there was insufficient corroboration because the only evidence of an attempted robbery was the statement of the appellant. \u201cThe requirement that there be some corroborating evidence tending to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>generally, does not establish an independent corroboration requirement as to each component element of the <em>corpus </em>delicti.\u201d 57 Md.App. at 351, 470 A.2d at 368....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The Court of Appeals also explained that 1 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 145 at 557-59 (Strong 4th ed.1992) \u201cprovided a national overview of the corroboration requirement,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\u201cThe traditional formulation of the requirement, still applied by most jurisdictions, demands that there be some evidence other than the confession that tends to establish the <em>corpus </em>delicti....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">There is some dispute regarding the definition of <em>corpus delicti, </em>which literally means the \u2018body of the crime.\u2019 To establish guilt in a criminal case, the prosecution must ordinarily show that (a) the injury or harm constituting the crime occurred; (b) this injury or harm was done in a criminal manner; and (c) the defendant was the person who inflicted the injury or harm. Wigmore maintains that <em>corpus delicti </em>means only the first of these, that is, \u201cthe fact of the specific loss or injury sustained,\u201d and does not require proof that this was occasioned by anyone\u2019s criminal agency. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">Most courts, however, define <em>corpus delicti </em>as involving both (a) and (b). This means that the corroborating evidence must tend to show the harm or injury and that it was occasioned by criminal activity. It need not, however, in any manner tend to show that the defendant was the guilty party. Thus in a homicide case, the <em>corpus delicti </em>consists of proof that the victim died and that the death was caused by a criminal act, but it need not tend to connect the defendant on trial with that act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">The traditional approach has been to require that the elements of the offense be carefully distinguished and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the corroborating evidence tend to show each of those elements. A growing number of courts, however, are abandoning the strict requirement that the corroborating evidence tend to prove all elements of the <em>corpus delicti. </em>Thus the corroborating evidence need only tend to show the \u2018major\u2019 or \u2018essential\u2019 harm involved in the offense charged and not all of the elements technically distinguished. This tendency is most pronounced in homicide cases, where defendants are often tried for offenses that involve requirements beyond simply the causing of death in a criminal manner.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><em>Ballard, </em>333 Md. at 577-78, 636 A.2d 474. The Court of Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\"><em>Further, McCormick points out that \u201c[a] growing number of courts\u201d do not require \u201cthat the corroborating evidence tend to prove all elements of the corpus delicti, \u201d but only the major or essential harm involved in the charged offense.

That is the rule applied by the Court of Special Appeals in Ball which we now </em>approve.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A24\"><em>Id. </em>at 578, 636 A.2d 474 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The Circumstantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Notwithstanding the absence of physical evidence in this case to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime, the circumstantial evidence established that: the victim was close to her family, most especially her daughter; the victim had not been heard from in five years, despite an exhaustive record and document search in addition to national media awareness of the disappearance; the victim was aware of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>appellant\u2019s ongoing affair with Cole; the victim had stated that she was going to report the affair to the police; the victim was going to leave appellant; prior to the victim\u2019s disappearance, appellant had asked co-workers about killing a person and disposing of the body; appellant had asked friends about obtaining a gun; appellant had stated to Cole that \u201che wanted to kill [the victim],\u201d stating that he would either \u201cshoot\u201d or \u201cstrangle her,\u201d and \u201cput her body in the truck with the waste,\u201d where \u201cnobody would ever find her\u201d; appellant stated that the victim \u201cwasn\u2019t coming back\u201d; and appellant had conspired to fabricate an alibi. Moreover, on the night of the victim\u2019s disappearance, the evidence indicated that appellant left work early to meet with Cole. Cole then observed appellant go to his house. There was clearly sufficient independent evidence that the victim had been murdered to corroborate appellant\u2019s confession to David Marshall. Therefore, the confession could be considered, by the trier of fact, along with all of the other evidence, in determining whether appellant was guilty of the crime of first degree murder. It is sufficient that the proof of the <em>corpus delicti, </em>even if \u201c \u2018small in amount, ..., when considered with the confession, convinces the jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ballard, </em>333 Md. at 575, 636 A.2d 474 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Appellant argues that the confession to David Marshall demonstrates a lack of premeditation, permitting only a conviction for second degree murder. We do not agree. There was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a reasonable inference that he had contemplated killing the victim prior to the events of the night of July 1 and the morning of July 2, 1996, and that, after leaving Cole, he went to his house to kill her, that was how he would \u201ctake care of\u2019 the situation that had escalated to crisis proportions. The evidence was legally sufficient to support the conviction for first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The Circumstantial Evidence Alone</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Moreover, in <em>Morgan v. State, </em>134 Md.App. 113, 124, 759 A.2d 306 (2000), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>The evidence to support a finding of guilt of the crime of murder may be either direct or circumstantial and, where legally sufficient evidence of <em>corpus delicti </em>and criminal agency are presented, the question of whether a defendant is guilty is a question of fact to be determined by the jury. Circumstantial evidence may support a conviction when the circumstances, taken together, do not require the trier of fact to resort to speculation or mere conjecture.\u201d [Internal citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In other words, if a conviction is to be supported on circumstantial evidence, that evidence \u201cmust be such that, in conjunction with weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses, there are sufficient strands interconnected to establish criminal agency and <em>corpus delicti </em>beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 759 A.2d 306. Even in the absence of the statements to David Marshall and John McKenny, we are satisfied that the circumstantial evidence in this case would have permitted a rational trier of fact to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant committed the crime of first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">III. The Jury Instruction Request</p>\n<p id=\"AJH\">A. The Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that statements made by appellant must be corroborated by independent evidence establishing the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime before they can be considered in determining appellant\u2019s guilt. More specifically, appellant asserts that it is a \u201cfunction of the fact finder, and not the trial court,\u201d to determine whether independent evidence of the <em>corpus delicti </em>exists. Appellant analogizes to accomplice testimony and the instruction to the jury that they \u201cmust first decide whether the testimony of [the accomplice] was corroborated.\u201d Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 3:11A, at 50 (\u201cMPJI-Cr\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The State responds that the trial court did not err when it rejected appellant\u2019s jury instruction because the request for a proposed instruction misstated the law; that no instruction was required because \u201cthe existence of corroboration is a legal determination to be made by the court on motion for judgment of acquittal;\u201d and, that, even if an instruction is appropriate in certain cases, the evidence in this case, absent appellant\u2019s confession, was \u201cfully sufficient to withstand a motion for judgment of acquittal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">B. The Requested Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Appellant submitted the following proposed jury instruction to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">19. Corroboration of Defendant\u2019s Statement <em>Ballard v. State, </em>383 Md. 567, 636 A.2d 474 (1994):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">You have heard testimony that the defendant made a statement to a State\u2019s witness. In order to find the defendant guilty, you must establish that independent evidence exists to corroborate, or support, the statement of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">The independent evidence necessary to support the statement of the defendant need not be full and positive proof of the corpus delicti, or crime, and may be small in amount, if such proof, when considered with the statement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>defendant, convinces you beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">If you do not find that the State has introduced independent evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime for which he is charged, then you must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">When asked by the trial court why appellant wanted such an instruction, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I think that the case law indicates that, well, the State is relying upon the statement of the defendant. Since this is a clearly circumstantial case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: \u2014 that there is no direct evidence that, one, [the victim] is dead; two, that [appellant] actually committed an act which resulted in the death of [the victim], that there is going to be a large emphasis placed on the statement of [appellant]. And, otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t have been the introduction of the inmates\u2019 testimony. So I believe that there has to be corroboration. And I\u2019m not \u2014 I believe, actually, the law is clear there has to be corroboration of the defendant\u2019s statement in order for the State in a circumstantial case to be able to prove the elements of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">They can\u2019t just rely upon the statement of the defendant in order to say, well, now you\u2019ve heard it, you\u2019ve heard that [appellant] said that he, he actually shook his wife and ultimately strangled her and killed her. And you don\u2019t need any more because his statement actually proves to you that he killed his wife. I think that the case law is clear in specifically <em>Ballard v. State </em>that there has to be an independent, there has to be independent evidence necessary to support the statement of [appellant], in order to actually prove, even in the absence of a body, the fact that the crime did occur. And that would be my request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">[STATE]: The only problem that we have, really, is we don\u2019t have any problem with the, legal principles [defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>counsel] has recited. We have some difficulty with the proposed instruction. Because this is, I think we can make it clear, Your Honor, we are not going to be arguing that the statement that the defendant made to Mr. Marshall is the only evidence against him. Our position is that there are multiple statements that the defendant made to a wide variety of people, which in various ways are admissions of his having murdered his wife. And they, they go from the statements made that establishes motive and his intent, his search [for] weaponry, his discussions with people about how to dispose of a body, so on and so forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">So it\u2019s this, this instruction that, that by its terms articulates the proposition that there is a statement made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I wouldn\u2019t object to creating the plural statements, I mean just adding an S to the statements of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">[STATE]: What is the, what is the \u2014 is there a pattern?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I don\u2019t believe there is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">THE COURT: No. And the reason there\u2019s \u2014 the only pattern instruction there is, is statement of the defendant, which is to police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">Discussions between counsel and the trial court continued, with the State contending that an instruction was not appropriate \u201cbecause this is a legal issue that really goes to [the court\u2019s] decision as to whether or not there is sufficient evidence to proceed.\u201d Then, the following exchange took place between the court and counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">[STATE]: I just respectfully say that I think it\u2019s a legal issue, not an issue of fact for the jury to determine. If the defense believed that there was insufficient corroboration of statements of the defendant, that would be a proper focus for a motion for judgment of acquittal. And unless we were able to satisfy you that we have corroboration of [the] statement through the circumstantial evidence that is, is abundant in this case, corroboration of the statement of the defendant, then this case should properly not go to a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>I think there\u2019s a reason why the pattern jury instruction committee does not have a pattern jury instruction on this. I think they would if this were a matter for a jury to decide as opposed to court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">[STATE]: Do you have a case, [defense counsel], where an instruction like this was given or considered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Not that \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether there is one. I just basically relied upon the <em>Ballard </em>case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">[STATE]: Well, we don\u2019t argue the principle. I mean you\u2019re absolutely right on the principle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">THE COURT: What the State\u2019s point is is if it had been argued yesterday that Judge all you\u2019ve got is the statement or statements of [appellant], and the principle of law is that other than that, you have nothing. You argued about the circumstantial evidence and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That there wasn\u2019t sufficient evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">THE COURT: \u2014 that there was insufficient, which would corroborate his statements if believed. So that was the legal principle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\">THE COURT: And I granted \u2014 granted that the State\u2019s argument, I noted that the State\u2019s arguments were all circumstantial. But the state of the case law is that pursuant to <em>Hricko </em>and <em>Hurley </em>and <em>Tu, </em>that small group of cases, that you can have a successful prosecution and conviction in a homicide case where there is no body found. Add to that statements of [appellant], it\u2019s a legal principle. It\u2019s not a factual issue for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-13\">The factual issues for the jury are what they\u2019re presented with in these instructions, and if they find, as a whole, the totality of the evidence, if they are persuaded beyond reasonable doubt as to [appellant\u2019s] statements, as to the statements of the other former inmates. Understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>that they may have had a motive or financial gain, or so on and so forth. The testimony of the family, the testimony of the friends, the testimony of the co-workers, the testimony of the police as to the efforts made, unsuccessfully to locate [the victim] if they find, as that body of evidence that it convinces them beyond reasonable doubt of one or more of these charges, then [appellant] is guilty. If not, then he\u2019s acquitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: My concern would be we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to contemplate back there. There might be a unanimous decision that if he never would have said it to Mr. Marshall if it wasn\u2019t true, and we believe Mr. Marshall and find him to be a trustworthy individual\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2pU\">THE COURT: That\u2019s a credibility issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL] But then, but then if that was the sole basis of the decision, they would actually, there would be an absence of guidance that they couldn\u2019t base their decision solely on the statements that Mr.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">THE COURT: They\u2019re not. They\u2019re, they\u2019re going by\u2014 they have to \u2014 they\u2019re is [sic] going to be instructed that they have to take in to account what constitutes evidence. And the evidence is direct and circumstantial. The evidence is the witness\u2019s statements and testimony, the documentary evidence. That is the evidence about which they have to deliberate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And I understand the Court\u2019s point. I\u2019m saying that without knowing that they, even though they are supposed to consider that, because they\u2019re considering a statement of [appellant], either as, as direct evidence actually, that they could make a determination that that in and of itself would lead them to believe that the [appellant] is guilty. And the Maryland\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">THE COURT: But the fact of the matter is, they may find, they may find that that\u2019s the most persuasive, and that the other evidence does not negate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Then they would actually render a verdict in violation of Maryland law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>THE COURT: No, they wouldn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s my argument^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">After proceeding on other issues, appellant again sought the proposed corroboration instruction. At a bench conference held prior to the giving of the jury instructions, the State proposed a modification of appellant\u2019s requested jury instruction, but the modified instruction was not placed on the record. The State subsequently renewed its objection to appellant\u2019s requested instruction, maintaining that \u201cthe law is not that the independent corroborative evidence standing alone has to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The trial court declined to provide a corroboration instruction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">The \u2014 any statements of the defendant that were given are taken as a whole as part of direct and circumstantial evidence for which the jury has to judge all of the evidence and find the defendant\u2019s guilt to be of a standard beyond reasonable doubt. These instructions, as given, adequately cover that aspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">After the jury was instructed, appellant renewed his objection to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">\u201cThe determination of whether an instruction must be given turns on whether there is any evidence in the case that supports the instruction. The threshold determination of whether the evidence is sufficient to generate the desired instruction is a question of law for the judge.\u201d <em>Dishman v. State, 352 </em>Md. 279, 292, 721 A.2d 699 (1998) (citations omitted). Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding.

Slate, </em>104 Md.App. 655, 660, 657 A.2d 402 (1995) (quoting <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 592, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984)). The trial court is under no obligation to give an instruction containing an incorrect statement of the law to the jury. <em>Hensen v.

State, </em>317 Md. 691, 706, 566 A.2d 488 (1989)). Because appellant\u2019s proposed instruction did not correctly state the law, the trial court did not err in not giving it to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">C. The Necessity of a Corroboration Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In determining whether some instruction regarding corroboration was necessary in this case, the essential question is whether the sufficiency of the corroboration evidence to establish <em>corpus delicti </em>is a question of law for the court alone to decide or ultimately a question of fact to be decided by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights states: \u201cIn the trial of all criminal cases, the Jury shall be the Judges of Law, as well as of fact, except that the Court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction.\u201d Md. Code (1958, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Article 23 of the Constitutions Article. In <em>Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 210, 522 A.2d 1338 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>(1987) (citations and footnotes omitted), the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">The first phrase of Article 23, that the jury shall be the judge of the law as well as the fact, has been interpreted to mean that while the jury is the exclusive judge of the fact, the jury\u2019s role with respect to the law is limited to resolving conflicting interpretations of the legal effect of the evidence and disputes concerning the substantive law of the crime for which there is a sound basis. The second phrase, that the court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence, added by constitutional amendment effective December 1, 1950, confers upon the courts of this State the power to pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction in a criminal case. The provisions of Article 23 have been implemented by statute, Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 593,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the rules of this Court, Md. Rule 4-324 (1987).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>1 <em>McCormick, on Evidence </em>\u00a7 145, at 522 (Strong 5th ed. 1999) <em>(\u201cMcCormick 5th </em>\u201d), states that the corroboration requirement \u201cis clearly a requirement of evidence <em>sufficiency </em>to be applied by an appellate court reviewing a conviction, and\u2014 apparently \u2014 by a trial judge in deciding whether there is sufficient evidence for a case to go to the jury.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The corroboration requirement may arise at different times during the course of the trial. For example, it may be raised when the confession is introduced into the proceedings. In that instance, the trial court in its discretion could determine that the evidence of corroboration was sufficient and admit the confession unconditionally or it could admit the evidence conditionally, subject to further evidence being introduced. In the latter situation, the court if it deems sufficient evidence is not forthcoming, the confession would not be considered in consideration of a motion for judgment of acquittal. As the Court of Appeals noted in <em>Ballard, </em>333 Md. at 571 n. 1, 636 A.2d 474:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">The corroboration requirement, ... is a rule of substantive law and not a rule of evidence. Thus, although [defendant\u2019s] multiple admissions and confessions came into evidence essentially without objection, [defendant] was not precluded from contending, in support of his motion for a judgment of acquittal, that the confessions could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>considered in weighing the sufficiency of the evidence to convict. The timing of a ruling on the sufficiency of corroboration of the <em>corpus delicti, i.e., </em>whether made conditionally or unconditionally when a confession or admission is offered, or deferred until ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal, is a function of defense tactics and trial court discretion. [Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We conclude that, as a general rule, the court makes the legal determination of whether the evidence, including the sufficiency of the independent evidence corroborating appellant\u2019s confession for the purpose of establishing the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime, is sufficient to support a guilty verdict. When that determination is made, the case goes to the jury to decide whether, based on all of the evidence, it is convinced of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, a corroboration instruction is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Although there is split authority on the issue, that position has been adopted in both federal and state courts, and, as noted, is \u201cgenerally agreed\u201d upon by the commentators. <em>See Perovich v.

Singleterry, </em>29 F.3d 733 (1st Cir.Me. 1994), the Court explained why a corroboration jury instruction is not required. We quote at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">First, if the district court loses confidence in its earlier determination of the corroboration issue and the evidence is otherwise inadequate to support a conviction, the proper course would be to enter a judgment of acquittal. Alternatively, if the government\u2019s remaining evidence could support a finding of guilt but the jury\u2019s incurable exposure to the confession raises serious questions about the prospect of a fair trial, the proper course would be to declare a mistrial. <em>See Stewart v. United States, </em>366 U.S. 1, 10, 81 S.Ct. 941, 6 L.Ed.2d 84 (1961); <em>United States v.

U.S., </em>348 U.S. 84, 75 S.Ct. 158, 99 L.Ed. 101 (1954)] may nevertheless be inadmissible \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">Third, particularly where a full confession dominates the government\u2019s proof, it is fair to assume that a jury will interpret its duty to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to mean that it cannot simply accept a confession at face value. <em>See D\u2019Aquino v. United States, </em>192 F.2d 338, 357 (9th Cir.1951) (holding that where there is adequate corroboration of the confession \u201cthe usual instructions on presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt adequately cover[ ] all that the jury need be told upon this question of [corroboration]\u201d) (citing <em>Pearlman v. United States, </em>10 F.2d 460 (9th Cir.1926)), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 U.S. 935[, 72 S.Ct. 772, 96 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>1343] (1952); McCormick, supra, \u00a7 145, at 564 (\u201cNor is there sufficient need to submit the matter to the jury, as long as the jury is adequately sensitized to the need to find all elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">Fourth, we note that a judge has wide latitude to select appropriate, legally correct instructions to ensure that the jury weighs the evidence without thoughtlessly crediting an out-of-court confession. Accordingly, even if the district court has properly admitted evidence of a confession, the court has the discretion to determine that the question of trustworthiness is such a close one that it would be appropriate to instruct the jury to conduct its own corroboration analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\"><em>Singleterry, </em>29 F.3d at 738-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The <em>Singleterry </em>Court declined to adopt the rule that, \u201ceven after a court has properly admitted evidence of a confession and correctly tested the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, the court has a responsibility ... to instruct the jury to determine that the confession is trustworthy before considering it as evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 738. The Court, however, kept open the possibility that, in a close case, a jury instruction \u201cwould be appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739. <em>See State v. Hale, </em>45 Haw. 269, 283-84, 367 P.2d 81 (Haw.1961) (stating that a jury should not weigh \u201cthe proof of the corpus delicti separately from the confession,\u201d unless the trial judge is in doubt as to the sufficiency of the independent proof to establish the <em>corpus delicti; </em>in such case, \u201cthe jury should be instructed on the point of corroboration upon request and submission of a proper instruction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Some jurisdictions have held that a corroboration jury instruction is required in all cases, and others have held that an instruction is necessary under certain circumstances. <em>See United States v.

Otherwise, it is a matter for the jury, not reviewable here.\u201d In <em>Jones, </em>188 Md. at 271-72, 52 A.2d 484, where three judges sat as a jury, the Court said that the independent evidence establishing the <em>corpus delicti </em>is \u201csufficient if, when considered in connection with the confession, it satisfies the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense was committed and that the defendant committed it.\u201d That principle is repeated in many subsequent cases. <em>Bagley v.

Also, in <em>Bradbury, </em>the Court said that \u201c[i]t is ... well settled that an extrajudicial confession of guilt ..., unsupported by other evidence, is not sufficient to warrant a conviction.\u201d <em>Bradbury, </em>233 Md. at 424,197 A.2d 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\"><em>Jones </em>and <em>Weller, </em>like the case of <em>Luery v. State, </em>116 Md. 284, 81 A. 681 (1911), wherein the Court of Appeals presented a \u201cbrief historical background as well as the reasoning behind the development of\u2019 the accomplice rule, were decided prior to the time that the Court had \u201ca duty [or] a right to review the <em>legal sufficiency </em>of the evidence in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Wright v. State, </em>219 Md. 643, 647, 150 A.2d 733 (1959) (emphasis supplied). Now, by judging the legal sufficiency of the corroboration evidence when it considers a judgment of acquittal, it falls upon the trial court to insure that a defendant is not convicted on his confession alone. When properly preserved, issues of legal sufficiency may be reviewed again on appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">If the evidence independent of the confession is legally sufficient to establish the <em>corpus delicti, </em>there is no reason that the jury consider the proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>separate from the confession. Rather, the jury should weigh the evidence as a whole in determining that the offense was committed and that the defendant committed it. At that point, the critical instruction is a proper \u201creasonable doubt instruction.\u201d <em>See F.J. Wigmore Evidence </em>\u00a7 2073, at 532 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">In this regard, one case deserves discussion. In <em>Bradbury, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals was asked to consider whether the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted because the evidence was insufficient to convict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>him of the common law crime of sodomy and whether the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury. The victim was a 12-year-old boy. Because the medical evidence did not establish penetration, the testimony of the young boy was central to the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">The trial court advised the jury that a \u201cdefendant in a criminal case cannot be convicted upon his extrajudicial confession alone. There must be corroboration. * * * If the confession is voluntary and you believe it is a valid confession, then you would need but slight evidence of corroboration. Slight evidence of corroboration has been defined as an infinitesimal amount of corroboration, a very small amount of corroboration. That is a very small amount of evidence in addition to the confession if the confession were believed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 423, 197 A.2d 126. Bradbury contended that the trial court erred in advising the jury that only \u201cslight evidence of corroboration\u201d was necessary to establish the <em>corpus delicti. </em>He argued that the correct instruction was that \u201ca confession must be corroborated by independent evidence which <em>substantially </em>establishes the <em>corpus delicti.\u201d Id. </em>at 424, 197 A.2d 126 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Acknowledging that it was \u201cwell settled that an extrajudicial confession of guilt by a person accused of crime, unsupported by other evidence, is not sufficient to warrant a conviction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 423,197 A.2d 126, the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">While the trial court should have advised the jury that the supporting evidence, independent of the confession, should relate to and establish the <em>corpus delicti, </em>it did not commit prejudicial error by stating that only \u201cslight evidence of corroboration\u201d was necessary, since, under the circumstances of this case, there was some proof of penetration and only slight evidence of that fact was sufficient to support the charge of sodomy irrespective of whether the accused confessed or admitted the charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 425, 197 A.2d 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\"><em>Bradbury </em>does not stand for the principle that a <em>corpus delicti </em>instruction is always necessary because that was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the question before the Court. Rather, the focus of the case was on the correctness of the instruction that had been given. Moreover, the Court found that omission of language that the supporting evidence should relate to the <em>corpus delicti </em>did not constitute \u201cprejudicial error\u201d because, even without Bradbury\u2019s confession, there was \u201csome proof\u2019 of penetration and only slight evidence was necessary. In other words, the Court, in effect, determined the legal sufficiency of the evidence. If the jury was to determine if the <em>corpus delicti </em>had been established, it would have been important to instruct that the supporting evidence should relate to the <em>corpus delicti.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">As we have discussed above, there was in this case before us substantially more than \u201csome proof,\u201d i.e., sufficient evidence, to establish <em>corpus delicti </em>and to support a conviction of murder in the first degree, even in the absence of appellant\u2019s confession. We have not been directed to any Maryland case, particularly one since 1950, when the courts were granted the power to pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a criminal conviction, that mandates a jury instruction regarding corroboration of a confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s analogy to the corroboration requirement in cases involving accomplice testimony and to MPJI-Cr 3:11 A. In reference to the purpose to be served by the <em>corpus delicti </em>rule, <em>McCormick </em>has indicated, \u201c[traditionally and generally, the requirement appears to have a relatively modest objective \u2014 protecting against the risk of conviction for a crime that never occurred.\u201d <em>McCormick 5th </em>\u00a7 145 at 523. In <em>Crouch, </em>77 Md.App. at 769, 551 A.2d 943, we indicated that the limited purpose of the corroboration requirement is \u201cto prevent a mentally unstable person from confessing to and being convicted of a crime that never occurred.\u201d Corroboration of an accomplice\u2019s testimony has been required because the testimony is \u201c \u2018admittedly contaminated with guilt\u2019 \u201d and the accomplice \u201cmay have an ulterior motive for testifying, such as seeking a reduced sentence or charge.\u201d <em>McCray v. State, </em>122 Md.App. 598, 605, 716 A.2d 302 (1998) (quoting <em>Turner v. State, </em>294 Md. 640, 642, 452 A.2d 416 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Not only is the basis for the rule different in each instance, what is to be corroborated is also different. As Judge Moylan explained in <em>Crouch, </em>77 Md.App. at 768-69, 551 A.2d 943:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae\">The corroboration requirement as to a defendant\u2019s confession is very different from the corroboration requirement as to accomplice testimony. When a conviction is based upon the testimony of an accomplice, there must be some independent corroboration establishing the defendant\u2019s criminal agency. When a conviction is based upon the testimony or statements of the defendant himself, on the other hand, there must be some independent corroboration of the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The ultimate determination of criminal agency and credibility are always issues for the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">No questions have been raised regarding appellant\u2019s mental stability. Nor are there any voluntariness or general trustworthiness issues raised regarding the extra-judicial confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Appellant\u2019s confession was heard by the jury through the medium of David Marshall. As to David Marshall\u2019s credibility, the jury was instructed to consider \u201cwith caution,\u201d the testimony of a witness who testified for the State as a result of a plea agreement or financial benefit. This instruction was similar to MPJI-Cr 3:11, which requires an instruction that accomplice testimony \u201cbe considered with caution and given such weight as you believe it deserves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s request for a jury instruction. Moreover, there is no indication that the trial court overlooked its obligation to avoid or limit undue prejudice stemming from evidence of appellant\u2019s voluntary confession. In denying the motions for judgment of acquittal, the trial court determined that the independent evidence establishing the <em>corpus delicti </em>was legally sufficient to permit the jury to consider the confession along with the other evidence in deciding whether a crime had been committed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>that appellant committed it. We, too, find the independent evidence legally sufficient to establish the <em>corpus delicti.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The trial court properly instructed the jury as to the State\u2019s burden of proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">In making your decision, you must consider the evidence in this case. That is the testimony from the witness stand, physical evidence or exhibits admitted into evidence, stipulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">In evaluating the evidence, you should consider it in light of your own experiences. You may draw any reasonable inferences or conclusions from the evidence that you believe to be justified by common sense and your own experiences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">In reaching a verdict, you should weigh all of the evidence presented, whether direct or circumstantial. You may not convict the defendant unless you find that the evidence, when considered as a whole, establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Here, the circumstantial evidence indicated that the victim was aware of appellant\u2019s ongoing affair with a minor; the victim had stated that she was going to report the affair to the police; that on the night of the victim\u2019s disappearance, appellant left work early, met with Cole, who then observed appellant go to his house; that the victim was going to leave appellant; appellant had asked co-workers about killing a person and disposing of the body; appellant had asked friends about obtaining a gun; appellant had stated to Cole that \u201che wanted to kill [the victim],\u201d stating that he would either \u201cshoot\u201d or \u201cstrangle her,\u201d and \u201cput her body in the truck with the waste,\u201d where \u201cnobody would ever find her;\u201d appellant stated that the victim \u201cwasn\u2019t coming back\u201d; and appellant had conspired to fabricate an alibi; and that there had been an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>exhaustive search, but no trace of the victim for five years. The jury was presented with more than sufficient evidence to corroborate appellant\u2019s confession, and thus, the jury was not in jeopardy of convicting appellant solely based on an uncorroborated extra-judicial confession of guilt.

They are bound by the rule of evidence not to convict unless there is, in their belief, some evidence of the corpus delicti to corroborate the confession. The judge\u2019s ruling was provisional only, preliminary to allowing the case to go to the jury; they in their turn must conclude, <em>without reference to the judge's ruling, </em>whether the corroboration exists to satisfy them.
