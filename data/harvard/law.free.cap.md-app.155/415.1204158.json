MOYLAN, Jr., Judge, retired, specially assigned.</author>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The leitmotif that runs through this opinion was first sounded by the Court of Appeals in 1943 in the landmark case of <em>Gontrum v. City of Baltimore, </em>182 Md. 370, 35 A.2d 128. <em>Gontrum </em>established that many of the standard rules governing the relationship between two contracting parties do not apply when one of those parties, instead of being a private person or private corporation, is a municipality or other governmental entity. The rationale for the difference is very similar to the rationale behind sovereign immunity. The literal holding of <em>Gontrum </em>was in the context of an ostensibly express contract. This appeal requires us to determine whether the rationale, as opposed to the holding, of <em>Gontrum </em>also extends to implied contracts, both those implied in fact and those implied in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The appellant, Alternatives Unlimited, a Maryland corporation that provides alternative education programs, sued the appellee, the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners, seeking compensation for services provided to the Board from September 25, 2000, through May 23, 2001. Carmen V. Russo, the Chief Executive Officer of the Baltimore City School system, was initially also a defendant, but summary judgments were granted in her favor on all counts against her. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The appellant is not challenging those judgments, and Ms. Russo, therefore, is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Dismissals By Judge Glynn And Summary Judgment By Judge Allison</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The pleading that concerns us is the First Amended Complaint, filed on June 10, 2002. That complaint was drawn in nine counts. Following a full hearing in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on July 17, 2002, Judge John Glynn granted the Board\u2019s Motion to Dismiss seven of those nine counts. The two counts against the Board which were not dismissed were Count V, a claim for Quantum Meruit, and Count VI, a claim of Unjust Enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">After the filing of an Answer to the First Amended Complaint by the Board and a period of discovery, the Board filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on the two remaining counts. Following a full hearing on January 10, 2003, Judge Kaye A. Allison granted summary judgment in favor of the Board on those two remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">On appeal, Alternatives raises essentially the two contentions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">1. that Judge Allison erroneously granted summary judgment in favor of the Board on Counts V and VI alleging, respectively, 1) quantum meruit and 2) unjust enrichment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">2. that Judge Glynn erroneously dismissed Count IX, demanding an accounting from the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">\n<em>Gontrum v. Baltimore</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">With respect to Alternatives\u2019s primary contention, it behooves us preliminarily, before even narrating the facts in this case, to set out the dispositive holding of <em>Gontrum v. Baltimore, </em>182 Md. at 375-78, 35 A.2d 128. Every aspect of the factual narrative takes on legal significance when looked at through the prism of <em>Gontrum. </em>It was on the authority of <em>Gontrum </em>that Judge Glynn dismissed six of the eight substantive counts that were before him, dismissals that Alternatives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>does not now challenge. It was also on the authority of <em>Gontrum </em>that Judge Allison granted summary judgment in favor of the Board on the two remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The plaintiff, Gontrum, sought relief against Baltimore City on the ground that he had been fraudulently induced by two city officials to convey a twenty-foot wide right of way across his property for a sewer line. The two city officials on whom he relied were 1) the Land Surveyor, who was an engineering aide in the Sewer Department and whose duty it was to secure rights of ways for sewers; and 2) an assistant city solicitor. The representation was that Baltimore City, which had already obtained a City Council ordinance for condemning and opening Cedonia Avenue across Gontrum\u2019s property, would soon be implementing that ordinance by condemning a sixty-foot right of way which would overlay the twenty-foot wide sewer right of way that Gontrum was conveying to the city voluntarily. The representation to Gontrum included the assurance that \u201che would suffer no abatement of compensation when the street was finally condemned and damages awarded, by reason of the [earlier and voluntary] conveyance of the twenty-foot sewer right of way.\u201d 182 Md. at 373, 35 A.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">After 1) ditches had been dug, 2) sewer pipes and drains had been installed, and 3) nine years had gone by without any hint of condemnation of his property for the opening of Cedonia Avenue, Gontrum finally demanded relief. He sought to have Baltimore City</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">at once begin the removal of its sewerage pipes and drains from the right of way and easement for sewers over the land of the appellants granted by said agreement, or <em>pay to the appellants such damages as would he fair compensation for the land </em>in the said right of way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">182 Md. at 372, 35 A.2d 128 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Much as Alternatives in the present case relied upon an anticipated retroactive approval of a contract, Gontrum relied, to his detriment, on an anticipated condemnation by Baltimore City.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>It is contended by the appellants that <em>Glover represented to them that Cedonia Avenue would be opened by the City within a very short time, </em>that <em>this representation was confirmed by von Wyszecki, </em>and that <em>it was in reliance upon these representations that the sewer right of way agreement was signed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">182 Md. at 374, 35 A.2d 128 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Just as the Board in this case may arguably have reaped certain benefits from the efforts of Alternatives without paying for them, the City of Baltimore, in the <em>Gontrum </em>case, had been for nine years very definitely \u201cenjoying the benefits accruing to it under the sewer right of way agreement, \u25a0without having compensated [Gontrum] therefor.\u201d 182 Md. at 377-78, 35 A.2d 128. Unfair as it may seem, Gontrum was nonetheless afforded no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The overarching principle of <em>Gontrum </em>is that a governmental entity, unlike a private corporation, may never have an obligation imposed upon it to expend public funds except in the formal manner expressly provided by law. There is no exemption from this rule because of any apparent authority of one of its agents to bind the governmental entity. There is imposed on any party dealing with the governmental entity, moreover, an absolute responsibility 1) to know the limitations on the powers of the agent to contract on behalf of the governmental entity and 2) to be familiar with and bound by \u201cthe power of the particular officer or agency to make the contract\u201d in question. <em>Gontrum </em>stated unequivocally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">[T]here is another and more cogent reason why the appellants are not entitled to relief in this case. It is a fundamental principle of law that <em>all persons dealing with the agent of a municipal corporation are bound to ascertain the nature and extent of his authority. Dillon\u2019s Municipal Corporations, </em>5th Ed., Sec. 777. <em>A municipal corporation is not bound by a contract 'made in its name </em>by one of its officers or by a person in its employ, although within the scope of its corporate powers, <em>if the officer or employee had </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>no authority to enter into such a contract on behalf of the corporation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">Section 1268 of <em>McQuillin\u2019s Municipal Corporations, </em>2d Ed., states that \u201cThe general rule is well settled and is constantly enforced that <em>one who makes a contract with a municipal corporation is bound to take notice of limitation of its powers to contract and also of the power of the particular officer </em>or agency <em>to make the contract.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">182 Md. at 375, 35 A.2d 128 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\"><em>Gontrum </em>actually applied long-settled Maryland law, as it cited and quoted with approval from a line of Maryland decisions dating back to 1862. <em>Baltimore v. Eschbach, </em>18 Md. 276, 282 (1862), first stated that a public entity will not be bound by an action of an employee even under circumstances where a private entity might well be bound by a similar action by one of its agents.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\"><em>Although a private agent, </em>acting in violation of specific instructions, yet within the scope of a general authority, <em>may bind his principal, the rule, as to the effect of the like act of a public agent, is otherwise. </em>The City Commissioner, upon whose determination to grade and pave, the contract was made, was the public agent of a municipal corporation, clothed with duties and powers, specifically defined and limited, by ordinances bearing the character and force of public laws, ignorance of which can be presumed in favor of no one dealing with him on matters thus conditionally within his official discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\"><em>Baltimore v. Eschbach </em>went on to hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\"><em>[T]he law makes a distinction between the effect of the acts of an officer of a corporation, and those of an agent for a principal in common cases; </em>in the latter the extent of authority is necessarily known only to the principal and the agent, while, <em>in the former, it is a matter of record in the books of the corporation, or of public law. A municipal corporation cannot be held liable for the unauthorized acts of its agents, </em>although done <em>officii colore, without some </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>corporate act of ratification or adoption; </em>and, from considerations of public policy, <em>it seems more reasonable that an individual should occasionally suffer from the mistakes of public agents or officers, than to adopt a rule, which, </em>through improper combinations and collusion, <em>might be turned to the detriment and injury of the public.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">18 Md. at 282-83, quoted in <em>Gontrum, </em>182 Md. at 375-76, 35 A.2d 128 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><em>Gontrum </em>also quoted with approval, 182 Md. at 376, 35 A.2d 128, from <em>Baltimore v. Reynolds, </em>20 Md. 1, 10-11 (1863):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgD\">\u201cIn cases of public agents, <em>the government or other authority, is not bound unless it manifestly appears that the agent is acting within the scope of his authority, </em>or he is held out as having authority to do the act, or is employed in his capacity as a public agent to make the declaration or representation for the government. Indeed <em>this rule seem indispensable, in order to guard the public against loss and injuries arising from the </em>fraud or <em>mistake, or rashness and indiscretion of their agents. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\"><em>Gontrum, </em>182 Md. at 376-77, 35 A.2d 128, similarly quoted with approval from <em>State v. Kirkley, </em>29 Md. 85, 110 (1869):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJv5\">No principle of the law relating to municipal corporations is more firmly established than that those who deal with their agents or officers must, at their peril, take notice of the limits of the powers both of the municipality and of those who assume to act as its agents and officers; and <em>in no State has this principle been more frequently applied or more rigidly enforced than in Maryland.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">(Emphasis supplied). <em>State v. Kirkley </em>had gone on to say, 29 Md. at 111:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">The reasonableness and necessity of the rule rests upon the ground that these bodies corporate are composed of all the inhabitants within the corporate limits; that the inhabitants are the corporators; that the officers of the corporation, including the legislative or governing body, are merely the public agents of the corporators; that their duties and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>powers are prescribed by Statutes and Ordinances, and <em>every one, </em>therefore, <em>may know the nature of these duties and the extent of these powers.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Horn v. Baltimore, </em>30 Md. 218 (1869); <em>Baltimore v. Gill, </em>31 Md. 375 (1869); <em>Baltimore v. Musgrave, </em>48 Md. 272, 30 Am. Rep. 458 (1878); <em>Mayor, Etc. of Baltimore v. Keyser, </em>72 Md. 106, 19 A. 706 (1890); <em>Mealey v. Hagerstown, </em>92 Md. 741, 48 A. 746 (1901); <em>Packard v.

Parr, </em>164 Md. 222, 164 A. 743 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><em>Gontrum </em>is now the unchallenged flagship case that is consistently and regularly followed. <em>Hanna v. Board of Education of Wicomico County, </em>200 Md. 49, 57, 87 A.2d 846 (1952), cited it as authority for the proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">The rule is firmly established that one who makes a contract with a municipal corporation or administrative agency is bound to take notice of the limitations of its powers to contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In <em>Inlet Associates v. Assateague House Condominium Assoc., </em>313 Md. 413, 437, 545 A.2d 1296 (1988), the Court of Appeals cited both <em>Gontrum </em>and <em>Lipsitz v. Parr, </em>as it held that <em>a party dealing with officials of a municipality is charged with knowledge of the limits on the power to act by those officials </em>and may not invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel simply because it \u201crelie[d] upon erroneous official advice to its detriment.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>[E]veryone dealing with officers and agents of a municipality is charged with knowledge of </em>the nature of their duties and <em>the extent of their powers, </em>and therefore such a person cannot be considered to have been deceived or misled by their acts when done without legal authority. Therefore, <em>the doctrine of equitable estoppel \u201ccannot be ... invoked to defeat the municipality in the enforcement of its ordinances, because of an error or mistake committed by one of its officers or agents which has been relied on by the third party to his detriment. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The Key Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">What, then, are the facts to which <em>Gontrum </em>and its progeny must be applied? The key to this case is the professional and contractual relationship, if any, among three persons. The central player for Alternatives Unlimited was its president and chief executive officer, Dr. Stuart Berger. Alternatives, a Maryland corporation, is a provider of alternative education programs. It has had contracts with urban school districts in cities such as Chicago, Houston, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Syracuse. At the time of the controversy in this case, Alternatives had been in business for approximately five and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>half years. It was incorporated in the Spring of 1997, with Dr. Berger having been one of the incorporators. Dr. Berger was also the president of Alternatives\u2019s Board of Directors and his wife was the Board\u2019s vice-president. Dr. Berger was the only person authorized to enter into contracts on behalf of Alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Dr. Berger also had had extensive experience with public education in Maryland. In the middle 1990\u2019s he had been the superintendent of the Baltimore County School System, and apparently had earlier served as the superintendent of the Frederick County school system as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The two key players for the Board were Carmen V. Russo and Dr. Elizabeth Morgan. At the time of the first of two possible meetings she had with Dr. Berger, Ms. Russo had just been appointed as Chief Executive Officer of the Baltimore City Public School System, but had not yet assumed her new duties. As of August 1, 2000, however, she had officially taken office. Dr. Morgan was, at all pertinent times in this case, the Chief Academic Officer in that system.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The Procurement Policy of the School Board</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">As spelled out in Maryland Code, Education Article, \u00a7 4-302, the municipal corporation known as the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore has the responsibility to \u201cestablish and maintain a system of free public schools in Baltimore City.\u201d To implement that mandate, \u00a7 4-303(a) establishes a Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners. Section 4-304 sets out the powers and duties of its Chief Executive Officer. Section 4-305 sets out the powers and duties of its Chief Academic Officer. Section 4-306.1 lists \u201cAdditional Powers of [the] Board,\u201d including the power to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">(4) <em>Enter into all contracts </em>and agreements <em>necessary or incidental to the performance of its duties </em>and the execution of its powers under this subtitle, employ consulting engineers, architects, attorneys, construction and financial ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>perts, and other employees and agents, and determine their compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxD\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The Board also has, pursuant to \u00a7 4 \u2014 303(d)(2), the power to \u201cadopt rules and regulations and prescribe policies and procedures for the management, maintenance, operation, and control of the Baltimore City Public School System.\u201d Section 4-310(a) also specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">Notwithstanding any provision of local law, <em>the Board shall adopt rules and regulations governing the procurement of goods and services </em>by the Baltimore City Public School System in accordance with \u00a7 5-112 of this article <em>{requiring competitive </em>bidding).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Of dispositive significance to the claim for professional services made by Alternatives in this case is the fact that on June 27, 2000, the Board, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 4-303(d)(2) and 4-310(a), promulgated a set of Procurement Policies and Procedures, including \u00a7 2-107(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">(2) <em>Professional Service Contracts </em>\u2014 $15,000 <em>or More: Professional Service Contracts in the amount of $15,000.00 or more, must be approved, in uniting, by the School Board. </em>Once a contract has been approved by the School Board, any proposed changes to the approved contract must be submitted to the School Board for its approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">(Emphasis supplied). Even without the benefit of a contract that had been approved by the Board, Alternatives nevertheless claimed that it was due $284,750 for professional services.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">The Dropout Prevention Program at Southern High School</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">Alternatives and Dr. Berger were fully familiar -with the controlling procurement procedures and requirements. On December 8, 1999, Alternatives had been one of eight firms submitting competitive bids for dropout prevention programs at six Baltimore City high schools. Alternatives submitted what was ultimately the winning bid for Southern High School <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>and on April 25, 2000, was awarded, by the Board, a contract to \u201cprovide a dropout prevention program at Southern\u201d for the remainder of the School Year 1999-2000. The contract amount was $76,207.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The Dropout Prevention Program was to provide a ninth grade educational program with remedial reading and math instruction, along with supportive counseling services, for 60 students then actually enrolled at Southern High School. The Dropout Prevention Program began at Southern on May 1, 2000, and operated during the spring, summer, and fall semesters of 2000. There is no quarrel with respect to the Dropout Prevention Program. Alternatives followed the prescribed procurement procedures and received the approval of the Board for a written contract for the amount of $76,207. For present purposes, Alternatives was demonstrably familiar with the Board\u2019s procurement procedures and requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Alternatives\u2019s Effort to Procure a Contract For a Different and Larger Program</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In June of 2000, Dr. Berger began to promote a different and significantly more expensive proposal. Dr. Berger believed that Alternatives\u2019s techniques for keeping \u201cat risk\u201d students from dropping out of school could also be successfully employed to entice students who had already dropped out to return to school. This case turns on the success or failure of Dr. Berger to \u201csell\u201d that different and more expensive proposal to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The heart of Alternatives\u2019s Complaint was that, through the agency of Ms. Russo, the Board\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Alternatives actually entered into an oral contract with the Board to implement (and that it did implement) a Drop-Back-In Program at an initially agreed upon cost to the Board of $250,000 (for 50 students). It later claimed, however, that the contract price had risen to $284,750 (for 67 students).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">On the basis of <em>Gontrum, </em>all of the counts (six of the nine) based on the existence of a contract were facially inadequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>to state a cause of action. Accordingly, Judge Glynn dismissed those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">While Defendants raised numerous contentions, they rely principally on <em>Gontrum v. Baltimore </em>which, in pertinent part, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">\u201cIt is a fundamental principal of law that all persons dealing with the agent of a municipal corporation are bound to ascertain the nature and extent of his authority. <em>A municipal corporation is not bound by a contract made in its name by one of its officers </em>or by a person it employs, although within the scope of its corporate powers, <em>if the officer </em>or employee <em>had no authority to enter into such a contract on behalf of the corporation.\u201d </em>182 Md. at 375, 35 A.2d 128</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The rationale for this policy is that, <em>\u201cit seems mare reasonable that an individual should occasionally suffer from mistakes of public agents and officials, than to adopt a rule, which, through improper combinations and collusion, might be turned to the detriment and injury of the public.\u201d </em>182 Md. at 130-31, 32 A.2d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The School Board argues that the rule in <em>Gontrum </em>is a rigid rule consistently followed by Maryland courts, which permits no exception. Since <em>it is undisputed that the School Board never properly approved or ratified Plaintiffs contract pursuant to its own rules, </em>it is of no consequence that the School Board\u2019s agents may have made statements to the contrary and provided assurances to the Plaintiff for the purpose of causing them to continue to provide services for which the School Board refused and still refuses to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The rule in <em>Gontrum </em>is harsh. Nonetheless, it must be applied in fact situations that are consistent with its rationale. <em>The rationale of Gontrum is based upon the public policy of protecting the municipality from the inappropriate acts or mistakes of its agents.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">For separate reasons, later to be discussed, Judge Glynn also dismissed a count under which Alternatives demanded an Accounting by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>The Two Remaining Counts And Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Judge Glynn did not dismiss the two counts against the Board alleging 1) <em>quantum meruit </em>and 2) unjust enrichment. At a subsequent hearing on the Board\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, Judge Allison did grant summary judgment in favor of the Board on both of those counts, also on the authority of <em>Gontrum. </em>Her rulings, however, were not based solely on the facial inadequacy of the counts. At the summary judgment stage, there is the additional consideration of whether there is any proffered evidentiary support for the claims. Accordingly, our scope of review is broader in looking at a grant of summary judgment than it is when evaluating a dismissal. The context for that evidentiary review, however, was still framed by the Complaint filed by Alternatives against the Board and its agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">If our discussion of the inadequacy of Alternatives\u2019s case with respect to quantum meruit and unjust enrichment wanders at times beyond the range of Judge Allison\u2019s literal reason for granting summary judgment, our response is that so many elusive theories and ever shifting concepts have been intertwined in Alternatives\u2019s arguments that the resolution of even a narrow issue would be largely unintelligible without an appreciation of the bigger picture. In <em>Francis O. Day Co., Inc. v. Montgomery County, </em>102 Md.App. 514, 517, 650 A.2d 303 (1994), Judge Cathell, after deciding that case on a narrower ground, felt similarly behooved to set the larger stage.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">While we shall resolve the issue presented in our discussion of the granting of the summary judgment, <em>we cannot help noting that, even if appellant had mode it past the summary judgment motion, the problems it would then have faced on an unjust enrichment claim would appear to be insurmountable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">A Treacherous Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">We cite several examples of why Alternatives\u2019s recitation of the facts must be approached with extreme wariness. In its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>First Amended Complaint, Alternatives alleged 1) that it had prepared \u201ca proposal\u201d and 2) that Ms. Russo \u201cgave the go-ahead for its implementation.\u201d It submitted with its complaint a five-page printed \u201cproposal,\u201d which it referred to as \u201cExhibit 2.\u201d Although Alternatives, in its various arguments, regularly referred to this \u201cExhibit 2\u201d for the details of the alleged \u201cproposal\u201d made by it to the school system, there is not the slightest indication 1) as to when this \u201cproposal\u201d was ever written or 2) that it was ever submitted to or read by anyone. There is nothing in the depositions or the affidavits of either Ms. Russo or Dr. Morgan to suggest that either of them ever had this five-page document submitted to them. In neither his deposition nor his affidavit did Dr. Berger suggest that he ever submitted such a document either to Ms. Russo or to Dr. Morgan. From everything that we can discern, \u201cExhibit 2,\u201d as evidence for the content of the \u201cproposal\u201d made by Dr. Berger to the school authorities, has no basis for being referred to in brief or argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The Complaint filed by Alternatives is rife with such bald allegations for which we can find no support in any of the depositions, documents, or affidavits. Although Alternatives was the initiating party for its Drop-Back-In Program at all times, the Complaint has disingenuously \u201cflipped\u201d the use of active and passive voices, as it refers to the Baltimore City Public School System as having \u201cmade an offer\u201d and Alternatives as having merely \u201caccepted the offer by initiating the Drop Back In Program.\u201d Although school authorities may have, at the request of Alternatives, given Alternatives the names of drop-outs, there is no indication that \u201cprospective students were <em>referred </em>to the program by various officials of BCPSS\u201d or that school authorities provided Alternatives with \u201cstaff liaisons to help with student recruitment.\u201d Nor do we find any evidentiary support for the allegation that Alternatives \u201cwas assured by officials of BCPSS that Board\u2019s approval was a mere formality, and that the Drop Back In Program should proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>At the hearing on the Board\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, Judge Allison was insistent, as are we, as to precisely what the evidence would be to support so bold an allegation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">THE COURT: Mr. Cohen, in paragraph 37 of your amended complaint, you say that the plaintiff expressed concern that its existing contract for providing a dropout prevention program had not been formally modified to include the drop back in program and that the Board had not approved a new contract specifically authorizing the drop back in program. However, when these concerns were raised, <em>Russo and her designees made representations to AU that the Board\u2019s approval was a mere formality and that the drop back in program should proceed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">\n<em>Do you have evidence of that?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">After counsel referred to Dr. Berger\u2019s and Dr. Morgan\u2019s depositions, Judge Allison bore in.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">THE COURT: All right. I\u2019m going to take you back to that paragraph 37. I got distracted. <em>You responded to my question by saying that both Doctor Berger and Doctor Morgan testified </em>as to the allegation here that statements were made <em>that the Board\u2019s approval was a mere formality.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\n<em>Can you tell me exactly where Doctor Berger testifies to that and where Doctor Morgan testifies to that?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">(Emphasis supplied). After some equivocation, counsel for Alternatives backed down, \u201cI apologize if I misspoke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKA\">Alternatives claimed that it \u201crecruited and provided educational services for 67 students at Southern High School from September 25, 2000 to December 1, 2000, and at Our Lady of Good Counsel Church School from December 4, 2000 to May 25, 2001.\u201d It alleged, without proffering any supporting evidence, that its educational efforts had caused the Baltimore City School System to receive from the State of Maryland the sum of $284,750. Alternatives alleged, as the modality for that financial benefit to the School System, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK2\">[d]uring the eight months that AU educated students at the Baltimore Transitional Learning Academy, BCPSS submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ted to the State of Maryland enrollment figures reflecting the number of students there in attendance and received per pupil allocations for these retrieved students. AU did not receive any part of these per pupil allocations, nor was AU otherwise compensated for retrieving and educating these at risk students who, but for AU\u2019s efforts, would not have returned to school.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">There was no evidence proffered to suggest, however, 1) how many, if any, students who had dropped out re-enrolled in school; 2) what arrangement, if any, existed between the State and the City for payment for such \u201cretrievals;\u201d or 8) what, if any, monies were ever paid by the State to the Baltimore City School System. These are simply unsupported allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Although cunningly clever in its phraseology, the First Amended Complaint was treacherously misleading in terms of which party actually took the initiative. It may have been \u201csoon apparent\u201d to Dr. Berger that Alternatives\u2019s \u201ctechnique\u201d could be expanded into a bigger and more lucrative contract, but Paragraph 6 of the Complaint presented an unrealistic mirror image of who proposed and who, at most, responded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHI\"><em>It was soon apparent to BCPSS that AU\u2019s techniques </em>for keeping at risk students from dropping out of school <em>could also be successfully employed to entice back to school students who had already dropped out. Discussions ensued </em>between AU and officials of BCPSS, including Dr. Betty Morgan, BCPSS\u2019s Chief Academic Officer, <em>to expand the program, </em>to high school dropouts. <em>A proposal was prepared </em>and, shortly after her arrival in Baltimore, <em>Russo gave the go-ahead for its implementation. A copy of the proposal is attached </em>and incorporated herein as Exhibit 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArP\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">That entire paragraph was deceptive in the extreme. The proposal now in issue was a new and different program, three and one-half times as expensive as the Board-approved Dropout Prevention Program. It was not a mere proposal \u201cto expand the [preexisting] the program.\u201d The last two sentences of the paragraph, in combination, state a proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>that is ingeniously misleading. The last sentence unequivocally pins down \u201cthe proposal\u201d as being the five-page document, of unknown provenance, that appears in the appellant\u2019s pleadings as \u201cExhibit 2.\u201d The immediately preceding sentence sends the unmistakable message that that five-page document, which Ms. Russo never saw or even had described to her, had actually been reviewed and expressly approved by her. Within two sentences, the objective referent of the word \u201cproposal\u201d shifted dramatically, without a hint of the shift being given to the unwary reader, the unwary trial judge, or the unwary appellate court. Neither we nor the trial judge should be required to negotiate such a linguistic minefield.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The point is that even as we set out the narrative backdrop for Judge Allison\u2019s granting of summary judgment, this pattern by Alternatives of jerry-building a case with the aid of smoke and mirrors inevitably colors our appraisal. Every arguable factual inference is being stretched to, if not beyond, its limits, and then strained inferences are piled on top of strained inferences. Our \u201cfeel\u201d for the case is not, of course, legally dispositive. Nevertheless, with respect to issues that are right on the cusp, it might, subliminally, influence the tilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Dr. Berger, Ms. Russo, and Dr. Morgan</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Alternatives\u2019s case with respect to <em>quantum meruit </em>and unjust enrichment depends 1) upon Dr. Berger\u2019s interactions with both Ms. Russo and Dr. Morgan; 2) upon their alleged representations to him; and 3) upon his alleged reliance thereon. The case against the Board is essentially based upon the proposition that Ms. Russo, the Board\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, reviewed the Drop-Back-In proposal and then gave the \u201cgo-ahead\u201d for its implementation. Critically heavy weight is being placed on an exceedingly fragile predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">A. The First Meeting of Dr. Berger with Ms. Russo Was a Nullity</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Dr. Berger and Ms. Russo only met with each other, or even so much as talked with each other, on two very brief occasions. The first such occasion was a 15-minute courtesy call by Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Berger shortly after Ms. Russo first arrived in Baltimore as the Board\u2019s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer. That courtesy call, on June 28, 2000, actually took place before Ms. Russo officially assumed office. Dr. Berger, in his deposition, recalled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">A. I don\u2019t believe Ms. Russo was actually in office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">Q. When do you believe she took office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">A. I believe August l.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">Q. So your first meeting with Ms. Russo took place before she was the chief executive officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">A. I believe that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">Dr. Berger described the purpose of his meeting with Ms. Russo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">Q. <em>What was the purpose of the meeting?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">A. <em>To meet her, welcome her to Maryland, and tell her what AU was doing and what we would continue to do. </em>Q. What did you tell her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">A. About the politics of Maryland and about the program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">Dr. Berger characterized Ms. Russo\u2019s responses as nothing more than diplomatically pleasant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-15\">Q. <em>What did Ms. Russo say to you?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-16\">\n<em>A. Sounds good to her, what every superintendent says.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-17\"><em>A. I believe she just said, sounds like these are good programs. It was a very general conversation. Certainly at that point she was not giving us any commitment. </em>She said \u201csounds interesting to me; work with Dr. Morgan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdN\">Q. How long did the meeting last?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>A. About 15 minutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Ms. Russo similarly described the general nature of that meeting with Dr. Berger.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">A. First of all, it was a get to know each other. I was new in town. He told me that he had a program at Southern with the Board, a dropout prevention. <em>It was just general, you know, conversation about what he would like to do in the future.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">And <em>my response was, \u201cDelightful getting to know you. </em>\u201d I\u2019m only here four weeks, and, you know, I\u2019m sure we will be discussing this with the staff. Of course, I did say to him I was always interested in dropout prevention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Ms. Russo confirmed that she was not yet making decisions about anything.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-10\">I was only there four weeks. I wouldn\u2019t have been making decisions that early. As I said, it was a getting-to-know-you kind of thing. He told me a lot about his history in Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">Ms. Russo thought that the conversation touched the subject of the already existing Drop Out Prevention Program, but she made no mention of a new Drop-Back-In program.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-12\">A. In conversation, I\u2019m sure he mentioned it. To be honest with you, it was a whirlwind, my first month. I don\u2019t remember specifically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-13\">Q. You don\u2019t have any specific recollection about those programs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-14\">A. No. We talked about dropout in general. And, of course, he mentioned that he was at Southern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-15\">Q. He mentioned he had a program already at Southern?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-16\">A. Yes. He mentioned that he had a program, but I don\u2019t remember the specifics of the conversation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-17\">Ms. Russo was simply generally upbeat about the subject of dropout prevention.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>And I, basically, like I said, I\u2019m interested in dropout prevention. So <em>from my perspective, I would tell anybody the same thing, I\u2019m always interested in pursuing those kinds of ideas to see if they are worthy. It was on that note and it was that kind of conversation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In June of 2000, moreover, Dr. Berger was fully aware that Alternatives\u2019s Drop-Back-In Program needed nothing less than the official approval of the Board.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">Q. Is it your testimony that <em>in June of 2000 you knew you needed Board approval for the Drop-Back-In Program?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">A. <em>Sure.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">It is transparently clear that that first meeting between Dr. Berger and Ms. Russo provides no factual basis for any obligation by the Board to Alternatives, even assuming that Ms. Russo had the authority to bind the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">B. The Second \u201cMeeting\u201d With Ms. Russo Was Both Negligible and Vague</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Even assuming an authority in Ms. Russo to bind the Board to the expenditure of public funds in excess of $15,000, Alternatives\u2019s case as to the exercise of that authority consists of two words ostensibly uttered by her as she looked in briefly on a meeting that Dr. Berger was having with Dr. Morgan and several others. Dr. Berger characterized his \u201csecond meeting\u201d with Ms. Russo.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\">Q. When was your second meeting with her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-13\">A. It was not actually with her per se.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">He testified that Dr. Morgan \u201chad convened a group to decide what to do about how to continue this Southern [High School] program.\u201d This possible extension of the existing Drop Out Preventive Program, of course, is not the subject matter of the present case. Dr. Berger, however, then slips in the subject matter of the present case by characterizing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>meeting as one called for the dual purpose of deciding \u201chow to continue\u201d the existing Drop Out Prevention Program and how to \u201cmorph it into this Drop-Back-In.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Persistently, Dr. Berger refers to the distinct Drop-Back-In proposal, notwithstanding its quarter of a million dollar price tag, not as a separate contractual undertaking but as a mere modification of an existing program, as something that the existing program might \u201cmorph\u201d into. The new program was not only different in character from the preexisting program, but, in terms of cost, the \u201cmorphed\u201d product was over three times bigger than the \u201cpre-morph\u201d original. It is a classic instance of getting the nose of the camel under the tent and then casually discussing the entire camel as if everyone took its presence in the tent for granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Dr. Berger narrated how Dr. Morgan called Ms. Russo briefly into the meeting, so briefly that she did not even take a seat.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">Q. Can we call this the second meeting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">A. The second meeting, and we\u2019re trying to finalize this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">Q. Finalize what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">A. <em>Morph in the Southern program and the Drop-Back-In. </em>And Dr. Morgan says, \u201cI\u2019m nervous about doing this all by my myself.\u201d <em>So she goes and gets Ms. Russo. </em>Ms. Russo comes in, and I remember this like it was yesterday. <em>Ms. Russo was standing there. </em>Dr. Morgan explains the program to her, and <em>she says, \u201cI already said when I met with Stuart that it sounded good to me; do it. </em>\u201d No question; that\u2019s what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">Q. What did you understand, \u201cDo it\u201d to mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">A. Implement the program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">Although she had, according to Dr. Berger\u2019s interpretation of what \u201cDo it\u201d meant, given her official approval for the implementation of a totally new, $250,000 project, without Board approval, Ms. Russo herself had no recollection whatsoever of the incident.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Q. Do you recall a meeting in August of 2000 at the offices of the school system in which Betty Morgan, Doctor Berger, and other members of the school system were present?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\">A. No, I really don\u2019t. <em>I don\u2019t know if I was there or not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">Q. Do you recall Doctor Morgan coming out to get you when Doctor Berger was there in a meeting and you coming into a conference room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">A. She might have, but <em>I don\u2019t remember.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">Q. <em>You have no recollection of that meeting ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">\n<em>A. No, I really don\u2019t.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Even accepting Dr. Berger\u2019s version of that second \u201cmeeting,\u201d as we must on summary judgment review, even that version does not indicate whether \u201cthe program\u201d that Dr. Morgan \u201cexplained\u201d to Ms. Russo was the preexisting Drop Out Prevention program, the new Drop-Back-In proposal, or a \u201cmorphing\u201d of both. Even assuming that \u201cDo it\u201d meant \u201cImplement the program\u201d and even assuming that the \u201cprogram\u201d was the new Drop-Back-In proposal, there was still no basis for concluding that \u201cImplement\u201d meant \u201cPut a $250,000 program into full operation on my authority without Board approval\u201d rather than meaning \u201cGo ahead and, following standard procedure, prepare a proposal for formal submission to the Board for its consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">Dr. Berger acknowledged that the procedural implications of implementation were never discussed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-12\">Q. Did you understand it to mean, \u201cProceed with the program in the absence of School Board approval\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-13\">A. I didn\u2019t think School Board approval at that point\u2014 that anybody cared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-14\">Q. <em>Did you ever discuss School Board approval with Ms. Russo?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-15\">\n<em>A. Not with Ms. Russo, no.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-16\">Q. <em>Did you ever discuss the need for a written contract with Ms. Russo?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>A. <em>Absolutely not.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Dr. Berger was fully aware of the Board\u2019s procurement policy and he readily acknowledged that Alternatives \u201cdidn\u2019t expect to get paid until [the proposal] was approved by the Board.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">Q. Did anyone ever tell you that a contract cannot be paid until it is approved by the Board?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">A. I knew that. <em>We didn\u2019t expect to get paid until it was approved by the Board.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">Q. What was the basis of your expectation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">A. To be paid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">Q. <em>Why did you believe you needed to have Board approval to get paid?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">A. <em>Because I knew it. There was [no] question in my mind, based on my experience in Maryland. There\u2019s no question. </em>That\u2019s not our argument that we didn\u2019t need the Board\u2019s approval some time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">Alternatives\u2019s case is, in the last analysis, one against the Board. It is based upon the authority of Ms. Russo, actual or apparent, to take action and to obligate the Board to pay for that action. The premise that Ms. Russo took such an action is based upon the inference that Ms. Russo made representations on which Dr. Berger relied. Dr. Berger acknowledged that the sum total of his interaction with Ms. Russo consisted only of the two \u201cmeetings\u201d that we have just discussed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-14\">Q. <em>Have we now described every personal conversation you had with Ms. Russo concerning the Drop-Back-In Program?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-15\">\n<em>A. Yes.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-16\">Q. Have you had any other personal discussions with Ms. Russo about any issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>A. <em>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen the woman, except for those two times.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">C. Dr. Berger and Dr. Morgan Never Discussed Any Contractual Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The only substantive discussion that Dr. Berger ever had with respect to his Drop-Back-In proposal was with Dr. Morgan, the Chief Academic Officer. In neither his affidavit nor his deposition did Dr. Berger ever allege that Dr. Morgan ever gave him any kind of approval to go forward with a program that would entitle him to any payment from the Baltimore City School System. Alternatives, by way of punctiliously careful wording, does not allege that Dr. Morgan, as Chief Academic Officer, ever \u201capproved\u201d the proposal for a Drop-Back-In program on behalf of Ms. Russo, the Chief Executive Officer. The allegation is simply that Dr. Morgan \u201cimplemented\u201d the proposal which Ms. Russo had \u201capproved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The only source of information as to any discussion between Dr. Berger and Dr. Morgan was the October 14, 2002 deposition of Dr. Morgan herself. Dr. Morgan repeatedly stated that Dr. Berger was proposing a volunteered service that would not obligate the School System to pay him anything.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">What I perceived was that [Ms. Russo] understood, <em>we both understood that Stuart in a sense was bringing a gift to the school system, </em>which I guess in retrospect and hindsight didn\u2019t turn out to be much of a gift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">I think she understood and I understood that <em>no money was to be exchanged and that we were just going to give him space in the high school. </em>And I believed that is what was in her mind. But again, I can\u2019t say what was in her mind. I can only tell you how I perceived it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">As far as Dr. Morgan was concerned, no contract, with advance approval or retroactive approval, was ever contemplated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Q. Was it your understanding that the school board had to approve this contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\">A. Well, as far as I was concerned, <em>it wasn\u2019t a contract, because we weren\u2019t paying him any money. </em>I mean, we had tons of people who worked even a year in Washington County and Montgomery County. We had people in Baltimore City that came in. This is basically almost like you deal with a voluntary kind of service in the school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\"><em>You don\u2019t generally contract with somebody when no money is being exchanged. </em>My understanding at the time was we were just providing him space and a list of names.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Dr. Morgan repeated that no approval was required because \u201cno money was being exchanged.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">Q. Was <em>it your plan to ask the school board to approve this relationship?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">A. Oh, no. <em>No, I never saw it as a contract. </em>That is what I\u2019m trying to tell you. We had various groups over the years that use space in the school system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">I\u2019ll give you an example. There was a legal, you know, school safety and security group that was headed up by an attorney that was doing all kinds of safety and security stuff. His name escapes me right now. They were using a wing of the PDC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">\n<em>There were many groups that used parts of the building or a room in the building and they didn\u2019t have a contract, because no money was being exchanged.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-13\">The implementation provided by Dr. Morgan was minimal. I then asked him what he needed and he said the main thing that he was going to need was a list of students who had dropped out, and of course he needed the space in the school. He would take care of the rest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">From Dr. Morgan\u2019s point of view, the School System was under no obligation to pay Alternatives anything.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Q.

Because <em>we were just providing him, the space and a list of names. He absolutely told us that it was going to be at no cost to us. </em>I remember him saying to me very clearly, this is the best deal for Baltimore City and you\u2019re not taking advantage of it. <em>Because it is going to cost you not one dime, </em>he said, you\u2019ll be able to get kids to drop back in, lessening your dropout rate. <em>All you have to give me is some space and a list of names.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">D. The Tectonic Shift of February 26, 2001</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">At the very first mention by Dr. Berger to Dr. Morgan that he somehow expected the Board to advance monies to Alternatives, Dr. Morgan brought that unanticipated revelation to the immediate attention of Ms. Russo. Both Ms. Russo and Dr. Morgan promptly made it clear to Dr. Berger that the School System had never committed itself to \u201cpay\u201d Alternatives anything for the Drop Back In program. Dr. Morgan, in her deposition, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">Again, that seemed like a reasonable deal since supposedly initially it was not going to cost us anything. Stuart then went into the high school and set up shop to try to begin this program. I\u2019m not sure that it ever really got off the ground, <em>but he then came back to us and said look, I can\u2019t do this unless you front me some money.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\"><em>I went back to Carmen </em>and I said, Stuart says even though I understood and you understood that we weren\u2019t going to pay anything for this, in fact we were going to get money from it because of this 80/20 or 90/10 formula, <em>now he is saying that he needs the money fronted by the school system, </em>but we\u2019ll get it back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\"><em>Carmen said absolutely not. I went back to Stuart and I said, absolutely not, we can\u2019t do that. </em>I think that Stuart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>had already begun to mobilize. At the time I think he said that he had hired some people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">\n<em>I said, well, why did you do that? He said, well, because we are going to run this program. I said, but we never committed any money. I never told you we were going to give you any money.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Both Ms. Russo and Dr. Morgan unequivocally stated to Dr. Berger that he had been given no authority to hire people or to commit the School System to any expense whatsoever. In her deposition, Dr. Morgan stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">Q. Did you discuss with Ms. Russo the procurement of this contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">A. Never. Only after the fact. Only after Stuart came back and said look, I\u2019ve hired all these people and whatever. I think <em>both Carmen and I said he had no authority to do that.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">By way of a certified letter to Alternatives on February 26, 2001, Ms. Russo, on behalf of the Board, made the Board\u2019s position with respect to the proposed Drop-Back-In program absolutely clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">As you know, <em>the Drop Out Agreement for Southern High School, the Drop Out Agreement for Lake Clifton-Eastern High School, and the proposed Drop In Agreement for a retrieval program are three (3) separate and distinct transactions. </em>The Drop Out Agreement for Southern High School was approved by the School Board on April 25, 2000. The Drop Out Agreement for Lake Clifton-Eastern High School was approved by the School Board on February 29, 2000. Obviously, <em>the proposed Drop In Agreement for a retrieval program has never been approved by the School Board.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">After consulting with the BCPSS Office of Legal Counsel, the School Board and the BCPSS would like to clarify its position with respect to all three of these transactions. <em>For Southern High School, Alternatives Unlimited will not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>receive any additional funding or compensation. </em>In accordance with Paragraph 6 of the Agreement, <em>the total amount of compensation will not exceed $76,207.00. Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, Chief Academic Officer, has no authority to increase the amount of compensation for any BCPSS Agreement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">\n<em>For the Drop In or retrieval program, no Agreement will be presented or approved by the School Board. If Alternatives Unlimited is still providing this program to students enrolled in the BCPSS, all operations and programs should be terminated immediately.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">As soon as possible, <em>please forward a detailed summary of the services provided by Alternatives Unlimited in operating a Drop In or retrieval program. </em>Provide the dates and locations that such services were rendered; provide an explanation on how these services were initiated; provide an itemization of the expenses incurred; identify the BCPSS enrolled students, including their home addresses and ages; and provide daily attendance reports and any other supporting documentation. This information should be sent to Mr. Dixon Waxter, Associate Counsel, BCPSS Office of Legal Counsel, Room 208, 200 East North Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21202. <em>The appropriate school system personnel will review this documentation and make a personal recommendation to me regarding the value of such services. Any amount that exceeds $15,000 will require the approval of the School Board.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">A follow-up letter, on March 23, to legal counsel for Alternatives from the Office of Legal Counsel of the Baltimore City Public School System stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">As indicated in Ms. Russo\u2019s letter, dated February 26, 2001, <em>all services of the \u201cDrop In\u201d or \u201cDrop Back In\u201d program provided by Alternatives Unlimited, Inc. should have </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>ceased, and terminated as of the date of Mr. Baldwin\u2019s receipt of the letter.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">To reiterate, the School Board must approve any contract involving a payment amount equal to or exceeding $15,000. <em>Agency principles cannot and will not be applied to circumvent the long-standing procurement policy of the BCPSS. </em>As <em>a result of the prior interaction of Alternatives Unlimited and the BCPSS, </em>referred to in your letter, <em>Alternatives Unlimited had actual notice of this procurement policy and the School Board\u2019s absolute and sole authority to enter into and commit the BCPSS to contracts of $15,000 or more.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">In a letter of April 17, counsel for the Board reiterated to counsel for Alternatives:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">After consulting with Ms. Russo, <em>the position of the </em>New Baltimore City <em>Board of School Commissioners </em>(\u201cSchool Board\u201d) and the Baltimore City Public School System (\u201cBCPSS\u201d) <em>has not changed. The BCPSS has no interest in continuing the \u201cDrop In\u201d program with Alternatives Unlimited, Inc. for this academic year or the next academic year.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">In a final letter to counsel for Alternatives on May 9, counsel for the Board again made clear the Board\u2019s practice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq_\"><em>These Drop In services were never authorized and never approved by the School Board. </em>However, the School Board is prepared to evaluate the services rendered and the value of such services. Again, <em>any amount exceeding $15,000 would require the approval of the School Board.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Quantum Meruit And/Or Unjust Enrichment: One Claim or Two?</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">What then, at the summary judgment stage and on the basis of the undisputed evidence, was the viability of Alterna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>tives\u2019s counts charging 1) quantum meruit and 2) unjust enrichment, the two counts against the Board that had survived earlier dismissal at the hands of Judge Glynn? We will, for the reasons just discussed, assess that viability in the more limited time frame of the actions of the parties prior to February 26, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Before making even that truncated assessment, however, we need to situate our inquiry on an identifiable legal grid. With quantum meruit and unjust enrichment, are we, at least in this case, really addressing two separate causes of action or simply two ways of labeling the same cause of action? Are these, perhaps, only two ways of measuring recovery for a single cause of action? Are quantum meruit and unjust enrichment claims sounding in contract or in tort or in something, more amorphous, in between? Are we talking about remedies that once would have been considered equitable remedies or remedies at law? Does it make any difference? Although there are a lot of legal arguments floating about in the surrounding waters, we will not begin to plot our course until our legal longitude and legal latitude have been more firmly and comfortably established.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The ultimate question, of course, will be whether these two remaining counts were not just as surely foreclosed by the rationale of <em>Gontrum v. Baltimore, </em>182 Md. 370, 35 A.2d 128 (1943), as were the other counts earlier dismissed by Judge Glynn on the basis of <em>Gontrum. </em>Judge Allison ruled unequivocally that those two counts could not survive the foreclosing effect of <em>Gontrum.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">With respect to counts five and six, quantum meruit and unjust enrichment as to the Board, this is perhaps the toughest question because if the defendant were a private party, this court would not be granting summary judgment on these two counts. However, <em>the defendant is not a private party, and it\u2019s the finding of this court that these counts cannot survive the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis in Gontrum v. Baltimore, </em>182 Md. 370, 35 A.2d 128 (1943).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number><em>Employees through words or deeds don\u2019t make enforceable contracts for the Board. Not only does the law impute that knowledge to the plaintiff, but Doctor Berger here, </em>acting for the plaintiff, <em>acknowledged he knew the rule. </em>And <em>even if he hadn\u2019t acknowledged it, his course of conduct </em>with respect to three prior contracts with the school system <em>would have been evidence of actual knowledge on his part in any event. </em>So for this reason, the court finds that summary judgment on counts five and six as to the Board is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The Third World of Restitution</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">As we seek to fix our legal latitude and longitude, we note that it was in <em>Mass Transit Administration v. Granite Construction Co., </em>57 Md.App. 766, 774, 471 A.2d 1121 (1984), that this Court, speaking through Judge Bloom, first used the term \u201cthe restitutionary remedies.\u201d That is the sea into which we shall be sailing. The conceptualization of restitution as an autonomous subject of legal analysis, as something overlapping the edges of both contract and tort but also filling some empty space between the two, is a relatively recent phenomenon. In I George E. Palmer, <em>The Law of Restitution </em>(1978), pp. 1-2, Professor Palmer discusses the subject\u2019s recent provenance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">It has been traditional to regard tort and contract as the two principal sources of civil liability at common law, although liability arising out of a fiduciary relationship has developed largely outside these two great categories. <em>There is another category that must be separated from all of these; this is liability based in unjust enrichment. </em>In particularized form this has been a part of our law from an early time, but <em>it has been slow to emerge as a general theory. </em>In present American law, however, the idea of unjust enrichment has been generally accepted and widely applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\"><em>Restitution based upon unjust enrichment cuts across many branches of the law, </em>including contract, tort, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>fiduciary relationship, <em>but it also occupies much territory that is its sole preserve.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><em>Palmer </em>acknowledges, p. 2 n. 3, the trailblazing impact of the <em>Restatement of Restitution </em>in furthering the recognition of restitution as an autonomous subject of legal analysis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">The most important modern contribution to the organization and development of American law is the <em>Restatement of Restitution </em>(1937).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">See also Dawson, <em>Unjust Enrichment </em>(1951), the \u201coutstanding contribution of a more recent time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Saul Levmore, \u201cExplaining Restitution,\u201d 71 <em>Vir. L.Rev. </em>65, 67 (1985), also describes how restitution has come to fill the borderland between contract and tort.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">Restitution occupies the crucial ground between its much-studied neighbors, tort and contract. Restitution deals with nonbargained benefits; tort law with nonbargained harms; contract law with bargained benefits and harms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Our conceptualization of restitutionary law is nonetheless still in a state of flux. Much geriatric language and many now creaking concepts still clutter the caselaw. The very presence of a quantum meruit count in this case, as something ostensibly separate from an unjust enrichment count, may represent nothing more than the reluctance to throw off obsolete linguistic shackles. 1 Dan B. Dobbs, <em>Law of Remedies </em>(2d ed.1993), \u00a7 4.1(3) \u201cIntroducing the Procedural and Terminological Side of Restitution,\u201d p. 564, well describes the recent conceptual and linguistic evolution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\"><em>At one time the legal profession did not understand restitution to be a general legal topic at all. </em>What we now call restitution was pursued through a whole host of actions, each of which was adapted to a single factual situation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>These actions </em>were often thought of as \u201cremedies\u201d rather than theories for a claim. They <em>went under a splendid variety of names like </em>Money Had and Received, Money Paid, Money Lent, <em>Quantum Meruit and many others. Earlier lawyers thought of these narrow actions as essentially unrelated.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\"><em>These same kinds of claims are now perceived to be merely subsets of restitution. The modem view is that unjust enrichment is a unifying principle for all such cases and restitution is the award made to vindicate that principle. </em>Restitution today is applied both in cases that used to be brought at law and those that used to be brought in equity. The unity of the subject matter is now reflected in part by Professor Palmer\u2019s four-volume treatise of classic dimensions and by the collection of many restitution cases under the topic of Implied and Constructive Contracts in the West Digests. Even so, <em>the history of restitution </em>as a collection of insular and unrelated dooms or procedures <em>is also still apparent in the diverse locutions of the courts.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The Restitutionary Remedies As Designed To Prevent Unjust Enrichment</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">When we enter the world of restitutionary remedies, we have arrived in the land of unjust enrichment. The restitutionary remedies and unjust enrichment are simply flip sides of the same coin. The generative purpose of a restitutionary remedy is the prevention of unjust enrichment. As Judge Salmon observed in <em>Mogavero v. Silverstein, </em>142 Md. App. 259, 276, 790 A.2d 43 (2002), \u201cRestitution ... is referred to as an action for unjust enrichment.\u201d In <em>Berry and Gould v. Berry, </em>360 Md. 142, 151, 757 A.2d 108 (2000), the Court of Appeals stated the general principle of unjust enrichment to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>A person who receives a benefit by reason of an infringement of another person\u2019s interest, or of loss suffered by the other, owes <em>restitution </em>to him in the manner and amount necessary <em>to prevent unjust enrichment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The core principle which <em>Restatement of Restitution </em>takes as its point of departure is set forth in its opening section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2D\">\u00a7 1. UNJUST ENRICHMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">A person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution to the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOJ\"><em>Restatement, </em>p. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The symbiotic relationship between restitution and unjust enrichment is also stressed in 1 Dan B. Dobbs, <em>Law of Remedies </em>(2d ed.1993), \u00a7 4.1 \u201cRestitution and Unjust Enrichment,\u201d pp. 551-52:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">Restitution is a simple word but a difficult subject, partly because restitutionary ideas appear in many guises. <em>In spite of their diversity, restitution claims are hound by a major unifying thread. Their purpose is to prevent the defendant\u2019s unjust enrichment </em>by recapturing the gains the defendant secured in a transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">(Emphasis supplied). <em>Dobbs </em>goes on, p. 557:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\"><em>The fundamental substantive basis for restitution is that the defendant has been unjustly enriched </em>by receiving something, tangible or intangible, that properly belongs to the plaintiff. <em>Restitution rectifies unjust enrichment </em>by forcing restoration to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">In explaining the law\u2019s reluctance to permit instances of unjust enrichment, John P. Dawson, \u201cThe Self-Serving Intermeddler,\u201d 87 <em>Ham L.Rev. </em>1409, 1411 (1974), traces back to the Book of Matthew the belief that men \u201cshould not reap where they have not sown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">For analytic purposes, <em>Dobbs, </em>pp. 558-62, divides unjust enrichment cases into four general categories, one of which concerns us here. If, <em>arguendo, </em>the Board in this case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the beneficiary of any unjust enrichment, it clearly would have been of the type that <em>Dobbs </em>describes, pp. 559-60, as \u201cGroup 4 Cases,\u201d cases in which the benefit to the Board came in the form of \u201cservices without misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\"><em>Benefits to defendant from money or services without misconduct </em>\u2014 Mistakes <em>and other disruptions in contracting. </em>Not all unjust enrichment turns on tort, on tangible property, or on contract breach. Sometimes a plaintiff confers a benefit upon a defendant wholly apart from any breach of substantive duty. <em>Parties attempting to enter a contract may be mistaken in their underlying assumptions about the subject matter of that contract, or they may be faced with new conditions they never intended to contract about. </em>When the mistakes or new conditions become apparent, the best solution may be to call off the deal because it is not really the deal the parties attempted to make----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\"><em>Benefits conferred without mistake or contract. Cases of attempted contract often illustrate the Group U category, </em>but contract is not an essential ingredient. <em>What is essential is that the defendant receives a benefit without fault or breach of duty on his part, yet is at least arguably under a duty to give up that benefit on the ground that othe'twise he will be unjustly enriched.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Equity: A False Light on the Shore</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Judge Allison granted summary judgment against Alternatives on the counts charging quantum meruit and unjust enrichment on the ground that the foreclosing effect of <em>Gontrum </em>applied as surely to them as to the counts based squarely on contract. Alternatives now argues that Judge Allison was in error in \u201cnot distinguishing between [its] legal and equitable claims.\u201d It argues that she \u201cimproperly applied the ruling in <em>Gontrum </em>... to causes of action which sound in equity.\u201d Alternatives asserts, quite accurately but unremarkably, that \u201cwhether the plaintiff might prevail under equitable remedies such as quantum meruit and unjust enrichment is never addressed in <em>Gontrum.\u201d </em>Indeed, it was not; those counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>were simply not before the Court in that case. All that means, of course, is that <em>Gontrum </em>squarely answered neither \u201cYes\u201d nor \u201cNo\u201d to the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">A. A Flawed Minor Premise: Quantum Meruit and Unjust Enrichment Are Not Equitable Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">What Alternatives seeks to do, by invoking the mantra of equity, is to beguile us by a false light on the shore. Quite aside from the distinct question of whether the foreclosing effect of <em>Gontrum </em>applies to equitable remedies (the major premise), Alternatives has abjectly failed to establish that quantum meruit and unjust enrichment, at least under the circumstances of this case, are actually equitable remedies (the necessary minor premise). It baldly asserts the proposition, but it offers no recognized legal support for it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The snare in which Alternatives would entrap us is a semantic one. Its argument is that if ever the caselaw uses the adjective \u201cequitable\u201d (or such synonyms as \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cjust\u201d), it necessarily is mandating that the form of relief shall be an \u201cequitable remedy\u201d as traditionally developed by the courts of equity and with all of the procedural \u201crights, honors, and privileges thereto appertaining.\u201d \u201cEquity,\u201d however, is too protean a word to be thus pinned down. The word \u201cequity\u201d (with its full grammatical paradigm) sometimes has a broadly diluted descriptive usage that ranges far beyond its more limited employment as a jurisdictional term of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\"><em>Dobbs, </em>\u00a7 2.1(3) \u201cMeanings of Equity,\u201d pp. 65-66, discusses the various definitions of the adjective \u201cequitable\u201d and the shifting legal significance of those respective definitions. In the broadest sense, almost every legal principle is based on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>being \u201cequitable\u201d in the sense that the law, whenever it reasonably can, seeks a result that is fair and just.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\"><em>Equitable in the sense of fair, moral, or just. When the term \u201cequitable\u201d is used only to describe the moral basis of a claim or defense, the conclusion that the claim is equitable has no necessary legal effect on the remedy or on the procedure. </em>Take this sentence: \u201cThe defendant stole the plaintiffs watch, worth only $10, but the defendant sold it for $100; it is only just and equitable that the defendant pay the plaintiff the $100. Good conscience demands it.\u201d In these sentences, the writer is stating a substantive ground for relief. He is not addressing the remedy. In fact, in such cases as those described in this sentence, the plaintiff can simply sue for the money ($100) and recover it \u201cat law,\u201d with a jury trial if he wishes. <em>It is not wrong to say that such a claim is \u201cequitable,\u201d but it is equitable only in a very limited way: it appeals to \u201cthe equities, \u201d the sense of justice. It does not necessarily involve equity remedies, equitable defenses, or equitable procedures </em>like the non-jury trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 65 (emphasis supplied). When a word says everything, it says nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Contrasted with that that sweeping and essentially cliched meaning of \u201cequitable\u201d is \u201cequitable\u201d as it more carefully distinguishes an \u201cequitable remedy\u201d from a \u201clegal remedy,\u201d each with its own attendant procedures and consequences.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\"><em>Equitable in the sense that an equitable remedy is sought. </em>In contrast to the substantive uses of the term \u201cequitable,\u201d <em>courts and lawyers often use the term much more precisely to mean that the plaintiff has sought an equitable remedy, usually one involving coercive elements. </em>When that is the case, there are two major legal effects of concluding that the case, claim or remedy is equitable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">First, when the plaintiff asserts an equitable remedy, equitable defenses can be invoked even if they could not be invoked against a \u201clegal\u201d claim. More broadly, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>will feel free to exercise discretion in denying the remedy and, if she grants it, in shaping the remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">Second, subject to an important exception, if the plaintiff claims an equitable remedy, then neither party has a right to a jury trial.

The plaintiff Gontrum, even more than Alternatives in this case, claimed that his enrichment of the City \u201cwas in reliance upon these representations\u201d by the Land Surveyor and the assistant city solicitor. 182 Md. at 374, 35 A.2d 128. \u201c[Rjelief is sought on the ground that these representations amount to constructive fraud.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The observations of the Court of Appeals, in affirming the pretrial dismissal of the complaint, are equally pertinent to Alternatives\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">[M]ere expressions of opinion about what will occur in the future, do not constitute fraud even though they turn out to be false, at least where they are not made with intent to deceive, and where the parties have equal means of knowledge or the subject is equally open to the investigation of both, and an examination has not been fraudulently prevented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">182 Md. at 374, 35 A.2d 128. Neither Ms. Russo nor Dr. Morgan made any representations to Dr. Berger that either of them possessed any authority to bind the Board to any expenditure of $15,000 or more. Even if, <em>arguendo, </em>they had, Dr. Berger, by his own acknowledgments, knew full well that that was not the case. He would have had no basis for relying on such representations even if, for the sake of argument, they had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Even in a case of proven unjust enrichment, not based upon an actual contract, express or implied, Maryland\u2019s deliberate policy decision to protect the public treasury from unauthorized expenditures will prevail over the interests of an aggrieved plaintiff. In <em>Mass Transit Administration v. Granite Construction Co., </em>57 Md.App. 766, 471 A.2d 1121 (1984), the specific doctrine that protected the governmental entity from the unauthorized entering into a contractual obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>gation by one of its employees was that of sovereign immunity. In this case the governmental entity is shielded from unauthorized financial obligations by the rule of <em>Gontrum. </em>The analogy between the two policy shields, however, is a close one, and we find it persuasive. What we said in <em>Mass Transit </em>with respect to sovereign immunity applies in this case with respect to <em>Gontrum. </em>It is a message, however, that Alternatives does not wish to hear.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Alternatives\u2019s Misperception Of <em>Gontrum\u2019s </em>Public Policy Pronouncement</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Permeating Alternatives\u2019s arguments as they appeal, genuinely or disingenuously, to equity is a complete misperception of <em>Gontrum\u2019s </em>basic teaching. It is as if Alternatives is in psychological denial as to the <em>Gontrum </em>statement of policy that the normal rules governing contractual relationships do not apply when one of the parties is a governmental entity. The appellee in this case is not Ms. Russo. Nor is it Dr. Morgan. The exclusive defendant-appellee is the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners. It is from that Board that Alternatives seeks a monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Alternatives, however, continuously and insistently imputes knowledge and responsibility to the Board through the words and actions of Ms. Russo and Dr. Morgan. If this were an ordinary business dispute between private parties, such imputing, of course, would be perfectly appropriate. A corporation may be bound by the words and actions of its agents, especially when they are high ranking executives of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">As Alternatives assesses the duties and the obligations of the parties, it seeks to place itself and Dr. Berger in one group, the plaintiffs camp, and to assign the Board, Ms. Russo, and Dr. Morgan to the adversary group, the defendant\u2019s camp. It seeks to rely on the apparent, if not the actual, authority of Ms. Russo and/or Dr. Morgan to bind or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>obligate the Board.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Once again, such a grouping of the players would be appropriate if this were an ordinary business dispute between private parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The fundamental teaching of <em>Gontrum, </em>however, is that when one of the parties to the ostensible relationship is a governmental entity, the placement of the players into respective categories is diametrically rearranged. When the expenditure of public funds is involved, the authority to expend such public resources is stingily conferred and rigidly regulated. In this case, only the Board itself, and not even its highest ranking executives or agents, may authorize any expenditure of $15,000 or more. That is this case\u2019s overarching reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The basic principle for which <em>Gontrum </em>stands is that the public fisc, and thereby the public itself, is to be protected by stringent procurement procedures not only against outside parties, such as Alternatives, but even against its own agents and employees, such as Ms. Russo and Dr. Morgan. Pursuant to the stern categorization of <em>Gontrum, </em>the Board (representing the public) is placed in one category, all by itself. Grouped together, perhaps uncomfortably, in the potentially opposing camp are Alternatives, Dr. Berger, Ms. Russo, and Dr. Morgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Alternatives poses the controlling principle as one of fairness to the plaintiff <em>vis-a-vis </em>the combined behavior of the Board, Ms. Russo, and Dr. Morgan. If the Board were a private corporation, fairness to the plaintiff would, indeed, be a critical, and perhaps controlling, consideration. It is not to demean fairness, however, to point out that in the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>different public policy world dealt -with by <em>Gontrum, </em>the critical consideration is not fairness, but the financial inviolatability of the Board <em>vis-a-vis </em>the combined behavior of Alternatives, Dr. Berger, Ms. Russo, and Dr. Morgan. A different set of values is in play.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">If fairness had been the controlling criterion, the plaintiff Gontrum himself would have prevailed in <em>Gontrum v. Baltimore. </em>The City had been unquestionably enriched at his expense. It took a strip of his property twenty feet in width and three hundred thirty-five feet in length. It dug trenches and installed sewer lines throughout that strip. Over the course of nine years the City never compensated Gontrum a single penny for the invasive use of his property. Gontrum had mistakenly believed that the City was about to condemn the property but, in making that mistake, Gontrum had relied on assurances made to him by the City Land Surveyor and an assistant city solicitor. The Court of Appeals was adamant that, even though the City \u201cis now enjoying the benefits accruing to it under the sewer right of way agreement, without having compensated [Gontrum] therefore,\u201d 182 Md. at 377-78, 35 A.2d 128, the City was \u201cunder no obligation to compensate [Gontrum] for the sewer right of way now used by it.\u201d 182 Md. at 378, 35 A.2d 128. The controlling public policy was clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">A municipal corporation cannot be held liable for the unauthorized acts of its agents although done <em>officii colore, </em>without some corporate act of ratification or adoption; and, <em>from consideration of public policy, it seems more reasonable that an individual should occasionally suffer from the mistakes of public agents or officials, than to adopt a rule, which, </em>through improper combinations and collusion, <em>might be turned to the detriment and injury of the public.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">182 Md. at 376, 35 A.2d 128 (emphasis supplied). The protection of the public unhesitatingly \u201ctrumped\u201d fairness to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Rigid budgetary and procurement procedures, as explained by <em>Gontrum, </em>protect the public treasury not only from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>corrupt or collusive actions of its agents, but also from the inadvertent, the ill-advised, and even from the most nobly motivated and well intentioned excesses of its highest executives, if and when they seek to commit funds beyond their authority to commit. It is a commonplace that visionary and forceful executives frequently believe that the optimum fulfillment of the mission of their state, their city, or their agency demands more funds than a seemingly stingy budgetary process has provided. If unrestrained, they could easily, from the noblest of intentions, drain the public treasury. It is not only to protect public funds from outside parties, such as Alternatives, but also to protect the public fisc from the well motivated enthusiasm of its own executives that strict budgetary and procurement procedures, and supporting cases such as <em>Gontrum, </em>are imposed as a necessary legislative check on the executive branch. As Judge Glynn observed, \u201cthe rule in <em>Gontrum </em>is harsh.\u201d There are, however, sound policy reasons for that harshness.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u201cThe Forms of the Actions We Have Buried, But They Rule Us From Their Graves\u201d ...

Despite occasional posing to the contrary, moreover, probably no one has truly mastered all of this arcane lore since the death of John Prentiss Poe.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Although the paths of quantum meruit and unjust enrichment have, for at least a century, diverged, they do share a long common ancestry. Some discussions, indeed, still use the terms interchangeably. Some carefully distinguish them. Some do both in successive paragraphs or even successive sentences without seeming to be aware of the slightest incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>sistency. It is a field fraught with hidden pitfalls. Saul Levmore, \u201cExplaining Restitution,\u201d 71 <em>Vir. L.Rev. </em>65, 66-67 (1985), refers to it as \u201cthe remarkably uneven terrain of restitution law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The Growth of Assumpsit</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Both quantum meruit and unjust enrichment are offshoots of the common law action of Assumpsit, and to understand them we must understand it. Although the common law action of Covenant was available for the breach of a contract under seal, the early common law recognized no cause of action for the breach of a simple contract. To fill a void that desperately needed filling, there gradually developed the form of action known as Assumpsit. It is Latin for \u201che assumed\u201d or \u201che undertook.\u201d The fuller form is Indebitatus Assumpsit: \u201cHe assumed the debt; he undertook to pay the debt.\u201d Both quantum meruit and unjust enrichment sprang up, albeit on the edges, as the law of contract itself evolved, and they remain firmly rooted in the principles and in the language of contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Early on, Assumpsit came to cover the case of an actual, though simple, contract, written or oral. From the coverage of an express contract, it then expanded to cover a contract that was not express but that could be inferred from the circumstantial behavior of the contracting parties. It ultimately was stretched to cover certain instances of unjust enrichment, where the law was willing to create a contract, as a legal fiction, where none in fact existed, even inferentially. Prosser and Keeton, <em>The Law of Torts </em>(5th ed.1984), p. 672, describes the burgeoning early growth of Assumpsit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">By a series of ingenious fictions <em>it was held first, that assumpsit would lie where a debt existed and a promise to pay it could be inferred, </em>as a fact, from the circumstances of the case; <em>then that the promise would be \u201cimplied\u201d by the law from the mere existence of a debt which the defendant ought to pay, although there was nothing to show that the promise was really made; </em>and <em>finally, that the law would \u201cimply\u201d both the debt and the promise whenever one had </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>received or used something for which \u201cnatural justice\u201d would require that he compensate another.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><em>Dobbs, </em>pp. 578-79, explains how the action of Assumpsit grew initially out of the action of Debt but ultimately came, in its own name, to cover breaches of simple express contracts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAx\">The development of Assumpsit for the enforcement of simple promises therefore did not extend to the kind of claim that could be brought in Debt. However, <em>Assumpsit was a preferable action to Debt for various reasons, and plaintiffs began to allege that the defendant had owed a debt, and that, </em>having owed it, <em>he later undertook to pay it by an express promise to do so. This allegation allowed the plaintiff to prove the express promise, and if he could do so, he could maintain the action in Assumpsit rather than Debt. </em>This came to be called indebitatus assumpsit. <em>By 1692 </em>in <em>Slade\u2019s Case </em>it was held that <em>Assumpsit could be used in any debt claim, whether the defendant had expressly undertaken to pay the debt or not, on the ground that every contract \u201cimports in itself an assumpsit.\u201d </em>The undertaking to pay the debt created by the bargain was not necessarily express, but the bargain that led to the debt in the first place was. <em>What was finally developed by the beginning of 17th century was thus a form of action capable of enforcing simple, but express, contracts.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Assumpsit and Implied Contracts</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The next evolutionary stage extended Assumpsit\u2019s coverage from express contracts to those unexpressed but actual contracts that could be inferred from the actions of the contracting parties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\"><em>A good many contracts are never expressed </em>in words, or at least not <em>fully in words. These are genuine understand,ings between the parties even though they have not been spelled out. </em>For instance, if a traveler goes to a hotel and asks for a room, he expects to pay for it at some more or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>less customary rate and the hotel expects to charge him. Both parties understand this and both understand that this reflects their agreement, even though the traveler has not promised to pay, much less named any amount of money. <em>This kind of contract is sometimes called an implied in fact contract, </em>a term that sometimes causes some confusion. <em>The term only means that the parties had a contract that can be seen in their conduct rather than in any explicit set of words. In other words, the contract is proved by circumstantial evidence. </em>As early as 1609, the English Courts recognized exactly this kind of implied promise, and <em>Assumpsit came to be used to cover such cases as well as cases involving express undertakings and express bargains.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><em>Dobbs, </em>p. 579 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">As Assumpsit expanded to embrace implied contracts or implied promises to pay, the common counts in general . assumpsit, including quantum meruit, were developed as modalities for measuring damages.

Old wine in new bottles.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\"><em>Prosser and Keeton, </em>p. 673, also explains how restitution in cases of quasi-contract inevitably retains the engrained characteristics as a contractual action that it assimilated during its long years as a part of Assumpsit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>Restitution is restricted to those cases in which the common counts in the old action of general assumpsit could be used </em>\u2014 that is to say, those in which the wrongdoer has been unjustly enriched by his tort, and \u201cis under an obligation from the ties of natural justice to refund,\u201d so that <em>\u201cthe law implies a debt and gives this action, founded in the equity of the plaintiffs case, as it ivere upon a contract.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The <em>Restatement of Restitution, </em>pp. 22-28, also makes it clear that an action for restitution for unjust enrichment, seeking a money judgment, is treated, as part of its doctrinal birthright, as a legal action in contract.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\"><em>[AJctions at law for restitution because of unjust enrichment originated in the fiction that the person receiving the benefit had promised to pay for it </em>and <em>this fiction has continued to affect the form of action. </em>...

Sometimes courts have said that <em>quantum meruit </em>is a term reserved for breach of contract cases. Sometimes courts think that a case that begins with a tort is converted to contract when the plaintiff claims restitution, and hence invoke the contract statute of limitations. <em>All of these </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>errors appear to result because lawyers sometimes focus on the contract language rather than its restitution content.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aoq\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">This discussion would be remiss if it failed to acknowledge the seminal role in the development of quasi-contract played by Lord Mansfield and his decision in the case of <em>Moses v. MacFerlan, </em>2 Burr. 1005, 97 Eng. Rep. 676 (K.B.1760). He ascribed to quasi-contract actions in Assumpsit a \u201ckind of equitable character\u201d as he explained that the action would lie when \u201cthe defendant, upon the circumstances of the case is obliged by the ties of natural justice and equity to refund the money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><em>Dobbs, </em>p. 581, explains how what came to be called the common counts developed as standard and handy descriptions of a number of set fact patterns for quasi-contractual restitution in General Assumpsit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\"><em>Lord Mansfield\u2019s </em>broad policy statement in <em>Moses v. MacFerlan </em>has had considerable impact on the law of restitution. It <em>laid the groundwork for establishing the principle against unjust enrichment as the central core of restitution claims. </em>Nevertheless, quasi-contract was tied to the action in assumpsit and to the limited judicial powers of the law judges. <em>The law of quasi-contract </em>did not expand to encompass Lord Mansfield\u2019s principle, but instead <em>developed in a group of very specific factual patterns. These patterns became so standardized that they acquired names as particular versions of the General Assumpsit form. These subordinate categories of assumpsit were called the common counts. </em>The names of some of these are still in use today to describe certain standard situations for restitution claims. <em>All of them are </em>particular instances or <em>forms of General Assumpsit; or put in slightly more modem terminology, all of them are particular kinds of quasi-contract. </em>So <em>all of them refer to fact patterns which may call for restitution to prevent unjust enrichment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Among these common counts, the more familiar ones were 1) money paid to the defendant\u2019s use, 2) money had and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>received, 3) use and occupation of land, 4) goods sold and delivered, 5) quantum valebant (\u201chow much were they [the goods] worth?\u201d), and 6) quantum meruit. <em>Dobbs, </em>p. 583, offers a brief description of quantum meruit and how it may apply both in cases of implied-in-fact contracts and in cases of quasi-contract.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\"><em>[Qfuantum meruit [is] a count used where the plaintiff has performed services for the defendant. </em>As in many common count cases, the <em>services may be performed a,t the defendant\u2019s request, so that an implied in fact contract might be found. </em>However, <em>services might be performed without the request of the defendant, but which nevertheless benefitted him in some way.

They are 1) the implied-in-fact contract and 2) the implied-in-law contract. The two terms, although they resemble each other linguistically, in that each contains both the noun \u201ccontract\u201d and the past participle \u201cimplied,\u201d are diametrically different in terms of the respective legal relationships they denote. Palmer, <em>Restitution, </em>p. 8, comments on the ever-present hazard of linguistic confusion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">American courts commonly describe the issue in a case as one of determining whether the circumstances are proper for \u201cimplying a contract,\u201d and <em>one cannot always be sure that the court is fully aware of the fundamental difference between \u201ca contract implied in fact\u2019\u2019 and \u201ca contract im</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>plied, in law. \u201d </em>It would be of some help if the latter phrase could be wholly eliminated from the legal vocabulary, but its substitute, quasi contract, seems certain to remain with us and even this can be a source of confusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Before turning to the two counts in question, we will set out, as distinctly as we can, the separate legal predicates on which these very different actions may rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">A. A Contract Implied in Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">A contract implied in fact is actually a contract. As Judge Salmon explained for this Court in <em>Mogavero v. Silverstein, </em>142 Md.App. 259, 275, 790 A.2d 43 (2002):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\"><em>An implied-in-fact contract is a \u201ctrue contract\u201d </em>and \u201cmeans that the parties had a contract that can be seen in their conduct rather than in an explicit set of words.\u201d <em>Implied-in-fact contracts are \u201cdependent on mutual agreement or consent, </em>and on the intention of the parties; and <em>a meeting of the minds is required. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">In <em>Mogavero v.

Engelcke Manufacturing, Inc., </em>37 Wash.App. 677, 681 P.2d 1312, 1314 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aar\"><em>A true implied contract, </em>or contract implied in fact, <em>does not describe a legal relationship which differs from an express contract: only the mode of proof is different.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Vol. 1, <em>Williston on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 1.5, pp. 20-21, by Richard A.

A Contract Implied In Law: Quasi Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">By sharp contrast, what is somewhat confusingly called a contract implied in law is actually no contract at all. In <em>Mass Transit v. Granite, </em>57 Md.App. at 775, 471 A.2d 1121, Judge Bloom spelled out the diametric difference between the two concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>A </em>quasi-contract or <em>implied in law contract, on the other hand, involves no assent between the parties, no \u201cmeeting of the minds. </em>\u201d Instead the law implies a promise on the part of the defendant to pay a particular \u201cdebt.\u201d Thus, <em>\u201c[t]he implied in law contract is indeed no contract at all, </em>it is simply a rule of law that requires restitution to the plaintiff of something that came into defendant\u2019s hands but belongs to the plaintiff in some sense.\u201d It is from quasi-contract that \u201cthe common counts in general <em>assumpsit </em>came into use, notably the counts for money had and received, for goods sold and delivered <em>(quantum </em>valebat), and for work and labor done <em>(quantum </em>meruit).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In <em>Caroline County v. Dashiell, </em>358 Md. at 94-95, 747 A.2d 600, the Court of Appeals noted the difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Finally, significant to our analysis is <em>the definition of a quasi-contract. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>[6th ed.1990] at 324 defines it os a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\"><em>[Ilegal fiction invented by common law courts to permit recovery by contractual remedy in cases where, in fact, there is no contract, </em>but where circumstances are such that justice warrants a recovery as though there had been a promise. It is not based on intention or consent of the parties, but is founded on considerations of justice and equity, and on [the] doctrine of unjust enrichment. <em>It is not in fact a contract, but an obligation which the law creates in absence of any agreement, </em>when and because the acts of the parties or others have placed in the possession of one person money, or its equivalent, under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">In <em>Dashiell, </em>358 Md. at 95 n. 6, 747 A.2d 600, Judge Cathell juxtaposed the two legal relationships.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\"><em>Historically, there were two types of implied contracts: contract implied by fact and contract implied by law. </em>They have distinct meanings. <em>An implied by fact contract is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>\u201cinferred, from conduct of parties </em>and arises where plaintiff, without being requested to do so, renders services under circumstances indicating that he expects to be paid therefor, and defendant, knowing such circumstances, avails himself of benefit of those services.\u201d <em>A contract implied by law is now what commonly is called quasi-contract.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Slick v. Reinecker, </em>154 Md.

They are obligations created by law for reasons of justice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">It may seem incongruously Orwellian to the modern mind to refer to something that is truly not a contract at all as a \u201ccontract implied in law.\u201d Why not describe the legal obligation in terms of what it is, rather than as something it emphatically is not? <em>Dobbs, </em>p. 571, has explained why, historically, it was necessary to resort to the linguistic fiction in order to make a desired remedy available.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">The more significant stream of restitution derived from the writ of assumpsit....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\"><em>Assumpsit was the common law form of action by which contract claims were redressed. </em>Sometimes the contract would be express, sometimes implied by the parties\u2019 actions, but in either event a genuine contract. However, <em>the assumpsit action also came to be used when the parties had no contract at all, </em>so long as the plaintiff could convince the court that he ought to recover something from the defendant as a matter of justice or good conscience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">Courts explained liability in assumpsit by saying that the defendant was liable on an implied contract. <em>Because the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>term, \u201cimplied contract\u201d might be confused with the idea of an implied in fact contract, judges sometimes use the term \u201cimplied in law contract\u201d instead, tacitly recognizing that this kind of claim had nothing to do with a genuine contract. Another term, for the implied in law contract is quasi-contract. </em>So restitutionary claims of the kind involved in the second stream is still often referred to as claims for <em>assumpsit, </em>or claims based on <em>implied in law or quasi-contracts.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">To keep the two actions, and their respective remedies, as distinct as possible, we are persuaded to follow the sound example of Judge Cathell in <em>Dashiell, </em>358 Md. at 95 n. 6, 747 A.2d 600:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">For clarity, we will refer to a contract implied by fact as an implied contract[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and a contract implied by law as a quasi-contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Count V: Quantum Meruit</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">If words such as \u201cequitable\u201d and phrases such as \u201cimplied contract\u201d are capable of generating confusion because of their multiple meanings, the term \u201cquantum meruit\u201d is even more so. In addition to being imprecise, it is both archaic and in a foreign language. \u201cQuantum meruit\u201d is Latin for \u201cas much as he deserved.\u201d As a measure of recovery, it means the reasonable value of the work performed or the services rendered by a plaintiff for a defendant. Procedurally, it is often pleaded, as it was in this case, as an alternative claim in a breach-of-contract case so that the plaintiff might still recover even if the contract claim itself should fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">A thorough and scholarly examination of quantum meruit was made by Judge Salmon for this Court in <em>Mogavero v. Silverstein, </em>142 Md.App. at 274-80, 790 A.2d 43. A problem with quantum meruit, and one for us in this case, is that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>sometimes employed to measure damages in the case of an implied-in-fact contract and sometimes employed to assess reasonable restitution in the case of a quasi-contract. <em>Mogavero, </em>142 Md.App. at 274-75, 790 A.2d 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">An excellent explanation of these two distinct employments of the term quantum meruit was made by Justice Stanley Feldman for the Supreme Court of Arizona in <em>Murdock Bryant Construction v. Pearson, </em>146 Ariz. 48, 703 P.2d 1197, 1201-02 (1985).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\"><em>[Qfuantum meruit was the common law count </em>or form of action <em>which allowed recovery where the plaintiff had performed services for the defendant, whether </em>the services were provided at the defendant\u2019s request, <em>on a theory of implied-in-fact contract, or </em>without the defendant\u2019s request but benefitting him in some way. The recovery allowed for services which had not been requested by defendant was <em>based upon quasi-contract, </em>and theoretically had as its central core the principle against unjust enrichment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACF\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Dudding v. Norton Frickey &amp; Assoc., </em>11 P.3d 441, 444 (Colo.2000), and <em>Davies v. Olson, </em>746 P.2d 264, 269 (Utah App.1987), for excellent explanations of why the notion of quantum meruit may sometimes apply to cases of quasi-contract as well as to implied-in-fact contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The use of quantum meruit in these two very different senses has, not surprisingly, been a source of confusion. Candace S. Kovacic, \u201cA Proposal to Simplify Quantum Meruit Litigation,\u201d 35 <em>Amer. U.L.Rev. </em>547, 553 (1986),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> has insightfully noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\"><em>Quantum meruit </em>litigation is confusing for three major reasons. First, the term <em>has two different definitions, one as a contract implied in fact, the other as a contract implied in law. Courts frequently do not identify which meaning they are applying and often make the claim an </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>amalgam of the two types. </em>Second, one of the definitions of quantum meruit, that of a contract implied in law, is in restitution, which is an area also often misunderstood. Third, many of the major authorities on contracts or restitution do not index the term quantum meruit in their treatises. When they do so, the discussion is often brief, fragmented, or intertwined with a discussion of restitution, which requires the reader to understand restitutionary terminology.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">As <em>Mogavero </em>points out, 142 Md.App. at 275, 790 A.2d 43, \u201cThe distinction between these two forms of quantum meruit is important, as the two claims require distinct remedies.\u201d If quantum meruit is the claim in a case based on an implied-in-fact contract, quantum meruit is the measure of damages. The value of the work done and the services performed by the plaintiff for which he has not been compensated measure the loss suffered by the plaintiff. As Judge Salmon pointed out in <em>Mogavero, </em>142 Md.App. at 276, 790 A.2d 43:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">Recovery on a contract implied in fact is based on the amount that the parties intended as the contract price or, if that amount is unexpressed, the fair market value of the plaintiffs services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Almost all of the Maryland cases surveyed by <em>Mogavero, </em>142 Md.App. at 277-80, 790 A.2d 43, are ones where the quantum meruit claim had been based on an implied-in-fact contract. Where a contract could be inferred but the contract price was unexpressed, the fair market value of the plaintiffs services, to wit, quantum meruit, was deemed to be the appropriate measure of damages. <em>Battaglia v. Clinical Perfusionists, Inc., </em>338 Md. 352, 358, 658 A.2d 680 (1995); <em>Merritt Building &amp; Supply Co. v. Shaulis, </em>252 Md. 133, 135-36, 249 A.2d 177 (1969); <em>Duck v.

Any award in such a case is not for damages, but for restitution. It is measured not by any loss suffered by the plaintiff, but by the gain or enrichment unjustly conferred on the defendant. In <em>Mass Transit v. Granite Construction, </em>57 Md.App. at 775, 471 A.2d 1121, Judge Bloom points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">It should also be remembered that <em>a money judgment recovered by virtue of quasi-contract is a remedy to prevent against the unjust enrichment of the defendant. Thus, the measure of the recovery is the gain to the defendant, not the loss by the plaintiff.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">The restitution claim stands in flat contrast to the damages action in this respect. <em>The damages recovery is to compensate the plaintiff, </em>and it pays him, theoretically, for his losses. <em>The restitution claim, </em>on the other hand, <em>is not aimed at compensating the plaintiff, but at forcing the defendant to disgorge benefits that it would be unjust for him to keep.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In <em>Mogavero, </em>142 Md.App. at 276, 790 A.2d 43, we again made it clear that in a quasi-contract case the proper measure of a recovery is not the loss to the plaintiff (damages) but the actual unjust gain of the defendant (restitution).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">The measure of recovery in quasi-contract (implied in law) cases is based upon restitution. Restitution, in turn, is referred to as an action for unjust enrichment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>[T]he classic measurement of unjust enrichment damages is the \u201cgain to the defendant, not the loss by the plaintiff.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApH\">Recovery on a contract implied in fact, on the other hand, is based on the amount that the parties intended as the contract price or, if that amount is unexpressed, the fair market value of the plaintiffs services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Slick v. Reinecker, </em>154 Md. App. at 335-86, 839 A.2d 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Kovacic, \u201cQuantum Meruit,\u201d pp. 555-57, similarly notes the sharp distinction between the remedial theories.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\"><em>The distinction between these two types of quantum meruit is important because the two claims provide different recoveries. </em>Technically, recovery in contract implied in fact is the amount the parties intended as the contract price. <em>If that amount is unexpressed, courts will infer that the parties intended the amount to be the reasonable market value of the plaintiff\u2019s services. Recovery in quasi-contract, </em>or contract implied in law, however, <em>is in restitution and thus is the amount of the defendant\u2019s gain. The courts are often aware of the duality of remedy in quantum meruit, but do not appear to know when one or the other is appropriate, </em>primarily because of a lack of authoritative guidance. Some of the courts applying quantum meruit award the plaintiff the amount of the defendant\u2019s gain. More courts, however, award the reasonable market value of the plaintiffs services, even when characterizing the quantum meruit claim as one in quasi-contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The reasonable value of the work or services performed by the plaintiff is clearly an apt measure of the plaintiffs damages when the claim is based on an implied-in-fact contract. In such a case, the utility of quantum meruit is self-evident. Less evident is the occasional utility of quantum meruit in a case based on quasi-contract. Sometimes when the unjust enrichment of the defendant cannot otherwise be measured, the reasonable value of the services received, but not paid for, is the measure of the unjust gain. In the context of quasi-contract, however, the reasonable value of the ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>vices is viewed through the prism of the defendant\u2019s gain or enrichment rather than through the prism of the plaintiffs loss. The dollar amount may be the same, but the theory of recovery is different. As to quantum meruit as a measure of gain, Kovacic, \u201cQuantum Meruit,\u201d p. 557, has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\"><em>[T]he reasonable market value of plaintiffs services </em>can be viewed as the correct remedy in most quantum meruit cases, even in many cases in unjust enrichment because reasonable value <em>can be viewed as the defendant\u2019s gain in certain situations. The value of the plaintiffs services measures the defendant\u2019s gain </em>when the defendant requests the work: the defendant\u2019s benefit is receiving what he or she requested. Those requested services have a market value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Was the Quantum Meruit Count Based On An Implied-in-Fact Contract or on Quasi-Contract?</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We turn to the granting of summary judgment on Count V. The dominant theme of Alternatives\u2019s full and original claim in this case was that it had, through the agency of Ms. Russo, an actual contract with the Board for the express, or inferential, contract price of $284,750. The fifth count, charging Quantum Meruit, was originally no more than an alternative or back-up claim, to be resorted to only if the primary contract argument failed. Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that it was, and remains, by no means clear whether the Quantum Meruit count, which was never the center of attention, was based on the theory of an implied-in-fact contract or on the theory of quasi-contract. Alternatives presumably would like us to take our pick and to choose whichever one shows greater promise. In fact, neither shows promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">If Based on Quasi-Contract, The Quantum Meruit Count Is Redundant</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">One thing, at least, is crystal clear. The quantum meruit count, of necessity, was based on the one theory or the other. If, <em>arguendo, </em>it was based on a theory of quasi-contract, it is moot or redundant in that it is indistinguishable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>from Count VI, which charges Unjust Enrichment. \u201cQuasi-contract,\u201d \u201can implied-in-law contract,\u201d and \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d are, as we have discussed, synonymous terms. Both counts, on precisely the same factual predicate, would be charging the same unjust enrichment and claiming precisely the same restitution in the amount of $284,750. One Unjust Enrichment count is enough; it need not be pled twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">If Based on an Implied Contract, The Quantum Meruit Count Is Controlled By <em>Gontrum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">If, on the other hand, the quantum meruit count was, <em>arguendo, </em>based on an implied-in-fact contract, it was squarely controlled by <em>Gontrum v. Baltimore </em>and was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Count V did clearly appear to be one based on the claim that, at the very least, an implied contract existed between Alternatives and the Board. As part of Count V, Paragraphs 61, 62, and 64 all alleged an actual meeting of the minds between Alternatives and the Board to the effect that Alternatives 1) would be paid for its services and 2) would be paid by the Board. The allegations, moreover, were that the amount of such payment would be the amount of \u201cthe per pupil allocation from the State of Maryland\u201d times the number of pupils enrolled in Alternative\u2019s Drop-Back-In program.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">61. <em>AU rendered valuable services to the Board, with the intention that AU would receive a fee for the services rendered, </em>specifically, <em>an amount for each student enrolled in the Baltimore Transitional Learning Academy equal to the per pupil allocation from the State of Maryland.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">62. All services provided by AU to the Board were rendered under such circumstances that <em>the Board, </em>through Russo and her designees, <em>knew that AU expected to be paid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">64. <em>The services were rendered under such circumstances that reasonably notified the Board that AU, </em>in providing these services, <em>expected to be paid by the Board.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alo\">(Emphasis supplied). That is unmistakable contract language.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Alternatives, moreover, was requesting the recovery of a contract price, not the quantum meruit-based reasonable mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ket value of work done and services performed. Nowhere in this record has there been any proffer by Alternatives of 1) the number of teachers or the personnel it hired, 2) the period of their employment, 3) the wages or salaries paid to such persons, or 4) the cost of supplies and materials furnished and used. As a back-stop, alternative pleading, the label \u201cquantum meruit\u201d was simply patched onto a set of allegations that show none of the indicative characteristics normally associated with quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Count V unquestionably alleged a contract. The fact that the contract was implied rather than express is of no moment. An implied-in-fact contract is, as has been fully discussed, an actual contract. The only difference between an implied contract and an express contract is not the existence of the contract itself but only the modality of its proof. <em>Gontrum </em>applies across the board to any contract with a governmental entity, regardless of whether it is express or implied. <em>Gontrum </em>is totally unconcerned with the modality of a contract\u2019s proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The generative force of <em>Gontrum </em>is the protection of the public fisc through tightly controlled and meticulously prescribed contracting procedures. If a governmental agent, unauthorized to do so, may not bind the governmental entity by entering into a purported contract that is express, written, and perhaps even under seal, <em>a fortiori, </em>such agent may not bind the governmental entity by a more informal and merely implied contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The juggernaut-like force behind the protection of the public treasury, able to roll over competing considerations of fairness to private plaintiffs, was dramatically in motion in <em>ARA Health Services v. Department of Public Safety, </em>344 Md. 85, 685 A.2d 435 (1996), <em>aff'g Department of Public Safety v. ARA Health Services, </em>107 Md.App. 445, 668 A.2d 960 (1995). The case was, to be sure, a sovereign immunity case, but it illustrates starkly the indisputably favored status enjoyed by a governmental entity when it comes to the questionable expenditure of public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>ARA Health Services sought $135,446 as payment for AIDS medications it had actually provided for the treatment of inmates in Maryland correctional facilities during the 18 month period of January 1,1989 to June 30,1990. The literal terms of the contract between ARA and the Division of Correction only provided for payment for AIDS medication delivered to inmates who were in the hospital and not to inmates who were in correctional facilities. A subsequent contract, made retroactive to July 1, 1990, however, provided for payment for AIDS medications delivered to all inmates regardless of their location.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">It was argued by ARA that the Division of Correction had, by a consistent course of conduct, modified the original contract. The Division knew that AIDS medication was being provided for inmates who were not hospitalized. It actually remitted payment to ARA for the medication on a monthly basis for the entire 18 month period for a total payment of $135,446. The problem was that the contract was not one that the Division of Correction was authorized to enter into at its own discretion. It was a type of contract that could only be entered into if approved by the Board of Public Works.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">It was, moreover, only a subsequent legislative audit that compelled the Department of Correction to recover from ARA what was deemed to have been \u201cthe $135,446 overpayment.\u201d Initially the Division disagreed with the audit and stated that \u201cthe understanding between the parties was that [ARA] would be reimbursed for all AIDS medication costs.\u201d The Division believed that it rightfully owed the money for medicines 1) it had requested, 2) it had received, and 3) it had used. The Board of Contract Appeals nonetheless ruled that \u201cthe plain and unambiguous language of the contract did not provide for the reimbursement sought by [ARA].\u201d 344 Md. at 91, 685 A.2d 435. The circuit court reversed the Board of Contract Appeals, because of its \u201cfailure to consider the possibility of an oral modification of the contract,\u201d as evidenced by the behavior of the parties. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>On appeal, the Division invoked sovereign immunity. ARA countered that sovereign immunity may not be asserted in a contract action if there has been a written contract executed for the State by an official or employee \u201cacting within the scope of the authority of the official or employee.\u201d 344 Md. at 92, 685 A.2d 435. The Court of Appeals held, as this Court had earlier held, that the Division of Correction had no authority to ignore the formal procurement procedures established by the legislature and was, therefore, not \u201cacting within the scope of [its] authority.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-4\">It is conceded that the Board [of Public Works] has not delegated to the [Division of Correction] procurement authority with respect to the service contract at issue in the instant case. The absence of this delegation necessarily means that <em>the [Division] must obtain Board approval prior to executing such a contract or any modification thereto.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">As a result, <em>the DOC\u2019s failure to follow the requirements of the statutory and regulatory scheme with which it must comply amounts to an ultra vires act.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">344 Md. at 94-95, 685 A.2d 435 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">In making what it thought was a commitment to ARA, the Division had taken an action without actual authority to do so. Citing <em>Gontrum, </em>the Court of Appeals held squarely that such an unauthorized action cannot bind a governmental entity to the expenditure of public funds.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the scope of a State official\u2019s authority is co-extensive with his or her actual authority. <em>Dept. of Public Safety v. ARA, </em>107 Md.App. 445, 462, 668 A.2d 960, 969 (1995). As we have previously observed in the context of municipal corporations, \u201c \u2018[although a private agent, acting in violation of specific instructions, yet within the scope of a general authority, may bind his principal, the rule, as to the effect of a like act of a public agent, is otherwise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gontrum v.

Public policy demands that the State cannot be bound by the unauthorized acts of its agents.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">344 Md. at 95, 685 A.2d 435 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Judge Hollander had earlier pointed out for this Court, 107 Md.App. at 459, 668 A.2d 960, that if a governmental procurement procedure requires, for instance, a written contract, nothing less will suffice, no matter how meritorious a plaintiffs claim might otherwise be.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">As we stated in <em>Mass Transit Administration v. Granite Construction Co.: \u201cHowever meritorious a claim based on an implied contract may be, if that claim is against the State </em>or any of its agencies, <em>it is barred because it is not based upon a written contract. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">That clearly would not have been the case if the defendant had been a private party instead of a governmental entity. Also citing <em>Gontrum </em>an authority, we explained that when the defendant is a governmental entity, the reasonableness of the plaintiffs beliefs is not a factor in resolving the dispute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agh\">In the absence of actual authority, <em>the State may avoid the contract, regardless of the reasonableness of the beliefs of the other party.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">107 Md.App. at 462, 668 A.2d 960 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">Once the basis for Count V is clearly identified, the answer is easy. If it had been stated at the outset that the Quantum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Meruit count was based on an implied-in-fact contract, there is no reason why it should not have been dismissed by Judge Glynn, on the authority of <em>Gontrum,, </em>when the other counts, more obviously based on contract, were dismissed. The disposition of this count, if it was based on an implied-in-fact contract, did not need to abide the summary judgment stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Alternatives sought to do indirectly what <em>Gontrum </em>forbids it from doing directly. The holding of <em>Gontrum </em>squarely determined that Ms. Russo, as Chief Executive Officer, could not have obligated the Board to the expenditure of $15,000 or more, even if she had signed an express and fully detailed written contract with Alternatives. <em>A fortiori, </em>she could not bind the Board inferentially by the vaguest and most circumstantial of arguable assents. What she may not do intentionally, she may not do unintentionally. A count based on an implied-in-fact contract cannot survive <em>Gontrum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Count VI: Unjust Enrichment</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">We are left with Count VI. The count is for Unjust Enrichment, a claim based on quasi-contract. It is with respect to this count that the correctness of the grant of summary judgment is perplexingly problematic. Legally it is right on the cusp, with some factors pointing decidedly in favor of granting the judgment against Alternatives. On the facts of this case, however, there may survive a small kernel of viability permitting Alternatives to see what it can develop at the trial table. The window of opportunity is small, but it is there.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In granting summary judgment in favor of the Board on Unjust Enrichment (as well as on Quantum Meruit), Judge Allison ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">With respect to counts five and six, quantum meruit and unjust enrichment as to the Board, this is perhaps the toughest question because if the defendant were a private party, this court would not be granting summary judgment on these two counts. However, the defendant is not a private party, and it\u2019s the finding of this court that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>counts cannot survive the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis in <em>Gontrum v. Baltimore, </em>182 Md. 370, 35 A.2d 128 (1943).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">Employees through words or deeds don\u2019t make enforceable contracts for the Board.... So for this reason, the court finds that summary judgment on counts five and six as to the Board is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">For all of these reasons, the court is granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in its entirety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">A. The <em>Gontrum </em>Holding Versus the <em>Gontrum </em>Rationale</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">If the Unjust Enrichment Count were based on a theory of implied contract, as the Quantum Meruit Count may have been (if it was not redundant), there would have been no window of opportunity through which to escape summary judgment and we would have affirmed the judgment. The literal holding of <em>Gontrum </em>would have foreclosed absolutely any restitutionary recovery based on contract, express or implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">A claim of unjust enrichment, however, is not based on contract, even an implied contract. It is based on quasi-contract, and a quasi-contract, notwithstanding its name, is not a real contract. Its contractual status is an historic fiction. To be sure, quasi-contract may once have suckled at the breast of Assumpsit, but it had been a foundling with no other shelter from the storm. To shield itself from the merciless eyes of common law pleading, it assumed the name and much of the contractual coloration of its adoptive family, but it was never a real contract. <em>Gontrum </em>speaks directly to real contracts, not to fictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">To say that the literal holding of <em>Gontrum </em>does not apply to quasi-contract, however, is not to say that <em>Gontrum\u2019s </em>broader rationale might not. The undergirding rationale of <em>Gontrum </em>is that the public treasury must be protected from obligations on it made by agents or employees acting without proper authority, even if the results work hardships on third parties. Even in cases where plaintiffs, facing the obstacle of an unenforceable contract, have sought to fall back on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>alternative relief of unjust enrichment, there is a chasm of difference between the private party as the unjust enrichment defendant and a governmental entity as defendant. <em>Dobbs, </em>at 566, observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\"><em>Public entities are often subject to limitations about their contracting, </em>both as to formalities and as to important processes like competitive bidding. Courts may ignore unimportant procedural irregularities and permit restitution or enforcement. <em>When substantive rules are violated, as where there is no public bidding </em>or the contractor is related to a government official, <em>courts have often denied restitution.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Whether a particular claim of unjust enrichment will be foreclosed by the rationale of <em>Gontrum, </em>therefore, requires a closer look at whether the public treasury will actually be protected by foreclosing that particular unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">B. The <em>Gontrum </em>Rationale May Foreclose a Claim for Unjust Enrichment</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">We are, therefore, by no means suggesting that an unjust enrichment claim is immune from the foreclosing effect of <em>Gontrum. </em>It all depends upon whether <em>Gontrum\u2019s </em>policy will be served on a particular occasion by a particular claim foreclosure. <em>Mass Transit v. Granite </em>observed initially, 57 Md.App. at 780, 471 A.2d 1121, that even in the face of an actual unjust enrichment, the policy of protecting the public treasury must prevail.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">Even if we were persuaded that MTA had been unjustly enriched ... we would be forced to conclude that sovereign immunity would be a complete bar to recovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">Judge Bloom there acknowledged that sometimes there is an unavoidable collision between two values and that sometimes the conflicting interests cannot be reconciled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-12\">As we have seen, sovereign immunity bars recovery unless waived or abrogated by the State and that <em>the State has </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>waived, the defense only with respect to those contract claims </em>which are \u201cbased upon a written contract <em>executed </em>on behalf of the State, ... <em>by an official or employee acting within the scope of his authority.\u201d </em>We have also seen that <em>recovery for unjust enrichment is based upon an implied in law contract. The two concepts are incompatible.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">57 Md.App. at 780, 471 A.2d 1121 (emphasis supplied). When the two conflicting values cannot be reconciled, the policy of protecting the governmental treasury from unauthorized obligations will override other considerations even if the governmental entity is thereby unjustly enriched.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\"><em>However meritorious a claim based upon an implied contract may be, if that claim is against the State </em>or any of its agencies, ... [i]n this case, <em>it would be barred because it is </em>allegedly based upon a contract implied as <em>a result of conduct on the part of an employee who was acting outside the scope of his employment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">57 Md.App. at 780-81, 471 A.2d 1121 (emphasis supplied).

It will, of course, have to be developed 1) how these funds were applied for; 2) how the amount of funding was calculated; and 3) what, if any, expenses the Board itself incurred. Was there figured into the computation, for instance, the cost of heat, light, security, and janitorial services at Southern High School or was the funding total profit? Did the amount of funding per student depend in any way on the length of time for which the student was enrolled? How much of each student\u2019s period of enrollment, for instance, was pre-February 26, and how much was post-February 26? If, when all the figuring is completed, however, the Board was, indeed, enriched by monies it would not otherwise have received, there would seem to have been proved \u201ca benefit conferred upon\u201d the Board by Alternatives, the first element of an unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The second element of unjust enrichment would appear reasonably easy for Alternatives to establish, to wit, that the Board had \u201can appreciation or knowledge\u201d that, by virtue of Alternatives\u2019s program, it was receiving funds from the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">It is with respect to the third element of unjust enrichment that the proof would appear to be far more tenuous. Even if the Board was, in fact, enriched, was the enrichment unjust?</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">D. Two Diametric Reasons for Conferring Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">If, at trial, Alternatives can persuade the fact finder that there was an actual meeting of the minds to enter into a contractual relationship, which effort failed only because of the Board\u2019s rigorous procurement policy, Alternatives might still have a case in quasi-contract for unjust enrichment. John D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Calamari and Joseph M. Perillo, <em>Contracts </em>(2d ed.1977), explains at p. 20.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">Very often quasi-contractual remedies are employed in contractual contexts. <em>When the parties negotiate an agreement which fails because the agent for one of the parties had no power to bind his principal, </em>or the parties each had a different reasonable understanding of the agreement, <em>it is the law of quasi contracts that is looked to for a determination of to what extent any performance rendered under the agreement [is] to be compensated.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\"><em>Dobbs, </em>at p. 583, also refers to the attempted but failed contract as a circumstance sometimes giving rise to a claim of quasi-contract.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">There are other cases in which services are rendered by request, but in which, nevertheless, the parties have no valid and enforceable contract. <em>This occurs, </em>for example, <em>where the parties have attempted to form a contract, but by reason of mistake have failed to do so. </em>... In such a case, <em>the contract itself, </em>whether express or implied in fact, <em>is unenforceable, but the defendant may still be liable for the value of the plaintiffs services.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">If, on the other hand, the fact finder should conclude that Alternatives was 1) fully aware of the procurement requirements and 2) fully aware, when it undertook its program, that the Board was under no obligation to it,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but nevertheless launched its operation because of 1) knowledge that the Board frequently, albeit not invariably, approved contracts retroactively for enterprises already underway and 2) its optimistic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>expectation that the Board would follow form on this occasion, Alternatives may well be left in the legal lurch. The <em>Restatement of Restitution, </em>p. 223, comments.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\"><em>A person </em>who has conferred a benefit upon another, manifesting that he does not expect compensation therefor, <em>is not entitled to restitution merely because his expectation that the other will </em>make a gift to him or <em>enter into a contract with him is not realized.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The intentional conferring of a benefit based on a hope, a prayer, an expectation, or a gamble that fails to be realized may constitute an enrichment, but it is not an UNJUST enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">E. Post-February 26 Officiousness: A \u201cShow Stopper\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Two other significant limitations will constrict Alternatives\u2019s effort to prove unjust enrichment. The first limitation is that Alternatives, as a matter of law, will be restricted to proving benefits conferred before it was expressly directed on February 26, 2001, to terminate all operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Before even turning to her decision as to whether the unjust enrichment count could otherwise survive summary judgment, Judge Allison ruled, on independent grounds, that no claim of any sort could be based on anything done by Alternatives after it had been expressly directed by the Board on February 26, 2001, to terminate all activity with respect to a Drop-Back-In program</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">\n<em>[NJone of the causes of action as to either defendant here could survive the February 26th letter.

As Judge Bishop explained for this Court in <em>First National Bank v. Shpritz, </em>63 Md.App. 623, 640, 493 A.2d 410, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 297, 498 A.2d 1184 (1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\"><em>The mere fact that a person benefits another is not of itself sufficient to require the other to make restitution.

In either event, it was a case of the Board\u2019s, in the words of the <em>Restatement, </em>p. 16, having \u201cbenefits thrust upon [it]\u201d against its wishes and express directions. At the hearing on summary judgment, Judge Allison made that very clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">[COUNSEL FOR ALTERNATIVES]: So <em>Doctor Berger\u2019s only option was either to keep the school open </em>until Sally Maxton came in and transferred these students back <em>or to </em>close the school and <em>put these students back on the street.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">THE COURT: Well, <em>wasn\u2019t that exactly what the letter told him to do? </em>I mean, wasn\u2019t he essentially a volunteer after that letter?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Any arguable enrichment the Board may have received after February 26, 2001, was not, by definition, UNJUST enrichment and was not, therefore, a predicate for restitution. With respect to the officious conferring of a benefit, even when the defendant is unquestionably enriched thereby, <em>Dobbs, </em>at pp. 553-54, is very emphatic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">The plaintiff may confer a benefit upon the defendant without mistake and without wrongdoing or breach of an agreement by the defendant. In many such cases <em>the plaintiff will be denied restitution in spite of the defendant\u2019s unjust enrichment because it will be important to protect the defendant\u2019s right to choose for himself what benefits he wants.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">The Board here clearly had the right \u201cto choose for [itself] what benefits [it] wanted.\u201d As of February 26, 2001, it made that choice absolutely clear. It did not want Alternatives\u2019s Drop Back In program and it said so in no uncertain terms. See also <em>Everhart v. Miles, </em>47 Md.App. at 136-37, 422 A.2d 28 (\u201c[U]njust enrichment does not exist where the benefit has officiously been thrust upon the defendant.\u201d). <em>Dobbs </em>also observed, at p. 583:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>Most services rendered without request, </em>however, <em>are apt to be </em>either given freely with no expectation of payment, or <em>rendered officiously. If either of these things is true, restitution is denied </em>on substantive rather than on formal grounds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">F. The Nature of the Benefit Conferred</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The second significant limitation on a restitutionary recovery by Alternatives for unjust enrichment concerns the nature of the benefit arguably conferred by it on the Board. How the benefit is conceptualized in this case may be dispositive. When dealing with defendants generally, but particularly when dealing with governmental entities, there is a critical difference between conferring cash benefits and non-cash benefits. The difference is critical because the law, in litigating claims of unjust enrichment, is essentially attempting to reconcile the competing values of 1) the defendant\u2019s autonomy or right of choice and 2) the prevention of unjust enrichment. The nature of the benefit affects that balancing. <em>Dobbs, </em>at p. 681, refers to the clash of conflicting values.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">Many of the cases and particular practices make sense if understood as <em>a judicial effort to respect the defendant\u2019s autonomy or rights of choice and self-determination, and at the same time to minimize his unjust enrichment. </em>... In attempting to effectual these ideals, courts have implicitly recognized that <em>not all benefits are alike, </em>and <em>restitution is better ordered for some kinds of benefits than for others.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avs\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Where the benefit conferred is a non-cash benefit, restitution is frequently denied because it would interfere with a defendant\u2019s freedom of choice of whether to \u201cbuy\u201d a particular service or benefit or not. The balancing favors the freedom of choice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">Underlying most of the cases seems to be <em>a strong double commitment to prevent unjust enrichment on the one hand and to protect the defendant\u2019s right of free choice on the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>other. </em>Where the defendant has a right to choose for himself whether to receive a benefit, and <em>where restitution would deprive him of this choice </em>by requiring payment for a \u201cbenefit\u201d the defendant may not want, <em>restitution is often denied. </em>The right of self-determination through personal choices \u2014 that is, personal autonomy \u2014 is central to personal being and growth as well as to the concept of a free society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq3\"><em>Dobbs, </em>at 683 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">This principle is doubly strong in cases in which the defendant is a governmental entity. In this case, the freedom of choice as to whether to \u201cbuy\u201d Alternatives\u2019s services resided not in Ms. Russo or Dr. Morgan but in the Board. It is <em>Gontrum </em>itself that protected the Board\u2019s autonomy not to buy (and to pay for out of public funds) a non-cash benefit, if that is what the unjust enrichment here consisted of. A non-cash benefit poses a problem.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\"><em>Restitution is relatively difficult to recover where the benefit intentionally conferred is neither cash nor a cash equivalent and </em>where the parties are in position to bargain in advance. In this setting the parties\u2019 implicit understandings are often most important. These implicit understandings include those revealed by the parties\u2019 failure to provide for payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\"><em>Dobbs, </em>at p. 682 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">For Alternatives to have conferred a non-cash benefit without having bargained in advance for a precise payment appears to have been foolhardy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\"><em>If the parties could have contracted but did not, the plaintiff generally is denied recovery of the non-cash benefit. </em>If they contracted or had a tacit understanding, then recovery is granted or denied in accord with that understanding .... <em>The absence of a contract between the parties in a position to bargain suggests that in the ordinary case we need have no special sympathy for the plaintiff who confers a non-cash benefit.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-9\"><em>Dobbs, </em>at 690 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Alternatives was in a position to bargain with the Board before proceeding with its program. For strategic reasons it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>chose not to do so. If the benefit it conferred was a non-cash benefit, therefore, it placed itself in an untenable situation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGT\">Nothing in the nature of the circumstances prevented bargaining: the parties knew each other and knew the interests involved; parties were not so numerous that bargaining was infeasible. <em>Where the benefit is intentionally conferred, is not in cash or specific chattels, and the parties are in a position to bargain about compensation, the cases, </em>in line with <em>Ulmer v. Farnsworth, </em>[80 Me. 500, 15 A. 65 (1888) ] <em>deny restitution.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><em>Dobbs, </em>at 693 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">If the benefit conferred on the defendant, however, is a cash benefit, restitution to the plaintiff does not infringe or compromise to the same extent a defendant\u2019s autonomy or freedom of choice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">When the plaintiff confers unsolicited benefits upon another person in the form of cash (or specific recoverable chattels to which the plaintiff retains title), he is usually able to recover restitution. <em>Although the benefit in such cases is unsolicited, recovery of cash does not affect any right of choice in the defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\"><em>[T]he defendant is not required to restore non-cash benefits by paying cash. To do that would be forcing the defendant to \u201cbuy\u201d the benefit. </em>But <em>if the benefit </em>conferred upon the defendant <em>is in the form of cash </em>or cash equivalents, <em>restitution does not infringe his right of choice. He is not being forced to buy a benefit he may not want </em>but on the contrary is asked to return it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\"><em>Dobbs, </em>at 685-86 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">When the benefit is in cash, the case for restitution is far less troubling. When the defendant is a governmental entity, there is no threat to the public treasury because the defendant is not being required to buy anything or to pay out any of its own funds. It is simply required to hand over the easily identifiable cash benefits by which it had been unjustly en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>riched. There is no cost. The public treasury has not been diminished and the status quo has not been disturbed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\">The easiest cases for restitution of unsolicited benefits are those in which the plaintiff mistakenly gives the defendant cash or a specific chattel. In the absence of a changed position, <em>the defendant\u2019s autonomy or right of choice is simply not involved when he returns the cash </em>or the identical chattel. So <em>in that case the unjust enrichment principle prevails because the autonomy principle simply does not come into play.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><em>Dobbs, </em>at 683 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In the most direct and immediate sense, the benefit conferred on the Board by Alternatives consisted of professional services, a non-cash benefit. If that should ultimately be determined to have been the character of the benefit, a claim for unjust enrichment would be barred by the <em>Gontrum </em>rationale. Under <em>Gontrum, </em>the Board cannot be required to expend public funds for services for which it had not lawfully contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">It could be, on the other hand, that the benefit conferred on the Board may be deemed to have been not the non-cash benefit of professional services but an actual cash benefit, to wit, the monetary payments forwarded by the State to the Board as the direct result of those professional services. It may have been an indirect cash benefit as opposed to a direct cash benefit. <em>Dobbs, </em>at 699, throws out such a tantalizing possibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\"><em>In some cases the benefit is conferred as a non-cash benefit but is readily realized as cash without impairing other rights of the recipient. ... </em>When the benefit is realized as cash, the unsolicited character of the benefit no longer poses a reason to deny restitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">The outcome of the trial may well depend upon which of these competing, and critically different, conceptualizations of the benefit is most effectively presented to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The Demand for An Accounting</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">With respect to his earlier dismissal of Count IX, Judge Glynn had stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">Count IX seeking \u201caccounting\u201d does not state a cause of action. Rather, it is a remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Indeed, in pleading Count IX, Alternatives alleged two predicates as bases for its demand for an accounting. One allegation was that there was an \u201cagreement\u201d by which the Board \u201cwould compensate [Alternatives] a per student allotment of State aid for each student enrolled in the program.\u201d Judge Glynn\u2019s dismissal of six other counts, on the basis of <em>Gontrum, v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>182 Md. 370, 35 A.2d 128 (1943), from which dismissals there has been no appeal, established that there was no <em>viable </em>predicate \u201cagreement.\u201d To the extent to which Alternatives might seek to fall back on some notion of an implied-in-fact contract, our earlier analysis has held that the foreclosing effect of <em>Gontrum </em>applies to implied-in-fact contracts as surely as it does to express contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The second predicate alleged by Alternatives was that the Board, through Ms. Russo, was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">under a fiduciary duty to collect the funds from the State and forward them to [Alternatives] pursuant to their agreement. The funds were to be held in trust by [the Board] for the benefit of [Alternatives],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">That allegation is twice flawed. Not only was there no \u201cagreement,\u201d but, as Judge Allison ruled, there was no basis for finding that Ms. Russo, acting for the Board or on her own behalf, was ever in any kind of a fiduciary relationship with Alternatives. Judge Allison ruled that \u201cthere was no fiduciary relationship.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">With respect to the fiduciary duty, the court finds that <em>it is a legal stretch to say that Ms. Russo was acting in a fiduciary capacity </em>when the school system receives state funds that might have under some circumstances been used to compensate the plaintiff. <em>This cause of action is an </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>attempt to imply a fiduciary relationship where none was agreed to, where none was intended. The court finds that there was no fiduciary relationship. </em>And for that reason, summary judgment on count eight as to Ms. Russo is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">(Emphasis supplied). We fully agree with Judge Allison that there was no basis for inferring that either the Board or Ms. Russo was in any sort of confidential relationship with or bore any fiduciary duty toward Alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">It is unnecessary to analyze further the ways in which Alternatives failed to establish substantively what was once the equitable cause of action for accounting. But see, <em>Nagel v. Todd, </em>185 Md. 512, 517, 45 A.2d 326 (1946); <em>Dormay Construction Corp. v. Doric Co., </em>221 Md. 145, 153-54, 156 A.2d 632 (1959); <em>P.V. Properties v. Rock Creek Village, </em>77 Md.App. 77, 89-92, 549 A.2d 403 (1988); <em>Allied Investment Corp. v. Jasen, </em>123 Md.App. 88, 110-11, 716 A.2d 1085 (1998), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>354 Md. 547, 731 A.2d 957 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">All that Alternatives was seeking through Count IX was, in effect, discovery, which might assist it in computing damages if it prevailed on any theory of liability. The standard statement as to when a \u201csuit in equity for an accounting may be maintained\u201d is that in <em>Nagel v. Todd, </em>185 Md. at 517, 45 A.2d 326:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">In <em>Miller\u2019s Equity, </em>Sec. 721, p. 823, it is said (citing <em>Pomeroy </em>): \u201cThe general rule is that a suit in equity for an accounting may be maintained when the remedies at law are inadequate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Alternatives seizes upon that general language of \u201cwhen the remedies at law are inadequate\u201d without pointing out that <em>Nagel v. Todd </em>immediately goes on to specify precisely what it means by remedial inadequacy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\"><em>The instances in which the legal remedies are held to be inadequate are said to be as follows: First, </em>where there are mutual accounts between the plaintiff and the defendant; <em>second, </em>where the accounts are all on one side, but there are circumstances of great complication, or difficulties in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>way of adequate remedy at law; <em>and third, </em>where a fiduciary relation exists between the parties, and a duty rests upon the defendant to render an account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">It is clear that Alternatives\u2019s suit does not qualify under either the first or third instance of remedial inadequacy quoted above. It must rely, if it can, on the second circumstance, to wit, \u201cwhere the accounts are all on one side, but there are circumstances of great complication, or difficulties in the way of adequate remedy at law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We agree with the implicit ruling of Judge Glynn that there was no insurmountable impediment to Alternatives\u2019s ascertaining what, if any, funds the Board had received from the State of Maryland for students enrolled in the Drop-Back-In program operated by Alternatives, but not otherwise enrolled, during the pertinent period. The records of funds paid to the Board by the State were not facts within the exclusive possession of the Board. The Board is a governmental entity, subject to the Maryland Access to Public Records Act requiring the disclosure of financial transactions. Maryland Code Annotated, State Government Article, \u00a7 10-612(a). The documents in the State\u2019s possession showing what funds, if any, it paid to the Board were also public records subject to disclosure under the same statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The claim for the equitable action of an accounting made by alternatives here was almost indistinguishable from that made by the plaintiff, and rejected by the Court of Appeals, in <em>Johnson, v. Bugle Coat, Apron and Linen Service, Inc., </em>191 Md. 268, 60 A.2d 686 (1948). The plaintiff there, a customer of Bugle Linen Service, believed that it had been fraudulently charged for items which had never been delivered to it. The plaintiff sought an equitable accounting, alleging that all of the records were under the control of the Bugle Linen Services.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARz\">Under the terms of the agreement defendant \u201cagreed to count and keep all the records of the number and quantity of each type of linen item rented * * * and to issue statements and account each month for the linens rented\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>plaintiffs \u201cduring the previous months.\u201d <em>\u201cAll the records concerning the number of linen items rented\u201d to plaintiffs were and are \u201cunder the complete and sole care and custody\u201d of defendant and \u201cwere not and are not available to\u201d plaintiffs, and plaintiffs \u201ccannot ascertain\u201d the number through their own efforts.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">191 Md. at 271, 60 A.2d 686 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded, however, that the plaintiff was fully capable of ascertaining, through its own efforts, the information it sought from the defendant by way of an accounting.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">Notwithstanding the allegations that plaintiffs \u201ccannot ascertain through their own efforts\u201d the number of linen items rented to them, ... specific facts shown are that deliveries were accompanied by duplicate receipts, stating quantities purporting to be delivered, one signed by plaintiffs\u2019 stock-clerk, the other retained by plaintiffs. These receipts could be checked by plaintiffs for each delivery.... There is nothing to indicate that defendant has or could have any record of its driver\u2019s frauds ... or any material records or information not already available to plaintiffs from the \u201cdelivery tickets\u201d and the itemized monthly statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIq\">191 Md. at 277, 60 A.2d 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">It is now clear, moreover, that whereas an equitable claim for an accounting once served a necessary discovery function, that function has been superseded by modern rules of discovery. <em>Johnson v. Bugle Linen </em>concluded, 191 Md. at 278, 60 A.2d 686.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">[W]here there is no other ground of equity jurisdiction, <em>a bill for discovery alone has been practically superseded by an adequate, complete and sufficient remedy at law. ... </em>[I]t is sufficient that the new rules furnish means for discovery, at law or in equity, which are broader than the former inherent equity jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">As early as 1917, the Court of Appeals had held, in <em>Becker v. Frederick W. Lipps Co., </em>131 Md. 301, 307, 101 A. 783 (1917), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>that a bill for an equitable accounting, seeking discovery, was properly dismissed because discovery was otherwise available.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A76\">It is clear that the discovery prayed for in the bill would have been available to the plaintiff ... in a Court of law, where the mode of procuring the production of books, papers and testimony is provided for in as ample a manner as in a Court of equity, and <em>where there is an adequate, complete and sufficient remedy pointed out by law, courts of equity will not interpose.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">(Emphasis supplied).

Let it be carefully noted that we are not, by this citation to <em>Inlet Associates, </em>suggesting that equitable estoppel is never available against a municipal corporation. As Chief Judge Murphy pointed out in <em>Inlet Associates, </em>313 Md. at 434, 545 A.2d 1296, \"There is no settled rule in this county as to when, and under what circumstances, equitable estoppel is available against a municipal corporation.\u201d It is simply the case, as Judge Hollander pointed out for this Court in <em>Gregg Neck Yacht Club v. Kent County, </em>137 Md.App. 732, 774, 769 A.2d 982 (2001), \"While municipal corporations are not exempt from application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>equitable estoppel principals, in practice we have applied the doctrine more narrowly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">A decisive criterion in applying equitable estoppel to a municipal corporation is frequently the authority of a municipality\u2019s employee to act on behalf of the municipality. Our citation to <em>Inlet Associates </em>is only intended to underscore the <em>Gontrum </em>principle that equitable estoppel may not be invoked to preclude a governmental entity from asserting a defense that would otherwise be available to it under <em>Gontrum </em>in those cases where the act of an agent or employee purportedly binding the governmental entity was an act that such agent or employee was not authorized to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">On the one hand, equitable estoppel may apply against a municipality \"at least where the acts of its officers are within the scope of their authority.\u201d <em>Berwyn Heights v. Rogers, </em>228 Md. 271, 279-80, 179 A.2d 712 (1962). On the other hand, \"equitable estoppel is not applicable when the limited authority of a public officer has been exceeded, or was unauthorized or wrongful.\u201d <em>Gregg Neck v. Kent County, </em>137 Md.App. at 775, 769 A.2d 982. We are not here concerned with the applicability of equitable estoppel beyond the limited context of <em>Gontrum.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-18\">.
