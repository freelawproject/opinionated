The van contained construction equipment and was littered with alcoholic beverages. Leaving the badly damaged vehicle where it lay, appellant fled the scene of the accident only to return later, in a taxicab, to retrieve his belongings and the equipment. His return, however, was met by more than a wrecked vehicle. A state trooper had arrived and was investigating the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">As the trooper approached the cab, he asked appellant whether he was \u201cMr. Conboy,\u201d the man who the trooper had reason to believe was driving the van at the time of the accident. Inebriated and reeking of alcohol,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant responded, \u201cI\u2019m not David Conboy,\u201d thereby revealing what sober reflection might have helped him conceal \u2014 his true identity. Unaware of how inculpatory this denial was, appellant then insisted that his name was \u201cGeorge Mitchell Unson\u201d \u2014 a less inventive choice than one might think as it apparently belonged to appellant\u2019s step brother, whose reaction to this choice has gone unrecorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Observing a rifle in the backseat of the cab, which would later turn out to be loaded, the trooper asked appellant to step out of the cab. When he did, the trooper patted him down for weapons. Upon feeling a key in appellant\u2019s back pocket, the trooper reached into that pocket and retrieved what would ultimately prove to be the key to the van. That, in turn, led appellant to volunteer that he was drunk and had in fact been the driver of the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Appellant was subsequently charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol and numerous other traffic violations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Seeking to exclude evidence of the key and his statement, he filed a motion to suppress in the Circuit Court for Worcester County, claiming that when the trooper reached into his pocket to retrieve the key the trooper exceeded the bounds of a permissible Terry<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stop and that his ensuing inculpatory statement was obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment. When that motion was denied, appellant was tried upon an agreed statement of facts and convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>He now asks this court to review the refusal of the trial court to suppress these two pieces of evidence. We do so and reach the same result as the trial court did but not necessarily for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">SUPPRESSION MOTION</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The only evidence presented at the suppression hearing was the testimony of State witness, Trooper David Grinnan of the Maryland State Police. He testified that, on May 28, 2002, at approximately 6:02 pm, he responded to a report of \u201ca single vehicle accident at Route 50 and Silver Point Lane in West Ocean City, Worcester County, Maryland.\u201d There, he found an unoccupied \u201colder model Ford van facing eastbound in the westbound ditch, approximately thirty to forty yards past Silver Point Lane.\u201d Badly damaged, the van was almost resting on its side; its driver\u2019s side wheels \u201cripped from the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The trooper observed \u201calcohol containers in the vehicle\u201d and further noted that \u201calcohol had spilled\u201d inside the vehicle, \u201cleaving a strong odor.\u201d In addition to the alcoholic beverages, the van contained a stereo and construction tools and equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The trooper then \u201cran the registration to find out who the vehicle belonged to, who the operator could be.\u201d He learned that the vehicle\u2019s license plates belonged, not to a Ford van as expected, but \u201cto an '85 Chevrolet van ... registered to a subject named Wolf,\u201d who resided in West Ocean City, Maryland. Unable to further identify the owner of the Ford van, the trooper left the accident scene to interview Wolf at the address he had been given. At that address, he found Wolf, who explained that he had removed the license plates from his Chevrolet van and given them to his brother for \u201csafekeeping.\u201d He also informed the trooper that a \u201cDavid Conboy,\u201d who was then staying with his brother, had taken the license plates and placed them on the Ford van in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Leaving Wolf\u2019s residence, Trooper Grinnan returned to the accident scene, arriving 30 to 40 minutes after he had initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>responded to the accident. When he arrived, he observed that the stereo, the construction tools and equipment, and other items had been removed from the van. He concluded that \u201cwhoever had wrecked the van ... was still in the area,\u201d reasoning that removal of all of the equipment would have taken several trips. At the suppression hearing, he opined: \u201c[I]f I was a construction person and I wrecked my van and I had twenty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of equipment in there, I am going to keep going back to the van until my equipment is gone because I am not going to leave the van unattended like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">A taxicab then \u201croll[ed] up\u201d to a nearby stop sign. \u201cThinking that if this person is wrecked he needs to get out of here somehow,\u201d the trooper\u2019s attention shifted to the cab. He saw appellant \u201cin the front passenger\u2019s seat.\u201d Although the taxi cab driver was looking in the trooper\u2019s direction, appellant \u201cwould not look at [him] to save his life.\u201d Indeed, \u201chis head was plastered in the opposite direction from mine,\u201d the trooper noted. Appellant\u2019s \u201ccontinued\u201d refusal to \u201cacknowledge\u201d the trooper, the crash, or the trooper\u2019s marked and well-lit cruiser, only \u201csparked [the trooper\u2019s] curiosity.\u201d After all, according to the trooper, \u201cwhen you have that situation, everybody wants to look.\u201d Trooper Grinnan then \u201cpointed the cab over to investigate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Approaching appellant, who was still seated in the passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle, the trooper asked, \u201cMr. Conboy?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cI\u2019m not David Conboy\u201d and then identified himself as \u201cGeorge Mitchell Unson,\u201d using his stepbrother\u2019s name. According to the trooper, appellant \u201cappeared intoxicated,\u201d and he detected a \u201cstrong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from [appellant\u2019s] breath and person.\u201d A deer rifle and a bottle of Popov vodka lay on the backseat of the cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">After appellant explained that the rifle was his and that he liked to hunt, the trooper asked appellant to step out of the cab. When he did, the trooper \u201cpatted him down ... to make sure that [appellant] did not have any other kind of weapons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>that may be associated with deer hunting, such as buck knives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">During the pat down, the trooper felt an object in appellant\u2019s back pocket. He \u201cimmediately recognized\u201d that it was \u201ca key of some type,\u201d possibly a car key. \u201c[B iased on the fact that the collision had occurred\u201d and that a vehicle lay \u201cunattended in the ditch,\u201d the trooper placed his hand in appellant\u2019s pocket and retrieved the key. The key turned out to be \u201ca Ford key, belonging to a Ford motor vehicle.\u201d After directing appellant to sit on the ground, the trooper returned to the van with the key. He then \u201cchecked the Ford key with the van and turned the ignition over and discovered that the key was, in fact, the key to the [wrecked] van.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">As he returned to where appellant was sitting, Trooper Grinnan remarked, \u201cit\u2019s funny, the key fits.\u201d Appellant \u201cshrugged\u201d and \u201cthrew his hands up and said ... \u2018what would you do?\u2019 \u201d Then, according to the trooper, appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtvI\">indicated that he was, in fact, driving the vehicle, and that the rear end locked up and he believed the drive shaft fell out, and the vehicle rotated and came to rest in the ditch. And that he had fled the scene because he was drunk. And then he said, \u201cwhat would you do?\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Trooper Grinnan placed appellant under arrest. Following the arrest, a person who was only identified as \u201cTrooper Sutka\u201d arrived at the scene of the accident and took possession of the rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the findings of fact made by the circuit court, unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See Riddick v. State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239 (1990); <em>Marr v. State, </em>134 Md.App. 152, 163, 759 A.2d 327 (2000). Our review is based solely upon the record developed at the suppression hearing, and we review that record in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>See Wengert v. State, </em>364 Md. 76, 84, 771 A.2d 389 (2001); <em>Trott v. State, </em>138 Md.App. 89, 97, 770 A.2d 1045 (2001). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>review <em>de novo, </em>however, all legal conclusions, making our own independent constitutional determination of whether the search in question was lawful and whether appellant\u2019s statement was lawfully obtained. <em>See Wengert, </em>864 Md. at 84, 771 A.2d 389; <em>Trott, </em>138 Md.App. at 97, 770 A.2d 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">ADMISSIBILITY OF THE KEY</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">While Appellant concedes that \u201cthe trooper had reason to feel [his] clothing for weapons,\u201d he contends that the trooper exceeded the limits of a <em>Terry </em>frisk by \u201ctaking a key from [his] pocket.\u201d He argues that because the \u201c \u2018incriminating nature of the object [the key] was not immediately apparent\u2019 \u201d to the trooper, the search was not constitutionally permissible under the plain feel doctrine, as promulgated by the Supreme Court in <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In <em>Dickerson, </em>the Supreme Court extended the boundaries of the <em>a </em>\u201cpatdown\u201d to allow seizure of contraband discovered during a lawful <em>Terry </em>search as long as the contraband\u2019s \u201cincriminating character is immediately apparent\u201d by sight or touch. 508 U.S. at 375, 113 S.Ct. 2130. But if the incriminating nature of the item cannot be discerned without further physical investigation, then the seizure of the object cannot be justified under the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine or its corollary, \u201cplain feel.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">In support of his claim that the \u201cincriminating nature\u201d of the key was \u201cnot immediately apparent,\u201d as required by a \u201cplain feel\u201d seizure, appellant cites the following testimonial excerpt to show that Trooper Grinnan did not know, at the time he reached into appellant\u2019s pocket, that the key he felt, during the pat down, was even a car key, let alone the key to the disabled van:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">[PROSECUTOR:] Did you take any precautions as a result of having seen the weapon on the back seat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">[TROOPER GRINNAN:] Yes, I did. I asked Mr. Conboy if he had any other weapons in his possession, and he indicated that he did not. I patted him down, his external <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>garments, to make sure that he did not have any other kind of weapons that maybe associated with deer hunting, such as buck knives, those sorts of things, that are commonly carried by hunters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">[Prosecutor:] What was Mr. Conboy wearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">[TROOPER GRINNAN:] He had shorts and a dirty tee shirt on, I believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">[PROSECUTOR:] Did you locate any other weapons on him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">[TROOPER GRINNAN:] No weapons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">[PROSECUTOR:] Did you locate any other evidence on him that would relate to the initial incident that you were investigating?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">[TROOPER GRINNAN:] That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqv\">[PROSECUTOR:] What did you learn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">[TROOPER GRINNAN:] During a pat down, I believe \u2014 I have to refer to my report, I believe it was his back pocket of his shorts \u2014 that\u2019s correct, in the rear pocket of his shorts, I felt what I immediately recognized as a car key, or key of some type, not necessarily a car key, but it was a key. And based on the fact that the collision had occurred and I had a vehicle that was unattended in the ditch, I retrieved the key from his pocket, and I observed that it was a Ford key, belonging to a Ford motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-12\">[PROSECUTOR:] All right. What did you do with the key?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az4L\">[TROOPER GRINNAN:] At this point, Trooper Sutka had arrived. No, correction, Trooper Sutka had not arrived at this point. I checked the Ford key with the van and turned the ignition over and discovered that the key was, in fact, the key to the van.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">The trial court disagreed with appellant\u2019s conclusion. It upheld the search, stating that \u201cin the process of the pat down, if [the trooper] discovers something that is certainly relevant, such as the key that may fit the vehicle that they can\u2019t find the driver for, [the trooper] has the right to go ahead and seize the key.\u201d We agree with the circuit court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The trooper\u2019s seizure of the key did not violate the Fourth Amendment \u2014 but not for the reasons espoused by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The plain feel doctrine, although often described as a corollary of the plain view doctrine, poses special problems of its own. In a nutshell, plain feel is more intrusive yet less conclusive than plain view. But we need not reach the question of whether the seizure of the key was justifiable under that doctrine today, because the search at issue is sustainable under another exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. It was a search incident to a lawful arrest. And, on that ground, we shall affirm the decision of the circuit court. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a); <em>Modecki v. State, </em>138 Md.App. 372, 771 A.2d 521 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We begin our discussion of the propriety of the search at issue by observing that a police officer with probable cause to believe that a suspect has or is committing a crime may arrest the suspect without a warrant. <em>See Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949). This is true in cases where the person \u201chas committed even a very minor criminal offense,\u201d such as a traffic violation. <em>Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, </em>532 U.S. 318, 354, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001). Once lawfully arrested, police may search \u201cthe person of the arrestee\u201d as well as \u201cthe area within the control of the arrestee\u201d to remove any weapons or evidence that could be concealed or destroyed. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 224, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). Moreover, as long as police have probable cause to arrest before they search the arrestee, it is not \u201cparticularly important that the search precede the arrest rather than vice versa.\u201d <em>Rawlings v. Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 111, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980); <em>see Lee v. State, </em>311 Md. 642, 668, 537 A.2d 235 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In his comprehensive multi-volume work, <em>Search and Seizure, </em>Professor Wayne R. LaFave explains why federal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>state<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> courts have rejected any test that would require that an arrest always precede the search at issue, before invoking this exception. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment, </em>vol. 3, \u00a7 5.4, at 152-55 (3d ed. 1996 &amp; Supp.2004). He begins his explanation by quoting from the concurring opinion of Justice John Marshall Harlan in <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968), and the opinion authored by Justice Roger Traynor in <em>People v. Simon, </em>45 Cal.2d 645, 290 P.2d 531 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Their words bear repeating. In his <em>Sibron </em>concurrence, Justice Harlan observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">Of course, the fruits of a search may not be used to justify an arrest to which it is incident, but this means only that probable cause to arrest must precede the search. If the prosecution shows probable cause to arrest prior to a search of a man\u2019s person, it has met its total burden. There is <em>no </em>case in which a defendant may validly say, \u201cAlthough the officer had a right to arrest me at the moment when he seized me and searched my person, the search is invalid because he did not in fact arrest me until afterwards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At_\"><em>Sibron, </em>392 U.S. at 77, 88 S.Ct. 1889 (Harlan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u201c[Tjhe proposition stated by Justice Harlan,\u201d Professor LaFave points out, \u201cdoes not broaden the power of the police, but instead gives some added measure of protection to those reasonably but mistakenly suspected of criminal behavior.\u201d <em>See </em>LaFave, <em>supra, </em>vol. 3, \u00a7 5.4, at 154. That point, the professor notes, was also made by Justice Traynor in <em>People v. Simon, </em>45 Cal.2d 645, 290 P.2d 531 (1955). <em>See id. </em>In that case, Justice Traynor wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>[I]f the officer is entitled to make an arrest on the basis of information available to him before he searches, and as an incident to that arrest is entitled to make a reasonable search of the person arrested and the place where he is arrested, there is nothing unreasonable in his conduct if he makes the search before instead of after the arrest. In fact, if the person searched is innocent and the search convinces the officer that his reasonable belief to the contrary is erroneous, it is to the advantage of the person searched not to be arrested. On the other hand, if he is not innocent or the search does not establish his innocence, the security of his person, house, papers, or effects suffers no more from a search preceding his arrest than it would from the same search following it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\"><em>Simon, </em>45 Cal.2d at 648, 290 P.2d 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">And that reasoning led the Supreme Court to declare, in <em>Rawlings v. Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 111, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980), that, \u201cwhere the formal arrest followed quickly on the heels of the challenged search of petitioner\u2019s person, we do not believe it particularly important that the search preceded the arrest rather than vice versa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In <em>Rawlings, </em>during a warrant-authorized search of a house, one of the occupants was ordered to empty her purse. 448 U.S. at 101, 100 S.Ct. 2556. When she did, it was observed to contain controlled substances. <em>Id. </em>The occupant then turned to Rawlings, who was standing nearby, and told him \u201cto take what was his.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rawlings \u201cimmediately claimed ownership\u201d of the drugs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The police arrested Rawlings but not before searching him and finding $4,500 and a knife. <em>Id. </em>The pre-arrest search of Rawlings\u2019 person was subsequently upheld as a valid search incident to an arrest, regardless of the fact that it had preceded his arrest, a distinction which the Court, as previously noted, did not feel was \u201cparticularly important.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 111, 100 S.Ct. 2556.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The lesson of <em>Rawlings </em>has not been lost on Maryland\u2019s appellate courts. WTien the issue of such pre-arrest searches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>has arisen, they have upheld them so long as a lawful arrest followed the search. <em>See Lee, </em>311 Md. at 668, 537 A.2d 235; <em>Wilson v. State, </em>150 Md.App. 658, 822 A.2d 1247 (2003); <em>Anderson v. State, </em>78 Md.App. 471, 553 A.2d 1296 (1989). As to how quickly the arrest must follow the search, Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have approved searches when the arrest occurred immediately after the search, <em>see, e.g., Lee, </em>311 Md. at 668, 537 A.2d 235; <em>Wilson, </em>150 Md.App. at 674, 822 A.2d 1247, and when it occurred \u201ca few minutes\u201d later. <em>Anderson, </em>78 Md.App. at 487, 553 A.2d 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">As in <em>Rawlings, </em>the pre-arrest search at issue here was a valid search incident to a lawful arrest. In response to a question at the suppression hearing, Trooper Grinnan stated that he had arrested appellant for \u201cleaving the scene of a property damage collision.\u201d There is no provision of the Maryland Code that authorizes an officer to arrest a driver for leaving the scene of an accident where the property damage caused by the accident is confined to the driver\u2019s vehicle. But that misstatement is of no consequence. It does not vitiate the lawfulness of appellant\u2019s arrest, as that arrest \u201cwas otherwise justified.\u201d <em>Nieves v. State, </em>\u2014 Md.App.-,-, \u2014- A.2d-, 2003 WL 23004983, at *5 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Moreover, it is clear from the trooper\u2019s testimony that his response was never intended to be a complete statement of all of the reasons he arrested appellant. Indeed, he testified that, before arresting appellant, appellant had confessed to driving while under the influence of alcohol. The clear implication of the trooper\u2019s testimony was that he arrested appellant for more than simply \u201cleaving the scene of a property damage collision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In any event, at the time of appellant\u2019s arrest, the trooper had probable cause to arrest appellant for driving under the influence of alcohol before he searched him and, as in <em>Rawlings, </em>that arrest \u201cfollowed quickly on the heels\u201d of the search at issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Before Trooper Grinnan even encountered appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>lant, he observed that someone had crashed a van, strewn with alcoholic beverages, into a ditch and then apparently abandoned it. He also believed that the driver of the van was probably in the area as he observed, upon his return from a brief meeting with the owner of the van\u2019s tags, that the property that had been in the van was now gone. And, from the information that he obtained from the tags owner, he obviously believed that there was a reasonable possibility that \u201cDavid Conboy\u201d was the driver of the van at the time of the accident. That is why, we can presume, he approached the cab\u2019s passenger asking \u201cMr. Conboy?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">When a taxicab pulled up and its passenger steadfastly refused to look in the trooper\u2019s direction, notwithstanding the uncommon sight of a badly damaged van and a well-lit police car, the trooper understandably suspected that this individual might be the \u201cDavid Conboy\u201d he was seeking. So he approached appellant, inquiring \u201cMr. Conboy?\u201d whereupon appellant unwittingly confirmed the trooper\u2019s suspicions by responding, \u201cI\u2019m not David Conboy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Moreover, appellant was at the scene of the accident just after the removal of property from the van. He arrived there in a taxicab, providing the trooper with an explanation of how the van\u2019s driver was able to leave the scene of the accident. At that time, appellant admitted to owning the property in the back seat of the cab, which was the sort of property, particularly the bottle of vodka, that had been removed from the van. And, as if that were not enough, he appeared to be intoxicated and, given the presence of full and empty containers of alcohol inside the van and the condition of the van, the trooper had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>every reason to believe the van\u2019s driver was too. In sum, the trooper had probable cause to believe that the badly damaged van, which was littered with alcoholic beverages, had apparently been in an alcohol-related accident and that the still inebriated appellant had been the driver of that vehicle. In short, the officer had probable cause to arrest appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Not only was the search of appellant performed after the trooper had probable cause to arrest, but appellant\u2019s arrest occurred within minutes of that search, satisfying both requirements of <em>Rawlings: </em>that there was probable cause to arrest and that the arrest \u201cfollowed quickly on the heels\u201d of the search. Once the trooper retrieved the key, he went directly over to the van, placed the key in its ignition, and then returned to place appellant under arrest. As the seizure of the key and the arrest of appellant occurred within minutes of <em>each </em>other, the arrest did in fact, as required by <em>Rawlings, </em>follow quickly on the heels of the search. <em>See, e.g., Anderson, </em>78 Md.App. at 487, 553 A.2d 1296. It was therefore a lawful search incident to an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">ADMISSIBILITY OF THE STATEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his statement to police that he was drunk when he crashed the van and fled the scene. He argues that, following the seizure of the van\u2019s key from his pocket, the investigatory stop evolved into a custodial detention. That change, he maintains, required that he be given his \u201cMiranda warnings\u201d before any further words were exchanged between him and the police. Because these warnings were not given, he claims that his admission of intoxication should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">In the landmark case of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), the Supreme Court held that statements obtained during the \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d of a suspect were not admissible unless he or she had been previously informed of certain constitutional rights. The Court then defined \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d as \u201cquestioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Miranda, 384 U.S. </em>at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Eponymously dubbed <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings,\u201d they require the suspect be told that \u201che has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Stansbury v. California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 322, 114 S.Ct. 1526,128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994). But these warnings are required only when the person questioned is both in custody and about to be interrogated. <em>See Stansbury, </em>511 U.S. at 322, 114 S.Ct. 1526.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"> To determine if a person is in custody, the trial court must make \u201ctwo discrete inquiries.\u201d <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 210-11, 821 A.2d 439 (2003). First, the court must consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, such as when and where it took place, how long it lasted, how many officers were present, what the police and the defendant said and did, and whether physical restraints or force was used to detain the defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 208, 821 A.2d 439; <em>see also Stansbury, </em>511 U.S. at 322, 114 S.Ct. 1526. And then, in light of those circumstances, the court must consider whether a reasonable person would have felt \u201che or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d <em>Rucker, </em>374 Md. at 210-11, 821 A.2d 439. If the answer to that question is \u201cyes\u201d, then the questioning was custodial. <em>See id. </em>On the other hand, what an officer may or may not feel about the nature of the detention is irrelevant. A police officer\u2019s unarticulated subjective views that the person questioned is a suspect and that he is not free to leave have no bearing on whether the suspect is in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda.\u201d See Stansbury, </em>511 U.S. at 323-24,114 S.Ct. 1526.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">We next turn to the second part of the <em>Miranda </em>test: whether the statement at issue was elicited by an interrogation. \u201cInterrogation\u201d includes not only \u201cexpress questioning\u201d but \u201cits functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300-01, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>(1980). The \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of interrogation includes \u201cany words or actions on the part of the police ... that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 801, 100 S.Ct. 1682. In determining whether the police should have known that their words or actions would elicit an incriminating response from the suspect, courts must consider the intent of the police in making the statement or performing the action, whether the police had knowledge of a suspect\u2019s \u201cunusual susceptibility\u201d to persuasion, and whether the police invited the suspect to respond to their statements or actions. <em>See id. </em>at 302, 100 S.Ct. 1682. Indeed, interrogation \u201cmust reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself,\u201d and a suspect\u2019s incriminating response must be \u201cthe product of words or actions on the part of police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 303, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 821 A.2d 439 (2003), the Court of Appeals considered whether Rucker was in custody for Miranda purposes when he was detained briefly in a public parking lot. In this case, the defendant was suspected of possessing and distributing crack cocaine in Prince Georges County. <em>Rucker, </em>374 Md. at 203, 821 A.2d 439. Based upon a tip from a confidential informant that Rucker was distributing crack cocaine and would be at particular shopping center, the police were at the shopping in question on the date and at the time given by the informant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Spotting Rucker, from the description given by the informant, the police stopped him in the shopping center parking lot as he was getting into his car. <em>Id. </em>at 204, 821 A.2d 439. One of the officers, armed and in uniform, asked him for his license and vehicle registration. Rucker complied and handed them to the officer. <em>Id. </em>Then, without first advising him of his <em>\u201cMiranda </em>rights,\u201d two narcotics detectives approached Rucker and asked him \u201cif he had anything that he was not supposed to have.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rucker replied, \u201cYes, 1 do, it\u2019s in my pocket ... [its] cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After retrieving the cocaine from his pocket, the police arrested Rucker. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Affirming the trial court\u2019s decision to suppress Rucker\u2019s statements, this Court held that the parking lot detention of Rucker was more than an investigatory stop because it had become the functional equivalent of an arrest by the time Rucker admitted to possessing cocaine, requiring <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See id. </em>The Court of Appeals, however, disagreed. <em>See id. </em>Observing that the entire incident occurred in a public place, that it took place within a short period of time, that there were only three officers present, that the return of the license and registration was not conditioned upon cooperation, and that only a single, non-coercive question was asked of Rucker before he made the statements at issue, the Court of Appeals found that the defendant \u201cwas not in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>because he was not restrained to a degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 221, 821 A.2d 439. Consequently, the police were not required to give the <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings\u201d to appellant. <em>See id. </em>at 221, 821 A.2d 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Like Rucker, appellant was not subject to \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d because he was not in custody at the time he admitted to being drunk. When Trooper Grinnan stopped the taxi, he executed a lawful <em>Terry </em>stop to investigate appellant\u2019s presence and unusual behavior at the accident scene. That investigatory stop had not evolved into a formal arrest or a \u201crestraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest\u201d before appellant made the statement at issue. Stansbury, 511 U.S. at 322, 114 S.Ct. 1526. Also, like Rucker, appellant was detained on a busy public street during daylight hours, his detention lasted for a short period of time, and there was only one trooper at the scene conducting the investigation. And, finally, prior to the statement, appellant was not placed in handcuffs or otherwise physically restrained; he merely was asked to sit on the ground. That the trooper considered appellant a suspect and that he felt appellant was not \u201cfree to leave\u201d have no bearing on the custody issue because the trooper did not communicate those views to appellant. Thus, the totality of the circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s statement indicate that appellant was not in custo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>dy for <em>Miranda </em>purposes when he made he made the statement at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Having determined that appellant was not in custody at the time that he admitted to driving while intoxicated, we now turn to the question of whether that statement was \u201cthe product\u201d of interrogation, either \u201cexpress questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682. Clearly, it was not. While appellant sat on the ground as instructed, the trooper walked over to the van and placed the key in the ignition. When the key proved to be the van\u2019s ignition key, the trooper walked back, stating \u201cit\u2019s funny, the key fits.\u201d That statement was merely an observation made without inviting a response. <em>See Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 302-03, 100 S.Ct. 1682 (finding that a conversation between two police officers regarding the location of the gun used in a robbery and murder, which took place in Innis\u2019 presence after he was arrested, was not interrogation because they were \u201ca few off hand remarks\u201d to which \u201cno response was invited\u201d). Appellant nonetheless did respond, stating that \u201che fled the scene because he was drunk.\u201d Moreover, there is no evidence that the trooper intended to elicit an incriminating response from appellant or should have known that appellant would respond to his remark. Accordingly, we find that appellant\u2019s statement was not the product of interrogation, and therefore the trial court properly admitted his statement into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

The vehicle involved in the accident was a 1978 Ford van, which was facing eastbound on the westbound side of the road and was extensively damaged, with its \u201ccontents shaken up extensively.\u201d Inside the van, Trooper Grinnan saw stereo equipment, construction tools, and an extension cord. The trooper also observed \u201calcohol containers in the vehicle, some carrying alcohol, and the alcohol had spilled leaving a strong odor of alcohol.\u201d As far as the record reveals, he observed nothing else concerning alcohol containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Trooper Grinnan discovered that the tag for the 1978 Ford van belonged to a 1985 Chevrolet, which was registered to a \u201cMr. Wolf,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> who lived nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Trooper Grinnan went to Wolfs home to question him about the tags. Wolf told Trooper Grinnan that the license plates to the 1985 Chevrolet had been hidden under a sofa seat at his brother\u2019s house; he also said that David Conboy had been staying at his brother\u2019s house. In the trooper\u2019s words, Wolf \u201cindicated that Mr. Conboy had gone under the sofa, to his belief, and removed the tag and placed it on the van.\u201d So far as is reflected in the record, Wolf did not say when David <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Conboy placed the tag on the vehicle, nor did he provide a description of Conboy.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Trooper Grinnan\u2019s trip to Wolfs house and back to the accident scene took \u201c30 to 40\u201d minutes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He returned to the accident scene at \u201c6:40-6:45 [p.m.],\u201d whereupon he discovered that construction tools, stereo equipment, and an extension cord that he had seen thirty or forty minutes previously were missing. This led Trooper Grinnan to believe that \u201cwhoever had wrecked the van\u201d had retrieved some of the property and was likely to still be in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The trooper did not testify that from the information he obtained from Wolf he believed that there was a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that a \u201cDavid Conboy was more than likely the driver of the van at the time of the accident.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>op. at 368, 843 A.2d at 225. Moreover, as far as the record shows, he possessed no facts that he could have utilized to arrive at the latter conclusion. After all, Wolf simply said that, to his belief, David Conboy put the tag on the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Insofar as it concerns Trooper Grinnan\u2019s knowledge regarding the relationship between alcohol and the accident, the only thing the trooper knew prior to appellant\u2019s arrival was that the van had been transporting alcohol. No \u201copen containers\u201d of alcohol were observed in the van except insofar as broken containers can be considered to be \u201copen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\n<em>Facts Learned by Trooper Grinnan fi-orn the Time Appellant Arrived at the Scene to the Conclusion of the Search</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The appellant arrived near the accident scene as the front-seat passenger in a cab. Although the taxi driver looked in the direction of the -wrecked van and at Trooper Grinnan, appellant looked in the opposite direction, which in the trooper\u2019s opinion was both unusual and suspicious, because \u201cmost people are nosy.\u201d The trooper reasoned: (1) valuable construction equipment like that in the wrecked van was unlikely to be abandoned by its possessor; (2) it would take \u201cmore than one trip\u201d to retrieve all the construction equipment; (3) whoever had driven the van was likely to still be \u201cin the area\u201d; (4) taking a cab would be a good way to transport the construction equipment; (5) therefore, the incurious passenger in the cab might well be the driver of the wrecked van. That reasoning led Trooper Grinnan to signal the cab driver to pull the taxicab to the side of the road so that he could investigate further.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">When he approached the passenger side of the cab, the officer said \u201cMr. Conboy.\u201d The passenger replied, \u201cI\u2019m not David Conboy.\u201d The passenger then said his name was \u201cMitch Unson.\u201d Upon further questioning, he gave his name as \u201cGeorge Mitchell Unson.\u201d In fact, the passenger\u2019s real name was David Nolan Conboy, but this was not discovered immediately.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Trooper Grinnan then asked appellant questions concerning whether he had been driving the van, where he hailed the cab, his purpose for being in the area, and whether he knew anything about the accident. The record does not reveal appellant\u2019s responses to those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>During this period of questioning, Trooper Grinnan noticed that appellant appeared intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol. Also, the trooper observed a 270-caliber deer rifle and a bottle of Popov vodka on the backseat of the taxicab. Appellant said that those items belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Trooper Grinnan told appellant to step from the cab. After appellant complied, the trooper asked him if he had any other weapons in his possession. Conboy responded in the negative. Trooper Grinnan then performed a pat-down of appellant\u2019s exterior clothing to make sure he did not have any weapons associated with deer hunting, such as a buck knife or similar weapons. He found no weapons but did feel a key \u201cof some sort\u201d in appellant\u2019s rear pants pocket. He extracted the key and saw that it \u201cbelonged to a Ford motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The trooper explained why he took the key out of appellant\u2019s pocket by saying: \u201cBased on the fact that the collision had occurred and I had a vehicle that was unattended in the ditch, 1 retrieved the key from his pocket.\u201d From that answer, coupled with what he did immediately thereafter, the only logical inference that can be drawn is that Trooper Grinnan extracted the key so that he could find out whether his suspicion (that the incurious cab passenger was the driver of the wrecked van) was accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">\n<em>Testimony at Suppression Hearing as to What Happened After the Retrieval of the Key</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Trooper Grinnan walked over to the wrecked van, tried the key in the ignition, and found that the key fit. He then walked back to where appellant was sitting and said, \u201cIt\u2019s funny, the key fits.\u201d Appellant then confessed that he had been driving the van and had fled the accident scene because he was drunk. Appellant was then arrested for \u201cleaving the scene of a property damage accident.\u201d As the majority correctly notes, \u201cThere is no provision of the Maryland Code that authorizes an officer to arrest a driver for leaving the scene of [an] accident where the property damage caused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>accident is confined to the driver\u2019s vehicle.\u201d (Op. at 367, 843 A.2d 224.) Moreover, as far as I can determine, it is neither a crime nor a traffic violation to leave the scene of a one-car accident of this type.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Trooper Grinnan did not learn the identity of the owner of the wrecked vehicle until several days after appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">At the suppression hearing, neither counsel, the motions judge, nor Trooper Grinnan even mentioned the fact that appellant faced an alcohol-related charge. The closest anyone came to the subject was when appellant\u2019s counsel said that appellant faced \u201ctraffic charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\n<em>Probable Cause to Arrest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\u201cProbable cause, we have frequently stated, is a nontechnical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>A finding of probable cause requires less evidence than is necessary to sustain a conviction, but more evidence than would merely arouse suspicion. Our determination of whether probable cause exists requires a nontechnical, common sense evaluation of the totality of the circumstances in a given situation in light of the facts found to be credible by the trial judge. Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances taken as a whole would lead a reasonably cautious person to believe that a felony had been or is being committed by the person arrested. Therefore, to justify a warrantless arrest the police must point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warranted the intrusion. <em>To determine whether an officer had probable cause in a specific case, here probable cause to search, \u201cthe reviewing court 'necessarily must relate the information known to the officer to the elements of the offense that the officer believed was being or had been committed.\u201d DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 32, 729 A.2d 354, 361 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><em>State v. Wallace, </em>372 Md. 137, 148-50, 812 A.2d 291 (2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 1036, 157 L.Ed.2d 951 (2004) (emphasis added) (some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The rule that, in considering whether the \u201csearch incident\u201d exception is applicable, the court should direct its probable cause focus upon \u201cthe information known to the officers ... [regarding] the elements of the offense that the officer believed was being or had been committed\u201d is here important. The majority ignores the issue of what crime Trooper Grinnan actually believed had been committed prior to the search and focuses, instead, on what offense Trooper Grinnan <em>might have </em>believed had been committed. <em>See </em>op. at 367-68, 843 A.2d at 225. In my view, this focus is misdirected.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Trooper Grinnan, the sole witness at the suppression hearing, gave no hint during his testimony that at any time prior to appellant\u2019s confession he believed that appellant had driven the van while under the influence of alcohol. The evidence showed that prior to the search, Trooper Grinnan suspected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>that appellant might have been the driver of the wrecked van and that, if he was the driver, he had left the scene of a property-damage accident, which he thought was a crime. Self-evidently, a search incident to an arrest for behavior that is not a crime is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Even if the majority is correct when it focuses upon the issue of whether there was probable cause to arrest appellant (prior to the search) for driving under the influence of alcohol, probable cause for an arrest as to that charge did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The majority\u2019s discussion as to why it concludes otherwise is set forth at Pages 367-69, 843 A.2d at 224-25 of the opinion. Two central \u201cfacts\u201d advanced in support of the conclusion that Trooper Grinnan had probable cause to believe that appellant had wrecked the van are: (1) Trooper Grinnan believed from information he received from Wolf that there was a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that a David Conboy was more than likely the driver of the van at the time of the accident, op. at 368, 843 A.2d at 225, and (2) appellant\u2019s statement that he was <em>not </em>David Conboy \u201cunwittingly confirmed the trooper\u2019s suspicions\u201d that he was David Conboy. <em>Id. </em>Trooper Grinnan never said that his conversation with Wolf led him to believe that, more than likely, David Conboy. drove the van at the time of the accident. Because the record is so sparse as to what he was told by Wolf, we have no way of knowing whether he, in fact, held that belief. For all we know, Trooper Grinnan\u2019s question may have been a \u201cshot in the dark.\u201d Moreover, Trooper Grinnan never said that appellant\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not David Conboy\u201d response confirmed appellant\u2019s identity as David Conboy. The <em>only </em>testimony regarding the \u201cI\u2019m not David Conboy\u201d answer was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">Q. Did you initially make contact with the cab driver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">A. I initially made contact via the passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle. So my first contact is with the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">Q. And what did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">A. I said Mr. Conboy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">Q. And what was his response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">A. He said I\u2019m not David Conboy, I\u2019m George, or I\u2019m Mitch Unson, is that he had said to me. Later he gave a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>full name of George Mitchell Unson, who I later determined was his stepbrother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">Q. And he used the name David Conboy when you had just used the last name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">A. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Depending on factors such as the size of the community where inquiry is made and how common the surname, there <em>may </em>be some circumstances where one can infer, legitimately, that a denial of one\u2019s identity means the opposite. For instance, if an officer confronts a sober adult on the streets of New York City and says, \u201cMr. Smith?\u201d and the response is, \u201cI\u2019m not Horatio Smith,\u201d one might possibly infer that the person is, most likely, Horatio Smith. But if, as here, the surname is uncommon, the locale is suburban-residential (about one-third of the way between Ocean City and Berlin, Maryland), and the person responding is drunk, the suggested inference cannot be drawn legitimately. And, in any event, there is <em>no indication </em>that Trooper Grinnan drew the suggested inference,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> at the point appellant was searched. After Trooper Grinnan got that response, he asked appellant whether he had been driving the van, whether he knew anything about the accident, where he hailed the cab, and why he was in the area. Based on this record, we do not know what appellant said in response to the questions, much less what Trooper Grinnan made of appellant\u2019s responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">What we do know is that Trooper Grinnan said that at the time of the search, he merely \u201chad a feeling [that there] was a possibility that he [appellant] was a suspect.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Based on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>answer, coupled with all the other circumstances, I believe that, at the time of the search, Trooper Grinnan merely had, at most, a reasonable suspicion, not probable cause, to believe appellant had wrecked the van.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Even assuming that the trooper had probable cause to believe that appellant wrecked the van, I do not believe that the trooper, prior to appellant\u2019s confession, had probable cause to believe that appellant had driven the van <em>while under the influence of alcohol. </em>The majority lists several facts in support of a contrary conclusion, <em>viz: </em>(1) appellant \u201cappeared intoxicated\u201d when Trooper Grinnan first saw him, which was forty to forty-five minutes after Trooper Grinnan first arrived at the accident scene; (2) the bottle of vodka in the back seat of the cab \u201cwas the sort of property that had been removed from the van\u201d; and (3) given the fact that appellant was then intoxicated, coupled with the fact that the trooper saw \u201cfull and empty containers of alcohol,\u201d the trooper \u201chad every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>reason to believe\u201d that the person who rode in the cab was intoxicated when the accident occurred. Op. at 368-69, 843 A.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">There was no evidence that alcohol containers were removed from the van post-accident (Fact 2). The evidence concerning alcohol containers was that Trooper Grinnan saw \u201calcohol containers in the vehicle, some carrying alcohol.\u201d From this, it can be inferred that some of the alcohol containers did not carry alcohol, but we do not know whether that was because the containers were broken in the crash or whether someone drank their contents. Moreover, even if one were to conclude that there was at least one empty container whose contents had been imbibed, we do not know if the trooper saw one empty container or ten, nor do we know what was in the containers. This leaves the facts that were proven: The appellant smelled strongly of alcohol and \u201cappeared intoxicated\u201d when Trooper Grinnan saw him at the accident scene. The accident, of course, took place before Trooper Grinnan arrived. Even if one were to assume that the accident occurred just moments before the trooper arrived (an unlikely scenario), I do not believe that one can infer legitimately that a person who presently \u201cappeared intoxicated\u201d was therefore intoxicated forty to forty-five minutes previously. To make such an inference, more information would be needed, such as information concerning what alcoholic beverage was imbibed and the amount.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">Probable cause is lacking if the circumstances relied on are \u201csusceptible to a variety of credible interpretations not necessarily compatible with nefarious activities.\u201d <em>United States v. Kandlis, </em>432 F.2d 132, 136, (9th Cir.1970), quoting <em>United States v. Selby, </em>... 407 F.2d [241,] 243 [ (1977) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQs\"><em>United States v. Moore, </em>483 F.2d 1361, 1363 (9th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">At the time appellant was searched, appellant\u2019s words and actions were susceptible of a variety of explanations inconsistent with having driven the van while under the influence of alcohol. Thus, at that point, Trooper Grinnan did not have probable cause to arrest him for that traffic offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\n<em>The Timing of the Arrest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Although the precise timing is not shown in the record, appellant\u2019s arrest probably took place only one or two minutes after the search. Therefore, the search was \u201cessentially contemporaneous\u201d with the arrest.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, I concede that the temporal element of the \u201csearch incident\u201d exception was met. But as this Court said about two and one-half years ago, meeting the temporal element is not enough. <em>State v. Funkhouser, </em>140 Md.App. 696, 782 A.2d 387 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In <em>Funkhouser, </em>the defendant\u2019s vehicle was stopped for a traffic violation; the police officer ordered the defendant out of the car, and the defendant complied with the order. <em>Id. </em>at 108, 782 A.2d 387. The officer then had a \u201ccocaine-sniffing canine\u201d scan the vehicle for the presence of cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 708, 782 A.2d 387. The dog gave a positive alert at both the front passenger door and the driver\u2019s door. <em>Id. </em>The defendant\u2019s vehicle was then searched, but no drugs were found. <em>Id. </em>at 711, 782 A.2d 387. Afterward, the police officer approached the defendant, who was standing near his car wearing a \u201cfanny pack\u201d around his waist. <em>Id. </em>at 711-12, 782 A.2d 387. The officer searched the fanny pack and found what he believed to be cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 712, 782 A.2d 387. Funkhouser was arrested immediately after the cocaine was found. <em>Id. </em>at 701, 782 A.2d 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">On appeal, the State argued, and we agreed, that prior to the search of the fanny pack the police had probable cause to arrest Funkhouser as a result of the positive canine alert. <em>Id. </em>at 721, 782 A.2d 387. The State also argued that the \u201ctight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>sequencing\u201d between the search and the arrest made the search incident to the arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 731, 782 A.2d 387. In the subject case, the majority adopts a position identical to that advanced by the State in <em>Funkhouser. </em>Op. at 381-84, 843 A.2d at 233-34. But in <em>Funkhouser, </em>Judge Moylan, for this Court, explicitly rejected the State\u2019s position.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">That the police have probable cause for a lawful arrest of a person does not in and of itself justify a warrantless search of that person. The search must be incident to an arrest itself. It may not be incident merely to good cause to make an arrest. The existence of an unserved warrant of arrest, for instance, would not justify a warrantless search of a person who is not actually arrested. As this Court observed in <em>DiPasquale v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 574, 577, 406 A.2d 665 (1979):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\"><em>That the facts here might have established probable cause for an arrest of the appellant, </em>even before the baggie was seized, and for a good search incident thereto which would have produced the baggie <em>is beside the point. No arrest was made until after the seizure and the arrest was predicated on the observation of the thing seized.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">(Emphasis supplied). <em>And see Dixon v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 19, 26, 327 A.2d 516 (1974) (\u201cAt the very threshold of search incident theory, the search must be incident not merely to an arrest but to a lawful arrest.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">140 Md.App. at 724-25, 782 A.2d 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Here, too, Conboy\u2019s arrest was predicated on the thing seized. The <em>Funkhouser </em>Court later explained, in detail, why meeting the temporal element was insufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">The State seeks to avoid the foreclosing effect of no arrest having been made [prior to the search] by arguing that the arrest followed the search almost immediately thereafter and was, therefore, \u201cessentially contemporaneous\u201d as if that tight sequencing were dispositive. <em>In this case it is clear, however, that no decision to arrest Funkhouser had been made and that the seizure and search of the \u201cfanny </em>pack\u201d <em>was \u2022no mere incident of an arrest already </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>in motion, even if moments behind, on a parallel track. It was, rather, the finding of suspected drugs in the \u201cfanny pack\u201d that was the precipitating or catalytic agent for Funkhouser\u2019s arrest in this case. There is no suggestion that Funkhouser was going to be arrested regardless of what the search of the \u201cfanny pack\u201d revealed. This was an arrest incident to search.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">This case is far more akin to the ostensible incident to arrest which the Supreme Court struck down in <em>Smith v. Ohio, </em>494 U.S. 541, 110 S.Ct. 1288, 108 L.Ed.2d 464 (1990). The police then grabbed and searched a brown paper grocery bag which Smith had been carrying \u201cgingerly\u201d and then attempted to shield from the police. When they discovered drug paraphernalia in the bag, they immediately arrested Smith. The Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that the search was a constitutional search incident to lawful arrest. Notwithstanding the closeness in time between the search and the arrest, the search was not an incident of the arrest. The Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">That reasoning, however, \u201cjustifying] the arrest by the search and at the same time ... the search by the arrest,\u201d just \u201cwill not do.\u201d As we have had occasion in the past to observe, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that an incident search may not precede an arrest and serve as part of its justification.\u201d The exception for searches incident to arrest permits the police to search a lawfully arrested person and areas within his immediate control. Contrary to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning, it does not permit the police to search any citizen without a warrant or probable cause so long as an arrest immediately follows.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1P\">494 U.S. at 543,110 S.Ct. 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\"><em>Essential contemporaneity is a necessary condition for an out-of-sequence incident, but it is not a sufficient condition. </em>\u201cEssentially contemporaneous\u201d is not, in and of itself, a legitimating mantra.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Cases such as <em>Rawlings v. Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 111, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980), and <em>Lee v. State, </em>311 Md. 642, 537 A.2d 235 (1988), were cases in which <em>the closely </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number><em>related, acts of arresting and searching were proceeding simultaneously. </em>In <em>Anderson v. State, </em>78 Md.App. at 481, 553 A.2d 1296, we fully explained the significance of being \u201cessentially contemporaneous\u201d as the qualifier for a departure from the ordinary time sequence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\"><em>[TJhere is no rigid requirement that the arrest literally precede its search incident. It is enough that they are essentially contemporaneous. </em>The exigencies that give rise to the search incident exception in the first place\u2014 the risk of harm to the arresting officer and the risk of destruction of readily accessible evidence \u2014 sometimes compel a departure from the formal protocol. There will be occasions when the arresting officer deems it tactfully unwise to lose critical seconds or even to be momentarily distracted from his overriding necessity of \u201cbeating his opponent to the draw.\u201d Under the circumstances, it would exalt form over substance to the point of absurdity to insist that an officer clap his hand upon an arrestee\u2019s shoulder and say the operative words, \u201cYou are under arrest,\u201d before disarming and/or neutralizing a potentially dangerous target. <em>The paradigm might yield a dead officer. It is enough, therefore, that the search closely anticipate, contemporaneously parallel, or follow shortly after the arrest of which it is an incident. </em>In all three time frames, it is still an incident of the arrest. <em>This is the purpose of the practical requirement that a lawful arrest and its search incident need only be essentially contemporaneous.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The temporal proximity between the search and the arrest, however, does not qualify the search as an \u201cincident\u201d of the arrest. That is a separate consideration. <em>The seizing and searching of the \u2018fanny pack\u201d in this case was not a consequence or incident of a decision to arrest Funkhouser. </em>The arrest of Funkhouser, rather, was a consequence of what was found in the search of the \u201cfanny pack,\u201d <em>notwithstanding the fact that the detectives may have had an alternative and independent basis for arresting him. </em>They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>were not acting on such a basis. What was flawed was not the proximity in time between the search and the arrest, but the lack of a proper cause-and-effect relationship. It was of this causative link that we spoke in <em>Anderson v. State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The exigencies of the essentially combat situation that exempt the policeman from the formal rigidities of parade-ground sequencing do not exempt him, however, from establishing the indispensable cause-and-effect relationship between the predicate event and its incidents.... The search incident may not \u201cbootstrap\u201d itself by using its results to provide its own justification. No search may justify itself on the basis of what it finds.... Thus, <em>although the attendant search need not technically be \u201csubsequent to, \u201d it must still be \u201cincident to\u201d its predicate lawful arrest. </em>78 Md.App. [471,] 481-82, 553 A.2d 1296 [ (1989) ] (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The shortness of the time period within which the arrest followed the search in this case could not transform the arrest into the cause of the search. The search had its own independent causation. The search was not an incident to the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 731-34, 782 A.2d 387 (some emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">In my view, the just-quoted portions of the <em>Funkhouser </em>opinion are dispositive. Here, as in <em>Funkhouser, </em>there was no indication that appellant was going to be arrested if the fruits of the search had not revealed a key that fit the van; the search, therefore, \u201chad its own independent causation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734, 782 A.2d 387. And, unlike the situation in <em>Lee v. State, </em>311 Md. 642, 537 A.2d 235 (1988), and <em>Rawlings v.

Except for coins, it is impossible to think of any object that an adult male is more likely to have in his pocket than a key of some sort. Under these circumstances, I would hold that Trooper Grinnan did not have probable cause, at the moment he felt the key, to believe that the key was associated with the crime he was investigating \u2014 or any other crime.

According to an agreed statement of facts introduced <em>at trial, </em>Con-boy\u2019s true identity was not discovered by the police until after Conboy had been taken back to police headquarters, booked, and released.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\">. The Transportation Article of the Maryland Code does have provisions sanctioning a driver of a vehicle who leaves the scene of an accident without fulfilling his or her duty to give aid (if bodily injury is involved) or information if an unattended vehicle or other property is damaged. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Transp. II \u00a7\u00a7 20-103 to 20-105 (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.). But none of these sections is here applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">For Fourth Amendment purposes, the legality of an arrest is determined under State law, \u2018\u2018absent any federal statute to the contrary.\u201d <em>State v. Evans, </em>352 Md. 496, 518, 723 A.2d 423 (1999). Under Maryland law, a warrantless arrest may be made for any offense committed in the officer\u2019s presence. Additionally, a warrantless arrest may be made for any felony, whether committed in the arresting police officer's presence or not, if the officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed and the suspect committed it. In regard to misdemeanors and traffic offenses, the rule is different. Save for certain exceptions spelled out by statute, an officer may not arrest a suspect without a warrant for misdemeanors or traffic offenses not committed in the officer\u2019s presence, even if the officer has probable cause to believe the suspect has committed the crime or violation. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. For misdemeanors listed in section 2-203(b) of the Criminal Procedure Article of the Maryland Code (2001) and for traffic offenses listed in section 26-203 of the Transportation Article of the Maryland Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), a police officer may arrest if he/she has probable cause to believe that the suspect has committed the offense out of his/her presence. Driving while under the influence is one of the traffic offenses that comes within the exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b403-9\">. At appellant\u2019s <em>trial, </em>it was revealed that Trooper Grinnan charged appellant under the name of George Mitchell Unson and that it was not until he was released from police custody that it became known that appellant\u2019s real name was David Conboy. Thus, as a historical fact, we know that appellant\u2019s \"I\u2019m not David Conboy\" response did not, in fact, \u201cconfirm his identity\u201d in Trooper Grinnan\u2019s mind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\">.

Yes, I went through the standard questions of, you know, were you driving this van, what is your business over here, where did you get picked up, that kind of stuff.

Reasonable suspicion is a less demanding standard than probable cause not only in the sense that reasonable suspicion can be established with information that is different in quantity or content than that required to establish probable cause, but also in the sense that reasonable suspicion can arise from information that is less reliable than that required to show probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\"><em>Alabama v.

As long as the search and the arrest are essentially contemporaneous, a search may be analyzed under the principles governing searches incident to arrest. <em>Lee </em>[v. <em>State </em>], 311 Md.

The motions judge did not think the \"search incident\" exception was applicable either. He evidently believed the \"plain feel\u201d doctrine was applicable.

The \"fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine is an aspect of the exclusionary rule, a judicially imposed sanction for violations of the Fourth Amendment right against improper arrests and unreasonable searches and seizures in prosecutions, and requires courts to suppress evidence that is the product of unlawful governmental activity. <em>Mapp v.
