Raul Garcia, appellant/cross-appellee, and three appellees/cross-appellants comprising several business entities that are engaged in the development and management of commercial real estate properties. The appeals and cross appeals are taken from a judgment and order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Hon. William J. Rowan, presiding.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Garcia (plaintiff below) is one of two limited partners in the F.P. Rockville Limited Partnership (\u201cthe Partnership\u201d), holding a 10% equity interest in the Partnership. Appellees (defendants below) are (1) Foulger Investments, Inc. (\u201cFoulger\u201d), the general partner of F.P. Rockville Limited Partnership, (\u201cF.P. Rockville\u201d), holding a 2% equity interest; (2) FP Investments, LLC (\u201cFP Investments\u201d), the other limited partner in the F.P. Rockville Limited Partnership, holding an 88% equity interest; and (3) Foulger-Pratt Development, Inc. (\u201cFoulger-Pratt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Garcia, a former salaried employee of Foulger-Pratt entered into a partnership agreement, in lieu of salary from the Foulger entities, for his services to identify and process new commercial real estate projects. The partnership agreement contemplated that new \u201climited partnerships\u201d would be created to oversee development of each individual phase in the overall project site. The new entities would be known as \u201cOperating Partnerships.\u201d Garcia identified a project site, and the Partnership formed a limited liability company (with an unrelated business entity) called the Rockville Metro Plaza I, L.L.C., rather than creating an off-shoot limited partnership as anticipated by the partnership agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Garcia brought this action against the Foulger entities alleging, among other things, that the general partner (Foul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>ger Investments, Inc.) of F.P. Rockville Limited Partnership had breached the partnership agreement by failing to assign him a direct 5% interest in the Rockville Metro I Plaza, L.L.C. project, and for wrongfully taking a $934,000 development fee that should have enured to the Partnership. The circuit court agreed with Garcia that the Partnership was entitled to the development fee. The court, however, concluded that Garcia was not entitled to a direct 5% interest in the limited liability company because he failed to prove that the limited liability company constituted an \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d as contemplated by the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Garcia, therefore, raises the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">I. Did the circuit court err in concluding that Rockville Metro Plaza I, L.L.C. (the entity formed to own the first building) was not an \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d as that term is defined in Paragraph 3.01 of the Partnership Agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">II. If this Court answers the first question in the affirmative, should appellant be assigned a direct interest in Rockville Metro Plaza I, L.L.C.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">III. If this Court rules that the general partner of the Partnership breached the Partnership Agreement by failing to assign appellant a direct interest in Rockville Metro Plaza I, L.L.C. does that ruling \u2014 coupled with the trial court\u2019s ruling \u2014 warrant dissolution of the Partnership and the appointment of a receiver?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">We answer \u201cno\u201d to the first question, and because appellant\u2019s second and third questions are framed in the alternative, we need not address those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">The cross-appeal in this case deals with the award of attorneys fees to Garcia related to recovery of the development fee to the Partnership. The court awarded Garcia $96,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees, and at the same time denied Foulger-Pratt\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees under Maryland Rule 1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>In its cross appeal, Foulger-Pratt has raised four questions for our review which we have condensed into two questions for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">I. Whether the trial court abused its discretion, or otherwise erred, when it awarded Garcia his requested attorneys\u2019 fees, including fees for unsuccessful claims that the court determined where \u201creasonably related\u201d to his successful claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">II. Whether the trial court abused its discretion, or otherwise erred, when it denied Foulger-Pratt\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees under Maryland Rule 1-341 ?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">We answer \u201cno\u201d to both questions, as discussed more fully within, and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">FACTUAL and PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">In 1989, Foulger-Pratt Development, Inc., hired Garcia, under a two-year employment agreement, to manage its real estate development and investment activities. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Garcia earned an annual base salary of $85,000, plus bonuses and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">After July 1, 1991, when the employment agreement had ended, Garcia continued to work for the Foulger entities, but no longer received a salary. Between 1991 and 1994, Garcia rendered services to the Foulger entities under a personal services contract. The agreement was not memorialized until April 14, 1994, but was applied retroactively to 1991 and extended his services for one additional year, until April 25, 1995. Garcia\u2019s duties and responsibilities under the personal services contract included \u201cthe identification and processing of new business opportunities to the point that they can be developed.\u201d In lieu of a salary, Garcia was to receive a 10% equity interest as a limited partner in a \u201climited partnership ... formed between [Garcia] and an assignee of FoulgerPratt [created] for the purpose of developing, constructing, and owning the project.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In short, each time Garcia identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>fied and processed a new development \u201cproject\u201d a new limited partnership would be created, in which Garcia would have a 10% equity interest as a limited partner. The Foulger entities would retain a 90% equity interest in each limited partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Garcia identified a parcel of real estate for potential commercial development in downtown Rockville, bounded by Middle Lane and Hungerford Drive (\u201cthe Rockville Property\u201d). He concluded a contract to purchase the property from the City of Rockville and negotiated the bureaucracy to obtain the necessary permits and support for the development of the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">As envisioned in the personal service agreement, the F.P. Rockville Limited Partnership (\u201cthe Partnership\u201d) was created to develop the Rockville Property. Foulger Investments, Inc., served as the general partner of the Partnership, \"with a 2% equity interest. The two limited partners included FP Investments, LLC, with an 88% equity interest, and Garcia with a 10% equity interest. Pertinent provisions of the Partnership Agreement include the following paragraphs:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">3.01 Business. The business of the Partnership shall be to negotiate contracts to acquire the parcels of real property [at the site in Rockville, otherwise known as \u201cthe Project\u201d]; enter into option contracts with respect to the Project; make option payments, deposits and other payments to the owners of the Project; negotiate zoning variances, site plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>approvals, proffers, locate tenants, secure financing and equity investors; and take all other actions necessary or advisable to develop or maintain the Project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">The Project has been zoned to permit construction of over one million square feet of commercial office space as well as multi-family residential uses. The General Partner currently plans to develop the Project by constructing three commercial office buildings on the IBEW Site, two commercial office buildings on the Middle Lane Site, and a residential tower on the Middle Lane Site. However, the General Partner may change those plans as it deems appropriate. <em>The General Partner expects to divide the Partnership pursuant to [Internal Revenue Service] Code Section 708(b)(2)(B) and establish separate limited partnerships (the \u201cOperating Partnerships\u201d) to own, f\u00ednance, manage, dispose of, lease and otherwise operate each building constructed as part of the Project. The ownership of the Operating Partnerships may differ from the Interests set forth in Schedule B hereto to take into account the contributions of each of the Partners, admission of additional equity investors, and other factors.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">\n<em>In addition, the Partnership may engage in any other lawful activity for protit permitted under the Act.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">4.03 Additional Funds. <em>If the General Partner determines that the Partnership or any of the Operating Partnerships require funds in addition to the Capital Contributions, the General Partner is authorized to admit additional Partners to the Partnership and the Operating Partnerships, </em>from time to time, upon such terms and conditions as it determines to be appropriate, which shall result in a <em>pro rata </em>dilution of the Interests of the Partners, <em>provided, </em>such additional Partners shall not be Affiliates of the General Partner or Limited Partners, or persons related to the General Partner or Limited Partners unless the General Partner obtains the prior written consent of Raul Garcia, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.! ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>4.07 Issuance of Additional Interests in Operating Partnerships. <em>Upon formation of each Operating Partnership established to own a commercial office building developed on the 1BEW site (pursuant to Paragraph 3.01), the General Partner shall issue interests therein to the Partners, including Raul Garcia, in the amounts set forth in Schedule B, provided, </em>that (i) under the circumstances described in Paragraph 4.08(D), the General Partner may reduce the interest of Raul Garcia in certain of the Operating Partnerships, and (ii) such interests may very [sic] from Schedule B to take into account additional capital contributions of the Partners, and to reflect admission of one or more additional equity investors to the Operating Partnership(s).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">6.01 General Partner. Except as provided expressly herein, the General Partner [Foulger-Pratt Development, Inc.] shall have full, exclusive and complete authority, discretion, obligation and responsibility to make all decisions affecting the business of the Partnership. The General Partner shall manage and control the affairs of the Partnership to the best of its abilities and shall use its best efforts to carry out the business of the Partnership. <em>The General Partner shall have authority to enter into such contracts as it determines to be appropriate on behalf of the Partnership and bind the Partnership by execution of documents, including deeds, mortgage documents, deeds of trust, promissory notes, leases, construction contracts, management contracts, contracts of sale, such documents as may be required to admit equity investors, and any other document not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">6.03 Compensation; Business with Affiliates. Except as specifically provided herein, no Partner shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered on behalf of the Partnership. The General Partner shall not cause the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Partnership to enter into any contract with any Partner or any Affiliate of any Partner without the prior written consent of all Partners, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, <em>provided, however, </em>that the General Partner is specifically authorized to enter into the following contracts with its Affiliates: [A. FoulgerPratt Construction shall serve as general contractor for the project; B. Foulger-Pratt Management shall serve as the management agent for the project; and C. Pioneer Building Services, Inc., will provide cleaning services for the building].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">(Emphasis added in bold italics).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">In order to actually develop the first building on the Rock-ville Property, the Partnership in turn entered into an \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d with an unrelated entity known as Reedy Creek Investments/Rockville LLC, to form an entity known as Rockville Metro Plaza I, L.L.C. (\u201cRockville Metro Plaza\u201d), which would directly oversee the development of the property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both the Partnership and Reedy Creek received a 50% interest in Rockville Metro Plaza.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As such, Garcia now had a 5% indirect interest in the Operating Agreement (i.e., a 10% limited partnership interest in the 50% L.L.C. interest). Also, according to the Operating Agreement, the Partnership was entitled to a $984,000 development fee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rockville Metro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Plaza, however, paid the development fee to Foulger-Pratt Development, Inc. (Garcia\u2019s initial employer, and an entity in which Garcia had no equity interest), rather than to the Partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Garcia filed a lawsuit against the various Foulger entities on September 7, 2001, alleging that (1) he should have had a <em>5% </em>direct interest in any new \u201cOperating Partnerships\u201d (according to his interpretation of Paragraph 4.07 of the Partnership Agreement) instead of a 5% indirect interest, and (2) the development fee had been wrongfully taken by Foulger-Pratt Development, Inc. Garcia sought judgment for breach of contract, dissolution of the Partnership, and attorneys\u2019 fees related to the breach of contract claim regarding the development fee, in addition to other causes of action not relevant to this appeal. After protracted pre-trial activity, Garcia filed a second amended complaint on June 24, 2002.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">That second amended complaint came to trial in the circuit court July 9, 2002. During the trial, lasting four days, twenty-six exhibits were admitted into evidence and five witnesses testified. The court took the case under advisement on July 15, 2002, and issued a memorandum opinion and order on July 29, 2002. The court ruled that appellees had not breached the Partnership Agreement by not granting Garcia a direct 5% interest in Rockville Metro Plaza, because Rockville Metro Plaza was established as a limited liability company and not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>limited partnership, and therefore the limited liability company could not be an \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d as described in the Partnership Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The court, however, did find that the Partnership, and not Foulger-Pratt Development, Inc., was entitled to the development fee. The court also ordered a future hearing on the attorneys\u2019 fees that were incurred by Garcia in recovering the development fee to the benefit of the Partnership. Lastly, the court declined to order dissolution of the Partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The court wrote the following in its extensive memorandum opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">In 1998 F.P. Rockville, Limited Partnership, was created. Foulger Investments, Inc., is the general partner with a 2% interest. F.P. Investments, Inc., and Garcia are the limited partners, with an 88% and 10% interest, respectively. (See Defendants\u2019 Exhibit I.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">The purpose of this Agreement was to take all actions necessary or advisable to develop or maintain the Rockville property purchased from IBEW. See Section 3.01. It recited that the \u201cgeneral partner\u201d expects to divide the partnership pursuant to [Internal Revenue Service] Code, Section 708(b)(2)(B), and establish separate limited partnerships (the \u201cOperating Partnerships\u201d) \u201cto own, finance, manage, dispose of, lease and otherwise operate each building constructed as a part of the project\u201d. See Section 3.01. If \u201cOperating Partnerships\u201d were formed, the general partner was to issue interest to the partners, \u201cincluding Raul Garcia\u201d in roughly the same percentage interest as set forth in the formation of the Limited Partnership. See Section 4.07. The Agreement contained an integration clause providing that it superseded all prior written or oral arguments among the parties concerning the subject matter. See Section 13.12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">In order to secure construction financing from Reedy Creek Investments, the Limited Partnership entered into an agreement with Reedy Creek on December 31, 2000, entitled \u201cOperating Agreement of Rockville Metro Plaza I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>LLC\u201d. See Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 2. F.P. Rockville, Limited Partnership, and Reedy Creek Investment each received a 50% interest. Garcia received no written interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">The Court finds that [Garcia] has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the \u201cOperating Agreement of Rockville Metro I, LLC\u201d is an \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d contemplated under Section 3.01 of the Limited Partnership Agreement. The operative words [of Section 3.01] are \u201cexpects to divide the partnership pursuant to Code, Section 708(b)(2)(b), and establish separate <em>limited partnerships </em>(the \u201coperating partnerships\u201d)\u201d. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">Metro Plaza I, LLC, is not a \u201climited partnership\u201d formed by two or more persons having one or more general partners and one or more limited partners. See Corporations and Associations Article, Section 10-101(i). Metro Plaza I, with 50% owners, has no delineation of general or limited partners. It was not a limited partnership converted to a limited liability company under Corporation and Associations, Section 4A-211. Rather, Metro Plaza I, LLC, is a limited liability company formed under Corporation and Associations, Title 4A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">No reference was made in the formation of Rockville Metro Plaza I, LLC, to IRS Code Section 708(b)(2)(B), which the Court believes significant because of the decisions in this case which were tax driven. While Section 4.03 of the Limited Partnership Agreement does not allow the creation of a new subsidiary that is not an operating partnership for the purposes of securing additional funding (construction financing), Section 6.01 does allow under it broad powers, the general partner to direct the formation of an LLC, such as Metro Plaza I, LLC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">Finally, the formation of Metro Plaza I, LLC, is referred to as an \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d, not an \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d. Accordingly, Mr. Garcia because of a failure the burden of proof is not entitled to a separate stated 5% interest in Metro Plaza I, LLC, under Section 4.07 of the Limited Partnership Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>As to the development fee, (subparagraph b), the Court finds [Garcia] has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the Limited Partnership was entitled to the payment and receipt of the development fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Garcia filed a timely appeal. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">\n<em>I. Did the circuit court err in concluding that Rockville Metro Plaza I, L.L.C. (the entity formed to own the first building) was not an \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d as that term is defined in Paragraph 3.01 of the Partnership Agreement?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">It is undisputed that Garcia has a 5% interest in Rockville Metro Plaza. What is disputed, however, is whether his interest is direct or indirect (i.e., a 10% interest in the Partnership\u2019s 50% interest in Rockville Metro Plaza). Garcia contends that he has a direct 5% interest pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, and that he has been significantly harmed by the difference.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, Garcia points to the language of the Partnership Agreement, Paragraph 4.07,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which he reads together with Paragraph 3.01,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to support his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Garcia posits that the matter is one of pure law (contract interpretation), and therefore the issue is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Turner v. Turner, </em>147 Md.App. 350, 403, 809 A.2d 18 (2002). Appellees posit the opposite-that the issue is strictly one of fact-and that the trial court\u2019s factual findings should be affirmed unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131 (c); <em>Brown &amp; Sturm v. Frederick Road Limited P\u2019ship, </em>137 Md.App. 150, 170, 768 A.2d 62 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Both are correct and incorrect at the same time. The issue before us raises mixed questions of law and fact because our inquiry actually raises two different sub-issues, for which two different standards of review apply. We must first determine whether, as a matter of law, the term \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d in the Partnership Agreement includes limited liability companies (in this case Rockville Metro Plaza). Second, assuming that the term \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d does not encompass limited liability companies, we must determine whether, as a matter of fact, Rockville Metro Plaza is, or should be considered, an \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d for purposes of the Partnership Agreement. Given the two differing standards of review, this Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Gregg Neck Yacht Club, Inc. v. County Comm\u2019rs of Kent County, </em>137 Md.App. 732, 769 A.2d 982 (2001) is instructive. There, Judge Hollander wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">When, as here, an action is tried without a jury, we review the case on both the law and the evidence. We will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous. Rule 8-131; <em>see Gwynn v. Oursler, </em>122 Md.App. 493, 502, 712 A.2d 1072, <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 662, 719 A.2d 1262 (1998); <em>see also Murphy v. 24th Street Cadillac Corp., 353 </em>Md. 480, 497, 727 A.2d 915 (1999); <em>Innerbichler v. Innerbichler, </em>132 Md.App. 207, 229, 752 A.2d 291, <em>cert. denied, </em>361 Md. 232, 760 A.2d 1107 (2000). The clearly erroneous standard requires an appellate court to \u201c \u2018consider the evidence produced at trial in a light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murphy, </em>353 Md. at 497, 727 A.2d 915 (citation omitted). A trial court\u2019s findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>are clearly erroneous when they are not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">The clearly erroneous standard only applies to the lower court\u2019s findings of fact, however. <em>B &amp; P Enter, v. Overland Equip. Co., </em>188 Md.App. 583, 602, 758 A.2d 1026 (2000); <em>Nationwide Ins. Companies v. Rhodes, </em>127 Md.App. 231, 235, 732 A.2d 388 (1999); <em>Piper v. Layman, </em>125 Md.App. 745, 754, 726 A.2d 887 (1999). When we consider conclusions of law, our review is more expansive. <em>Narayen v. Bailey, </em>130 Md.App. 458, 461-62, 747 A.2d 195 (2000). We do not accord any deference to \u201c[p]ure conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Oliver v. Hays, </em>121 Md.App. 292, 306, 708 A.2d 1140 (1998); <em>see B &amp; P Enter., </em>133 Md.App. at 602, 758 A.2d 1026; <em>Porter v. Schaffer </em>126 Md.App. 237, 259, 728 A.2d 755, <em>cert. denied, </em>355 Md. 613, 735 A.2d 1107 (1999). Instead, we must determine whether the trial court was legally correct. <em>Andy\u2019s Ice Cream, Inc. v. City of Salisbury, </em>125 Md.App. 125, 137, 724 A.2d 717, <em>cert. denied, </em>353 Md. 473, 727 A.2d 382 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Id. at 751-52, 769 A.2d 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Construction of The Partnership Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\"> Implicit in the trial court\u2019s holding is its finding that the Partnership Agreement\u2019s term, \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d, does not include limited liability companies. Garcia correctly points out that \u201c[t]he construction of a written contract is a question of law, subject to <em>de novo </em>review by an appellate court.\u201d <em>Turner, supra, </em>147 Md.App. at 403, 809 A.2d 18 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The principle rule in construction of a contract, here the Partnership Agreement, is to \u201cascertain and effectuate the intention of the contracting parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403, 809 A.2d 18. In order to do so, we look at the plain-meaning of the contract itself, and review the entire document. <em>Id. </em>at 403-04, 809 A.2d 18. \u201c[T]he terms of the agreement are construed consistent with their usual and ordinary meaning, unless it is apparent that the parties ascribed a special or technical mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>ing to the words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404, 809 A.2d 18 (citations omitted). Because Maryland follows the law of objective contract interpretation, \u201c[t]he clear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give way to what the parties thought the agreement meant or was intended to mean.\u201d <em>Blakehurst v. Baltimore County, </em>146 Md.App. 509, 523, 807 A.2d 179 (2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">F.P. Rockville Limited Partnership was set up as a Maryland limited partnership. Maryland law defines a limited partnership as \u201ca partnership formed by two or more persons under the laws of the State having one or more general partners and one or more limited partners.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Corps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns \u00a7 10-101(i) (Repl.Vol.1999). Rockville Metro Plaza, on the other hand, was organized as a Maryland limited liability company. Maryland law defines a limited liability company as \u201ca permitted form of unincorporated business organization which is organized and existing under this title.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Corps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns \u00a7 4A-101\u00ae (Repl.Vol.1999 &amp; Supp.2002). Limited partnerships and limited liability companies are different legal entities under Maryland law, governed by separate provisions of the Corporations and Associations Article of the Maryland Code \u2014 Title 10 governs limited partnerships whereas Title 4A covers limited liability companies. Md.Code Ann., Corps. <em>&amp; </em>Ass\u2019ns Title 10 &amp; Title 4A; <em>see also Provident Bank v. DeChiaro Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>98 Md.App. 596, 606, 634 A.2d 973 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>334 Md. 210, 638 A.2d 752 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Turning to the specific language of the Partnership Agreement, the term \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d is defined in Paragraph 2.21 as \u201c[a]ny limited partnership established pursuant to Paragraph 3.01, and in which Interests] are issued to the Partners hereof, and/or additional equity investors pursuant to Paragraphs 3.01, 4.03 and 4.07.\u201d The term \u201climited partnership\u201d is not defined in the Agreement, but the Agreement does refer to the Maryland Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (Title 10 of the Maryland Code, Corps. <em>&amp; </em>Ass\u2019ns Art.) as the governing authority. <em>See </em>Paragraph 2.01 and 3.01 (\u201c[T]he Partnership may engage in any other lawful activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>for profit permitted under [Title 10 of the Maryland Code, Corps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns Art.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">We find that the term \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d is clear and unambiguous, and does not on its face include limited liability companies. Reading the contract objectively, as we must, we find that the intent of the parties was to establish \u201climited partnerships\u201d as that term is defined by Maryland law. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Corps. <em>&amp; </em>Ass\u2019ns \u00a7 10 \u2014 101(i). Accordingly, we hold that the court did not err, as a matter of law, in its implicit conclusion that the term \u201cOperating Partnerships\u201d applies only to limited partnerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Is Rockville Metro Plaza an Operating Partnership, or Should it be Considered as Such?</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The second inquiry is whether, as a matter of fact, Rocvkille Metro Plaza is, or should be considered to be, an Operating Partnership for purposes of the Partnership Agreement. It is this issue that both parties have more fully addressed, and that drew the trial court\u2019s attention as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Garcia cites several propositions for his position, relying essentially on the fact that Rockville Metro Plaza I, has elected to be taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. He writes, \u201cBecause Rockville Metro Plaza elected to be treated as a partnership, it is therefore considered a \u2018partnership\u2019 under the federal tax laws, including the Code section applicable here.\u201d Following this theory, Garcia also argues that the creation of Rockville Metro Plaza constitutes a \u201cdivision\u201d of a partnership which, for federal tax purposes, the resulting partnership is \u201cconsidered a continuation of the prior partnership.\u201d <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 708(b)(2)(B).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Lastly, Garcia argues that Paragraph 4.03 of the Partnership Agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>precluded the Partnership from admitting equity investors (here Reedy Creek) into any entity other than an Operating Partnership. Specifically, Garcia maintains that \u201cParagraph 4.03 ... specifies only two ways in which the General Partner is authorized to raise funds from a third party investor: borrowing the money, or admitting the investor into the Partnership of an \u2018Operating Partnership.\u2019\u201d In summary, Garcia\u2019s position, in simple terms, is that even though Rock-ville Metro Plaza is not legally a \u201cduck,\u201d (i.e., a limited partnership) it looks, acts, walks, and sounds like one, and therefore should be treated as one.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Appellees, predictably, argue the opposite. They respond by arguing, first, that simply because a business entity is treated as a limited partnership for federal tax purposes does not mean that it is, or should be, otherwise considered a limited partnership; especially if Maryland law would not treat it as such, or more importantly, when the Partnership Agreement (i.e., the contract binding the parties) does not treat it as such. Second, appellees posit that Rockville Metro Plaza was not formed by a division of a partnership, but rather as a distinct limited liability company. Finally, appellees argue that Paragraph 6.01 authorized the general partner of the Partnership to enter into a limited liability company. In other words, appellees maintain that Rockville Metro Plaza cannot be a \u201cduck\u201d because, despite its appearance, it is not legally a duck. Appellees emphasize that the court\u2019s ruling involved findings of fact on this issue, and that we must affirm unless the court was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The trial court concluded that Garcia \u201chas failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the \u2018Operating Agreement of Rockville Metro I, LLC\u2019 is an \u2018Operating Partnership\u2019 contemplated under Section 3.01 of the Limited Partnership Agreement.\u201d In so concluding, the court found the following: (1) Rockville Metro Plaza is not a limited partnership as defined by Maryland law; (2) there has been \u201cno delineation of general or limited partners\u201d; (3) the limited liability company had no prior existence as a limited partnership; (4) Rock-ville Metro Plaza has been organized as a. limited liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>company under the laws of the state; (5) \u201cNo reference was made in the formation of Rockville Metro Plaza I, LLC, to IRS Code Section 708(b)(2)(B), which the Court believes significant because of the decisions in this case which were tax driven\u201d; (6) Paragraph 6.01 of the Partnership Agreement authorizes the general partner to form a limited liability company; (7) the formation of the limited liability company refers to a \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d not an \u201cOperating Partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">We are unable to conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous. Simply because a limited liability company chooses to be treated like a partnership for federal income tax purposes does not overcome the requirement of Maryland statutory law, or dictate its legal status for purposes of Maryland law. This is especially true given the fact that the section of the Internal Revenue Service Code which Garcia cites for his proposition (Code Section 708(b)(2)(B)) clarifies that it applies \u201cfor purposes of this section....\u201d <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 708(b)(2)(B). In this regard, we reiterate that because we are reviewing facts as found by the court, those facts must be viewed in a light most favorable to appellees. <em>Gregg Neck, supra, </em>137 Md.App. at 751-52, 769 A.2d 982. We find the court\u2019s factual findings to be extensive, clear, and entirely supportable by the evidence in the record. Even our independent review of the record suggests that Metro Rockville Plaza is not, and should not be considered to be, an operating partnership as that term is defined and used in the Partnership Agreement. Furthermore, we agree that Paragraph 6.01 gave the general partner the authority to form a limited liability company for purposes of admitting equity investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">There is yet another compelling reason why Garcia is only entitled to a 5% indirect interest, although the trial court never directly addressed this point. Garcia was not able to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was actually entitled to a direct interest versus an indirect interest. The operative language of Paragraph 4.07 the Partnership Agreement is \u201cthe General Partner shall issue interests.... \u201d On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>this, we note that there is no dispute that Garcia was issued, and has, a 5% interest in the limited liability company, created through his 10% interest in the Partnership. However, nowhere in the Partnership Agreement is it provided that Garcia is entitled to a direct interest. We find no error in the court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\n<em>I. Whether the trial court abused its discretion, or otherwise erred, when it awarded Garcia his requested attorneys\u2019 fees, including fees for unsuccessful claims that the court determined were \u201creasonably related\u201d to his successful claim?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Following Garcia\u2019s timely appeal of the substantive issues, Garcia and Foulger-Pratt briefed the attorneys\u2019 fees issue. Even though prevailing parties are generally barred from recovering their attorneys\u2019 fees under the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d Garcia sought fees associated with the recoupment of the $934,000 development fee pursuant to the \u201ccommon-fund doctrine.\u201d The trial court awarded Garcia $96,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees. Foulger-Pratt posits that the trial court erred in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The American Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Maryland follows the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Hess Constr. Co. v. Bd. of Educ., </em>341 Md. 155, 159, 669 A.2d 1352 (1996). As such, \u201c[i]n the absence of statute, rule, or contract expressly allowing recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees, a prevailing party in a lawsuit may not ordinarily recover attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 566, 590-91, 735 A.2d 1081 (1999). As with most legal principles, however, exceptions do exist. <em>See generally Hess Constr. Co., supra, </em>341 Md. at 160-61,168-70, 669 A.2d 1352.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Exceptions to the American Rule are premised on underlying equitable or policy considerations which support the need for such recovery. <em>See Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 U.S. 375, 391-92, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970). Relevant exceptions in this case include: (1) the \u201ccommon-fund doctrine\u201d; (2) a statutory fee-shifting provision for derivative suits in a limited partnership pursuant to Md.Code Ann., Corps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns \u00a7 10-1004; and, as discussed <em>infra, </em>(3) the award of attorney fees via Md. Rule 1-341 when a lawsuit is maintained or defended in \u201cbad faith or without substantial justification.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The Common-Fund Doctrine, a Common Law Exception to the American Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In <em>Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, </em>444 U.S. 472, 100 S.Ct. 745, 62 L.Ed.2d 676 (1980), the U.S. Supreme Court had the opportunity to apply the common-fund doctrine as an exception to the American Rule. Justice Powell, writing on behalf of the eight-justice majority, described the doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3p\">Since the decisions in <em>Trustees v. Greenough, 105 U.S. 527, 26 L.Ed. 1157 (1882), and Central Railroad &amp; Banking Co. v. Pettus, 113 U.S. 116, 5 S.Ct. 387, 28 L.Ed. 915 (1885), </em>this Court has recognized consistently that a litigant or a lawyer who recovers a common fund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from the fund as a whole. See <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375, 90 S.Ct. 616, 2b L.Ed.2d 593 (1970); Sprague v. Ticonic National Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 59 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939); cf. Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973). </em>The common-fund doctrine reflects the traditional practice in courts of equity, <em>Trustees v. Greenough, supra, 105 U.S. at 532-537, </em>and it stands as a well-recognized exception to the general principle that requires every litigant to bear his own attorney\u2019s fees, <em>Alyeska, Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number><em>Society, 421 U.S., [240] at 257-58, 95 S.Ct. [1612], at 1621-22, H L.Ed.2d HI. </em>The doctrine rests on the perception that persons who obtain the benefit of a lawsuit without contributing to its cost are unjustly enriched at the successful litigant\u2019s expense. See, <em>e.g., Mills v. Electnc Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. at 392, 90 S.Ct. [616] at 625. </em>Jurisdiction over the fund involved in the litigation allows a court to prevent this inequity by assessing attorney\u2019s fees against the entire fund, thus spreading fees proportionately among those benefitted by the suit. See <em>id., </em>at 394, 90 S.Ct. at 626.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMU\"><em>Id. </em>at 478,100 S.Ct. 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Mills, supra, </em>that the common-fund doctrine is primarily a \u201cjudicially-created exception ... where a plaintiff has successfully maintained a suit, usually on behalf of a class that benefits a group of others in the same manner as himself.\u201d 396 U.S. at 392, 90 S.Ct. 616. Because the common-fund doctrine is an equity-based judicially-created exception, it follows that the application of the doctrine is vested within the discretion of the trial judge. The Supreme Court examined this notion in <em>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991), when it wrote, \u201c[T]he \u2018common fund exception,\u2019 derives not from a court\u2019s power to control litigants, but from its historic equity jurisdiction, and allows a court to award attorney\u2019s fees to a party whose litigation efforts directly benefit others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, 111 S.Ct. 2123 (citations omitted). The Court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Id. </em>at 50, 111 S.Ct. 2123.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Accordingly, the abuse of discretion standard is the appropriate standard of review. <em>Id.; see also Tandycrafts, Inc. v. Initio Partners, </em>562 A.2d 1162 (Del.1989). Maryland law holds likewise. <em>Rauch v. McCall, </em>134 Md.App. 624, 638, 761 A.2d 76 (2000) (\u201cThe award of attorney\u2019s fees by the court is a \u2018factual matter which lies within the \u201csound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.\u201d \u2019 \u201d) (citations and quoting sources omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>362 Md. 625, 766 A.2d 148 (2001); <em>see also Milton Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number><em>v.

In <em>Hess Constr. Co., supra, </em>341 Md. 155, 669 A.2d 1352, the Court of Appeals, in an opinion authored by Judge Rodowsky, discussed the various instances in which the common-fund doctrine had been previously applied in reported cases in Maryland.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">The common fund theory has been applied or recognized where all of the holders of mortgage debentures were benefitted by the sale of the security, ordered over the objection of receivers for the debtor corporation, <em>Terminal Freezing &amp; Heating Co. v.

Defendants also argue that since recovery was had under the breach of contract claim, which was not pled in a derivative fashion, there can be no recovery of attorney\u2019s fees. See Corporation and Associations Article, Section 10-1001-1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Plaintiff seeks an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the \u201ccommon fund\u201d exception doctrine which he argues is recognized in Maryland. See <em>Davis v. Gemmell, </em>73 Md. 530, 21 A. 712; <em>Hess Construction Company v. Board of Education </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>341 Md. 155, 669 A.2d 1352; <em>United Cable Television of Baltimore Limited Partnership v.

Initio Partners, </em>562 A.2d 1162 (Del.-1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The Court agrees with the underlying thesis of the Plaintiffs argument that the Plaintiff represented interests of all of the partners of F.P. Rockville Limited Partnership who received the benefits of his labor. Even though not pled as a derivative claim, the exact purpose of Corporation and Associates Article, Section 10-1001-1004 was accomplished. The judgment rendered in favor of PIP. Rockville Limited Partnership is the exact judgment that would have been rendered had the claim been made in a derivative fashion. Finally, there is nothing in Corporation and Associations Article 10-1004 that mandates that the common fund production prohibits an award of attorney\u2019s fees if the production is achieved through a direct action as opposed to [a] derivative claim. See also <em>Tandycrafts, Inc. v. Initio Partners, </em>Supra, at p. 1166, (\u201cThere is no class action or derivative suit prerequisite to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the common benefit exception.\u201d) Thus, the Court holds that F.P. Rockville Limited Partnership should be required to compensate the Plaintiff with an award of a portion of the attorney\u2019s fees and costs he incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Attorney\u2019s fees awarded pursuant to the common fund doctrine may be calculated using either a percentage of the recovered benefit, the Lodestar approach (i.e., a calculation of the attorney\u2019s reasonable hours multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate), or a combination of both. See <em>United Cable Television of Baltimore Limited Partnership v. Burch, </em>Supra, at p. 685-688, 732 A.2d 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The Court rejects the percentage method because of the arbitrariness of picking a fair percentage. Rather the Court calculates the fee under the Lodestar approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Plaintiffs suit sought two things: the recovery of the development fee, and the award of a direct ownership interest in Rockville Metro. The Plaintiff, for the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the partnership, prevailed in the first and lost on the second. Plaintiff supports his requested attorney\u2019s fees by Affidavit of Donald Clark, Jr., Esquire, as to the reasonableness of the hourly rate and work done. Mr. Clark\u2019s background and experience, as set forth in the Affidavit, provides the necessary expertise. See <em>Kirsner v. Edelmann, </em>65 Md.App. 185, 499 A.2d 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The Affidavit of Plaintiffs chief counsel, David Clark, Jr., Esquire, reflects that no time or services were charged where they related \u201csolely\u201d to the claim for an ownership interest. However, one-third of the time and services (marked \u201cC\u201d) where charged for those items \u201crelated predominantly to the claim for ownership services\u201d. The Court believes that since the Plaintiff did not prevail on the claim and it was not \u201creasonably related\u201d to the other claims, all time and services related to the claim for an ownership interest should be deducted. Accordingly, there is a downward deduction of the fee sought of $140,000.00 by $11,835.00 (1/3 of $35,514.25, those items marked \u201cC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AOx\">Fougler Pratt contends that the trial court erred by granting Garcia\u2019s requested attorney fees under \u00a7 10-1004, because his breach of contract claim was not a derivative action. Garcia, on the other hand, argues that the court awarded the fees under the common-fund doctrine, and that under Maryland law it was appropriate to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We read the trial court\u2019s opinion as granting the attorneys\u2019 fees based on the common-fund doctrine. That said, however, we think that the trial court found analogous support for its position from \u00a7 10-1004, and therefore chose to include this as a rationale in its written opinion. The trial court determined that if Garcia had brought his claim as a derivative action he would have been likewise entitled to fees. Nevertheless, we still must review the propriety of the court\u2019s action, given Foulger-Pratt\u2019s broad challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Again, we are faced with a mixed question of law and fact with corresponding standards of review. <em>See Gregg Neck Yacht Club, supra, </em>137 Md.App. at 751-52, 769 A.2d 982. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Initially, as a matter of law, we must determine whether Garcia was entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under the common-fund exception. Second, if the common-fund doctrine is applicable, we must, as a matter of fact, review whether the court erred in calculating the amount and reasonableness of the fee award under that doctrine; more specifically, whether the court abused its discretion in awarding Garcia fees associated with unsuccessful claims that were related to his successful claim. We will address point each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The Common-Fund Doctrine\u2019s Applicability to this Case</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Foulger-Pratt makes several arguments as to why Garcia was not entitled to fees, including that Maryland has never applied the common-fund doctrine to limited partners in a partnership. In this regard, Fougler Pratt posits that \u00a7 10-1004 is only applicable to derivative actions, and further, that this section provides the only way a limited partner may recover attorneys\u2019 fees. Implicit in cross-appellant\u2019s argument is the position that the legislative language of \u00a7 10-1004 has abrogated the common law, such that adherence to \u00a7 10-1004 is the only possible vehicle for recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees. In other words, Foulger-Pratt posits that the legislature has provided the only mechanism in which a limited partner may recover fees as set forth in \u00a7 10-1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Garcia argues that \u00a7 10-1004 has not abrogated the common law \u201ccommon-fund doctrine,\u201d and rests most of his support on <em>Davis v. Gemmell, </em>73 Md. 530, 21 A. 712 (1891) (cited in <em>Hess Constr. Co., supra, </em>341 Md. at 168, 669 A.2d 1352). The facts of <em>Davis </em>are lengthy, but worthy of discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In <em>Davis, </em>three shareholders were the sole owners of the North Branch Company, a corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 21 A. 712. William A. Brydon was the majority owner; the minority owners were Thomas Gemmell and Malcolm Sinclair. Brydon recovered a $75,000 judgment against the Ohio Railroad Company for breach of contract. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 21 A. 712. The court awarded the judgment to an assignee of Brydon (Henry G. Davis and Company). <em>Id. </em>Following this, the two minority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>shareholders (Gemmell and Sinclair) brought suit against the majority shareholder (Brydon) alleging that he had misappropriated the $75,000 judgment, in that it properly enured to the North Branch Company. The trial court agreed with the minority shareholders and held \u201cthat the judgment, though recovered in Brydon\u2019s name, belonged in fact to the North Branch Company....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 21 A. 712. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and in so doing directed that the attorneys\u2019 fees of the two minority shareholders be paid out of the fund. The Court of Appeals found that \u201c[tjheir labor resulted in preserving the fund for the North Branch Company, and ... the sum which should be audited to them upon a <em>quantum, meruit </em>is fourteen thousand dollars.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 21 A. 712. \u201c[T]he fee was allowed upon the theory that counsel for Gemmell and Sinclair in fact represented the interest of all the stockholders, who received the fruits of their labor.\u201d <em>Terminal Freezing &amp; Heating, supra, </em>120 Md. at 417, 87 A. 820 (summarizing the holding in <em>Davis).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">We agree with Garcia. Contrary to Foulger-Pratt\u2019s position, we find nothing in \u00a7 10-1004 which suggests that the legislature intended to abrogate the common law award of attorneys\u2019 fees in cases involving limited partnerships. Section 10-1004 does not explicitly restrict the application of the common law exceptions to the American Rule, and from a statutory construction perspective, \u201cthere is a presumption against statutory preemption of the common law[,]\u201d unless there is express language to suggest otherwise. <em>Hardy v. State, </em>301 Md. 124, 131, 482 A.2d 474 (1984); <em>see also Mills, supra, </em>396 U.S. at 390-92, 90 S.Ct. 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Moreover, we find <em>Davis </em>as persuasive authority supporting Garcia\u2019s position that attorneys representing limited partners in a limited partnership may receive their fees from a common fund recovered as a result of their efforts. Indeed, the underlying basis for the attorneys\u2019 fees in <em>Davis </em>was that the attorneys for the minority interests had recovered the $75,000 judgment for the benefit of all three interested parties; even when one of the three interested parties had previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>wrongfully diverted the award so that the recovery to the common fund was actually a detriment to him. The mere fact that <em>Davis </em>dealt with three \u201cshareholders\u201d versus three \u201cpartners\u201d is not, in our view, a compelling reason for barring the use of the common-fund doctrine to the present case. We find the underlying principle espoused in <em>Davis </em>equally applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">H9, 20] Foulger-Pratt further maintains that the common-fund doctrine is inapplicable to this case, because there is no \u201cgroup\u201d or \u201cclass\u201d of benefitted persons. Foulger-Pratt states that \u201cevery Maryland case that has ever addressed a common fund exception to the American Rule has involved a class action, a corporate shareholders derivative action, or a similarly large and widely dispersed group of beneficiaries such as taxpayers or bondholder.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United Cable Television of Baltimore Ltd. P\u2019ship, supra, </em>354 Md. 658, 732 A.2d 887; <em>Davis, supra, </em>73 Md. 530, 21 A. 712; <em>Bowling, supra, </em>57 Md.App. 248, 469 A.2d 896; <em>Terminal Freezing &amp; Healing, supra, </em>120 Md. 408, 87 A. 820. Aside from the fact that <em>Davis </em>directly involved only three interested parties (as here), we find nothing in the Maryland cases to suggest a threshold number of persons to whom the benefit must accrue. As noted above, the common-fund doctrine is equity-based, and its application left to the discretion of the trial judge. Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court, in <em>Sprague v. Ticonic Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>307 U.S. 161, 59 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939), held that even one person bringing suit on behalf of herself may be entitled to fees in a common-fund case. The Court upheld the trial court\u2019s authority to grant attorneys\u2019 fees to a petitioner who had sued on her own behalf, because of the <em>stare decisis </em>impact of the decision. <em>Id. </em>at 166-67, 59 S.Ct. 777. The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">That the party in a situation like the present neither purported to sue for a class nor formally established by litigation a fund available to the class, does not seem to be a differentiating factor so far as it affects the source of the recognized power of equity to grant reimbursements of the kind for which the petitioner in this case appealed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>chancellor\u2019s discretion. Plainly the foundation for the historic practice of granting reimbursement for the costs of litigation other than the conventional taxable costs is part of the original authority of the chancellor to do equity in a particular situation. Whether one professes to sue representatively or formally makes a fund available for others may, of course, be a relevant circumstance in making the fund liable for his costs in producing it. But when such a fund is for all practical purposes created for the benefit of others, the formalities of the litigation \u2014 the absence of an allowed class suit or the creation of a fund, as it were, through <em>stare decisis </em>rather than through a decree \u2014 hardly touch the power of equity in doing justice as between a party and the beneficiaries of his litigation. As in much else that pertains to equitable jurisdiction, individualization in the exercise of a discretionary power will alone retain equity as a living system and save it from sterility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 166-67, 59 S.Ct. 777 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In a related argument, Foulger-Pratt also argues, as a matter of fact, that Garcia was the only person to benefit from the recovery of the $934,000 development fee to the partnership, and so the common-fund doctrine is inapplicable. This simply is not correct. Pursuant to Paragraph 5.2.2(i) of the Rockville Metro Plaza Operating Agreement, the Partnership was entitled to the $934,000 development fee. As previously explained, the Partnership is composed of (1) Foulger Investments, Inc. (the general partner) with a 2% equity interest, (2) FP Investments, LLC, (the other limited partner) with an 88% equity interest, and (3) Garcia with a 10% equity interest. Rockville Metro Plaza initially began paying the development fee to Foulger-Pratt Development, Inc., an entirely separate legal entity. Because of Garcia\u2019s efforts, Foulger Investments, Inc., and FP Investments LLC, will now recover a benefit that would not have otherwise materialized. Notably, the other limited partner (FP Investments) has an approximate $822,000 interest in the recovered development fee due, in whole, to Garcia\u2019s efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>On its face, clearly it cannot be claimed that the other legal entities comprising the partnership did not benefit. As we previously commented, the United States Supreme Court has noted that the common-fund doctrine \u201crests on the perception that persons who obtain the benefit of a lawsuit without contributing to its cost are unjustly enriched at the successful litigant\u2019s expense.\u201d <em>Boeing Co., supra, </em>444 U.S. at 478, 100 S.Ct. 745. If Garcia was not entitled to pay his attorneys\u2019 funds out of the common fund, Foulger Investments, Inc., and FP Investments LLC, would reap the fruit of his labor, without sharing any of the costs. In summary, Garcia did not recover the $934,000 personally, rather, he recovered the benefit on behalf of the entire partnership.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Recovery of Fees for Unsuccessful Claims Related to the Successful Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Having established as a matter of law that the common-fund doctrine was applicable to the case <em>sub judice, </em>we must now focus our attention on whether the court abused its discretion in calculating the amount and reasonableness of the fee awarded. As the question suggests, we review a court\u2019s establishment of a \u201creasonable\u201d fee under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Rauch, supra, </em>134 Md.App. at 639, 761 A.2d 76. The crux of the issue for this case is whether Garcia\u2019s counsel is entitled to fees associated with work done for the unsuccessful claims related to the successful claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Foulger-Pratt argues that the trial court erred by awarding Garcia fees for the unsuccessful claims of conversion and breach of fiduciary duty. Garcia responds by pointing out that those claims were \u201creasonably related\u201d to his successful breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">On this issue, the trial court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Finally, [Garcia] seeks fees for the unsuccessful claims (conversion and breach of fiduciary duty) reasonably related to the claim in obtaining the development fee for the partnership. Plaintiff urges the adoption of the analogy in <em>Continental Casualty Company v. Board of Education of Charles County, </em>302 Md. 516, 489 A.2d 536, because the tort actions of conversion and breach of fiduciary duty were based on the same facts as the Plaintiffs cause of action for breach of contract. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant\u2019s defense took the position that it was not conversion because it was a contract claim. It was not breach of contract because the contract did not prohibit what happened. It was not breach of fiduciary duty, because it was a breach of contract claim \u2014 and around we go again. As Plaintiff notes, because claims were asserted under alternative related causes of action, he should not be penalized for \u201cgood advocacy\u201d as long as one claim[ ] provides him with the recovery he seeks. See <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, [440-41,] 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1943, 76 L.Ed.2d 40.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">The Court agrees with the analogy and adopts the \u201creasonably related\u201d argument. Nevertheless, there was one claim (misrepresentation) that was not successful nor reasonably related to the same facts. If the total fee for the four claims (breach of contract, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and misrepresentation) is $128,000 ($140,000.00 minus $11,835.00), the Court apportions $32,000.00 to each claim (1/4 of $128,000.00). Since misrepresentation was neither successful nor reasonably related, a downward deduction of $32,000.00 is appropriate in determining the reasonableness of the total fee after considering and applying the factors set forth in the Maryland Code of Professional Responsibility with respect to attorney\u2019s fees. See Rule 1.5(a), Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Very recently, in <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 819 A.2d 354 (2003), the Court of Appeals had the opportunity to address the proper amount of attorneys\u2019 fees when a plaintiff is only partially successful. In <em>Friolo, </em>the Court was called on to consider whether a trial court is required to use the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>\u201clodestar\u201d approach under all Maryland fee-shifting statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 504, 819 A.2d 354.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In concluding that the lodestar approach is \u201cordinarily the appropriate\u201d method to use, the Court relied extensively on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424,103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), a case focused on whether \u201cprevailing plaintiffs could recover fees for legal services related to unsuccessful claims.\u201d <em>Friolo, supra, </em>373 Md. at 523-25, 819 A.2d 354. In <em>Hensley, </em>the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEE\">the extent of a plaintiff\u2019s success is a crucial factor in determining the proper amount of an award of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 USC \u00a7 1988 [i.e., a fee-shifting statute]. Where the plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee. Where a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney\u2019s fee reduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention raised. But where the plaintiff achieved only limited success, the district court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtQ\"><em>Id. </em>at 440, 103 S.Ct. 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Judge Wilner, writing for the Court in <em>Friolo, </em>adopted the analysis set forth in <em>Hensley </em>for awarding fees to partially successful litigants. <em>Friolo, supra, </em>373 Md. at 523-25, 819 A.2d 354. The key inquiry, therefore, is the degree of success achieved by the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 525, 819 A.2d 354. For example, if a \u201cplaintiff has obtained \u2018excellent results,\u2019 the attorney should recover \u2018a fully compensatory fee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524-25, 819 A.2d 354 (citing <em>Hensley, supra, </em>461 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. 1933). \u201cConversely, if the plaintiff has achieved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u2018only partial or limited success,\u2019 the product of hours reasonably spent on the litigation times the hourly rate \u2018may be an excessive amount,\u2019 even where the \u2018claims were interrelated, nonfrivolous, and raised in good faith.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525 (citing <em>Hensley, supra, </em>461 U.S. at 436,103 S.Ct. 1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Although <em>Friolo </em>applied to all Maryland fee-shifting statutes, rather than the common-fund doctrine, we see no reason to depart from the <em>Friolo </em>analysis, because in both types of cases there is an underlying equity/policy basis for shifting the fee burden. Of course, the <em>Friolo </em>analysis \u201crelates to how the lodestar approach is to be implemented[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 525, 819 A.2d 354, application of which, as we have noted, is vested -within the discretion of the trial judge to ensure a reasonable fee. A judge applying the lodestar approach must also look to a variety of factors established in the caselaw, <em>see Friolo, supra, </em>373 Md. at 521-522 and n. 2, 819 A.2d 354 (citing <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.1974)), and under Rule 1.5(a) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct to ensure the fees were \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>Friolo, supra, </em>373 Md. at 527, 819 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In this case, Garcia\u2019s lawyers\u2019 accrued $271,618.50 in total fees, $257,344.25 of which was entirely attributed to work by attorneys (and paralegals). Garcia sought $140,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees by including all the fees associated with the recovery of the development fee, 1/3 of the fees \u201crelated predominantly to the claim for the ownership interest[,]\u201d none of the fees related solely to the ownership interest, and \u201ctwo thirds of remaining entries were included in the requested figure[.]\u201d Disbursements were calculated in the same fashion. From the start, therefore, we know that Garcia conceded that he was not entitled to the total fees. To use the words of <em>Friolo, </em>he had not achieved \u201cexcellent results.\u201d Accordingly, we have no need to determine whether all of his fees were fully compensatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Upon reviewing the record as a whole, and the court\u2019s extensive memorandum on the issue, we find no abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>discretion in the court\u2019s calculation of the amount and reasonableness of the fee award. The court had before it an extensive line-by-line accounting of all the fees generated pursuant to each claim, and had the opportunity to review that document before making its determination. The court found that Garcia had partially succeeded, and granted fees for the prevailing claim and those fees reasonably related to that claim,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but denied Garcia\u2019s request for 1/3 of the time and services \u201crelated predominantly\u201d to the ownership interest because Garcia did not prevail on that claim. The trial court also denied all fees on the misrepresentation count as it \u201cwas neither successful nor reasonably related.... \u201d The court\u2019s approach was entirely consistent with <em>Friolo, supra, </em>373 Md. 501, 819 A.2d 354, and <em>Hensley, supra, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Furthermore, the court\u2019s use of the lodestar approach instead of the percentage method was clearly justified, <em>see Burch, supra, </em>354 Md. at 686, 732 A.2d 887; <em>Friolo, supra, </em>373 Md. 501, 819 A.2d 354, and the court relied on the factors set forth in Rule 1.5(a) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct to ensure a reasonable fee award. In short, the court awarded Garcia only about 1/3 of the total fees generated by his attorneys, and roughly 2/3 of the requested fees. Based on the foregoing, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, or otherwise err, in calculating the amount or reasonableness of the attorneys\u2019 fees awarded to the prevailing party, Garcia.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>\n<em>II.

Rule 1-341. Foulger-Pratt\u2019s attorneys\u2019 accrued $255,869.09 in total fees (disbursements comprising $10,456.59 of the total) and sought recovery for all fees in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Rule 1-341</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Maryland Rule 1-341 (2002) provides in full:</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">In any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by the adverse party in opposing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Maryland courts employ a two-step process to determine if sanctions under the rule are warranted. <em>Barnes v. Rosenthal Toyota, Inc., </em>126 Md.App. 97, 105, 727 A.2d 431 (1999) (quoting and citing <em>Inlet Assocs. v.

SCHUETT, MARYLAND RULES COMMENTARY at 57 (3d. ed.2003). First, the court must determine if the party or attorney maintained or defended the action in bad faith or without substantial justification. <em>Id. </em>at 105. Bad faith, in the context of Rule 1-341, \u201cexists when a party litigates with the purpose of intentional harassment or unreasonable delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Seney, supra, </em>97 Md.App. at 554, 631 A.2d 139). \u201cFor there to be substantial justification, the litigant\u2019s position must be fairly debatable and within the realm of legitimate advocacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105-06 (citing <em>Inlet </em>Assocs., <em>supra, </em>324 Md. at 268, 596 A.2d 1049). The action(s) must be viewed at the time it was taken, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>not from judicial hindsight. <em>Legal Aid Bureau, Inc. v.

His oft-quoted words include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">Maryland Rule 1-341 is not, and never was intended, to be used as a weapon to force persons who have a questionable or innovative cause to abandon it because of a fear of the imposition of sanctions.

In short, it found Garcia had not acted \u201cwithout substantial justification\u201d in pursing his claims of conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and punitive damages, so there was no need to exercise its discretion in choosing a sanction. Accordingly, we need only review the court\u2019s factual findings under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>Barnes, supra, </em>126 Md.App. at 105, 727 A.2d 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Conversion</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Foulger-Pratt generically alleges that Garcia\u2019s claim had no basis under Maryland law, and therefore it was brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>\u201cwithout substantial justification.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Garcia filed the conversion claim for recovery of the $934,000 development fee, and argues that the conversion theory was an alternate, but viable, theory to recover the fee, and that the court recognized as much.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We agree with Garcia. Simply because a party misconceives a legal basis for recovery does not mean that a claim proceeded \u201cwithout substantial justification.\u201d <em>Century I Condo. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v.

Moreover, in this case, the trial court had previously denied Foulger-Pratt\u2019s motion to dismiss the conversion claim. <em>Needle, supra, </em>81 Md.App. at 479, 568 A.2d 856 (\u201cThe denial of the motion, furthermore, establishes that the court recognized that there were disputed questions of fact presented by the pleadings that precluded the court from granting [the] motion as a matter of law.\u201d). Upon our independent review of the record, we are unable to find the court\u2019s factual findings clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Prior to trial, the court granted Foulger-Pratt\u2019s motion to dismiss the breach of fiduciary duty count, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">THE COURT: All right. [FOULGER PRATT\u2019S COUNSEL], on breach of fiduciary duty motion to dismiss, let\u2019s take that, and the misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">I don\u2019t need to hear from you on the breach of fiduciary duty. I will listen to [GARCIA\u2019S COUNSEL] on that. Why don\u2019t I do that, and then we will go to the misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">[GARCIA\u2019S COUNSEL], 1 am faced with this day in and day out. I mean, everybody comes in with these same arguments back and forth, the same cases, and I have looked at the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">You see these Court of Special Appeals cases that follow Kahn v. Kahn, and they talk about breach of fiduciary duty, but when you go back to it, and you look at some of the federal cases, it is just not clear guidance to trial courts as to what you do in this situation, but having said all that, it seems to me that the arguments favor the defense on the breach of fiduciary duty, that in view of the fact that you have these other claims, conversion, more importantly the breach of contract claim, that the breach of fiduciary duty is out the window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">THE COURT: All right. As the Court indicated, the law is unclear because we are dealing with the Court of Appeals and the Court of Special Appeals in Maryland, but following the Kahn v. Kahn case line, the Court doesn\u2019t believe in this situation, since there is a cause of action set forth for breach of contract, albeit that there may be legitimate defenses to it one way or another \u2014 obviously I am not reaching anything close to even commenting on that, because I don\u2019t really know at this point \u2014 but the Court doesn\u2019t believe that under the factual scenario present in this case that there is, in view of the common holding, a breach of fiduciary duty, and accordingly the Court is going to grant the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>motion to dismiss count III of the second amended complaint for breach of fiduciary duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Foulger-Pratt now argues that the \u201claw <em>is </em>clear\u201d in Maryland, that an independent cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is not recognized if the allegations are duplicative of a breach of contract claim. (Emphasis added by FoulgerPratt). Foulger-Pratt bases its claim on <em>Kann v. Kann, </em>344 Md. 689, 690 A.2d 509 (1997), and several cases before this Court citing <em>Kann. </em>In <em>Kann, </em>the Court held \u201cthat there is no universal or omnibus tort for the redress of breach of fiduciary duty by any and all fiduciaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713, 690 A.2d 509. Were this all the Court of Appeals wrote on the subject, we might agree with Foulger-Pratt. The Court, however, further wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\"><em>This does not mean that there is no claim or cause of action available for breach of fiduciary duty. Our holding means that identifying a breach of fiduciary duty will be the beginning of the analysis, and not its conclusion. </em>Counsel are required to identify the particular fiduciary relationship involved, identify how it was breached, consider the remedies available, and select those remedies appropriate to the client\u2019s problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 713, 690 A.2d 509 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Contrary to Foulger-Pratt\u2019s position, we do not find the Court\u2019s holding dispositive regarding the survival of an independent tortious fiduciary duty claim when a breach of contract claim is likewise brought; rather the Court of Appeals held that the analysis must be done on a case-by-case basis. <em>Id. </em>at 713, 690 A.2d 509. For example, following <em>Kann, </em>the Court of Appeals recognized breach of fiduciary duty as a viable cause of action in <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Miller, </em>362 Md. 361, 765 A.2d 587 (2001) (upholding fiduciary duty claim brought by insurers against agent representing insurers).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Moreover, the trial court found that Garcia\u2019s assertion of the claim was \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d thus quelling any notion that Rule 1-341 would apply. We agree with that conclusion, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>are unable to find the factual predicate supporting that conclusion to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Negligent Misrepresentation</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The misrepresentation claim, like the conversion claim, survived Foulger-Pratt\u2019s motion to dismiss and was heard on the merits. On this alone, we would agree with the court\u2019s unwillingness to find an absence of substantial justification under Md. Rule 1-341. <em>Needle, supra, </em>81 Md.App. at 479, 568 A.2d 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The misrepresentation claim surfaced after FoulgerPratt\u2019s attorneys, acting as agents of their client, made certain communications to Garcia about a \u201cdraft\u201d tax return, and amendments to the Operating Agreement involving payment of the development fee. Foulger-Pratt argues that there were no false statements in those communications and thus, no cause of action under Maryland law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">We cannot agree with Foulger-Pratt\u2019s conclusion. When the misrepresentation claim is viewed in light of the entire record, and the factual context available at the time, Garcia may be said to have a \u201cfairly debatable\u201d reason for filing and maintaining this claim. As we noted <em>supra, </em>Foulger-Pratt\u2019s counsel noted in his June 19, 2002, letter that its previous communications about the return of the development fee were \u201cnot completely accurate.\u201d Counsel also wrote, \u201cYou <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>may then want to \u2018reinstate\u2019 those claims which were amended out because of the wording of my letter, which of course will not be opposed.\u201d Moreover, even though Foulger-Pratt had turned over a \u201cdraft\u201d tax form to Garcia, Foulger-Pratt\u2019s chief financial officer admitted at trial that the form was incorrect. We reiterate that under Md. Rule 1-341 a party\u2019s action is viewed at the time it took place, not with the benefit of judicial hindsight. <em>Bishop\u2019s Garth, </em>75 Md.App. at 221, 540 A.2d 1175. Furthermore, simply because a party does not prevail at trial does not necessitate a finding that a claim was brought in bad faith or without substantial justification. Otherwise, every losing party could be subject to sanctions under Md. Rule 1-341. Rather, this court\u2019s jurisprudence makes clear that \u201cMaryland Rule 1-341 is not, and never was intended, to be used as a weapon to force persons who have a questionable or innovative cause to abandon it because of a fear of the imposition of sanctions.\u201d <em>Bishop\u2019s Garth, supra, </em>75 Md.App. at 224, 540 A.2d 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Foulger-Pratt argues that Garcia did not have a fairly debatable reason for filing a punitive damage claim. Garcia filed the punitive damage claim because of the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFAD\">defendants\u2019 repeated, persistent, wanton and cavalier disregard for Garcia\u2019s rights under the Agreement of Limited Partnership \u2014 including the defendants\u2019 failure to take even basic steps to provide Garcia with accurate statements of fact concerning matters critical to this litigation \u2014 must be the result of a conscious desire to punish Garcia for having had the temerity to insist on receiving what he is entitled under the parties\u2019 agreements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The parties have evidently zeroed in on the misrepresentation claim as the foundation for the punitive damage claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Punitive damages, as the term suggests, seek to punish a party \u201cwhose conduct is characterized by evil motive, intent to injure, or fraud, and to warn others contemplating similar conduct of the serious risk of monetary liability.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number><em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 454, 601 A.2d 633 (1992). Punishment and deterrence are the two main goals of punitive damages. <em>Id. </em>at 454, 601 A.2d 633. Recovery of punitive damages requires the presence of actual malice, that is \u201cconduct characterized by evil motive, intent to injure, ill will, or fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, n. 20, 601 A.2d 633. A plaintiff must prove the actual malice by a standard of clear and convincing evidence in order to recover. <em>Le Marc\u2019s Mgmt. Co'rp. v. Valentin, </em>349 Md. 645, 709 A.2d 1222 (1998). We note, however, a finding of actual malice may be inferred from circumstantial evidence. <em>McClung-Logan Equipment Co. v. Thomas, </em>226 Md. 136, 148, 172 A.2d 494 (1961). \u201cMalice, fraud, deceit and wrongful motive are oftenest inferred from acts and circumstantial evidence. They are seldom admitted and need not be proved by direct evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). If a party files a claim for punitive damages in bad faith or without substantial justification, a court has the discretion to invoke the Rule 1-341 sanctions. <em>Nast v. Lockett, </em>312 Md. 343, 371, 539 A.2d 1113 (1988), <em>overruled on other grounds, Owens-Illinois, supra, </em>325 Md. 420, 601 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The trial court determined, as a matter of fact, that the \u201cinference of malice is \u2018fairly debatable!.\u2019 \u201d] We are unable to find the court\u2019s determination clearly erroneous. While we agree that punitive damages were not warranted in this case, there were facts (with inferences therefrom), presented during certain phases of the litigation, suggesting an ill-will or improper motive. For example, during the redirect examination of Clayton Foulger, the resident agent of the Partnership, the following discussion took place about the development fee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">Q [GARCIA\u2019S COUNSEL] In any event, the way you did it before you have now retroactively tried to change it, Mr. Garcia did not get either directly or indirectly, a penny of that $950,000, did he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">A [FOULGER] That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Q [GARCIA\u2019S COUNSEL] So he gets the benefit only if you pay him ten percent of it, which is what he is asking for and what you are denying in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">A [FOULGER] Yes, that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">THE COURT: Maybe I am really thick, but I don\u2019t even understand why you would consider it. If it goes back into FP Rockville in a year, which your tax boys say to do, and you have said, \u201cOkay,\u201d why would you even think about putting it out to FPDI, Foulger-Pratt Development, if it\u2019s going to mean taxes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">[FP\u2019S COUNSEL]: Because of the lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">[GARCIA\u2019S COUNSEL]: Because they don\u2019t want to share it with us. He would rather take $450,000 in taxes than to give us ten percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">[FOULGER]: That\u2019s not correct, that\u2019s not correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">THE COURT: Well, that is, in effect, what is happening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">[FOULGER]: No, that\u2019s not correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">THE COURT: I mean, you are doing that solely because of this lawsuit? That is the reason you would do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">[FOULGER]: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-13\">THE COURT: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-14\">[FOULGER]: Because if I gave up that right, right now, they would argue that we changed that amendment, we amended that, in response to their complaint. That\u2019s why. And then they would \u2014 they would \u2014 they would then say that it\u2019s conversion, and then they would claim that we misrepresented from the beginning. And that\u2019s why it was important for me to retain that right so that they couldn\u2019t claim that I had done this in response to their suit, and I have not done that. But, you are right; economically, it doesn\u2019t make sense. I agree with you. But I have retained that right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">Although Foulger explains a motive, lacking the element of ill-will, for the reason Foulger-Pratt Development, Inc. would have incurred the $450,000 tax liability, there is nonetheless another inference that the purpose was premised on actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>malice, as pointed out by Garcia\u2019s counsel. The court believed Foulger-Pratt\u2019s explanation, and hence it denied the punitive damage claim. For example, in the court\u2019s written opinion on the merits it wrote: \u201cThis Court has found that the general partner did divert the development fee that belonged to the partnership, but what is not clear from the evidence is why the diversion was initially accomplished.\u201d At the same time, however, the court recognized that inferences could made from the facts to suggest actual malice, and hence it denied Foulger-Pratt\u2019s request for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">In conclusion, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, or otherwise err in denying Foulger-Pratt attorneys\u2019 fees under Md. Rule 1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED; EACH PARTY TO PAY ITS OWN COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-11\">.

One </em>form <em>of action </em>that a limited partner <em>may </em>bring against a limited partnership is a derivative action. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Corps. &amp; Assn's \u00a7 10-1001 (Repl.Vol. 1999); <em>Provident Bank, supra, </em>98 Md.App. at 612, 634 A.2d 973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b693-9\">. Garcia also argued before the trial court that the Partnership had a number of creditors who might be considered as benefitted group members, such as in <em>Davis, supra, </em>73 Md. 530, 21 A. 712. FoulgerPratt claims that Garcia\u2019s evidence about other creditors is anecdotal or speculative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b695-6\">. The \"lodestar\u201d approach calculates the attorneys' fees \u201cby multiplying the reasonable number of hours expended by the attorney on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate and then to consider appropriate adjustments to the product of that multiplication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504, 819 A.2d 354.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b697-4\">. Prior to Garcia's second amended complaint (i.e., nine out of the ten months that litigation had been pending), return of the development fee and a 5% direct interest were the only relief sought by Garcia. All said, one-half of Garcia's claims (conversion, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty) sought the return of the $934,000 development fee, in which he succeeded in recovering.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b697-5\">. In light of the notion that this Court may affirm a trial court if it is right, even for the wrong reason, because the court\u2019s determination was consistent with <em>Friolo </em>and <em>Hensley, </em>we have no need to address whether the court's reliance on <em>Continental Cas. v. Bd. of Ed. of Charles County, </em>302 Md. 516, 489 A.2d 536 (1985), was erroneous. <em>See Hurt v. Chavis, </em>128 Md.App. 626, 640, 739 A.2d 924 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\">. Foulger-Pratt argues that Garcia \"through his appeal continues to persist, in pursuing [this] cause of action. As a result, Defendants ... continue to incur substantial costs and fees having to defend a claim that plainly lacked substantial justification.\u201d This is absolutely incorrect. Garcia made clear in his appeal that he was not appealing the conversion ruling, nor several other claims for that matter. Garcia wrote the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Mr. Garcia does not intend to pursue his appeal from the Circuit Court\u2019s rulings dismissing or denying his breach of contract claim relating to the general partner's refusal to provide him with timely access to the Partnership\u2019s tax information and other records, his claims for conversion, breach of fiduciary duty and misrepresentation and his request for punitive damages. To the extent, however, that the defendants argue in their appeal that those claims were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, Mr. Garcia respectfully reserves his right to argue their merit in his opposition to the defendants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\">. The elements of negligent misrepresentation are:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">1) The negligent assertion of a false statement by the defendant owing a duty of care to the plaintiff;</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">2) The intention of the defendant for the plaintiff to act or rely upon the negligent assertion;</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">3) The knowledge of the defendant that the plaintiff will probably rely upon the negligent assertion or statement which, if erroneous, will cause damage;</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">4) Justifiable action by the plaintiff in reliance upon the statement or assertion; and</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">5) The incurring of damages caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence.
