Akopian, to circumvent the denial of a continuance by the administrative judge, dismissed the charges following a re-indictment. The State has appealed the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The State raises one question for review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we have rephrased for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">Did the State\u2019s entry of a <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the charges against appellee have the effect, either actual or intentional, of circumventing Rule 4-271<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, requiring appellee to be tried within 180 days?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">We answer the question in the negative, and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">By indictment of the grand jury, returned on June 13, 2002, appellee, Tigra D. Akopian,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was charged with robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. A privately retained attorney entered his appearance on behalf of appellee on June 20, 2002, thus starting the <em>Hicks </em>calendar, which would have required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>that appellee be tried not later than December 17, 2002.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Trial was set for September 11, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">On September 6, 2002, the State moved to continue because a police officer, considered \u201can essential State\u2019s witness,\u201d was not available on the scheduled trial date.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The motion was granted and a new trial date was set for October 22, 2002. The case was called for trial on that date and the State again requested a continuance. The request was referred to the administrative judge. In support of its motion, the State noted appellee\u2019s motion for appropriate relief filed the previous day, and the unavailability of one of the State\u2019s witnesses. When requesting the postponement, the State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agn\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, this matter was set for trial this morning, and the State is not \u2014 well, let me just back up for one moment and offer to the Court that [appellee\u2019s counsel] filed a motion for appropriate relief yesterday \u2014 I just received it yesterday \u2014 asking the court to order a pretrial identification of his client, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">... And on top of that, I also have witnesses today \u2014 two officers, specifically the K-9 officer in this case \u2014 this is a track case \u2014 who is not available \u2014 he\u2019s out with the shootings <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 as well as the lead officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">Based on all the circumstances, I would actually ask the Court to postpone this case and charge it to both the State and the defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>There was discussion on the record concerning which party had requested the earlier continuance, and the court determined that the State had made the request, not appellee as incorrectly indicated in the docket entries. The administrative judge denied the State\u2019s request for continuance. The State then asked the administrative judge to reconsider, or to postpone the trial until the next day if possible. When the administrative judge pointed out that appellee would have to remain in jail while the case was rescheduled, the State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, Your Honor, and I would also ask the Court to consider this. I can ask for a brief postponement. I can try this case tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">[THE COURT]: You got a continuance once before. Your predecessor got a continuance, because you weren\u2019t ready then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Understood. I understood, (sic) Your Honor. But I can ask for a brief postponement of even a day. All I am asking for is for the officer to be able to come. This is a K-9 case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">[THE COURT]: No. You can pick the jury. You can get started. Do whatever you need to today. And if you want to start the testimony, you can do it tomorrow morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Although the administrative judge technically denied the State\u2019s request for a one-day continuance he did, in effect, tell the State that a continuance was not actually needed in the circumstances because witnesses would not be reached until the next day. Thereafter, appellee maneuvered the State into an untenable position, <em>vis a vis </em>its witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The parties returned to the courtroom of the assigned trial judge. When the case was called for trial, appellee, by his counsel, told the court that he had no motions to make, waived his right to a jury trial, and elected to have a bench trial. The effect of those elections was to put the State to the task of proceeding immediately to trial, rather than to a motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>hearing and jury selection, as had been anticipated by the State and the administrative judge. The State renewed its motion for continuance, and in further support offered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, if I may just for the record, a critical witness in this case is a K-9 officer and he is out working the sniper case. He has not returned our pages. I am not able to reach him. Given the severity of the situation and his\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">[DEFENSE]: We have reached him. It is just that he cannot get off his case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Oh, I am sorry, Your Honor. We have been able to contact him but he is out there with the dogs right now looking for the sniper and I am not ready to proceed. I will nolle-pros all counts at this time. I will be re-indicting this case on Thursday.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Defense counsel argued that the officer, whose unavailability was the basis for the State\u2019s motion, was not an essential witness and that, therefore, it was inappropriate for the State to base its postponement request on that officer\u2019s absence. Counsel noted appellee\u2019s speedy trial rights for the record, and further noted that the <em>Hicks </em>date was approaching. The court noted the objection, but acknowledged that \u201cthe prosecutor carries an (sic) near absolute power to nolle-pros (sic) those cases if it feels appropriate to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Appellee was re-indicted on October 24, 2002.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An initial appearance was held on October 28, 2002, at which he was represented by the Office of the Public Defender.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court scheduled a status conference for November 1, 2002. Appellee was incarcerated and not transported for the hearing. At that conference, before the administrative judge, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, this is a re-indictment of a case I nol-prossed last week because one of my officers, the K-9 officer, was unavailable for trial because of the sniper shooting \u2014 the last sniper shooting. And I had asked for a postponement, it was denied, and I then nol-prossed the case and reindicted it Thursday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: If Your Honor can set in both a 4-215 and a trial date, I don\u2019t \u2014 Your Honor, I am in \u2014 I am\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">[THE COURT]: I can\u2019t put the cart before the horse. What is the sense in me setting a trial date without getting a lawyer for \u2014 and I assume the Public Defender is going to have to interview him. By the time they get somebody assigned to this case, Lord knows when they will be ready for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>Well, Your Honor, I am in a difficult position, because I have a 180 problem that I am trying to avoid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">[THE COURT]: ... I can\u2019t set a trial date until I get him a lawyer. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Thereupon, the administrative judge recessed the status conference and ordered that it be reconvened, in conjunction with a Rule 4-215 hearing,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> on November 7, 2002. The administrative judge also ordered that appellee be interviewed by the Office of the Public Defender. At the November 7, 2002 status conference and Rule 4-215 hearing, appellee was again unrepresented; the court questioned him regarding the status of his representation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>[THE COURT]: Is [your previous attorney] going to represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">[DEFENDANT]: I\u2019m not sure yet, sir, because when I got found nol-prosecuted (sic) on my charge, I was under \u2014 he and I was under the impression that the case was basically over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I understand that the continuance was denied on the day of trial when a K-9 officer was involved with searching the sniper\u2019s car, and [the State] made it clear on that date, I think on the record, that she planned to re-indict the case, and [Akopian\u2019s previous attorney] was certainly aware of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">[THE COURT]: Have you contacted the Public Defender\u2019s Office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">[DEFENDANT]: No, sir. I plan on getting a paid lawyer for this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">[THE COURT]: I know, but we need to get \u2014 you have a trial date coming up on January 13.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">[DEFENDANT]: I plan on having a lawyer by then, sir. [THE COURT]: Well, I am going to bring you back every week until you tell me who your lawyer is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">[DEFENDANT]: Okay, sir. I have to tell my family to hire me a lawyer, because right now\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I believe the <em>Hicks </em>date on the original case runs on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">[THE COURT]: That wouldn\u2019t make any difference. It wouldn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-13\">[PROSECUTOR]:I don\u2019t think so either, but I guess [the State] was a little concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-14\">[THE COURT]: Have you talked to Mr. [your previous attorney]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-15\">[DEFENDANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-16\">[THE COURT]: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-17\">[DEFENDANT]: I haven\u2019t \u2014 I haven\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>[THE COURT]: Has [he] been out to see you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoH\">[DEFENDANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">[THE COURT]: And you haven\u2019t called him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZb\">[DEFENDANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">[THE COURT]: I would suggest you get \u2014 when you get back to the jail today, you better get in touch with him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq7\">[DEFENDANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">[THE COURT]: \u2014 because if you don\u2019t, then I am going to have the Public Defender represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">[DEFENDANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Appellant\u2019s father then indicated to the court that he intended to hire an attorney for his son, and repeatedly refused the services of the Office of the Public Defender.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The State filed a motion to advance the trial date to November 8, 2002.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The State\u2019s motion addressed the speedy trial issue: \u201cThe Maryland Rule 4-213, 180 day requirement on the first case began on June 6, 2002.... The State seeks to advance the trial date of the instant matter, to a date before December 12, 2002 to foreclose any possible claim of a 180 day violation, pursuant to Rule 4-213.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The administrative judge held yet another status conference for November 15, 2002. Appellee was present, but was again unrepresented. On this occasion, appellee\u2019s father again appeared and told the court that he had not yet hired a lawyer for his son, but that he was \u201cin the process of hiring a lawyer.\u201d The State again raised the issue of the <em>Hicks </em>deadline to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... [t]his is not a new indictment. This is a re-indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">[THE COURT]: It doesn\u2019t make any difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: And I will offer the Court this information. When the case was nol-prossed, the Court denied my postponement request, and I was not able to go forward with trial, and I went ahead and nol-prossed the case and re-indicted it two days later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">And in the first case,[defendant\u2019s previous attorney], represented the defendant, and it is my understanding that he also has a case coming up next week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">But I will offer to the Court that when [he] realized that I was in \u2014 I was in a position to ask that this case be set within 180 counting from the case that was initially \u2014 the first indictment in this case, to ensure that there would not be a speedy trial violation or objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">To remove that as a possible issue, I had spoken with [Akopian\u2019s previous attorney] about setting this case in before the 180 [days] expired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">[THE COURT]: Well, he doesn\u2019t have counsel. That is the problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: But I would ask the Court \u2014 you already advised him of his right to counsel ... last week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">But in any event, if the Court would just set a trial date and \u2014 you have already advised him many, many times to get counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">If it is not going to be [Akopian\u2019s previous attorney], who I think at this point is \u2014 and with all due respect to him, I think that he is just really trying to delay this beyond my 180 day at this point and will not be coming into this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-13\">Having been advised and having had counsel in the previous matter, <em>I would just ask the Court to set this case in before the 180 expires.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>And I will just offer to the Court, I have argued this particular issue in front of Judge Mason, and he has advised me on this motion for a speedy trial on another case where a re-indictment occurred, and he said it is the State\u2019s obligation to ensure that there is an advanced trial date for that re-indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">And at this point I have done everything I could to get this thing set in.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The administrative judge instructed appellee\u2019s father to contact his son\u2019s previous attorney between that date and the next week, and instruct him to appear. On November 22, 2002, appellee again appeared without counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, we need [appellee] because [Akopian\u2019s previous attorney] may or may not represent him, and at this point, I would ask the Court to just sign a waiver and <em>advance the trial date.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">[THE COURT]: I am not going to do that until he gets a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Oh, [appellee] is not here. Okay, Your Honor. I just don\u2019t know what to do with him anymore, because this is the ongoing case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">[THE COURT]: Yeah, I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-13\">[THE COURT]: But I am not going to get into any waivers or anything else until he gets counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: Right. But if he chooses not to get counsel, which seems to be the case, given that this is the third week in a row that we have been here trying to find out whether or not he has a public defender or [his previous attorney].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-15\">He was here last week with his father, who spoke at length about his questions for [his son\u2019s previous attorney], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>and I think Your Honor was going to contact [that attorney], I haven\u2019t heard from him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">[The COURT]: I did, and [he] has not entered his appearance yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Right. And since we can\u2019t make him do that, at this point I am not certain where to go with this case. If Your Honor would \u2014 well, maybe you would find a good-cause basis to set the trial date as it currently is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArF\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The Court then telephoned a public defender to arrange for appellee to be interviewed. The assistant public defender who responded to the call advised the court of a letter, written by appellee\u2019s father, indicating that appellee did not want a public defender, and that the family would be raising money to retain other counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Appellee\u2019s father stated that appellee would have an attorney by the time of his January 13 court date, at which time the court informed appellee\u2019s father that the State was moving to advance the trial date. Appellee\u2019s father reiterated that his son did not want a public defender: \u201c[h]e doesn\u2019t want Public Defender (sic).\u201d The court also noted that appellee\u2019s previous attorney had not yet entered his appearance in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The assistant public defender expressed concern that they could be ready for trial by January 13, but agreed to interview appellee. The court acknowledged that appellant\u2019s father had been present at every hearing and was aware of the situation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A status conference was set for the following week, November 27, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Appellee appeared at the next conference, again unrepresented. Upon questioning by the court, he admitted refusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the services of a public defender.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Notwithstanding appellee\u2019s lack of counsel, the court set the case in for a jury trial on December 11, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">After the trial did not go forward on December 11, 2002,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> appellee\u2019s previous counsel entered his appearance on behalf of appellee on December 13, 2002, and filed a motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court reset the matter for a hearing on the motion to dismiss on December 20, 2002, and for a two-day jury trial on January 6, 2003.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss was granted at the conclusion of the December 20, 2002 hearing. In granting the motion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">If the nol-pros is entered in an effort to avoid a ruling or order by the administrative judge enforcing ... the 180-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>[Hicks </em>] rule \u2014 and that the nol-pros then enters to circumvent the order of the court, I don\u2019t believe that that can be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">And ... while I honestly and sincerely applaud [the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s] efforts to get this set back in within 180 days \u2014 and frankly, that may be a critical distinction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">But the position I have taken -with respect to these motions and this rule is that there are two parts to that rule ... discussed in <em>Hicks.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">One is that trial has ... to be tried ... within 180 days. The other part to the rule ... is that it may not be continued unless for good cause shown by the administrative judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">And the cases that have dealt with this issue on appeal have discussed the importance of allowing the administrative judge to manage this docket so that all cases can be handled in an efficient manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">So ... it is not just the 180-day clause within the rule, but ... that the case cannot be continued unless for good cause shown and found by the administrative judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">In this case, clearly the State entered the nol-pros to avoid the order of the administrative judge which is that the case not be continued, no good cause having been shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\"><em>I will say that the State, through the extraordinary efforts of [the State\u2019s Attorney], has managed in my view to satisfy the 180-day prong of that rule </em>by managing to get the case set back in on the re-indictment by December 11th, which makes this case different from any case that is cited on appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">That notwithstanding, I think when you read those cases, they stand for the proposition that ... notwithstanding that you were able to get it set back in, that still the net effect of this was that you overruled the determination of the administrative judge that there was no good cause for continuing the prosecution of this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">The State filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\n<em>Did the State\u2019s use of a nolle prosequi of the charges against appellee have the effect, either actual or intentional, of circumventing Rule 4r-271, requiring appellee be tried within 180 days?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The trial date for a criminal case in the circuit court may not be later than 180 days after the earlier of the appearance of counsel or, as provided in the Maryland Rules, the first appearance of the defendant before the circuit court. Maryland Rule 4-271 (implementing former Md. Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 591); Md.Code Ann.Crim. Pro. \u00a7 6-103 (2001).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals in <em>Hicks, supra, </em>read former \u00a7 591 and Rule 4-271 to require all criminal cases in the circuit court to be tried within 180 days, and \u201cwhere trial has not commenced within the prescribed period, the county administrative judge or his designee to find good cause for the postponement of the trial and the rescheduling of it beyond the 180-day period.\u201d <em>Jackson v. State, </em>358 Md. 259, 262 n. 3, 747 A.2d 1199 (2000) (citing <em>Hicks, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In <em>Baker v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 281, 745 A.2d 1142 (2000), we addressed the calculation of time under Maryland Rule 4-271 in cases where charges have been <em>not prossed </em>and the defendant then re-indicted. Judge Moylan detailed the approach adopted by Maryland courts to calculate the 180-day period following a re-indictment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">When earlier charges are <em>not prossed </em>and new charges are subsequently filed, the new charges have a life of their own. A new and independent 180-day count begins with respect to them. The <em>not prossing </em>of initial charges, therefore, is not an occasion for skepticism or suspicion. Under the ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>approach[ ] chosen by Maryland, it is a legitimate and accepted way of doing prosecutorial business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\"><em>Baker, supra, </em>130 Md.App. at 288, 745 A.2d 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">However, the noted exception to this rule applies when it is demonstrated that the <em>nolle prosequi </em>had the purpose or necessary effect of circumventing the requirements of the 180-day rule set forth in Rule 4-271 and \u00a7 6-103 of the Criminal Procedure Article. In such instances, the 180-day period will begin to run from the arraignment or first appearance of counsel under the original indictment. <em>Baker, supra, </em>130 Md.App. at 289, 745 A.2d 1142 (citing <em>Curley v. State, </em>299 Md. 449, 462, 474 A.2d 502 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The first prong of the test, that the <em>nolle prosequi </em>have the \u201cnecessary effect\u201d of circumventing the 180-day rule, has been narrowly defined by the Court of Appeals. A <em>nolle prosequi </em>will only have the necessary effect of attempting to circumvent the 180-day rule when the only alternative to the <em>nolle prosequi </em>would be a dismissal with prejudice for violation of the <em>Hicks </em>rule. <em>Baker, supra, </em>130 Md.App. at 292-93, 745 A.2d 1142 (quoting <em>Curley, supra, </em>299 Md. at 462, 474 A.2d 502). Further, we have previously held that if time remains in the 180-day period when the <em>nolle prosequi </em>is entered, the <em>nolle prosequi </em>will fail \u201cself-evidently ... [to] have the necessary effect of circumventing the 180-day rule.\u201d <em>Baker, supra, </em>130 Md.App. at 292, 745 A.2d 1142 (emphasis in original). The Court of Appeals has cautioned that not every effect of a <em>nolle prosequi </em>should be treated as a necessary effect. <em>Baker, supra, </em>130 Md.App. at 297-98, 745 A.2d 1142 (citing <em>State v. Brown, </em>341 Md. 609, 620, 672 A.2d 602 (1996)). Because there were more than fifty days remaining in the original <em>Hicks </em>calendar when the <em>nolle prosequi </em>was entered on October 22, 2002, the State\u2019s action, in and of itself, did not have the necessary effect of circumventing the 180-day rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">The second prong of the test requires an inquiry as to whether the <em>nolle prosequi </em>did, in fact, have the purpose of circumventing the 180-day rule. Our decision in <em>Ross v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 357, 700 A.2d 282 (1997), addressed this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>aspect of a <em>Hicks </em>issue. In <em>Ross, </em>the trial date was scheduled well within the original 180-day period. On the day of trial, the State requested a continuance before the administrative judge because the drugs seized had not yet been analyzed. The administrative judge denied the requested continuance and stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think this case can be put back in. Our docket is too crowded. It cannot be put back in before Hicks runs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361, 700 A.2d 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">After the administrative judge denied the State\u2019s request for a postponement, the State immediately <em>nol prossed </em>the charges and filed a new indictment. The defendant was tried within the \u201cnew\u201d 180 day time, but beyond 180 days as calculated from the original indictment. In <em>Ross, </em>this Court held that the State\u2019s immediate <em>nolle prosequi </em>in the face of the denial of its postponement request circumvented the 180-day rule. <em>Id. </em>at 370-71, 700 A.2d 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The appellee argues that <em>Ross </em>is dispositive of the issue presented here. When asked why the case was not scheduled within 180 days of the original indictment, Akopian\u2019s counsel answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">Now, what happened is they re-indict him ... that Friday. They then get an arraignment that next Tuesday. They get a trial date of January, which would have been outside of <em>Hicks. </em>Then the state obtains a status for the following Friday and tries to advance the court date to get it within the 180 days of the first case.... The bottom line is it didn\u2019t happen ... for a couple of reasons. No. 1, the court just can\u2019t do it. The January court date was given. There was a court date that was given that would have potentially been within <em>Hicks ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">That response does not present all the facts apparent from the record. In fact, as we have noted in detail, the State made numerous attempts to expedite the trial date to avoid a <em>Hicks </em>problem, and to inform the attorney who represented appellee in the first case of its efforts, even though his appearance was not formally entered. <em>Ross, Curley, Baker, </em>and <em>Brown </em>are factually inapposite as they relate to the efforts by the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>to avoid a <em>Hicks </em>dismissal. In those cases the State was attempting to save a case from dismissal for its failure to bring the defendant to trial within 180 days. Here, by contrast, the State was vigorous in its effort to advance the trial date to fit within the original 180 day calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">At this point it is appropriate to review our recent decision in <em>State v. Price, </em>152 Md.App. 640, 833 A.2d 614 (2003), <em>cert. granted </em>379 Md. 98, 839 A.2d 741 (Jan. 9, 2004) (No. 107). There, we discussed the consequences of the entry of a <em>nolle prosequi, </em>followed by a re-indictment and a trial on a date beyond the expiration of the <em>Hicks </em>time. So that our position is clear, we shall point to the distinctions between <em>Price </em>and the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In <em>Price, </em>the State had entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>after the administrative judge had denied its motion for continuance, the ground for which was the unavailability of DNA evidence, which had not been processed by the crime laboratory in time for trial. The State was faced with a discovery order to produce the report within the time ordered by the court, and the potential for dismissal based upon a discovery failure. The <em>nolle prosequi </em>was then entered and a re-indictment followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Speaking for this Court, Judge Davis wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">The \u201cnecessary effect of the nol pros\u201d was to circumvent not only the requirements of [Art. 27] \u00a7 591 and Md. Rule [4-271(a)(1) ], but also the sanction that \u201cthe State be prohibited from introducing any witness or evidence at trial or hearing which relates in any way to the nondisclosure for failure to comply\u201d with the motion to compel discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO\">152 Md.App. at 655, 833 A.2d 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">In that case the State\u2019s entry of the <em>nolle prosequi </em>was to avoid the sanction for its inability to comply with the discovery order, which resulted ultimately in a trial date beyond that permitted under the <em>Hicks </em>analysis. We held, therefore, that the <em>Hicks </em>period began from the date of the initial indictment, not from the date of the re-filed indictment, and that the court did not err in dismissing the case. Here, we have no such lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>of diligence, for the State stood ready to try the case well before the expiration of the 180 day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">A second distinction between the facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>and others cited is that, unlike the others, appellee continued to appear without counsel and continually refused the services of the public defender, despite the efforts of the administrative judge to counsel him on the importance of being represented. Having exhausted its efforts to have appellee obtain counsel, the court finally set the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Appellee\u2019s refusal to obtain counsel cannot be discounted in assessing the time taken to get the case to trial, from the State\u2019s initial postponement request on October 22, 2002, until the actual trial date set for December 11, 2002, when, but for the unforeseen closing of the circuit court because of inclement weather, the case presumably would have gone to trial. Further, the case before us is unlike <em>Curley, supra, </em>299 Md. at 462, 474 A.2d 502, where the State <em>nol prossed </em>the case on the 180th day. As we have previously held, a <em>nolle prosequi </em>is a procedural device that may be used by the State at its discretion, and not the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Baker, supra, </em>130 Md.App. at 294-96, 745 A.2d 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We cannot discern from the record facts that would indicate that the State\u2019s use of a <em>nolle prosequi </em>had either the necessary effect or the purpose of circumventing the 180-day rule, as more than fifty days remained in the <em>Hicks </em>period. When the case was originally called for trial on October 22, 2002, the State\u2019s witnesses were unavailable due to the exigent circumstances of the serial sniper shootings in Montgomery County. In denying the State\u2019s motion for continuance, the administrative judge indicated his expectation that the trial proceedings would be somewhat delayed by selecting a jury, and that the State would not reach the then-absent witnesses until at least the second day. We agree with the State that, \u201c[i]t was under these specific circumstances that the administrative judge denied the State\u2019s request for postponement, in the anticipation that trial would not begin until, at the earliest, the next day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The State was willing to commence the trial on October 22, by litigating pending motions and, thereafter, participating in jury selection. Appellee\u2019s unexpected waiver of his right to trial by jury, and election of a bench trial, effectively pulled the rug out from under the State. Faced with the unavailability of necessary police witnesses, and rather than go forward and not be able to prove its case, the State chose to <em>nolle prosequi </em>and re-indict. We recognize that a defendant\u2019s election to be tried by a jury or by the court is absolute. Likewise absolute is the State\u2019s option to utilize the <em>nolle prosequi </em>as a tool to avoid unfairness to the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Therefore, we hold that the entry of the <em>nolle prosequi </em>on October 22, 2002, had neither the necessary nor intended effect of circumventing the 180-day rule. A new 180-day time period began after appellee\u2019s re-indictment, accounting from the date of his initial appearance after that indictment. It is abundantly clear from the record that the State made extraordinary effort to obtain a trial date well within the outside limit of the original 180-day calendar. In every instance the State\u2019s effort was thwarted by appellee\u2019s appearance without counsel and, what we conclude to be, his refusal to be represented.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is true that the savvy defendant can manipulate the system to obtain delays, and the facts before us lead to the inescapable conclusion that appellee\u2019s goal was to delay trial to the point of a <em>Hicks </em>violation, despite the State\u2019s best efforts to avoid that result. The State should not suffer the detriment of his manipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS; COSTS ASSESSED TO APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-11\">. The question as originally presented by the State for review is:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Did the trial court err in dismissing the charges against [appellee] after re-indictment, where the State nol pressed the original charges because the State could not proceed to trial due to the unavailability of witnesses?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-13\">.
