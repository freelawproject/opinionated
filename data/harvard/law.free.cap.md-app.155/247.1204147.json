EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">In a civil case in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, a jury found Robert Beeman (\u201cBeeman\u201d), Suzanne Beeman, and their company, A Home of Your Own, Inc. (\u201cAHOYO\u201d), liable for conspiracy to defraud, fraud, and violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (\u201cMCPA\u201d), for perpetrating a scheme to sell the appellees, plaintiffs below, dilapidated residential properties at grossly inflated prices. Through Bee-man, AHOYO purchased the properties for small sums and quickly sold them to the appellees (whom for ease of discussion we shall from time to time call \u201cbuyers\u201d) at huge profits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although by agreement of counsel the word \u201cflipping\u201d was not used at trial, that is the colloquialism for the type of fraudulent scheme practiced by the Beemans and their company.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The Beemans and AHOYO are not parties to this appeal, and their fraud and consequent liability in tort to the buyers are not in question.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appellants are three co-defendants who were tried jointly with the Beemans and AHOYO: Irwin Mortgage Corporation (\u201cIrwin\u201d), the lender that extended FHA financing to each buyer; Joyce Wood (\u201cWood\u201d), a loan officer employed by Irwin who handled the financing for each transaction; and Arthur J. Hoffman (\u201cHoffman\u201d), the appraiser who performed the property valuation in each transaction. The buyers\u2019 theory of liability against Irwin was based solely on vicarious liability for the wrongful acts of Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">At trial, the appellants claimed to have known nothing about Beeman\u2019s scheme and to have been his unwitting victims. The buyers asserted, on the contrary, that Wood and Hoffman (and Irwin, through Wood) not only knew about but also participated in Beeman\u2019s design to sell them dilapidated houses at vastly inflated prices. The jury agreed with the buyers and found Irwin, Wood, and Hoffman liable for conspiracy to defraud and fraud, and for violations of the MCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The buyers were awarded a total of $129,020.03, in economic damages, and $1,305,000, in non-economic damages, against all the defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the court granted a motion for judgment that kept the issue of punitive damages against Irwin, Wood, and Hoffman from the jury\u2019s consideration, that issue went to the jury against the Beemans and AHOYO only. The jurors decided that punitive damages were warranted. Thereafter, in a separate proceeding, they awarded the buyers $1,800,000 in punitive damages against the Beemans and AHOYO.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">After denying post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d) and new trial or remittitur, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>court granted the buyers\u2019 petition for attorneys\u2019 fees under the MCPA, awarding them fees of $195,591.26, against all the defendants. The court ruled that the fee award would be reduced by the amount of fees recovered on the judgment for fraud, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The appellants have raised a multiplicity of questions for review on appeal. We have combined and rephrased the questions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">I. Did the circuit court err in denying Hoffman\u2019s motion for removal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">II. Did the trial court err in denying the defense motions for judgment and JNOV on the conspiracy to defraud, fraud, and MCPA claims; and Irwin and Wood\u2019s motion for JNOV on the affirmative defense of fraud?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">III. Did the trial court err in denying the defense motions for judgment, JNOV, and new trial/remittitur on the issue of non-economic damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">IV. Did the trial court err in declining to instruct the jury on the defense of equitable estoppel; in giving an erroneous instruction on economic damages; and in declining to give a curative instruction during closing argument? [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The appellees noted a cross-appeal, raising two questions, which we have reworded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">V. Did the trial court err in granting motions for judgment in favor of Irwin, Wood, and Hoffman on punitive damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">VI. Did the trial court err in ruling that the amount received by the buyers\u2019 counsel for the common law claims pursuant to the contingency fee agreement would be deducted from its award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the MCPA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court for compensatory damages; reverse the judgment of the circuit court on the issue of punitive damages against Irwin, Wood, and Hoffman; vacate the attorneys\u2019 fees award against Irwin, Wood, and Hoffman; and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion on the issue of punitive damages and on the petition for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Beginning in 1996, Beeman and his wife, Suzanne, through their company, AHOYO, embarked on a connivance to profit by buying up dilapidated residential properties in or near Baltimore City at low prices and quickly selling them to the unwary at hugely inflated prices. The Beemans and AHOYO targeted low income, unsophisticated renters in poor neighborhoods who dreamed of someday owning their own homes, and enticed them with promises that they could be homeowners for \u201conly $500 down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The scheme involved tricking a prospective buyer into thinking he or she was purchasing a \u201crehabbed\u201d house, or one that would be fully renovated by the time of settlement, and having Beeman illegally pay settlement and other costs, including paying off the buyer\u2019s creditors, so the transaction could go to closing \u2014 at which time Beeman\u2019s profits would far exceed the money he had fronted to make the deal happen. The properties Beeman\u2019s company purchased were in slum conditions. He would make cosmetic changes to a property and pass it off as \u201crehabbed.\u201d After settlement, the buyer was left with a property that was either uninhabitable or in seriously decayed condition, and was worth far less than the mortgage loan taken to buy it. Beeman continued this practice until early 1998, when he became the subject of a federal criminal investigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">This case involves eight of Beeman\u2019s and AHOYO\u2019s real estate transactions. Seven went to closing between July and December 1997, and one closed in January 1998. There were two buyers in one transaction; hence, there were nine buyer/plaintiffs at trial. The basic facts of the eight transactions, showing the purchases by Beeman/AHOYO and sales to the buyers, are as follows (chronologically by settlement date):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">1. 17 North Kresson Street/Buyer Jerry McFadden</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">April 23,1997: Purchased for $14,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">July 11, 1997: Sold for $52,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">2. 612 E. 41st Street/Buyer Carl Haley</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">June 25,1997: Purchased for $20,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">August 22, 1997: Sold for $57,200</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-11\">3. 610 North Belnord Road/Buyer Gertrude Green</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">June 18,1997: Purchased for $12,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-13\">September 8,1997: Sold for $44,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-14\">4. 5601 Force Road/Buyers Denise Brower and Forrest Spencer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-15\">August 7,1997: Purchased for $24,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-16\">September 24,1997: Sold for $65,900</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>5. 406 Oldham Street/Buyer Francine Henderson</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">March 27,1997: Purchased for $17,550</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">October 9,1997: Sold for $65,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">6. 3132 Piedmont Road/Buyer Eva Elder</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">September 5,1997: Purchased for $29,551</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">October 22,1997 Sold for $51,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">7. 6521 Lenhart Street/Buyer Toyome Stamper</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">September 5,1997: Purchased for $41,790</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\">December 5, 1997: Sold for $87,250</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-13\">8. 1127 Carroll Street/Buyer Inez Coward</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-14\">September 29,1997: Purchased for $7,550</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-15\">January 28, 1998: Sold for $58,000</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">The eight transactions were similar in most material respects and followed the same factual pattern.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-17\">Through AHOYO, Beeman would buy up depressed residential properties and then advertise in newspapers in Baltimore City that he could help people with little income and with credit problems buy houses with down payments of no more than $500. Some of the buyers in this case read Beeman\u2019s advertisements. Most of them heard about Beeman and AHOYO through word of mouth from others who had read the advertisements or had dealt with Beeman directly. Each of the buyers wanted to own a house and called Beeman for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-18\">The buyers had similar backgrounds. Each lived in a rental unit in Baltimore City and had been employed for at least two years in a steady job that paid a modest wage. None had ever owned real property and none had any experience buying or selling real property. Most of the buyers had graduated from high school or held GEDs, but some had dropped out of high school. A few had taken some college courses. Each had experienced credit problems and for that reason had a marginal credit history. All were unsophisticated in business matters. Many were renting units in crime-ridden neighborhoods and wanted to move so their families would have a safe place to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-19\">After the buyer called Beeman and left a message on his pager, Beeman would return the call and agree to a meeting. Usually Beeman went to the buyer\u2019s home. At the meeting, Beeman obtained preliminary income information and ran a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>credit report. After determining that the buyer\u2019s credit problems were not so insurmountable as to preclude obtaining financing, Beeman would offer to assist the buyer in purchasing a house in a neighborhood the buyer liked in or near Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Beeman\u2019s sales pitch was \u201cthe American Dream.\u201d He told his prospective buyers that nothing made him happier than to see a poor person with bad credit problems become a homeowner, and promised to \u201cwalk the buyer through\u201d the process of purchasing a house. The buyers all believed that Beeman was representing them in the home-buying process. Beeman seemed likeable, and all the buyers were impressed by him. As one buyer testified, Beeman was \u201csmooth.\u201d They thought he was a nice man and a professional, and trusted him to look out for their interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Either on the same day as his first meeting with the buyer or soon thereafter, Beeman would drive the buyer to see various properties, like a real estate agent would do. Some of the buyers seemed to understand that AHOYO owned the properties that Beeman was showing; some did not know who owned the properties. Most of the buyers did not seem to know that Beeman himself was the seller, <em>ie., </em>owned the selling company; some did know that Beeman, or at least his company, was the seller. Two of the buyers thought that Beeman was the lender in the transaction. Many had no understanding at all of Beeman\u2019s role. All of the buyers thought that Beeman was working for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">When the buyer he was meeting with expressed an interest in a particular property, Beeman would offer to help obtain purchase mortgage financing, through Irwin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Then, either that day or soon thereafter, Beeman would drive the buyer to Irwin\u2019s office in Columbia, Maryland. There, Beeman and the buyer would meet with Joyce Wood. Wood worked on commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>sion and so was compensated only for work performed on loans that in fact were extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Beeman and Wood knew each other before any of the transactions in this case took place. In early 1997, Beeman contacted Wood, saying that he was a real estate investor involved in buying, renovating, and selling properties in Baltimore City, and that he was looking for financing sources for his buyers. Wood agreed to meet Beeman at Pargos Restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">At their meeting, Wood educated Beeman about the different types of loans available to first time homebuyers with little in the way of income or assets. In particular, Wood introduced Beeman to Federal Housing Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d) backed lending, about which he knew nothing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The FHA is an agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), and the loans it backs are governed by strict HUD regulations designed to promote home-ownership and prevent fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">As a loan officer, Wood was familiar with the HUD regulations governing FHA loans. She told Beeman that a qualified buyer could obtain an FHA loan for 100% of the purchase price of the property and that the seller could contribute up to 6% to the purchase price. In addition, Wood explained that the buyer could use gift money from a relative to pay for closing costs. Wood also told Beeman that such a gift would have to be verified by the lender, <em>i.e., </em>Irwin, by means of a gift letter signed by the donor and the buyer and evidence that the gift money had been drawn from the donor\u2019s account. Wood further explained that, for an FHA loan to be approved, any judgments and collections against the buyer had to be cleared by payment. Finally, Wood told Beeman that, for any given transaction, she could use Irwin\u2019s computer software to generate a \u201cGood Faith Estimate\u201d of the maximum loan amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>available, based on the buyer\u2019s income, and to calculate the closing costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Wood knew that, among other things, HUD regulations prohibit a seller or other interested party to a transaction from playing any role in the buyer\u2019s obtaining a gift and gift letter for the closing costs, verifying a gift letter, furnishing funds for closing, and clearing credit problems for the buyer. She also knew that, if and when an FHA loan goes into default, and the lender ultimately forecloses, federal law requires the lender to convey the property to the FHA, and the FHA then reimburses the lender for most of its losses. The FHA thus provides insurance to lenders, and so promotes home-ownership for the poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Wood and Beeman stayed in contact after their initial meeting. Wood furnished Beeman with copies of the blank gift letter form that Irwin was using for FHA loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In the case of each buyer, at the meeting at Wood\u2019s office, the buyer gave Wood information about his or her income, assets, and credit, and signed a preliminary application for an FHA mortgage, which was filled in by Wood. Also in each case, the preliminary application stated that closing costs for settlement were to be financed by a \u201cgift.\u201d Precisely what was said and done at the initial meetings between the buyers, Wood, and Beeman was critical to Irwin and Wood\u2019s liability <em>vel non </em>and was hotly contested at trial. Because several of the questions presented on appeal concern the sufficiency of the evidence on the buyers\u2019 claims, and we review those issues by considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the buyers, <em>see John Crane, Inc. v. Scribner, </em>369 Md. 369, 378, 800 A.2d 727 (2002), we shall set forth in some detail, and in chronological order by settlement date, each buyer\u2019s testimony about what happened at the initial meeting with Wood, together with other surrounding facts for context.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">1) <em>Jerry McFadden: </em>Beeman came to McFadden\u2019s house, asked about his credit, ran a credit report on him, and had him sign several documents. He came back the next day and drove McFadden to see four properties. McFadden liked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>one on North Kresson Street. Beeman told him the house would probably cost about $50,000, but he was not sure. Beeman also told him not to worry about financing, that he would take care of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">A few days later, Beeman drove McFadden to Wood\u2019s office. McFadden thought Wood worked for Beeman, as his secretary or assistant. At the meeting, Wood showed McFadden a contract of sale, with his signature, that gave the contract price as $52,000. Wood told him that was the purchase price for the house. McFadden did not know that Beeman owned the property. When the subject of closing costs came up, Wood told Beeman that McFadden would need a gift letter to get the house. Before the meeting, Beeman had mentioned something about a gift letter. At the end of the meeting, McFadden was asked to sit outside while Wood and Beeman talked.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">2) <em>Carl </em>Haley.,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Beeman drove Haley by the house on 41st Street and later took him inside. Haley did not know that Beeman owned the house. Beeman took him to the initial meeting with Wood. Haley thought that \u201cthey\u201d were lending him money to buy the house. At the meeting, Wood and Beeman told him that the price for the house was $57,000. Before then, based on his conversations with Beeman, he thought the price was $35,000 or $40,000. Wood asked Haley about his employment, income, and credit. Before the meeting, Beeman had asked Haley if he had a relative with a bank account. Haley said yes, that his niece did. At the meeting, the subject of a gift letter came up, and Beeman told Wood that Haley\u2019s niece was going to give him money.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">3) <em>Gertrude Green: </em>Beeman drove Green to the house on North Belnord Street, and she said she liked it. They got back in Beeman\u2019s vehicle and discussed how much she could afford to pay monthly for a mortgage. Green gave Beeman a figure that coincided with her weekly paycheck. Beeman called Wood from his cell phone. Up until then, Green and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Beeman had not discussed the sales price for the house. After the phone call, Beeman said the price was $38,000. Green did not negotiate with Beeman about the price. She did not know that she needed a loan to buy a house; she thought she could pay for the house monthly, like paying rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">A few days later, Beeman presented Green with some papers, which she signed. Thereafter, Beeman took Green to Wood\u2019s office. Wood asked Green questions about her income and bank statements. Wood then presented Green with a Good Faith Estimate document that showed the sales price of the house to be $44,000. That is when Green learned the actual sales price for the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">During the meeting with Wood, the subject of a down payment or money for closing costs came up, and Wood asked about a gift letter. Beeman interrupted, telling Wood, \u201call of that was taken care of.\u201d Green did not say anything at all about a gift or a gift letter. Nevertheless, the preliminary loan application filled out that day, in Wood\u2019s handwriting, states, \u201cGift from son to pay for closing and BGE collections.\u201d Green never told Wood that. Green thought that Beeman was the person lending her the money to buy the house. For part of the meeting, Green was asked to leave, and Beeman and Wood met privately.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">4) <em>Denise Brower and Forrest Spencer: </em>Beeman took Brower and Spencer to see three properties, including 5601 Force Road. Before then, Beeman told them that his company, AHOYO, provided people with homes and that he would \u201cwalk [them] through every facet of buying a house and that he would take care of just about everything.\u201d Brower signed a contract of sale the day that Beeman showed them the Force Road property. Spencer, who has a learning disability and an 8th grade education, did not remember any discussion of price then. Spencer remembers that later, Beeman said that the house would cost $65,900, and that that was a good price because others in the neighborhood were selling for $75,000 to $80,000. Brower does not remember agreeing to pay $65,900 for the house, but that is what the contract of sale reflects. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Spencer did not know that Beeman or his company owned the house on Force Road, and was not sure what Beeman\u2019s exact role was.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Beeman told Brower and Spencer that he knew a loan officer who could help them get money to buy the house. He then drove them to Wood\u2019s office. During the meeting, Wood and Beeman left the room several times; at one point, Bee-man had Brower and Spencer leave the room. Later, when they all were present in the room, Wood asked Brower and Spencer how they intended to pay for closing costs. They were \u201ca little dumbfounded\u201d and turned to Beeman. Wood and Beeman then said in unison, \u201ca gift letter.\u201d When Wood brought up the subject of a gift letter at the meeting, Brower thought that a gift letter was a \u201cstandard practice\u201d when buying a house. Wood presented Brower and Spencer with a Good Faith Estimate document that showed what their monthly mortgage payment would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">5) <em>Francine Henderson: </em>Beeman took Henderson to see the house on Oldham Street, which she told him she liked. He told her the price for the house was $58,000. Beeman then drove Henderson to Wood\u2019s office. Wood asked about her debts, credit, and income. Henderson signed a preliminary loan application, but did not fill it out. Before the meeting, Beeman asked Henderson whether there was someone in her family \u201cthat had a bank account to give [her] a gift letter.\u201d That was the first time she heard anything about a gift letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">During the meeting, Wood asked Beeman whether he had the gift letter. Beeman responded that \u201che would take care of it.\u201d Wood showed Henderson the Good Faith Estimate document reflecting what her monthly mortgage payments would be. Wood did some calculations and said the sales price for the house was \u201csixty-two thousand.\u201d Wood then looked at Beeman, and he said, \u201cno, sixty-five.\u201d This is when Henderson learned the actual sales price for the house. She did not question Wood or Beeman about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">6) <em>Eva Elder: </em>On three occasions, Beeman came to Elder\u2019s house and took her to see several properties. She saw a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>house that she liked on the last trip, on Piedmont Street. She asked Beeman the sales price, and he said he did not know, that he would have to look in a book he had in his car to find out. He drove her back to her house without telling her the sales price. Later, when he drove Elder to Wood\u2019s office, he showed her a contract of sale that listed the purchase price of the property as $51,000. At the meeting, Wood did not talk to Elder about money for closing costs. Wood directed herself to Beeman and said, \u201cthis too would be a gift.\u201d Elder did not know what that meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">7) <em>Toyome Stamper: </em>Beeman took Stamper to see the house on Lenhart Street. She told him she wanted to buy it and then signed a contract of sale he furnished. The sales price on the contract was left blank. Stamper told Beeman she would need a loan to buy the house. When Beeman said he had a loan officer he dealt with, Stamper left it to him to arrange the loan. Stamper did not know that Beeman (or AHOYO) was the owner of the Lenhart Street house.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">That same day, Beeman drove Stamper to Wood\u2019s office. Stamper waited in the reception area while Beeman and Wood met. She was then signaled to come into the conference room. Wood introduced herself and asked Stamper questions about her income. Beeman asked questions about her credit. When Wood presented Stamper with the Good Faith Estimate document, Stamper learned that the sale price for the house was $86,500. Until then, she did not know what the sale price was. Her primary concern was that the monthly mortgage payment would be affordable, and the Good Faith Estimate showed what that payment would be. There was no discussion whatsoever at that meeting about a gift or about closing costs. Yet, Stamper\u2019s loan application, filled out by Wood, reflected that closing costs would be paid by a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">8) <em>Inez Coward: </em>Beeman showed Coward the house on Carroll Street and told her he would sell it to her for $40,000. He presented her with a sales contract and she signed it, but no price was written on it. Beeman then said he would take Coward to a \u201cfinance company.\u201d He drove her to Wood\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>office. Wood asked her questions about her income and credit. Coward signed a preliminary loan application, but did not fill it in. Wood asked whether Coward had a bank account; she said yes. Wood then asked whether she had any money. When she said no, Wood said, \u201cthere we go a gift again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">On three occasions during the meeting, Wood and Beeman left the room and then returned with documents. They were discussing Coward\u2019s monthly mortgage payment. Wood said the monthly payment was lower than it might have been, left the room, and then came back and asked Coward whether she thought she could pay more. Each time this happened, \u201cthe price went up.\u201d The monthly mortgage payment went from $426 to about $450.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Wood presented Coward with a Good Faith Estimate document and gave her a copy of it. She took it with her. Later, she read it and noticed that the price for the house was $58,000, which was a \u201cjump\u201d from the $40,000 Beeman had said it was. Coward called Beeman about the \u201cjump.\u201d He told her the price for the house had gone up because she had no money and so she had to pay extra \u201cfees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In every case, sometime after the meeting with Wood, Beeman asked the buyer to designate a person who had a bank account who could be the \u201cdonor\u201d of a gift that would be used for closing costs. Once the buyer had designated a \u201cdonor,\u201d Beeman filled out one of the form \u201cgift letters\u201d furnished by Wood, giving the names of the buyer and the \u201cdonor,\u201d their relationship, and the amount of the gift. Bee-man then presented the \u201cgift letter\u201d to the buyer and the \u201cdonor\u201d to sign. Once that was done, Beeman arranged to meet the \u201cdonor,\u201d sometimes alone and sometimes with the buyer present, at the \u201cdonor\u2019s\u201d bank or credit union. Beeman arrived with cash, often stuffed in suitcases, in an amount equal to the \u201cgift.\u201d He gave the cash to the \u201cdonor\u201d to deposit in the \u201cdonor\u2019s\u201d account. With Beeman standing watch, the \u201cdonor\u201d then obtained a certified check for that amount, payable to the buyer, and handed it over to Beeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>If a buyer questioned Beeman about the gift transaction, Beeman explained that this method of operation was necessary to provide the closing costs for the sale and that it was the usual way things were done. The buyers all understood that their \u201cdonors\u201d were not really making gifts; rather, the money was coming from Beeman. From what Beeman told them, however, the buyers thought the \u201cgift letter\u201d process was a standard part of the process for buying a house. Some of the buyers testified that Wood\u2019s raising the \u201cgift\u201d transaction in the initial meeting led them to think it was a legitimate practice, if Beeman had not already raised it with them, or confirmed their thinking that it was a legitimate practice, if Beeman already had brought it up. All of the buyers testified that they did not know that the \u201cgift\u201d process used in their transaction was illegal and, had they known, they would not have participated in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In several cases, Beeman assisted buyers in correcting their credit problems so they could be approved for the FHA loans. Wood forwarded confidential credit reports of the buyers to Beeman so he could clear up credit problems that would have prevented approval of their loans. Wood did that even though Beeman, under FHA regulations, should not have been provided the reports.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">To obtain an FHA loan to purchase property, the next step was to have the property appraised pursuant to FHA guidelines, which require that an FHA-approved appraiser inspect it, and that the appraised value reflect at least the purchase price on which the loan is being extended. For each of the eight transactions in this case, Irwin and Wood selected Hoffman to perform the property appraisal. For many years, Hoffman had been employed by Irwin as an appraiser. Not long before the transactions at issue, his status was changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>from employee to independent contractor. He still received 99% of his income from Irwin, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In the transactions in this case, Hoffman was paid $300 per appraisal. In each appraisal except one, he valued the property for precisely the price on the sales contract. In the one exception, he valued the property $500 above the contract price. We shall discuss particular facts pertinent to the appraisals and to Hoffman in our discussion of the issues. In 1998, Hoffman destroyed all the files for the eight transactions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In each case, the buyer testified that the property was in poor condition when Beeman showed it to him or her, but that Beeman promised that his workers would make repairs and that the property would be in good condition by settlement time. Thus, the buyers expected that their properties would be attractive and habitable. In most cases, the buyer brought up the topic of an inspection. Beeman responded either by saying that, because the buyer had no money, Beeman would pay for an inspection, or by saying that an inspection was not necessary because the FHA was going to have the house inspected before it extended the loan. Also in most of the cases, on the day of settlement, there was a brief \u201cwalk through\u201d that the buyer attended with Beeman. Usually, there were workers present in the house, making repairs of a cosmetic nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Beeman drove each buyer to the closing, which was held at a lawyer\u2019s office. No one from Irwin attended the settlement. Beeman brought with him the cashier\u2019s check representing the buyer\u2019s \u201cgift money,\u201d which was used to pay the closing costs necessary to effectuate the transaction. As the sellers, the Beemans and AHOYO received a check for the amount of the profit on the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">All of the buyers testified that soon after moving into their properties, they experienced serious problems. The problems ranged from complete lack of heat, to ceilings caving in, to faulty plumbing, to non-functional appliances, to rodent and insect infestation. When they attempted to contact Beeman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>he either did not respond, or sent workers to make slight repairs, and then would not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">One buyer never moved into her property because it was uninhabitable; the property ultimately was foreclosed on. Five other buyers moved into their properties but then lost them to foreclosure. Three of the buyers kept their properties despite their poor conditions, and still were occupying them at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We -will recite additional facts as necessary to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Appeal Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AGU\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\n<em>Denial of Motion for Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The buyers filed suit against all of the defendants in August 1998. Their amended complaint, the operative pleading in the case, was filed on March 22,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">On August 13, 2001, four months after his motion for summary judgment on liability was denied and two days before a scheduled pre-trial conference, at which a trial date was to be selected, Hoffman filed a Rule 2-505(a) motion to remove the case on the ground that he could not receive a fair trial in Baltimore City or any contiguous county.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">In a supporting affidavit, Hoffman alleged that, beginning on February 4, 1998, and until shortly before the motion was filed, the <em>Baltimore Sun </em>published no fewer than 39 articles or editorials on the practice of property \u201cflipping\u201d in Baltimore City. According to Hoffman, most of the articles commented on the role of appraisers in the practice of \u201cflipping,\u201d portraying them as dishonest and their appraisals as overblown and misleading, while depicting the purchasers and lenders involved in the transactions as innocent victims. Hoffman attached to his affidavit 25 of the <em>Baltimore Sun </em>articles or editorials that he claimed were prejudicial to him. The two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>earliest were published on February 4 and 12, 1998; thirteen were published between August 1, 1999, and December 16, 1999; five were published in 2000; and four were published in 2001, with the most recent article dated July 28, 2001. Hoffman listed the other 16 articles, all of which were published in 2000 and 2001, by title and date.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Hoffman also attached a videotape of a two-night investigative feature story about \u201cflipping\u201d that aired on Channel 18. It included a segment in which the lawyer for the buyers in this case characterized the real estate appraisals performed in \u201cflipping\u201d situations as \u201coutright fraudfs].\u201d Hoffman further attested that, in 1999, \u201cflipping\u201d was the subject of coverage on a local radio show and another local television news report.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Based on all of this, Hoffman complained that the extensive media coverage made it impossible for him to receive a fair trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">Real estate appraisers in flipping cases have already been tried and convicted in the press. One <em>Baltimore Sun </em>editorial calls for the criminal prosecution of these appraisers. One appraiser has been convicted and is now in prison.... The media coverage I have described is wide spread and has saturated the entire Baltimore metropolitan area. The entire potential pool of jurors has been exposed to this highly prejudicial and judgmental coverage. As a result, I cannot receive a fair and impartial trial in Baltimore City, nor in the counties contiguous to Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Hoffman did not request a hearing on his motion. Two days after the motion was filed, and before any response was submitted, the circuit court denied the motion in a one paragraph order stating that the court found no reasonable ground to believe Hoffman\u2019s allegation that he could not receive a fair and impartial trial in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">On appeal, Hoffman contends the court erred in denying his motion for removal. He argues that the newspaper articles and editorials about \u201cflipping\u201d and the television coverage of the subject, particularly the two-night investigative report on Channel 13, established reasonable ground to believe his alie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>gation that he could not receive a fair and impartial trial in Baltimore City or the contiguous counties; and that the court erred in finding otherwise. He further argues that under Rule 2-505, because his motion was accompanied by an affidavit alleging that he could not receive a fair and impartial trial in the county in which the action was pending, and because the court properly should have found reasonable ground to believe the allegation, removal was required.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, Hoffman argues that the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages against the Beemans and AHOYO in twice the amount the buyers\u2019 lawyer requested in closing argument, in addition to what Hoffman characterizes as an excessive award for non-economic damages against all the defendants, reveals an outraged jury that must have been infected by bias before the trial even started.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The right of removal is guaranteed to the citizens of Maryland by Article IV of the state constitution. The pertinent provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">In all ... cases of presentment or indictment [other than capital cases],[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] and in all suits or actions at law ... pending in any of the courts of law in this State which have jurisdiction over the cause or case, in addition to the suggestion in writing of either of the parties to the cause or case that the party cannot have a fair and impartial trial in the court in which the cause or case may be pending, it shall be necessary for the party making the suggestion to make it satisfactorily appear to the court that the suggestion is true, or that there is reasonable ground for the same; and thereupon the court shall order and direct the record of the proceedings in the cause or case to be transmitted to some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>other court, having jurisdiction in the cause or case, for trial....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Md. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 8(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The purpose and intent of the removal provisions of the Maryland Constitution, including the provision quoted above, is \u201c \u2018to get rid of the influence of local prejudice in the community from which the jury to try the case w[ill] come, and thus, as far as practicable, to secure a fair and impartial trial by jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Redman v. State, </em>363 Md. 298, 323, 768 A.2d 656 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 860, 122 S.Ct. 140, 151 L.Ed.2d 92 (2001), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>535 U.S. 966, 122 S.Ct. 1387, 152 L.Ed.2d 376 (2002) (quoting <em>Greenberg v. Dunn, </em>245 Md. 651, 654-55, 227 A.2d 242 (1967)). Because the right of removal is fundamental, the constitutional provision and implementing rules, criminal and civil, must be liberally construed in favor of the right. <em>Greenberg, supra, </em>245 Md. at 657, 227 A.2d 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Rule 2-505 implements the right of removal in civil actions at law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">(a) Grounds. (1) Prejudice. In any action that is subject to removal ... any party may lile a motion for removal accompanied by an affidavit alleging that the party cannot receive a fair and impartial trial in the county in which the action is pending. If the court finds that there is a reasonable ground to believe that the allegation is correct, it shall order that the action be removed for trial to a court of another county.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\u201cThe right of removal ... entitles a party to have a case removed to a court in another jurisdiction if the party can demonstrate that a fair and impartial trial is impossible in the court where the action was initially brought.\u201d <em>Smith v. Pearre, </em>96 Md.App. 376, 383, 625 A.2d 349 (1993) (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>Ezersky, supra, </em>40 Md.App. at 715, 394 A.2d 1225); <em>see also Pantazes v. State, </em>376 Md. 661, 675, 831 A.2d 432 (2003). \u201cIf the condition for removal is satisfied, there is no discretion to deny the request.\u201d <em>Lennox v. Mull, </em>89 Md.App. 555, 560, 598 A.2d 847 (1991). Thus, once a showing has been made of reasonable ground to believe the party cannot receive a fair and impartial trial, the court lacks discretion over <em>whether </em>to remove the case; the court does have discretion, however, over <em>where </em>to remove the case. <em>Smith, supra, </em>96 Md.App. at 385 n. 4, 625 A.2d 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"> The threshold question for the circuit court on a motion for removal \u2014 whether there is reasonable ground to believe the allegation that the moving party cannot receive a fair and impartial trial in the county in which the action is pending \u2014 is a mixed question of law and fact concerning a constitutional right. Accordingly, on appeal, we review that threshold determination <em>de novo. See Glover v. State, </em>368 Md. 211, 220-21, 792 A.2d 1160 (2002) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>the judgment of the trial court on a motion to dismiss for violation of the right to a speedy trial); <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 310, 765 A.2d 97 (2001) (holding that whether the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary was a mixed question of law and fact subject to <em>de novo </em>review); <em>Cartnail v. State, </em>359 Md. 272, 282, 753 A.2d 519 (2000) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>the mixed question of law and fact of whether statements made by a suspect following a traffic stop should be suppressed because they were obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 172, 183, 788 A.2d 678 (2002) (holding that the question of whether the police had reasonable suspicion and probable cause to make a warrantless search should be reviewed <em>de </em>novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The implementing rule for removal in non-capital criminal cases, Rule 4-254(b)(2), is substantively identical to Rule 2-505. This Court has held, in the context of Rule 4-252(b)(2), that the party seeking removal bears the burden to show that he has been prejudiced by adverse publicity and that the <em>voir dire </em>examination available to him will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>adequate to assure him a fair and impartial trial by jury. <em>Simms v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 515, 518, 433 A.2d 1199 (1981); <em>Waine v. State, </em>37 Md.App. 222, 227, 377 A.2d 509 (1977); <em>Mason v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 655, 678, 280 A.2d 753, <em>cert. denied, </em>263 Md. 717 (1971). Our interpretation of Rule 2-505 is likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Returning to this case, to be sure, the documents submitted by Hoffman in support of his motion for removal showed that, in the months and years before the trial, there was widespread media coverage of the fraudulent practice of property \u201cflipping,\u201d including coverage of the fraudulent acts perpetrated by appraisers who participated in \u201cflipping\u201d schemes. Yet, none of the articles or other media reports about \u201cflipping\u201d that Hoffman furnished the court in support of his motion drew a connection between the facts being reported and him, or this case. Indeed, the articles and other media reports did not concern the allegations in this case and did not mention Hoffman\u2019s name. They addressed \u201cflipping\u201d only in general terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Hoffman\u2019s assertion below, repeated in this Court, was to the effect that the general adverse media attention about appraisers committing fraud in \u201cflipping\u201d schemes in Baltimore City was so pervasive in the time period leading up to trial that <em>no </em>appraiser could receive a fair and impartial trial in that jurisdiction; and so, as an appraiser, he could not receive a fair and impartial trial in Baltimore City, and was entitled to have the case removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">This assertion, and the proof offered by Hoffman to support it, clearly falls short of the standard requiring removal under Rule 2-505. The standard is a particularized one: the party seeking removal must allege, by affidavit, facts showing personal prejudice, <em>i.e., </em>that \u201cthat party\u201d cannot receive a fair and impartial trial. General, non-identifying media coverage about a type of wrongdoing that is not connected to the party seeking removal, except that it concerns the same type of wrongdoing he is accused of, is not, in and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>itself, reasonable ground to believe that that party, in particular, cannot receive a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The right of removal rule derives from and protects the right to a fair and impartial jury for a party who by pervasive adverse media attention about the allegations against him has been tried and convicted in the press, so that the panels of potential jurors from the jurisdiction are likely to have prejudged the facts in his case. <em>See Stouffer v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 590, 631-32, 703 A.2d 861 (1997), <em>affd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>352 Md. 97, 721 A.2d 207 (1998) (affirming the denial of a suggestion of removal when the defendant failed to produce evidence that any juror was prejudiced by information he or she had gathered from the news coverage of the case); <em>Smith, supra, </em>96 Md.App. at 387, 625 A.2d 349 (commenting that \u201c[t]he media coverage of the case did not, apparently, intrude on the life of every Frederick County citizen so as to preclude the possibility of selecting an impartial jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The danger the removal right seeks to avert \u2014 individual jurors being so tainted by the media coverage of the particular case that they already have decided the party\u2019s legal fate based on the media-generated facts, and therefore will not decide it based on the facts put in evidence \u2014 is not implicated by general media coverage about a type of wrongdoing. Such coverage at most conveys the general notion that people who in fact commit certain wrongs are bad people; it does not prejudge the particular factual allegations against a party in a given case, or even suggest that a person merely accused of wrongdoing must be found liable or guilty. If that were the case, all murder defendants in Baltimore City would be entitled to have their cases removed on the ground that there is pervasive adverse media publicity in that jurisdiction about murderers; and therefore there is reason to believe that, as accused murderers, they cannot receive fair and impartial trials. That plainly is not a sufficient basis for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Even in cases in which there has been media coverage of a particular crime, the fact of such coverage, standing alone, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>is not sufficient to demonstrate a reason to believe the defendant on trial for the crime will not receive a fair and impartial trial. The defendant in such a circumstance must show not only that there has been publicity about his case but also that there is reason to believe the publicity about him will prejudice his rights. <em>Waine, supra, </em>37 Md.App. at 227, 377 A.2d 509; <em>Cleveland v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 712, 716-17, 280 A.2d 520 (1971). Here, Hoffman did not even show that the publicity in question was about him, let alone that it was prejudicial to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The <em>voir dire </em>process, not removal, serves the function of eliminating from the venire pool potential jurors who carry with them general prejudices, including prejudices that are a product of media coverage about crime and about civil wrongdoing in general. <em>See Smith, supra, </em>96 Md.App. at 386, 625 A.2d 349 (\u201cBecause the purpose of removal is to eradicate local prejudice from the jury, <em>voir dire </em>may be used to weed out prospective jurors who are subject to such prejudice.\u201d). Hoffman offered nothing in support of his motion for removal to show that the <em>voir dire </em>process could not be used to address the general prejudices he thought might affect potential jurors, and he offers no argument on appeal that the <em>voir dire </em>process was not effective in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Finally, there is no merit in Hoffman\u2019s after-the-fact argument that the amounts of the punitive damages award against Beeman and AHOYO and the non-economic damages award against him and Irwin and Wood reveal such prejudice against him that it is clear that the circuit court erred by not removing the case from Baltimore City. Such circular reasoning was rejected by the Court of Appeals in <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Garrett, </em>343 Md. 500, 525, 682 A.2d 1143 (1996), in which the Court concluded that verdicts against the defendants in the case were not proof that defendants were prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We find no fault with the circuit court\u2019s determination that Hoffman did not demonstrate reason to believe that he could not receive a fair and impartial trial in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\n<em>Denials of Motions for Judgment and for JNOV on Liability Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">At the close of the buyers\u2019 case-in-chief, the appellants and the other defendants all moved for judgment on various grounds as to the claims in the amended complaint and punitive damages. The trial court denied the motions, except that it deferred its decision on punitive damages until the close of all the evidence. At the close of all the evidence, the motions were renewed. After hearing lengthy argument, the court denied the motions for judgment as to the three claims but granted Irwin, Wood, and Hoffman\u2019s motions respecting punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">After the jury returned a verdict in favor of the buyers, and after a separate punitive damages proceeding against the Beemans and AHOYO, the appellants and the other defendants all filed motions for JNOV. The buyers filed oppositions, and the court held a hearing. On May 13, 2002, the court issued a 39-page memorandum opinion denying the JNOV motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">In a civil jury trial, if there is any evidence adduced, however slight, from which reasonable jurors could find in favor of the plaintiff on the claims presented, the trial court should deny the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment at the close of the evidence and submit the claims to the jury for decision. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-519. It is a question of law whether the plaintiff has introduced evidence sufficient to make his claim a jury issue. <em>Fister v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>366 Md. 201, 209-10, 783 A.2d 194 (2001); <em>Glover v. State, supra, </em>143 Md.App. at 321, 794 A.2d 735. In deciding this question, the trial court should view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Md. Rule 2-519(b); <em>see also Todd v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>373 Md. 149, 155, 816 A.2d 930 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"A1v\">When a party\u2019s motion for judgment is denied at the close of all the evidence, he may move for JNOV on the same grounds advanced in support of the earlier motion. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>532. The trial court must decide the JNOV motion using the same analysis as if it were a motion for judgment made at the close of all the evidence. <em>See Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 353-54, 749 A.2d 174 (2000); <em>Weathersby v. Kentucky Fried Chicken Nat\u2019l Mgmt. Co., </em>86 Md.App. 533, 552, 587 A.2d 569 (1991), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>326 Md. 663, 607 A.2d 8 (1992). Thus, for purposes of appellate review, the issues of whether the trial court erred in denying motions for judgment and motions for JNOV are identical. <em>See Giant Food, Inc. v. Booker, </em>152 Md.App. 166, 176, 831 A.2d 481 (2003); <em>Suburban Hosp., Inc. v. Kirson, </em>128 Md.App. 533, 542, 739 A.2d 875 (1999). Because they are questions of law, we review them <em>de novo. Muthukumarana v.

The buyers respond that the jury instruction had no such effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Irwin and Wood\u2019s second argument is tied into their first. Operating on the premise that the jurors were in effect instructed that they could infer, from a finding that Wood had actual knowledge, based on \u201cwillful blindness,\u201d of Beeman\u2019s fraudulent acts, that Wood and Beeman had entered into an agreement to defraud the buyers, they argue that there was no evidence other than such an inference to support a finding of a conspiracy, and therefore the evidence could not sustain a finding that they were part of a conspiracy, as a matter of law. They maintain that the evidence about Wood\u2019s conduct merely showed that she engaged in the ordinary business tasks of a loan officer. The buyers respond that there was evidence of conduct by Wood to support the jury\u2019s finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that she entered into a conspiratorial agreement with Beeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The Court of Appeals has recognized that willful refusal to know a fact, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cwillful blindness\u201d to a fact, is the equivalent of actual knowledge of that fact. <em>Ellerin v. Fairfax Savings, F.S.B., </em>337 Md. 216, 235 n. 10, 652 A.2d 1117 (1995); <em>OwensIllinois v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 462 n. 23, 601 A.2d 633 (1992). <em>See also State v. McCallum, </em>321 Md. 451, 458-61, 583 A.2d 250 (1991) (Chasanow, J., concurring) (observing that \u201cknowledge exists where a person believes that it is probable that something is a fact, but deliberately shuts his or her eyes or avoids making reasonable inquiry with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The trial court in this case instructed the jury about \u201cwillful blindness\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">Now, in determining whether someone had knowledge of something you may look at all the evidence in the case and use your own common sense in determining whether that person really knew what was going on. You may draw reasonable inferences from facts but you must take care to avoid guess work or speculation. You may consider the willful and knowing violation of a known duty as evidence of such knowledge. <em>You may also consider whether the person involved willfully refused or deliberately refused to look at the facts in the face of obvious facts because </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>such willful refusal to know in the face of obvious facts may be deemed knowledge. If you f\u00ednd that a person was willfully blind or made a conscience [sic] effort not to know something than [sic] you may determine under all the facts in the case that the person actually knew it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOt\">(Emphasis added.) The instruction was not objected to by any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Irwin and Wood\u2019s first argument about conspiracy to defraud is a thinly disguised effort to challenge on appeal the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d instruction, even though, not having been objected to, it is not properly subject to appellate review. Md. Rule 4-825(e); <em>Bowman v. State, </em>337 Md. 65, 67, 650 A.2d 954 (1994). In any event, the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d instruction, given as one of a series of preliminary instructions, simply informed the jurors of the legal concept of actual knowledge based on \u201cwillful blindness.\u201d It did not tell the jurors that a finding, based on \u201cwillful blindness,\u201d that Wood had actual knowledge of Beeman\u2019s fraudulent acts, could in and of itself support a further finding that Wood had entered into an agreement with Beeman to defraud the buyers. Indeed, the trial court gave the jurors a separate instruction about conspiracy to defraud, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">To prove there is a civil conspiracy to commit fraud it must be shown that there was, in fact, an agreement between two or more persons to accomplish fraud and that such fraud resulted in damage to the Plaintiffs.... The existence of a conspiracy may be shown by inference drawn from the nature of the acts complained of, the individual and collective interests of the alleged co-conspirators or conspirators, the situation and relationship of the parties, their motives and all the surrounding circumstances preceding and attending the culmination of a common design. <em>The Plaintiff </em>\u2014 each <em>Plaintiff must, however prove by clear and convincing evidence that there was an actual agreement between two or more Defendants as well as intentional conduct of some kind by each such Defendant as a result of the agreement. </em>An agreement plus an act in furtherance of it.... The evidence must show from the Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>own acts or statement that he or she was a willing participant. Once it\u2019s determined from the evidence that a conspiracy existed and that the Defendant that you\u2019re considering was one of the members then all of the acts and statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy and any during the \u2014 and during the existence of the conspiracy can be considered by you as evidence against all others of co-conspirators even though the statements and acts may have occurred in the absence and without the knowledge of the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">(Emphasis added.) This instruction, which also was not objected to, properly explained the concept of a civil conspiracy, including that the buyers were required to show \u201can actual agreement [to defraud] between two or more Defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">For the same reasons, the premise to Irwin and Wood\u2019s second argument is faulty. In addition, we agree with the buyers that there was ample evidence of <em>conduct </em>by Wood from which jurors reasonably could infer that Wood and Beeman entered into a conspiratorial agreement to defraud the buyers into purchasing and financing the properties at inflated prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">To be sure, Wood testified that she merely was following an innocuous business routine in her every action in the relevant transactions: that by taking applications for FHA loans and processing them for potential buyers, she did nothing out of the ordinary and nothing that could not be explained by customary business practices. The jurors could have chosen to credit Wood\u2019s testimony, interpreting her actions innocently and disregarding the evidence that supported inferences that she was acting in step with Beeman. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 534, 823 A.2d 664 (2003); <em>Dawson v. State, </em>329 Md. 275, 281, 619 A.2d 111 (1993); <em>Brandon v. Molesworth, </em>104 Md.App. 167, 197, 655 A.2d 1292 (1995) (observing that jurors are entitled to weigh the evidence, make credibility assessments, and accept all, some, or none of any given witness\u2019s testimony). On a sufficiency review, however, we must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that could be drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>from the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, which, in this case, means most favorable to the buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Viewed in that light, the evidence showed that, at their initial lunch meeting, in early 1997, Wood taught Beeman the \u201cins and outs\u201d of FHA lending. Wood knew then that Bee-man was an investor whose business was buying and then selling residential properties; but that, in seeking out a lender such as herself, he was to some extent involving himself in the borrowing side of the transaction, which concerns the buyer. Wood also knew that, as the seller in a transaction, Beeman would be prohibited by FHA regulations from obtaining gifts or gift letters for buyer/borrowers. She nevertheless explained to him the process Irwin used for verifying gifts, and gave him blank gift letter forms. The jury reasonably could infer that, from the very outset of their relationship, Wood expected Beeman to have some sort of involvement in arranging gifts for buyers, if only to give them gift forms to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">According to the evidence, the eight transactions at issue took place not long after Beeman and Wood established their relationship, and all within a six-month period. In each case, Beeman referred the financing transaction to Wood at a point in time after he had created the false impression for each buyer \u2014 by words and conduct \u2014 that he was representing the buyer in the purchase transaction, and was looking out for the buyer\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">At the initial meetings with Wood, notwithstanding her knowledge that Beeman was the seller in the transactions, Wood treated Beeman as if he <em>were </em>representing the buyers, by directing questions to him that properly should have been posed to the buyers and by accepting his answers on their behalves. This conduct ran contrary to the knowledge Wood had, as an experienced mortgage lender, about the role of the seller and lender <em>vis-a-vis </em>the buyer in such transactions. Wood\u2019s actions during the initial meetings were such as to validate the impression that Beeman\u2019s role in the transactions was as the buyer\u2019s representative. Reasonable jurors could find that Wood\u2019s conduct was not merely coincidental to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Beeman\u2019s pre-meeting conduct; rather, that Wood knew, before each initial meeting, that Beeman had led the buyer to think he was representing him (or her) and that, during the meeting, she was actively participating in that charade.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In all the transactions, Wood either knew from the documents or from Beeman\u2019s remarks in the initial meeting that the sales prices for the properties had not been established, were not clear, or were being changed. She participated in generating Good Faith Estimate documents showing monthly loan payment amounts calculated based on income, not on loans based on sales prices. In some of the transactions, Wood watched as Beeman, in the guise of acting on the buyers\u2019 behalves, used the Good Faith Estimates to persuade them to agree to sales prices that were not based on value. She tacitly gave credence to that method of establishing a sales price. In other of the transactions, Wood actively involved herself in using the Good Faith Estimates to generate or increase a contract price, performing calculations and conversing with Beeman to arrive at a price. Reasonable jurors could infer from this evidence and the evidence that Wood was experienced in and knowledgeable about real estate sales and mortgage financing; that she knew Beeman was using the Good Faith Estimates to generate inflated sale prices; that she was participating in a pretense designed to lend legitimacy to that practice; and that she was allowing Irwin\u2019s computer system to be used as a tool for Beeman to perpetuate a false impression about his role in the transaction and about sales pricing for consumer realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The evidence showed that Wood was familiar with the FHA regulations that prohibited Beeman from having any involvement in arranging gifts for sellers to use for closing or other costs in the transactions and any involvement in clearing buyers\u2019 credit problems. The evidence also showed, however, that Wood routinely listed \u201cgift\u201d as the source of funds needed for closing, even when she did not have information from the buyers from which to know that. This evidence raised a reasonable inference that Beeman was communicating directly with Wood about gifts and gift letters in these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>In the initial meeting with Brower and Spencer, Wood and Beernan announced, in unison, that the problem of closing costs would be taken care of by \u201ca gift letter\u201d \u2014 without the buyers\u2019 participating in the discussion. Likewise, in the initial meeting with Inez Coward, Wood remarked, \u201cthere we go a gift again.\u201d These comments by Wood were fraught with meaning. They disclosed her understanding of what was taking place, as a matter of routine, in all the Beernan sales: that, regardless of the individual circumstances of the buyers, including their lack of financial resources, they were managing to come up with substantial gift money to enable them to consummate their purchases. From the evidence of that understanding and the evidence of Wood\u2019s conduct in educating Beernan about gifts and gift letters and furnishing him gift letter forms, reasonable jurors could infer that Wood knew all along that Beernan was arranging or in some manner facilitating the \u201cgifts\u201d necessary to make the transactions happen, in violation of federal law. Likewise, from the evidence that Wood furnished Beernan with information about the credit problems some of the buyers faced as obstacles to completing their transactions, reasonable jurors could find that Wood knew Beernan was playing a role in removing those obstacles, also in violation of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The jury had before it direct evidence of an established relationship between Wood and Beernan; of Beeman\u2019s deceptive conduct in roping the buyers into thinking he was advancing their interests when in fact he was positioning them to purchase dilapidated housing at inflated prices; that, in many of the initial meetings, Wood and Beernan spoke privately, and that, in all of the meetings, Wood treated the buyers as Beernan did; and that Wood and Hoffman, also an actor in all the transactions, had a long-standing relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Not unlike many conspiracy cases, there was no direct evidence in this case of an agreement between Wood and Beernan to defraud the buyers. Yet, there was compelling circumstantial evidence that Wood was acting in step with Beernan in creating the impression for the buyers that what was false was true; and in enabling him to violate federal laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>to consummate the transactions, not because her innocent business routines happened to suit Beeman\u2019s scheme, but because she was part of the scheme and was acting in aid of its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Reasonable jurors could find, by clear and convincing evidence, that Wood\u2019s behavior in the initial meetings with the buyers and in her interactions with Beeman only could be sensibly explained by her having reached an understanding with Beeman to use the meetings to deceive the buyers into agreeing to inflated sales prices and to misuse and violate the FHA mortgage financing process to accomplish closings in the buyers\u2019 transactions, when closings otherwise would not come to fruition (and profits therefore would not materialize). The evidence of Wood\u2019s conduct thus was sufficient to prove that Beeman and Wood (and hence Irwin) had entered into a conspiracy to defraud the buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\n<em>Hoffman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Hoffman contends the trial court should have granted his motion for judgment and JNOV on the issue of conspiracy because there was not \u201ca shred of evidence\u201d to show he had entered into an agreement with Beeman to defraud the buyers. He maintains that, at most, the evidence established that in two of his eight appraisals \u2014 those for the 1127 Carroll Street and 5601 Force Road properties \u2014 Beeman gave him information about recent home sales in the neighborhoods that he then used as comparable sales for valuing the properties; and, as all the appraiser experts who testified at trial opined, it is an accepted practice in the appraising industry to use comparable sales as the basis for an opinion about a property\u2019s value. Hoffman maintains that he simply performed his appraisals at Irwin\u2019s request, with his $300 per appraisal fee in no way depending on the outcome of the appraisal, and that his limited contacts with Beeman and well-defined role with Irwin could not support a finding that there was a \u201cmeeting of the minds in an unlawful arrangement.\u201d He adds that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>evidence that in 1998 he discarded his files in these eight transactions was insufficient, in and of itself, to show that he had entered into a conspiratorial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The buyers respond that there was evidence that Hoffman participated in Beeman\u2019s fraudulent scheme; and that the jurors reasonably could have inferred from that conduct that Hoffman had reached an understanding with Beeman to perpetrate the fraud. They maintain that the adverse inference that permissibly could be drawn from Hoffman\u2019s destruction of his records was in addition to the affirmative evidence showing that he had entered into a conspiratorial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Again, in reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence contention, we consider the evidence adduced in the light most favorable to the verdict. <em>See Todd, supra, </em>373 Md. at 155, 816 A.2d 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The evidence showed that for the Force Road property, Hoffman could not find any comparable sales in the immediate neighborhood to justify the $65,900 sales price. He resorted to using two comparable sales outside the immediate neighborhood and a comparable sale that he obtained from Beeman, of another Beeman property. The prior Beeman comparable was of a house that Beeman had purchased for $23,200 and then sold six weeks later for $75,000, in a transaction financed by a sub-prime lender. The transaction in that comparable sale had taken place within the prior year \u2014 but Hoffman\u2019s appraisal omitted that fact, representing, instead, that for that comparable sale there were \u201cno other recent sales (none within 1 year).\u201d For the Force Road property itself, even though Hoffman knew that Beeman had purchased the property for $24,000 only 20 days prior, Hoffman stated in his appraisal that there had been \u201cno other recent sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Likewise for the Carroll Street property, Hoffman could not find any comparable sales in the immediate neighborhood to support the sale price of $58,000. He resorted to using three comparable sales furnished by Beeman. Two were prior sales by Beeman himself, and one was a prior sale by a business associate of Beeman. The properties all had been bought by Beeman (or his associate) in the prior year and quickly resold at huge profits. Yet, Hoffman falsely represented with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>spect to those properties that there had been \u201cno other recent sales (none -within 1 year).\u201d For the Carroll Street property itself, Hoffman stated, \u201cLast Sale Unknown,\u201d even though the evidence showed he knew that Beeman had recently purchased the property for $7,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The evidence respecting these properties showed that when Hoffman could not justify contract sales prices by using comparable sales figures in the immediate neighborhoods, he went to Beeman and used information furnished by Beeman to justify the prices. Hoffman knew from the information at his disposal that, if the sales went through at the contract sales prices, they would result in huge profits to Beeman. Using information from Beeman, Hoffman fashioned the appraisal reports so as not to disclose that Beeman was the source of the data used to justify the contract sales prices and to conceal that the information in fact was tainted and unreliable. The evidence that Hoffman acted together with Beeman to craft misleading and inaccurate appraisals to justify inflated sales prices supported a reasonable inference that Hoffman was participating in a scheme with Beeman to trick the buyers into purchasing the properties at inflated prices. From the evidence that Hoffman was acting together with Beeman in carrying out the scheme to defraud, the jurors reasonably could conclude that Hoffman had entered into an agreement with Beeman and Wood to perpetrate the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Other evidence lent further support to that conclusion. Hoffman\u2019s appraisal of the Lenhart Street property stated that the house was built on a slab, despite the obvious presence of a crawl space. As it turned out, the crawl space was filled with standing water, a condition that, if disclosed, would have precluded FHA financing, and thus derailed settlement. In appraising the 41st Street property, which was a rowhouse, Hoffman used a comparable sale of a single family house in a neighborhood that was not nearby, and did not use comparable sales of rowhouses in the immediate neighborhood that would not have supported the contract sales price. For the Oldham Street property, Hoffman used a comparable sale of a house built 40 years after the subject property, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>was located on the other side of the tunnel thruway. Hoffman acknowledged in his own testimony that his estimations of the distances between the subject properties and comparable properties in this case were inaccurate about 60% of the time. The buyers\u2019 expert witness in the field of home appraisals testified at length about the misleading entries in Hoffman\u2019s appraisals and that the values Hoffman arrived at for five of the eight properties greatly exceeded even the highest possible value ranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Hoffman\u2019s interactions with Beeman in performing these appraisals, quite apart from his later destruction of the pertinent records, supported a reasonable finding that he was actively participating in Beeman\u2019s scheme to sell the properties in question at inflated prices. Hoffman\u2019s conduct showed a \u201cconcurrence of action [with Beeman] on a material point\u201d that was sufficient to allow the jurors to find \u201ca concurrence of sentiment\u201d and therefore a conspiratorial agreement. <em>Hill v.

First, they argue that there was no evidence to support a finding that Wood made a misrepresentation of fact, one of the elements of a fraud claim. The buyers respond that, to satisfy the misrepresentation element of the tort of fraud, it is enough to prove a statement made or conduct performed for the purpose of creating a false or misleading impression of a material fact, by concealing the truth; and that the evidence against Wood was sufficient on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Second, in a somewhat convoluted argument, Irwin and Wood renew their indirect attack on the trial court\u2019s \u201cwillful blindness\u201d instruction, arguing that the instruction gave the jury free reign to find the \u201cknowledge of falsity\u201d and <em>scienter </em>elements of the tort of fraud against Wood on legally insufficient evidence. The buyers respond that the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d jury instruction was not objected to and in any event the evidence at trial was sufficient to support a reasonable finding of knowledge of falsity and intent to deceive on Wood\u2019s, and therefore Irwin\u2019s, part.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Because, for the reasons we have discussed, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that Irwin and Wood conspired with Beeman to defraud the buyers, and because the evidence plainly established (and it is not disput<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>ed) that Beeman defrauded the buyers, Irwin and Wood properly were held liable for fraud.

RO Cruises, Inc., </em>262 F.Supp.2d 618, 628-29 (D.Md.2003)(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Here, as we have explained, there was evidence showing that Wood participated in creating a number of false impressions for the buyers, by words and conduct amounting to partial and fragmentary disclosures. First, in conducting each initial loan application meeting, Wood treated Beeman, whom she knew to be the seller in the transaction, as if he were the buyer\u2019s representative. She engaged Beeman in discussion that validated one of two false impressions: either that Bee-man was not the seller in the transaction, when he was, or that it was a permissible business practice for the seller to be taking on the role of buyer\u2019s representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Second, Wood actively participated in using the Irwin computer system to generate and then misuse Good Faith Estimates to set or increase the sales prices for the properties. The jury could have inferred from the circumstances surrounding many of the initial meetings that the buyers did not understand mortgage financing and that an arm\u2019s length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>negotiation of a sales price is rarely arrived at by working backward from a monthly payment \u2014 and Wood knew they did not understand that. Yet, she participated with Beeman in misusing the Good Faith Estimate forms to create and then perpetuate that misimpression, and either establish sales prices not yet negotiated or inflate already agreed to sales prices \u2014 all to Beeman\u2019s financial benefit. At the same time, Wood did not inform the buyers of Beeman\u2019s actual role in the transaction, of the impropriety of the role he was assuming, and that the Good Faith Estimate process was being misused to the buyers\u2019 detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Finally, Wood\u2019s statements and conduct during the initial meetings contributed to misleading the buyers into thinking it was proper for Beeman to be arranging gift letters, and hence gifts, to effectuate the transactions. On several occasions, Wood included a gift letter as part of the application, without any confirmation by the buyer. Other times, Wood raised the prospect of a gift letter, and directed the issue to Beeman, not the buyer. Yet other times, Wood and Beeman in unison announced, in front of the buyer, that a gift would be part of the transaction. Wood thus conducted herself before the buyers so as to make it seem acceptable for Beeman to be involved in making a gift happen in each case. She did this, all the time knowing that Beeman was prohibited by federal regulations from having anything to do with the buyers\u2019 obtaining gifts to effectuate closings. By her words and conduct, Wood gave the buyers enough information about the gift letter process to know it could be part of a prescribed plan of action for obtaining financing, but not enough information to know that it was improper for Beeman to be involved in the process. Wood thus made partial and fragmentary disclosures that created and perpetuated a false impression, and were misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">For these reasons, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding against Wood (and hence Irwin) on the misrepresentation element of the tort of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">In their second argument, Irwin and Wood complain that because (in their view) there was no false represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tation by Wood, the only \u201cknowledge of falsity\u201d the jury could have found on her part was her knowledge, based on the legal concept of \u201cwillful blindness,\u201d of false representations by Beeman. They argue that mere knowledge by Wood that Beeman was making false representations could not support a finding that she knew of the falsity of her own representations (of which, they assert, there were none) or that she acted with an intent to deceive the buyers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In the context of the fraud claim against Irwin and Wood, \u201cknowledge of falsity\u201d meant that Wood knew that the impression she was creating about Beeman\u2019s proper role in the transactions, both as the buyer\u2019s representative and as the facilitator of gifts, and about the method for setting sales prices, was false; that is, she was consciously aware that she was creating a false impression. Reasonable inferences from the evidence supported that finding. From the evidence about Wood\u2019s experience as a loan officer, the jurors could find that she knew that neither her role nor Beeman\u2019s role as the seller properly included using a Good Faith Estimate form to create or increase sales prices; but, that the impression she was creating by her conduct in the initial meetings with the buyers was exactly the contrary. Wood testified that she was familiar with the federal regulations making it illegal for Beeman to participate in arranging gift letters and gifts. The jurors could infer from Wood\u2019s conduct validating Beeman\u2019s involvement in the gift letter process that she knew she was drawing a picture about that process that was inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">With respect to the <em>scienter </em>element of fraud, from a finding that Wood knew she was creating a false impression for the buyers, the jurors reasonably could conclude that Wood did so with the intent to deceive them into accepting the impression as true, so they would act in conformity with it. <em>See Ellerin, supra, </em>337 Md. at 230, 652 A.2d 1117 (explaining that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>intent to defraud element of a fraud claim can be satisfied by proof of \u201c \u2018a falsehood knowingly told, with an intention that another should believe it to be true and act upon it\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>McAleer v. Horsey, 35 </em>Md. 439, 453 (1872))).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The jury may well have employed the legal concept of \u201cwillful blindness\u201d to find that Wood had actual knowledge of Beeman\u2019s fraudulent acts \u2014 specifically, that he was giving money to \u201cdonors\u201d to establish bogus \u201cgifts,\u201d without which the properties could not go to settlement. The evidence independently showed that Wood knew, from the buyers\u2019 financial situations, that gifts would be necessary to complete the settlements; that, without information from the buyers, she designated the transactions as involving gift letters; that she further knew that Beeman was insinuating himself into the gift letter process, in violation of federal regulations; and that she validated Beeman\u2019s conduct by acting in step with him at the initial meetings. These circumstances supported a logical inference that Wood knew Beeman was taking steps to arrange for \u201cgifts\u201d in these transactions. Jurors reasonably could conclude from the evidence that, if Wood did not in fact know that Beeman was enabling and creating false gifts, her supposed lack of knowledge was a result of turning a blind eye: hence, she had actual knowledge of those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Actual knowledge by Wood that Beeman was making misrepresentations to the buyers and was engaging them in a false gift process was a fact, in the total circumstances, that lent support to a finding that Wood knew the impressions <em>she </em>was creating in the initial meetings were false and that she was creating the false impressions with a mind for deception. Wood\u2019s knowledge of Beeman\u2019s wrongful conduct was not the sole basis in the evidence for a reasonable jury to find against Wood on the knowledge of falsity and <em>scienter </em>elements of fraud, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Hoffman</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Hoffman contends there was no evidence that any buyer in fact relied on his appraisal reports before going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>forward with the sale; therefore, the evidence was legally insufficient to prove the reliance element of the tort of fraud. He points out that the evidence showed the buyers did not read the appraisal reports. Hoffman further argues that even if the buyers did rely on his appraisal, they had no right to do so. While the FHA financing clauses in their contracts gave them the right to cancel if the appraised values did not meet the contract prices, the clauses also stated that the appraisals were being performed for the benefit of HUD, not the purchasers. Therefore, the buyers were required to independently satisfy themselves about the value and condition of the properties they were purchasing, apart from any appraisals by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The buyers respond that the evidence was sufficient to prove reasonable reliance by them on Hoffman\u2019s appraisals.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Again, Hoffman was subject to liability for the fraudulent scheme perpetrated by Beeman against the buyers because the evidence supported a finding that Hoffman conspired with Beeman to defraud the buyers. The evidence also supported a finding of fraud against Hoffman independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In advancing the first part of his argument, Hoffman relies on <em>Parlette v. Parlette, </em>88 Md.App. 628, 596 A.2d 665 (1991). There, the plaintiff sued her ex-husband for fraud, alleging that he had made false representations to her late son that induced him to name him (the ex-husband), rather than her, as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy. Affirming the circuit court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for judgment and declaratory judgment in the ex-husband\u2019s favor, we held that the plaintiff could not have relied on the alleged misrepresentations by her ex-husband because she \u201cwas not a party to any misrepresentations made by [the defendant] to [the son]\u201d and did not know about the representations until after the son died. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 596 A.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\"><em>Parlette </em>is inapposite. In that case, there was no evidence that the alleged misrepresentations were made to the plaintiff, directly or indirectly, or that she knew of them before the critical point at which her son\u2019s death triggered the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>benefits. Here, Hoffman\u2019s misrepresentations about the values of the properties were made before the critical times of the settlements and were communicated to the buyers, indirectly, by the mere availability of financing to complete the transactions. Had the properties not been appraised at or above their contract values, the sales would have fallen through. Thus, there was evidence on which the jurors reasonably could find actual reliance by the buyers on Hoffman\u2019s inflated and false appraisal values.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">As to the second aspect of Hoffman\u2019s reliance argument, whether the buyers acted reasonably in so relying was a jury question. The admonitions in the FHA financing language, read in isolation, could support a conclusion that the buyers did not act reasonably. Yet, the contracts all contained clauses allowing the buyers to cancel the sales if the properties did not appraise for the contract prices, based on the appraisals obtained by the lender. Necessarily, the buyers were entitled to rely on the appraisals in that regard. Considering the total evidence, then, the jurors rationally could conclude, by a clear and convincing standard, that the buyers acted reasonably in relying on their appraisals\u2019 statements of value in deciding not to exercise their cancellation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\n<em>Maryland Consumer Protection Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Maryland\u2019s Consumer Protection Act, Md.Code (2000 Repl Vol.), Com.

They suggest that the evidence merely proved that Beeman engaged in questionable practices in connection with the sales of the properties to the buyers, and that the buyers themselves admitted that they participated in Beeman\u2019s fraud by knowingly signing false gift letters. Revisiting their arguments as to why the fraud claim was unsupported by the evidence, Irwin and Wood assert that the evidence was insufficient to prove that they knowingly engaged in an unfair and deceptive trade practice with the intention of inducing reliance; that such trade practice was somehow material to a choice that the buyers made; that the buyers in fact relied reasonably; or that the buyers suffered actual losses as a result. In addition, noting that the statement or omission must be false or misleading to a <em>reasonable </em>consumer, they argue that the buyers could not have reasonably concluded that false gift letters were somehow permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The buyers respond that the evidence supported a reasonable finding that Irwin and Wood committed unfair and deceptive trade practices in assisting Beeman in deceiving them.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">As Irwin and Wood acknowledge, the buyers\u2019 MCPA claim depended on proof that they relied to their detriment on a material misrepresentation or omission by Wood. For the reasons we have given, we are satisfied that the jury reasonably could have concluded that Wood created a false impression suggesting that false gift letters based not on actual gifts but on a bogus gift arrangement made by the seller was a permissible practice, and that the buyers were justified in relying on that impression in deciding to go along with Bee-man\u2019s scheme. We also acknowledge Irwin and Wood\u2019s argument that the consumer must be deemed to have acted reasonably in relying on the misrepresentation or false impression, citing <em>Luskin\u2019s, supra, </em>353 Md. at 365, 726 A.2d 702, and that the consumer\u2019s sophistication does not necessarily affect the determination of what is reasonable. We think, however, that the jury could have concluded that a reasonable consumer, whether sophisticated or not, would have relied on the false impressions created by Wood. Thus, we affirm the jury\u2019s verdict on the MCPA claim against Irwin and Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\n<em>Hoffman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Relying on <em>Morris v. Osmose Wood Preserving, </em>340 Md. 519, 667 A.2d 624 (1995), Hoffman argues that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he violated the MCPA because, as an appraiser, he did not offer consumer services, sell consumer realty, or extend consumer credit, all of which fall within the statute\u2019s coverage. He argues that, because he was working for Irwin, and not the buyers, and because his appraisals were for the exclusive use of Irwin, his conduct was too remote from the sales or financing of the properties to implicate the MCPA. The buyers respond that the facts in this case, which showed that Hoffman\u2019s conduct was necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>to allow completion of the sales and financing of the consumer realty to them, distinguish it from <em>Moms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In <em>Morris, </em>the plaintiffs brought a class action suit against plywood manufacturers to recover the cost of replacing the roofs of their townhouses, which were made with allegedly defective fire retardant plywood. The suit stated five counts \u2014 strict liability, negligence, breach of implied warranties, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of the MCPA. The plaintiffs alleged that each defendant had advertised its product as suitable for constructing roofs. The circuit court dismissed all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">On appeal, as to the MCPA claims, the Court of Appeals reviewed whether the allegations were \u201csufficient to establish that the defendants engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices in connection with sales, offers for sale, or attempts to sell consumer goods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538, 667 A.2d 624. It concluded that they were not. Relying on principles of statutory construction, the Court reasoned that \u201cthe sale of consumer goods,\u201d for purposes of the MCPA, is limited to a sale in which the buyer intends to use the goods primarily for personal, family, household, or agricultural purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 540-41, 667 A.2d 624. Applying that rule to the facts of the case, the Court held that dismissal was appropriate because the allegedly deceptive practices by the manufacturers occurred entirely in the course of their marketing the plywood to the builders, who intended to use it for commercial, rather than consumer, purposes. There was no allegation that the manufacturers were in any way involved in selling, offering to sell, or advertising the townhouses purchased by the plaintiffs. Therefore, the \u201cremote effect on the sale of consumer realty [was] not sufficient for [the Court] to conclude that the deceptive trade practice actually occurred in that sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 667 A.2d 624 (pointing out that \u201c[t]he only effect the alleged misrepresentations had on the sale of the townhouses was the creation of a possibly erroneous belief on the part of the builders which caused them to include allegedly inferior products in the townhouse.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The Court observed, however, that \u201c[i]t is quite possible that a deceptive trade practice committed by someone who is not the seller [of consumer realty] would so infect the sale or offer for sale to a consumer that the law would deem the practice to have been committed \u2018in\u2019 the sale or offer for sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541, 667 A.2d 624. (providing examples from other cases, such as a Pennsylvania consumer\u2019s action against a finance company that assisted a pool sales company in fraudulently obtaining mortgage deeds on consumers\u2019 homes).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The case at bar is such a case. Hoffman\u2019s appraisals were so vital to the sales of consumer realty here that his conduct in performing them was the equivalent of conduct committed \u201cin\u201d the sale, for purposes of the MCPA. Unlike the defendants in <em>Morris, </em>who produced the plywood to be used for any purpose for which plywood is suitable, and who in no way participated in influencing the plaintiffs\u2019 decisions to purchase consumer realty, Hoffman knew, from his familiarity with FHA regulations, that his appraisals were critical to effectuate the sales. Moreover, the evidence showed that, without the inflated appraisals, the sales would not have transpired. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable finding that Hoffman engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices in making material misrepresentations about value in the appraisals.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\n<em>Affirmative Defense of Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Irwin and Wood contend the trial court erred by not granting their motion for JNOV on the affirmative defense of fraud. They argue that the evidence established that the buyers knowingly participated in furnishing false gift letters to Irwin to induce Irwin to extend FHA mortgage financing to them; and that reasonable jurors could find from that evidence only that the buyers were themselves committing fraud, and therefore were barred from recovering against them for conspiracy to defraud or fraud. In short, Irwin and Wood contend that the evidence of fraud by the buyers was so clearly in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>favor that it should not have been submitted to the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The buyers respond that whether they had the necessary <em>scienter </em>to satisfy the elements of fraud was a question of fact; therefore, the issue of fraud on their part was properly ruled a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In Maryland, fraud is an affirmative defense that, if proven, bars a plaintiff from recovering. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-323(g). Like an affirmative claim of fraud, the affirmative defense of fraud requires a showing, by clear and convincing evidence, of detrimental reliance on a knowingly false representation, made with an intent to deceive. The showing must be made by the defendant, however, against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">This issue was not properly presented to the trial court on a motion for JNOV, and therefore was not properly preserved for review in this Court. The issue was not raised in a motion for judgment at the conclusion of the defense case or the entire trial. Rather, it was raised for the first time in Irwin and Wood\u2019s motion for JNOY. Yet, Rule 2-532(a) plainly states that, \u201c[i]n a jury trial, a party may move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict only if that party made a motion for judgment at the close of all the evidence and only on the grounds advanced in support of the earlier motion.\u201d The rule was not satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">If we were to address the issue, however, we would agree with the buyers that, with respect to the affirmative defense of fraud, the evidence at trial generated a question of fact on the issue of <em>scienter, </em>at the very least. The jurors reasonably could have concluded that the buyers did not cooperate with Beeman in the false gift letter effort with an intention to deceive Irwin and Wood. The evidence supported an inference that the buyers inaccurately thought that the gift letters were a standard means of effectuating closings, and that Wood knew that gift letters, based on inaccurate information, were being used to effectuate the settlements. That evidence tended to negate the intent to deceive element of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>fraud defense. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the motion for JNOV on the affirmative defense of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\n<em>Denials of Motions for Judgment and JNOV and Motion for New Trial or Remittitur on Non-economic Damages Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">In connection with conspiracy to defraud and fraud, the trial court instructed the jurors about non-economic damages as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">In addition to the economic injury, if any you find, you may consider any non-economic injury which you find is proximately and directly caused. In determining non-economic damages, you may consider any mental pain, anguish, humiliation, nervousness, stress and insult to which that Plaintiff has been subjected and which was the direct result of the conduct of one or more Defendants. Again, your award must not be based on guess work but must fairly and adequately compensate each Plaintiff that you find in favor or for the injury that each Plaintiff you find has sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">As noted above, the jury awarded $145,000 in non-economic damages to each buyer, for a total of $1,305 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">The appellants raise a number of contentions about the non-economic damages, all of which fall into two categories.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> First, they argue that the jury\u2019s damages award for emotional distress was not supported by adequate evidence, because the buyers did not introduce proof that their injuries were \u201cobjectively determinable.\u201d They maintain that, under the rule articulated in <em>Vance v. Vance, </em>286 Md. 490, 408 A.2d 728 (1979), the buyers could not recover non-economic emotional distress damages absent evidence of \u201coutward manifestations\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>of their psychic injuries. The buyers respond that proof of an objective manifestation of an emotional injury is not required in a fraud action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Second, the appellants argue that the non-economic damages award was improper because it was founded at least in part on loss of credit, which is an inherently speculative loss, and was not supported by the evidence in any event. The buyers counter that they did not seek and were not awarded damages for loss of credit or repair to their damaged credit. Rather, they offered evidence of the humiliation, anxiety, stress, and embarrassment they endured as a consequence of having their credit damaged to show, in part, that they suffered emotional distress as a result of the appellants\u2019 fraudulent practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\n<em>The \u201cPhysical Injury Rule\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In <em>Vance v. Vance, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals upheld an award of damages for emotional distress in a negligent misrepresentation case. The defendant had falsely misrepresented to the plaintiff that he was divorced and therefore free to marry; and on that basis, the two had participated in a marriage ceremony and lived together as though married. The plaintiff later learned, in the course of divorce proceedings, that her \u201chusband\u201d had been married when they \u201cmarried,\u201d so they were never married at all. At trial, the plaintiff presented evidence that, upon learning that she and the defendant were never married, she could not function, could not sleep, had difficulty communicating and socializing with other people, and spent \u201clong periods of time crying and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>sobbing.\u201d <em>Vance, supra, </em>286 Md. at 493-94, 408 A.2d 728. No medical evidence was presented to support the plaintiffs claim of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The jury awarded the plaintiff $50,000 in damages. The trial court granted a JNOV, on the ground that the plaintiff had not offered evidence of a physical injury sufficient to support an award of damages for emotional distress in a negligence case.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">On review, the Court of Appeals held that the evidence was sufficient to support the award of damages for emotional distress. The Court discussed the history of what is known as the \u201cphysical injury rule,\u201d beginning with <em>Green v. T.A. Shoemaker &amp; Co., </em>111 Md. 69, 73 A. 688 (1909). That case held that it was not necessary for a plaintiff in a negligence action to prove a physical impact, in order to recover damages for emotional distress; rather, it was sufficient for the plaintiff to show that the negligence had caused him some \u201cphysical injury.\u201d Later, in <em>Bowman v. Williams, </em>164 Md. 397, 165 A. 182 (1933), the \u201cphysical injury rule\u201d was clarified to mean that a plaintiff can recover damages for emotional distress in a negligence action, in the absence of a physical impact, when the emotional distress has \u201cresulted in some clearly apparent and substantial physical injury, as manifested by an external condition or by symptoms clearly indicated of a resultant pathological, physiological, or mental state.\u201d <em>Vance, supra, </em>286 Md. at 500, 408 A.2d 728 (quoting <em>Bowman, supra, </em>164 Md. at 404, 165 A. 182).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The Court in <em>Vance </em>explained that the underlying purpose of the \u201cphysical injury rule\u201d is to \u201crequir[e] objective evidence to guard against feigned claims.\u201d 286 Md. at 500, 408 A.2d 728. Therefore, \u201c[i]n the context of the <em>Bowman </em>rule ... the term \u2018physical\u2019 is not used in its ordinary dictionary sense. Instead, it is used to represent that the injury for which recovery is sought is capable of objective determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Evidence indicative of a \u201cmental state\u201d is sufficiently objective to prove a physical injury, as that term is used in <em>Bowman. </em>On that basis, the Court concluded that the evidence intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>duced by the plaintiff at trial was sufficient to support the award of damages for emotional distress for negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The buyers acknowledge the \u201cphysical injury rule\u201d but argue that it applies only in negligence cases, not in intentional tort cases. In support, they cite <em>Laubach v. Franklin Square Hospital, </em>79 Md.App. 203, 556 A.2d 682 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In <em>Laubach, </em>a jury found that the defendant hospital violated a provision of the Health General Article by refusing to give the plaintiffs a medical record created in the course of plaintiff wife\u2019s treatment, within a reasonable time after the plaintiffs requested it. The plaintiffs introduced evidence that the hospital\u2019s statutory violation caused them mental distress; there was no evidence that they suffered physical manifestations of the distress, however. The jury awarded the plaintiffs compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">On appeal, the hospital argued <em>inter alia </em>that, under the \u201cphysical injury rule,\u201d as explicated in <em>Vance, </em>the evidence was insufficient to support the award of compensatory damages for emotional distress. In rejecting that argument, we explained that, because the statute proscribed an intentional act (refusal to disclose), not a negligent act, the \u201cphysical injury rule\u201d was not implicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">[T]he conduct which forms the basis for the cause of action is more closely akin to intentional torts than to negligent acts [ ... ] There was no need for [the plaintiffs] to prove physical injury of the sort required by the Court in <em>Vance, supra. </em>It was sufficient that the emotional distress and mental suffering were elements of damages emanating directly from the intentional conduct of the hospital in refusing to disclose the [medical record.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">79 Md.App. at 219, 556 A.2d 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">We observed that \u201cemotional distress may form the basis for the recovery of actual damages where the emotional distress arises from an intentional tort, such as libel, slander, malicious prosecution, fraud, and the like.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 556 A.2d 682 (citing <em>H &amp; R Block, Inc. v. Testerman, 275 </em>Md. 36, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>48-49, 338 A.2d 48 (1975)(commenting, in the course of affirming a trial court\u2019s denial of damages for emotional distress in a negligence action, that mental suffering is a proper element of damages when the act causing the injury was \u201cinspired by fraud, malice, or like motives\u201d); <em>Zeigler v. F Street Corp., </em>248 Md. 223, 225-26, 235 A.2d 703 (1967) (commenting, in the course of affirming the dismissal of a -wrongful death case in which the decedent\u2019s wife was claiming he died as a consequence of emotional distress due to enduring the defendant\u2019s damage to his real property, that \u201c[wjhere ... the act occasioning the injury to the [plaintiffs] property [was] inspired by fraud, malice, or like motives, mental suffering is a proper element of damage\u201d); and <em>Davis v. United States Dept. of Army, </em>602 F.Supp. 355, 360 (D.Md.1985) (stating that \u201crecovery for negligent, as opposed to intentional infliction of emotional harm must be accompanied by a physical invasion\u201d)). Our holding recognized that intentional misconduct that forms the basis for an intentional tort is conduct that one expects, by its very nature, to produce emotional distress in the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">In the case at bar, we agree with the buyers that the \u201cphysical injury rule\u201d had no application to their fraud claim. As the Court in <em>Vance </em>made plain, the rule was fashioned in a series of negligence cases for the purpose of minimizing feigned claims for damages for emotional distress.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The rule permits recovery when the emotional distress claimed is not parasitic to an actual physical injury; the defendant\u2019s conduct itself (carelessness) does not give reassur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>anee that the plaintiff in fact experienced emotional distress; but there is some objective proof to support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">As the Court in <em>Laubach </em>recognized, unlike in a tort case founded on negligence, in a tort case based on intentional misconduct, such as fraud, proof that the defendant committed the wrong alleged is sufficient reassurance that the plaintiffs claimed emotional distress is not feigned, because the wrongful conduct ordinarily would cause emotional distress in the victim. For that reason, there is no need for the plaintiff to support his claim of emotional distress with objective evidence of a physical injury. It is only necessary that the plaintiff prove \u201cthat the emotional distress and mental suffering were elements of damages emanating directly from the intentional conduct of the [defendant].... \u201d <em>Laubach, supra, </em>79 Md.App. at 219, 556 A.2d 682. <em>See also Empire Realty Co., Inc. v. Fleisher, </em>269 Md. 278, 284, 805 A.2d 144 (1973) (noting that \u201c[o]ne suing for fraud or deceit must establish that he sustained damages by reason of the fraud, and that his injury was the natural and proximate consequence of his reliance on the fraudulent act\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"> Here, the buyers alleged and introduced evidence to show that they were the victims of a deceptive scheme to trick them into buying deteriorating properties at inflated prices. The buyers presented evidence showing that they sustained actual, economic damages as a result of the fraud practiced upon them. In addition, they each testified that, as a consequence of the successful scheme, they experienced emotional distress, in the form of anxiety, humiliation, and embarrassment. The buyers were not required to introduce objective evidence, under the \u201cphysical injury rule,\u201d to support their claims that they suffered emotional distress as a consequence of being fraud victims. Proof of the appellants\u2019 misconduct was sufficient to validate the buyers\u2019 subjective evidence that they experienced emotional distress. It was enough that the buyers proved that the appellants perpetrated a fraud on them that resulted in actual harm, in the form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>economic loss, and that they suffered emotional distress attendant to that harm.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\n<em>Emotional Distress for Experiencing Credit Problems</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In advancing their second argument, concerning loss of credit, the appellants rely on <em>Sterling v. Marine Bank of Crisfield, </em>120 Md. 396, 87 A. 697 (1913). In that case, the sheriff levied on certain items of merchandise of a store owner \u2014 tobacco, candies, and soft drinks \u2014 that were wrongfully attached by a bank. The store owner sued the bank for economic damages. A jury trial resulted in a defense verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">On appeal, the store owner challenged several rulings and instructions by the trial court concerning the proper measure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>of damages. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that two elements of economic damage that properly could be recovered in a wrongful attachment action were 1) the value of or damages to the goods actually seized; and 2) the actual, ascertainable loss of profit consequential to the interruption of the business. In response to an argument advanced by the store owner, the Court explained that in such an action recovery could not be had for \u201cdamage to the credit, if any, of the plaintiff\u2019 because it is \u201ctoo uncertain and speculative a matter to be left to the jury.\u201d 120 Md. at 402, 87 A. 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Sterling, </em>the buyers in the case at bar were not seeking economic damages for loss of credit. (As we shall explain, <em>infra, </em>in Part IV, in closing argument, the buyers\u2019 lawyer itemized the economic damages being sought, which did not include damages for loss of credit; and, except for one discrepancy that is <em>de minimis, </em>the jury awarded the buyers economic damages in the amounts sought.) The issue of credit related to the buyers\u2019 claims for non-economic, emotional distress damages. There was evidence introduced showing that, after being deceived into purchasing deteriorating properties at inflated values, the buyers experienced credit problems, either by virtue of foreclosure actions against them or their inabilities to pay expenses incurred for repairs to the properties; and that the credit problems were a source of anxiety and embarrassment to them. The jurors properly were permitted by the trial court to take the buyers\u2019 negative credit experiences into account in considering their claims for emotional distress damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Irwin and Wood advance various challenges to the trial court\u2019s instructions, or lack thereof, at the close of the case and during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Rule 2-520 governs jury instructions in civil cases. The court must instruct the jury at the close of the evidence, and may do so, <em>inter alia, </em>by granting requested instructions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>giving instructions of its own, or combining these methods. The court has discretion to give interim instructions. Rule 2-520(a) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">A party is entitled to have his theory of the case presented to the jury by way of instructions but only if the theory is a correct exposition of the law and the theory is generated by the evidence in the case. <em>Sergeant Co. v. Pickett, </em>285 Md. 186, 194, 401 A.2d 651 (1979); <em>Levine v. Rendler, </em>272 Md. 1, 13, 320 A.2d 258 (1974); <em>Boone v. Am. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>150 Md.App. 201, 225, 819 A.2d 1099 (2003). However, \u201c[t]he court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by the instructions actually given.\u201d Rule 2-520(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\n<em>Refusal to Instruct on Defense of Equitable Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Irwin and Wood contend that the trial court erred in declining to instruct the jury on the defense of equitable estoppel. They argue that one of their principal defenses related to the buyers\u2019 submission of false gift letters to support their loan applications, which appellants claim triggered the need for an equitable estoppel instruction. In support of their argument, Irwin and Wood cite <em>Impala Platinum, Ltd. v. Impala Sales (USA), Inc., </em>283 Md. 296, 389 A.2d 887 (1978), which addressed the doctrine of equitable estoppel, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">Equitable estoppel is the effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded, both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed, either of property, of contract, or of remedy, as against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse, and who on his part acquires some corresponding right, either of property, of contract, or of remedy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Impala, supra, </em>283 Md. at 322, 389 A.2d 887 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\">In response, the buyers, citing <em>Chesapeake Homes, Inc. v. McGrath, </em>249 Md. 480, 489, 240 A.2d 245 (1968), argue that the doctrine was not applicable because a party raising the estoppel must himself be free from fraud in the transaction. The buyers assert that, because Irwin and Wood could not fulfill the \u201cgood faith\u201d component necessary to invoke the doctrine, the trial court correctly denied their request for an instruction on the doctrine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">We agree with the buyers that an equitable estoppel instruction was not generated by the evidence. The buyers\u2019 claims against Irwin and Wood all were predicated on fraudulent conduct on their part. If the jury found, as it did, that Irwin and Wood were liable for fraud, then equitable estoppel could not be raised as a defense. If, on the other hand, the jury found in Irwin and Wood\u2019s favor on all three counts, the issue of equitable estoppel would be moot because they would not need an affirmative defense. Therefore, the trial court did not err in declining to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of equitable estoppel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\n<em>Instruction on Economic Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Irwin and Wood next contend the trial court erred in its instructions on economic damages for fraud both as to the standard of proof of damages and the type of damages recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">\n<em>Standard of Proof of Damages for Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">The trial court gave the jury written instructions and oral instructions. Its written instruction Number Four stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMm\">The burden of proving fraud and conspiracy to defraud by clear and convincing evidence applie[s] to the elements of the claim. Individual items of damage attributable to these claims must only be provided [sic] by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The written instructions further directed the jurors that, with respect to Question Six on the verdict sheet, asking them to list the damages they were awarding, if any, for fraud, conspiracy to defraud, or both, the buyers were required to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, \u201ceach item of injury or loss claimed to be sustained.... \u201d The trial court\u2019s oral instructions for the most part mirrored its written instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">Irwin and Wood objected to written instruction Number Four. They argued that the court\u2019s directive that \u201c[ijndividual items of damage attributable to [the fraud] claim[ ] must only be provided by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d was legally incorrect, because proof of all the elements of fraud, including damages, must be by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">Notwithstanding their objection to written instruction Number Four, Irwin and Wood made no objection to the written instruction about Question Six on the verdict sheet \u2014 which was in substance identical to written instruction Number Four. They also did not object to the trial court\u2019s oral instructions about the preponderance of the evidence standard for proof of items of damages sustained as a result of fraud.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">On appeal, Irwin and Wood argue, in a single paragraph of their brief, that the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof applies to all elements of the tort of fraud, and therefore the part of the court\u2019s instruction telling the jury that individual items of damage only had to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence was legally incorrect. The buyers respond that this argument confuses two distinct concepts: the fact of an injury proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s fraud, which they argue must be shown by clear and convincing evidence, and the value of that item of loss, which they argue may be shown by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">We conclude that Irwin and Wood waived this issue for appellate review. Rule 2-520(e) provides that \u201c[n]o party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds for the objection.\u201d \u201c[A] party must fully comply with the requirements of the rule at every stage of the instructions in order to preserve his rights.\u201d <em>Casey v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Baltimore, </em>217 Md. 595, 612, 143 A.2d 627 (1958) (addressing the predecessor rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In <em>Casey, </em>the Court held that a party\u2019s objection to an original instruction on damages, which prompted the court to give an amended instruction on damages, did not suffice to preserve for appellate review the issue of the legal correctness of the amended instruction, to which the party did not object. In a similar vein, in <em>Sydnor v. State, </em>365 Md. 205, 776 A.2d 669 (2001), the defendant did not object to the trial court\u2019s self-defense instruction;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> during deliberations, the jury asked a question about self-defense, to which the court responded by giving an amended instruction on the same topic, to which the defendant objected. On appeal, the Court held that the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the original instruction did not operate to waive his challenge to the amended instruction, because the amended instruction differed from the original instruction. It was implicit in the Court\u2019s holding in this regard that, had the instructions been the same, the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the instruction as first given would have precluded him from challenging on appeal the instruction as given a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In the case at bar, Irwin and Wood objected to written instruction Number Four, on the standard of proof of damages, but did not object to the written instruction about Question Six on the verdict sheet, which covered the same topic. The two written instructions communicated the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>concept to the jury: that, with respect to the fraud claim, proof of the value of an item of loss could be made by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Especially given that the trial court\u2019s instructions were provided to the jury in writing, as well as orally, and therefore would be a tangible reference for the jurors during deliberations, it was not sufficient for Irwin and Wood to lodge an incomplete objection to the standard of proof instruction. Had the trial court changed written instruction Number Four, as Irwin and Wood suggested, the jury still would have been instructed, in the written instruction on Question Six, that, in deciding the issue of damages for fraud, it was sufficient for the buyers to prove each item of loss by a preponderance standard. Thus, to preserve the issue whether the trial court properly instructed the jury on this point, it was necessary for Irwin and Wood to object to both instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\n<em>Type of Damages Recoverable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">If you have found in favor of any Plaintiff or against any Defendant for conspiracy to commit fraud or fraud, ... you must then consider the amount of damage which you find that that Plaintiff sustained. You must then consider the question of damages and it will be your duty to consider in what amount that will fairly and adequately compensate each Plaintiff....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">MM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">You are not to engage in speculation. You are not to guess but your award must adequately and fairly compensate the Plaintiff for the injuries sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>In determining economic injury you may consider all losses that the Plaintiff that you found for has sustained and you should endeavor to compensate that person so as to put him or her in a position as nearly as possible that they would have been in if the injury or loss had not occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Irwin and Wood excepted to this instruction, arguing that, based on <em>Hall v. Lovell Regency Homes Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>121 Md.App. 1, 12, 708 A.2d 344 (1998), because the allegations of fraud arose out of the sale of real property, the court should have instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">In fraudulent cases involving real estate transactions Maryland Courts have applied a flexible measure of damages that allows the Plaintiff to choose between two tests for damages. The preferred test is the out of pocket rule which [is] the difference between the amount of the purchase price the buyer has paid and the actual value of the property on the date it was sold. The other acceptable measure of damages is the benefit of the bargain [ ] test in which the damages are the [ ] difference between the actual value of the property at the time of making the contract and the value that it would have possessed had the representations been true. Under either test the goal is to put the buyer as nearly as practicable in the position he would have been in had he not been defrauded. If the Plaintiffs fail to present competent evidence under either of the two tests set out above, they are not entitled to recover damages as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">Under either the benefit of the bargain or the out of pocket test, the Plaintiffs evidence must establish the difference between two like valuation variables at one point in time. It is the difference between the two valuation figures at one point in time that quantifies the Plaintiffs lost benefit or her out of pocket loss. The Plaintiff that presents valuations figures at different points in time cannot recover damages as there is simply no basis for comparison of the valuation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>figures as intervening forces may have impacted the value of the property during (inaudible) point in time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The court denied the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In closing argument, the buyers\u2019 lawyer discussed damages with the aid of a chart that set forth for each buyer the precise sum of economic damages being sought, and explained to the jurors what those sums represented. He asked the jury to award to each of the three buyers who still owned the properties they had purchased (Henderson, Elder, and Green) three items of damage: an \u201cover valuation\u201d amount (which he explained was the difference between the amount paid for the house on the date of purchase and the actual value of the house on that date); an \u201cexcess mortgage payments\u201d amount (which he explained was the difference between the mortgage payments the buyer had paid up to the time of trial and the amount of the mortgage payments the buyer would have paid for the same time period if the house had been sold at its actual value, not at an inflated value); and compensation for the cost of making repairs that Beeman had promised he would make to the house but did not make.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">As applied to the three buyers in question, the damages sought were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">Henderson: $35,000 over valuation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8E\">$12,477 excess mortgage payments</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atv\">$ 2,446 repairs not performed by Beeman $49,923</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYb\">Elder:. $21,000 overvaluation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANQ\">$ 8,064 excess mortgage payments $29,264</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4h\">Green: $ 14,000 over valuation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAlU\">$ 1,263 excess mortgage payments</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG1\">$ 850 repairs not performed by Beeman $16,113</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-21\">The buyers\u2019 lawyer asked for the jury to award these precise sums in economic damages, and the jury did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-22\">The other six buyers (Stamper, Brower, Spencer, Coward, McFadden, and Haley) had lost their properties by foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>and, because their mortgages were FHA-insured, were not liable for any deficiency. The buyers\u2019 lawyer asked the jury to award each of these buyers reimbursements of any down payments made; any mortgage payments made; any moving and storing costs incurred; any property repair and maintenance costs incurred; and certain other consequential damages we shall specify below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">Stamper: $ 500 down payment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">$1,403.82 mortgage payments made</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQz\">$ 380 moving and storage costs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">$1,916.85 property repairs and maintenance $4,200.67</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">Brower: $ 202.72 mortgage payments made</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az4\">$ 325 moving and storage costs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-12\">$ 209.50 property repairs and maintenance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adm\">$2,843.48 SELP loan still owned to Baltimore City $3,580.70</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-14\">Spencer: $ 209.50 property repairs and maintenance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-15\">$2,843.48 SELP loan still owed to Baltimore City $3,052.98</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-17\">Coward: $6,777.19 mortgage payments made</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9P\">$ 400 moving and storage costs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-19\">$ 1,850 property repairs and maintenance $ 9,027</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-21\">McFadden: $ 500 down payment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-23\">$2,878.47 property repairs and maintenance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1d\">$ 500 moving and storage costs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-24\">$ 605 additional property repairs and maintenance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-25\">$ 6,000 value of furniture put out on street during eviction and stolen $ 10,483</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-28\">' Haley: $1,227.36 mortgage payments made</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-29\">$ 950 property repairs and maintenance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-30\">$ 950 value of furniture, clothes, and carpets ruined and replaced due to water damage $3,127.36</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-33\">In each case except for Stamper\u2019s, the buyers\u2019 lawyer asked the jury to award the sums listed above, and the jury gave an award in that amount. In Stamper\u2019s case, the jury was asked to award $4,245.67 (instead of $4,200.67), for reasons we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>cannot discern from the record, and the jury gave the amount requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In his closing argument, counsel for Irwin and Wood did not address the items of damage sought in the chart the buyers\u2019 lawyer had presented to the jury. Irwin and Wood\u2019s lawyer argued that the jurors could not speculate about damages; that they should consider (and, though not expressly stated, but implied, offset) the benefits the buyers had derived, such as living in the houses for periods of time much longer than the months for which they made their mortgage payments, and further consider that in McFadden\u2019s case, he could have removed his belongings before the sheriff put them on the street; that the root of the buyers\u2019 problems was the poor conditions of the properties, not the loans extended to them, so the damage award should focus on Beeman, not on Irwin and Wood; and that they were to keep in mind that they could not use a damages award to punish Irwin and Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Irwin and Wood argue that the trial court erred by not giving the instruction they requested based on the <em>Hall </em>case, and by instead giving an instruction that did not give the jurors proper guidance about the measure of economic damages in fraud and conspiracy to defraud cases involving real estate transactions. They assert that the jury should have been told that the buyers could recover either the difference between the sum paid on the date of purchase and the actual value of the property on that date, under the \u201cout of pocket\u201d test; or the difference between the actual value of the property and the value the property would have had if the representations been true, at some point in time after the sale, under the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d test; and that, had they been so informed, they would have known that none of the other damages claimed were recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Thus, according to Wood and Irwin, the jurors should have been given enough information to know first, that the three buyers who still owned their properties only should have been entitled to recover the over valuation sums they sought, and not the additional sums for excess mortgage payments and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>repairs promised by Beeman but not made; second, to know that the other six buyers were not entitled to recover anything, because there were no over valuation damages for them (their houses having been foreclosed on and no longer being owned by them); and third, that no other type of damage was recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The buyers respond that the instruction as given was an accurate statement of the law and that, under the flexibility theory of fraud damages discussed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Hinkle v. Rockville Motor Co., </em>262 Md. 502, 511-12, 278 A.2d 42 (1971), they were entitled to recover the damages they were awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The trial court properly declined to give the instruction requested by Irwin and Wood. The instruction only was partially applicable to this case and would have been misleading to the jury. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In the <em>Hall </em>case, purchasers of a number of new houses in a Frederick County development brought tort and contract claims, including a claim for fraud, against the home builder. <em>Hall, supra, </em>121 Md.App. at 5, 708 A.2d 344. The crux of the homeowners\u2019 allegations was that their houses, which they still owned and lived in, were constructed and the streets in the development were designed such that water leaked into their basements; that they had been told by the builder prior to construction that the houses would not have water problems and the basements would be able to be finished off; and that the water problems the houses were experiencing were irreparable and made the houses uninhabitable. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7, 708 A.2d 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">At trial, the homeowners introduced expert testimony that, due to the water leakage problems, the present fair market value of each house was zero. They did not introduce competent, non-speculative evidence of the present fair market value of the houses without the alleged defects. In addition, although they introduced evidence of the prices they paid for the houses on their purchase dates, <em>i.e., </em>the values of the houses in the conditions as represented by the builder on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>date of the purchases, they did not introduce evidence of the values of the houses with the defects on their purchase dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">On that basis, the trial court ruled that because the homeowners did not present evidence of the values of their houses with and without the alleged defects at a single point in time, they had not presented sufficient evidence to recover out of pocket damages for loss in value or benefit of the bargain damages for loss in value. <em>Id. </em>The trial court instructed the jury that they could not award damages for loss of value of the houses, but they could award damages for any actual costs of repair; and if they found the homeowners did not prove any actual repair costs, they were to award nominal damages. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 708 A.2d 344. The jury found in favor of the homeowners on several claims, including fraud, but awarded them nominal damages. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11, 708 A.2d 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">On appeal by the homeowners, we affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court properly had ruled that, without evidence of loss in value at a single point of time \u2014 either at the time of sale, under the out of pocket theory of recovery, or at a later time, under the benefit of the bargain theory of recovery \u2014 the homeowners did not present sufficient evidence to permit the jury to award loss of value damages. <em>Id. </em>at 22-23, 708 A.2d 344. '</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In the case at bar, the three buyers who still owned their properties presented evidence of the \u201cas represented\u201d values of their properties on the dates of sale and the actual values of their properties on the dates of sale. Thus, they introduced sufficient evidence to establish, under the out of pocket theory of recovery, the loss of value in their properties as calculated at a single point in time. Moreover, that is the sum they sought for damages for \u201cover valuation,\u201d and that they were awarded; and, as noted, Irwin and Wood concede these buyers were entitled to recover that sum. What Irwin and Wood were seeking to do by requesting the instruction based on <em>Hall, </em>however, was to limit these buyers to that recovery only. Yet, <em>Hall </em>does not stand for the proposition that loss of value is the only item of damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>recoverable in a fraud action involving the sale of real property, and that the plaintiff cannot also recover other items of consequential damages.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The instruction sought would have misled the jury to think otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><em>Hall </em>also does not stand for the proposition that a plaintiff property buyer suing for fraud in the sale of real property who no longer owns the property and is not seeking damages for loss in value is not entitled to any other damages proximately caused by the fraud. For that reason, the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>quested instruction based on <em>Hall </em>was inapplicable to the six buyers whose properties had been foreclosed upon. The instruction would have incorrectly led the jurors to think they were not permitted to award damages to any of those buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\n<em>Refusal to Give a Curative Instruction During Closing Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Finally, Irwin and Wood contend the trial court erred in declining to give a curative instruction after the initial closing argument by counsel for the buyers. They argue that certain comments by counsel in his initial closing \u201cwere an attempt to have the jury award punitive damages in the guise of non-economic damages,\u201d despite the court\u2019s ruling that the jury would not be permitted to assess punitive damages against them. In support, Irwin and Wood quote the following excerpts from the buyers\u2019 lawyer\u2019s closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">This kind of case makes a statement about what\u2019s acceptable in the entire community and it goes out from beyond here in sets of standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">[Tjhis is a case about making a difference, that in deciding on an award under this factor of what you believe is acceptable and unacceptable conduct towards other people is an important message to send out there and let them know, you can\u2019t treat people this way. You can\u2019t take people and run them through a process and take advantage of them, to use them just as means of production just to earn a profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">H\u00bb \u2022i* H* *1*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\">That\u2019s what you should consider when making your award here, of just what is the affect [sic] on people being used in this way. What it means for people to come in here and take advantage of others in this manner. Your award will say a lot about that. Often times people complain nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>ever changes. This is a case where you have a chance to make a difference, a chance for things to change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The buyers respond that Irwin and Wood did not object to the statements or seek a curative instruction on the ground they now advance. On the merits, they argue that the trial judge was in the best position to determine whether there was any impropriety in the remarks in the context of the entire argument and the evidence, and whether any prejudice occurred. They maintain that, ultimately, the decision to give a curative instruction rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the court here did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Vergie M. Lapelosa, Inc. v. Craze, </em>44 Md.App. 202, 215-16, 407 A.2d 786 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The record reflects that, after the initial closing argument, Irwin and Wood\u2019s lawyer said he had \u201ctwo short objections on damages.\u201d He argued that counsel had invited the jury to award damages \u201cas a basis of harm to Baltimore which [they] can\u2019t possibly be responsible for\u201d and further said, \u201cI think the jury should hear that that should not be a proper consideration .... \u201d The court responded, \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to give that.\u201d Irwin and Wood\u2019s lawyer then complained that, by suggesting that the jurors award each buyer $200,000 in non-economic damages, without giving an \u201cobjective basis\u201d for that amount, the buyers\u2019 lawyer was \u201cin effect\u201d asking the jurors to award punitive damages against Irwin and Wood.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Counsel did not seek a curative instruction on this topic, or any other relief. The trial court overruled the objection, observing that an award of non-economic damages in the case \u201ccould be substantial\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t think [counsel for the buyers] was arguing punitives. He got very close ... but I don\u2019t think he overstepped the bounds.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">While the argument advanced on appeal is not identical to the request for curative instruction made below, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>overlap is sufficient to preserve the issue for review. In essence, Irwin and Wood asked for a curative instruction to correct what they argued was an improper impression, conveyed to the jurors in the remarks quoted above, that compensatory damages could be awarded against Irwin and Wood not based on harm to the buyers but to make a statement to the community that \u201cflipping\u201d schemes are not to be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The Court of Appeals has addressed the proper bounds of closing argument for the most part in criminal cases, in the context of whether a prosecutor\u2019s remarks have negatively affected the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. In that context, the Court has observed that counsel are afforded a wide range of latitude in closing argument, \u201c \u2018to make any comment or argument that is warranted by the evidence proved or inferences therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill v. State, </em>355 Md. 206, 222, 734 A.2d 199 (1999) (quoting <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412, 326 A.2d 707 (1974)). Counsel may assess the conduct of the parties, attack the credibility of witnesses, and in that regard \u201cindulge in oratorical conceit or flourish and in illustrations and metaphorical allusions.\u201d <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 430, 722 A.2d 887 (1999) (quoting <em>Wilhelm, supra, </em>272 Md. at 413, 326 A.2d 707). Although there are \u201cno hard-and-fast limitations within which the argument of earnest counsel must be confined,\u201d <em>id., </em>counsel must not comment on facts not in evidence or make \u201c \u2018appeals to class prejudice or to passion ... [that] may so poison the minds of jurors that an accused may be deprived of a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill, supra, </em>355 Md. at 222-23, 734 A.2d 199 (quoting <em>Wilhelm, supra, </em>272 Md. at 414, 326 A.2d 707); <em>White v. State, </em>125 Md.App. 684, 705, 726 A.2d 858 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The propriety <em>vel non </em>of the closing remarks Irwin and Wood complain about only can be assessed by taking them in context. The buyers\u2019 lawyer gave an initial closing argument that lasted <em>Vk </em>hours. It consisted among other things of a detailed review of the facts in evidence concerning each defendant and each buyer, including recapitulations of testimony; a discussion of the facts in light of the legal principles explained by the court in instructions; an accounting as to each buyer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the economic injury suffered and the amount of damages sought; and an argument seeking compensation for each buyer for the emotional distress he or she experienced.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The first statement Irwin and Wood complain about, made toward the beginning of the initial opening, was part of an introductory discussion in which counsel was distinguishing the case, in terms of importance, from those about \u201cwho has the red light\u201d and \u201chow many physical therapy visits are justified.\u201d The remark, taken in context, was not an appeal to the jurors to award damages for harm to the community, or on any basis other than the evidence, or to award punitive damages against defendants other than the Beemans and AHOYO.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The second and third statements Irwin and Wood complain about were made much later in the initial closing, when counsel was discussing the buyers\u2019 claims for non-economic emotional distress damages. The comments in question were attacks on the conduct of the defendants made in the context of explaining how that conduct had caused anguish and humiliation to the buyers: that they had been taken advantage of, used as pawns in a process devised to generate financial gain, and treated in unacceptable and undignified ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The trial judge was in the best position to assess the import of these remarks, in their full context, and determine whether they were a proper observation about the nature of the defendants\u2019 conduct and request that the jurors award the buyers damages, in accordance with the law, to compensate them for their distress; or whether they were an improper plea for an award of punitive damages against Irwin and Hoffman. The trial judge made a considered ruling, taking into account that the sum being sought for compensatory emotional distress damages was not out of line with the substantial value of the buyers\u2019 emotional distress claims, and concluded that the remarks were not an improper attempt to recover punitive damages. We see no basis to disturb the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Cross-Appeal Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"A9d\">\n<em>Grant of motion for judgment on punitive damages against Irwin, Wood, and Hoffman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The buyers\u2019 first cross-appeal issue challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling granting Irwin, Wood, and Hoffman\u2019s motions for judgment on the issue of punitive damages. They contend the evidence adduced at trial made the question whether punitive damages were warranted against these defendants a jury question. Irwin, Wood, and Hoffman respond that neither the evidence of their own conduct nor the evidence of conduct by Beeman, imputed to them by virtue of their status as co-conspirators, could support a reasonable finding that punitive damages were warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Punitive damages only may be awarded when a defendant commits a tort with \u201cactual malice.\u201d <em>Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc. v. Borzym, </em>379 Md. 249, 841 A.2d 828 (2004). \u201cActual malice\u201d is \u201c \u2018conduct of the defendant characterized by evil motive, intent to injure, ill will or fraud.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264, 841 A.2d 828 (quoting <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, supra, </em>325 Md. at 460, 601 A.2d 633). The defendant must have acted \u201cwith a consciousness of the wrongfulness of his [misconduct],\u201d <em>Darcars, supra, </em>at 266, 841 A.2d 828, <em>i.e., </em>with knowing and deliberate wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In <em>Ellerin v. Fairfax Savings, F.S.B., supra, </em>337 Md. 216, 652 A.2d 1117, the Court of Appeals explained that, given the state of mind that must be proven to support a finding of \u201cactual malice,\u201d not all instances of fraud will support an award of punitive damages, because not all instances of fraud involve \u201cactual malice.\u201d Fraud committed with \u201cactual knowledge of falsity, coupled with [an] intent to deceive\u201d is fraud committed with consciousness of wrongdoing, and will support a finding of \u201cactual malice\u201d warranting punitive damages. By contrast, fraud committed with \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the truth does not meet the state of mind of consciousness of wrongdoing (even though there is an intent to deceive), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>hence does not involve \u201cactual malice,\u201d and will not warrant the imposition of punitive damages. As the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aje\">[T]he elements of the tort of fraud or deceit in Maryland where the tort is committed by a defendant who knows that his representation is false, include the type of deliberate wrongdoing and evil motive that has traditionally justified the award of punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 235, 652 A.2d 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The buyers maintain that the evidence at trial was sufficient to support a finding, by a clear and convincing standard, that Wood acted with conscious knowledge of the falsity of the impressions she was giving the buyers, not merely with reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of those impressions, and therefore with \u201cactual malice\u201d; and thus it was a jury question whether punitive damages were warranted against her and hence against Irwin. <em>See Embrey v. Holly, </em>293 Md. 128, 137, 442 A.2d 966 (1982) (holding that punitive damages may be imposed against employer for tortious conduct of employee). Likewise, they maintain that the evidence adduced reasonably could support a finding, by the same standard, that Hoffman communicated false information about the values and conditions of the properties deliberately and with knowledge that he was communicating false information, not simply with reckless disregard for whether the information was true or false. Thus, the jury should have been permitted to decide whether his fraudulent conduct was taken with \u201cactual malice,\u201d and warranted the imposition of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Harkening back to an earlier argument, Irwin and Wood respond that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that Wood made any false misrepresentation, and \u201cthe most the jury could have found is that Wood <em>should have </em>known that Beeman was committing fraud and that [the buyers] were submitting false gift letters.\u201d Hoffman responds that the evidence at most established that he engaged in fraud of the \u201creckless disregard\u201d type.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">For the same reasons we have explained in Part II, as to why the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>liability for fraud against Irwin, Wood, and Hoffman, the evidence was sufficient to send the issue of punitive damages to the jury as to all of these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">An interpretation of the facts and legitimate inferences most favorable to the buyers could have supported, by a clear and convincing standard, reasonable findings that, in the course of her meetings with the buyers, Wood deliberately engaged in a scheme to create false impressions about Beeman\u2019s role in the sales transactions, the values of the properties being purchased, and the legitimacy of the means being employed to effectual the sales, including the use of gift letters in violation of FHA regulations; that her conduct enabled Beeman to accomplish the closings, and turn hefty profits illegally; that she acted with actual knowledge of Beeman\u2019s wrongful acts; and, of significance to this issue, that her actions were taken with conscious knowledge that she was creating false impressions for the buyers by which they were being deceived into purchasing the properties in question at prices that were inflated. The evidence thus was sufficient to allow a finding that punitive damages were warranted against Wood (and hence Irwin), and the issue should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">So, too, the evidence most favorable to the buyers could have supported reasonable findings that Hoffman furnished false information about the conditions of the properties and assigned inaccurate, inflated appraisal values to them with conscious knowledge of his wrongdoing, not merely with reckless indifference to the truth or falsity of the information. To be sure, there was evidence that Hoffman\u2019s appraisal practices were sloppy, and he tried to portray himself to the jury as merely careless, at most, to the point of recklessness. The evidence about his interactions with Beeman to justify the final appraisal numbers, his omission from the reports of facts that would reveal that the recent sales of the properties themselves and other nearby properties did not support the values he was assigning, and the evidence that he omitted information that would reveal property defects, if credited by the jury, however, could support a reasonable finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Hoffman knew he was furnishing false information. The question whether punitive damages were warranted against Hoffman was a jury issue on the evidence adduced.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The evidence adduced at trial supported the jury\u2019s verdicts against Irwin, Wood, and Hoffman for fraud and its award of compensatory damages on the fraud verdicts. The evidence could have supported a decision by the jury that Irwin and Wood, Hoffman, or all three committed fraud with \u201cactual malice,\u201d warranting punitive damages. Had the jury decided that that was the case, a separate punitive damages hearing would have been held and the jury would have rendered an award of punitive damages in some amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Because the punitive damages issue was incorrectly withheld from the jury for decision, the buyers are entitled to a partial new trial on the issue of whether punitive damages are warranted against the appellants. The evidence presented at the retrial must itself be legally sufficient to prove the buyers\u2019 entitlement to punitive damages. <em>Middle States Holding Co., Inc. v. Thomas, </em>340 Md. 699, 703-04, 668 A.2d 5 (1995); <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, supra, </em>325 Md. at 472, 601 A.2d 633; <em>Owens-Illinois v. Armstrong, </em>326 Md. 107, 128-29, 604 A.2d 47, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 871, 113 S.Ct. 204, 121 L.Ed.2d 145 (1992). If it is, and if the jury answers the issue affirmatively, a separate hearing on the proper amount of punitive damages shall be held and the jury\u2019s final punitive damages award shall be made based on the evidence presented at that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\n<em>Calculation of Attorneys\u2019 Fees under CPA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">On February 7, 2002, after judgment was entered, the buyers\u2019 lawyers filed a petition for attorneys\u2019 fees under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>MCPA. The appellants opposed the petition. A hearing on the petition was held on March 21 and April 2, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">On May 13, 2002, the trial court issued a memorandum opinion explaining that it was going to award the buyers\u2019 lawyers $195,591.26 in fees and expenses. The court noted the award was reasonable and appropriate, given the time expended, the competency of counsel, and the risk involved in undertaking and prosecuting the case. The court stated, however, that the award was subject to a credit for any sums the buyers\u2019 lawyers might receive in the future under their contingency fee agreements with each buyer. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">If the case is settled or judgment is rendered on the conspiracy or fraud or punitive damages claims, and the [buyers\u2019 lawyers] secure[ ] by settlement or judgment any amount under the contingent fee agreement, any such payment shall reduce the amount to which [the buyers\u2019 lawyers] are entitled to receive for attorneys\u2019 fees awarded by this Court under the Consumer Protection Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The court\u2019s decision was incorporated into an order issued the same day and entered on the docket on May 14, 2002. On cross-appeal, the buyers assert that the trial court erred in conditioning the amount of the judgment for fees on sums otherwise collected as attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Because we are remanding the case for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages, we shall vacate the award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Section 13^408(b) of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), Md.Code (2002 RepLVol., 2002 Supp.), confers discretion on the court to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to any person who is awarded damages in a claim brought under the MCPA. The court\u2019s decision whether to award attorneys\u2019 fees and, if so, the amount of the award, is to be made upon a consideration of the total circumstances of the case. <em>See The Milton Co. v. Council of Unit Owners of Bentley Place Condominium, </em>121 Md.App. 100, 121-22, 708 A.2d 1047 (1998). Those circumstances include the amount of money in contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>versy in the case and the results obtained. <em>Blaylock v. Johns Hopkins Federal Credit Union, </em>152 Md.App. 338, 361, 831 A.2d 1120 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Our decision to remand this case on the issue of punitive damages creates the possibility that the buyers, or some of them, will be awarded punitive damages against one or more of the appellants. Such a result would alter the total circumstances that were before the court when it awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to the buyers\u2019 counsel. Therefore, the decision whether to award attorneys\u2019 fees against the appellants and, if so, the amount of the award, should be reconsidered by the court after the issue of punitive damages has been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">For guidance on remand, however, we make the following observation. The trial court was concerned, in making its award, that the buyers\u2019 lawyers might enjoy a double payment for their work on this case if they were to collect on a judgment for attorneys\u2019 fees and also collect their contingency fee from their clients. The contingent fee agreement, which was submitted to the court, states, however, that the fee will \u201cnot exceed one-third of any compensatory damages and any punitive damages,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he combination of court awarded fees and the [one-third] percentage fee shall not exceed the [one-third] percentage fee alone.\u201d Thus, as the buyers point out, collection on a judgment entered as an award of attorneys\u2019 fees would not result in additional compensation to the buyers\u2019 lawyers for their work on this case, under the terms of the contingency fee agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">JUDGMENT ON ISSUE OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES AGAINST IRWIN, WOOD, AND HOFFMAN REVERSED AND REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; JUDGMENT FOR ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES AGAINST IRWIN, WOOD, AND HOFFMAN VACATED, AND ISSUE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>THIS OPINION; JUDGMENTS OTHERWISE AFFIRMED.

As explained above, a conspiracy to defraud claim cannot independently result in an award of damages absent proof that fraud was committed and the plaintiff suffered actual damage as a result. The buyers in this case were awarded damages for fraud, and were not awarded separate damages for conspiracy, for that reason. The questions the appellants present on appeal concerning non-economic and economic damages therefore pertain to the fraud claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b342-5\">. We note, moreover, that in <em>Belcher v. T. Rowe Price Foundation, Inc., </em>329 Md. 709, 722, 621 A.2d 872 (1993), although not presented with the question, the Court of Appeals recognized that the \"physical injury rule\u201d is peculiar to negligence cases. It remarked, <em>\u201cVance's </em>explication of the [physical injury rule described in] <em>Bowman </em>is, at this time, the definitive Maryland case on mental distress as the basis of damages <em>in negligent tort actions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). <em>See also Hunt v. Mercy Medical Center, </em>121 Md.App. 516, 524, 710 A.2d 362 (1998)(observing that, <em>\u2018\u2018[wjithin the field of negligence law, </em>the rule in Maryland is that any 'physical injury\u2019 is compensable if that injury is 'capable of objective determination' \u201d) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Belcher v. T. Rowe Price Found., Inc., supra, </em>at 734, 621 A.2d 872).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\">. In the course of their argument, based on <em>Vance, </em>that the buyers were required to introduce evidence of objective manifestations of their emotional distress, Irwin and Wood suggest that, because the jurors awarded the buyers identical recoveries for non-economic damages, the awards must have been punitive, not compensatory. The jurors were instructed about the compensatory nature of the damages sought, and we shall presume that they followed those instructions. <em>Carter v. State, </em>366 Md. 574, 592, 785 A.2d 348 (2001). We see nothing in this record to suggest that the jurors awarded non-economic damages to punish Irwin and Wood (or any of the defendants) instead of to compensate the buyers for their emotional distress. The mere fact that each award was for the same amount of money does not mean that the awards were punitive, or were not supported by the evidence. While each buyer did not endure the exact same ordeal, the jurors reasonably could have found that they all suffered emotional distress as a direct result of the fraud practiced upon them and that $145,000 was a fair sum to compensate each one for his or her distress. <em>Southern Mgmt. Corp. </em>v. <em>Mariner, </em>144 Md.App. 188, 197, 797 A.2d 110 (2002); <em>Butkiewicz v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 412, 425, 732 A.2d 994 (1999); <em>Standiford v. Standiford, </em>89 Md.App. 326, 343, 598 A.2d 495 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Hoffman also argues that, in addition to objective evidence of emotional distress, the buyers were required to introduce expert opinion testimony about their emotional states. As explained, the \u201cphysical injury rule\u201d did not apply to the fraud claim in this case. Moreover, there is an obvious cause-and-effect between being the victim of a fraudulent scheme such as that practiced here and emotional distress, such that expert witness testimony on the topic was not required. <em>See Shpigel v. White, </em>357 Md. 117, 131, 741 A.2d 1205 (1999). <em>See also Vance, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\">. Hoffman did not object to any of these instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">. In criminal cases, under Rule 4-325(e), a party must object to the giving or failure to give an instruction to preserve the issue for appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b350-11\">. We note that courts in other jurisdictions have expressly held that even when the elements of a fraud claim must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, or its equivalent, damages need only be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Johnson v. Chesebrough-Pond's USA Co., </em>918 F.Supp. 543, 548 (D.Conn.1996); <em>County of Oakland v. Vista Disposal, Inc., </em>900 F.Supp. 879, 890-91 (E.D.Mich.1995); <em>United Parcel Service v. Rickert, </em>996 S.W.2d 464, 468-69 (Ky. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\">. Irwin and Wood\u2019s argument as to why the three buyers who remained in their homes were not entilled to recover the excess mortgage payments and repair costs is that \u201c[tjhe out-of-pocket test does not provide for recovery of these items.\u201d As mentioned in the text above, however, we do not think that the out-of-pocket test limited the buyers' recovery to only the amount of overvaluation. They also were entitled to other consequential damages resulting from the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">That being said, we are cognizant that, when consequential damages are awarded, they should not represent amounts that are accounted for in the overvaluation award. In the present case, Irwin and Wood did not challenge the economic damages award on the basis that recovery for excess mortgage payments and repair costs were duplicative of the overvaluation award. Instead, they challenged the adequacy of the jury instructions and the propriety of allowing the jury to award costs other than for overvaluation. Therefore, we consider only that specific issue to have been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">We will briefly comment on the propriety of the jury\u2019s awarding damages for the excess mortgage payments, however. First, we see the jury\u2019s award of those amounts as a means for the buyers to recoup the excess interest payments that they made on the inflated loans for the time period from the date of the sale to the date of the judgment. Such an award is consistent with the fact that for the first several years of a mortgage loan the monthly sum that the borrower is paying is close to 100% interest. Thus, there was no duplication of recovery for the overvaluation except for the tiny portion of the excess payments that actually went to principal, which we find would be <em>de minimis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">On the repair costs issue, it is unclear from the transcript whether the repairs made by the buyers were for items that Beeman promised to repair before settlement or repairs that he promised to make post-settlement. This distinction is important because if they were repairs he promised to make beforehand, then they would be included in the overvaluation amount. If they were post-settlement promises to repair, we would treat them as new promises that were separate from the original affirmation of value. Because we cannot tell from the transcript into which category they fit, and because the appellants did not raise this specific issue on appeal, we will not disturb the verdict on that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">. The buyers\u2019 lawyer suggested that each buyer be awarded $200,000 in non-economic damages but further argued that the jurors could award more or less than that figure, and different figures for each buyer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\">. The buyers raise an alternative argument, to which the appellants respond, that, if the evidence were found insufficient to have supported findings of \"actual malice\u201d based on the conduct of Wood and Hoffman, the evidence still could support a finding of \"actual malice\u201d by them based solely on their status as co-conspirators with Beeman. Given our holding, it is not necessary to address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
