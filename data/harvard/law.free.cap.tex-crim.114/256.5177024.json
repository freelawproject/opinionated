Counts two and four charge that the accused killed deceased voluntarily, \u2014 there being therein no allegation that the killing was upon malice aforethought. The verdict of the jury specifically finds appellant guilty under the second count in the indictment. Said count having failed to charge that the murder was with malice aforethought, can not be made the basis for a judgment of conviction carrying with it a penalty greater than five years\u2019 imprisonment in the penitentiary.
