On May 18th the court overruled the motion for new trial, and by order made granted sixty days from that date in which to file bills of exception. By supplemental order made during said sixty days such time was extended twenty-five days. The only bill of exceptions in this record was filed two days after the expiration of the extended time, hence same can not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">The facts in the case seem ample to support the judgment and sentence. On the State\u2019s case appellant was very drunk and was operating his automobile upon a public highway. The jury were justified in their judgment. Same will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
