Appellant was served with a copy of the search warrant at the time the search was made. Appellant offered no testimony on the trial of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-21\">We find no exceptions to the court\u2019s charge. The court adjourned on the 2nd day of March, 1929. Appellant\u2019s bills of exception were filed on the 27th of April, 1929. No extension of time for the filing of the bills was granted by the trial court. Art. 760, Sub-division 5, C. C. P. allows thirty days after the day of adjournment of court for filing bills of exception. There being no order in the record extending the time, and said bills not having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>been filed within thirty days after the adjournment of court, we are compelled to hold they were filed too late.

This order is brought forward. Having been filed in time, the bills of exception are now considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Appellant objected to the testimony of the officers touching the result of the search on the ground that there was not set forth in the affidavit for the search warrant facts and circumstances sufficient to show \u201cprobable cause.\u201d After stating that they had good reason to believe and did believe that intoxicating liquors were being manufactured and sold in appellant\u2019s residence, the affiants made the following statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">\u201cAffiants\u2019 information is based on the fact that they have been informed that within the last thirty days G. R. Smith had containers, instrumentalities and equipment for the purpose of the unlawful sale and manufacture and possession of intoxicating liquor and liquors; that the said G. R. Smith unlawfully has such intoxicating liquors, containers, and instrumentalities for the unlawful manufacture, transportation and sale thereof in his possession and has charge and control of, and is keeping and is interested in keeping the property and premises above described where same are kept, as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">The objection was properly overruled. In Rozner v. State, 3 S. W. (2d) 441, we held that a statement to the effect that the affiants had been informed that about ten days or two weeks prior to the making of the affidavit the accused had fifteen gallons of whiskey in his smokehouse \u201cpresented such a state of affairs that this court would have no right to say as a matter of law that the magistrate has abused his discretion in deciding that probable cause existed for authorizing the warrant to issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">Appellant further objected to the receipt of the testimony of the officers on the ground that it was not shown in the affidavit that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>residence was a place where intoxicating liquor was manufactured or sold. An examination of the affidavit discloses that the affiants averred appellant\u2019s residence was a place where intoxicating liquor was sold and manufactured. Considering the affidavit in its entirety, it would appear that it is clearly shown that appellant was manufacturing intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\">ON SECOND MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b342-9\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Adv\">In view of a defect in the record, the merits of the case could not be passed upon on the original hearing. The record having been perfected, the appellant\u2019s second motion for rehearing is entitled to consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">In a very forceful argument appended to the motion, it is asserted that the validity of the search warrant issued upon the affidavit discussed and partly quoted in the original opinion is in conflict with previous decisions upon the same subject, notably Chapin v. State, 296 S. W. 1095; Veeder v. United States, 252 Fed. 414. Upon the questions raised, this court has, in previous decisions recently rendered, expressed its views in language as 'definite as it is capable of making it, and must of necessity content itself with reference to the cases mentioned. It was there stated that <em>belief </em>on undisclosed information does not show probable cause for a search as that term is used in the State and Federal Constitutions. In a quotation from one of the Federal decisions in Chapin\u2019s case, supra, it is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">\u201cIf the sworn accusation is based on fiction, the accuser must take the chance of punishment for. perjury. Hence the necessity of a sworn statement of facts, because one cannot be convicted of perjury for having a belief, though the belief be utterly unfounded in fact and law.\u201d (Veeder v. United States, 252 F. 414, 164 C. C. A. 338.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">It is the contention of the appellant in substance that the affidavit for the search warrant, to be valid, must contain not only the <em>information </em>which would show \u201cprobable cause\u201d but it must also disclose the <em>source </em>of the information. Such a construction has been rejected by this court in several cases. In Rozner\u2019s case, 3 S. W. (2d) 441, it is said of the affidavit:</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u201cIt recites specifically that affiants had been informed that about 10 days or 2 weeks past appellant had 15 gallons of whisky in his smokehouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">This was held to be a sufficient compliance with the rule stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In Ruhmann\u2019s case, 22 S. W. (2d) 1069, the most recent one published upon the subject, it was said:</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u201cIf we understand appellant\u2019s contention, it is that such averment states no fact, but gives only information which has reached the affiants, without naming the informant, and is only hearsay. Appellant seems to assume that \u2018probable cause\u2019 for the issuance of a search warrant cannot arise from hearsay. We think this is a mistaken view. The definition of probable cause, as found in Landa v. Obert, 45 Tex. 539, which is approved in Chapin v. State, 107 Tex. Cr. R. 477, 296 S. W. 1095, and is in substance the same as other definitions sanctioned by the courts and text-writers, reads as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u201c \u2018A reasonable ground of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious man in the belief that the person accused is guilty of the offense with which he is charged.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">For further elaboration of the views of the court reference is made to the report of the case last mentioned above. The conclusion there stated may be thus summarized: One who swears that he has certain detailed and disclosed information which in fact he does not possess perjures himself. If the information detailed to the magistrate is sufficient, if true, to constitute probable cause, it is for him to determine whether he believes it to be true, and the issuance of the warrant (which implies the belief of the magistrate in the truth of the affiant\u2019s statement), is supported by the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">The motion is overruled..</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
