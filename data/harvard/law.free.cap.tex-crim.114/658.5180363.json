Prior to the search, a witness for the state, according to her testimony, had bought a pint of whiskey and two bottles of beer from appellant and his wife. Appellant did not testify in his own behalf. He placed a witness on the stand who declared that he was present at the time the state\u2019s witness came to appellant\u2019s residence, and that he did not see appellant and his wife sell the witness any whiskey or beer. He further said that he did not see any whiskey in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Appellant opposed the reception of the testimony touching the result of the search on the ground that the affidavit was based upon information and belief. The affidavit does not disclose that the averments therein are based.upon information and belief. The two affiants state in positive terms that appellant was selling intoxicating liquor in his private residence. Where the ultimate fact is stated as a fact, and not merely as upon \u201cinformation and belief,\u201d the magistrate is justified in his conclusion that \u201cprobable cause\u201d existed for issuing the warrant, provided those things stated as facts would, if true, furnish sufficient \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Ware v.
