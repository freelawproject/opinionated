In the absence of a sentence this court is without jurisdiction. The sentence in a felony case is the final judgment in the cause, Arcia v. State, 26 Texas Crim. App. 193, and must be pronounced before an appeal can be prosecuted. Williams v. State, 99 Texas Crim. Rep. 356; Ridge v. State, 96 Texas Crim. Rep. 496; Stanford v. State, 99 Texas Crim. Rep. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-17\">Because of the lack of a sentence the appeal will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-18\">Dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-19\">ON MOTION TO REINSTATE.</p>\n<author id=\"b702-20\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AjPe\">In connection with the motion to reinstate the appeal there is brought before us in a supplemental transcript what is alluded to as the \u201csentence.\u201d It is in fact nothing but the judgment which was entered on the verdict. This judgment was in the original transcript. It is unsatisfactory to deal with a record such as is found in the present case but there is not up to this date anything before us showing in a legal way that sentence was ever pronounced against accused. Under the circumstances we have no option but to let the order dismissing the appeal stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-21\">The motion to reinstate is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-22\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
