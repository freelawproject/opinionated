Caldwell </em>of Mt. Pleasant, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b696-10\"><em>A. A. Dawson </em>of Canton, State\u2019s Attorney, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b696-11\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A6tm\">Conviction for manufacturing intoxicating liquor; punishment, one year in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">The evidence is ample to justify the conclusion of guilt reached by the jury. Appellant was observed engaged in the manufacture of whisky. He had what the witnesses called a complete outfit. Whisky was running from the worm. Appellant was observed to place a jar under said worm. Seventeen and one-half gallons of whisky were found near by.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">The record contains four bills of exception. The first complains of testimony to the effect that appellant had a \u201ccomplete outfit\u201d when discovered by the officers. The bill is qualified by the trial court who calls attention to the fact that witness had already testified that he knew from his own knowledge and experience what it took to constitute a complete outfit. There was no error in admitting the testimony. Bill No. 2 presents a similar complaint to the testimony of another witness who said, \u201cYes sir, I think I know what it takes to constitute a complete outfit for making whisky.\u201d We perceive no error in the admission of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">The testimony showed that appellant\u2019s son was present at the still. We see no objection to the argument of the prosecution in suggesting to the jury that they take this case and give this man such punishment as a \u201cWild cat liquor maker with his boy there training him up deserves.\u201d Bill of exception No. 4 sdts out appellant\u2019s objection to the statement made by the prosecuting' attorney to the effect that the accused bought sugar and meal and carried it over there. The objection was that there was no such, evidence in the case. There is no certificate of the trial court to the bill of exception certifying that this objection had foundation in the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Being unable to agree with any of the contentions of appellant, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b697-6\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b697-7\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AK0\">Appellant complains because we did not discuss an exception to the charge for failure to instruct the jury that the mere presence of appellant at the still was not sufficient upon which to base a conviction. There was no evidence raising any such issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
