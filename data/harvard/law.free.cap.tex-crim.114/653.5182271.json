C. M. Boone and occupied by Bud Boone, and located about two miles and a half northwest of Vera, in Knox County, Texas, together with barns and out-houses, pastures and fields upon said farm. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-17\">We fail to discover any uncertainty in the description. See Odell v. State, 105 Tex. Cr. R. 646, 290 S. W. 164; Watson v. State, 9 S. W. (2d) 265; Hernandez v. State, 4 S. W. (2d) 82. Regarding the second objection; the affidavit is in somewhat different form than the ordinary affidavit for search warrant in that it does not begin with the statement that \u201caffiants believe, etc.\u201d It begins with the positive averment that affiants under oath say that in and upon the residence and premises described appellant was at the \u201cpresent time unlawfully <em>selling </em>and possessing' for the purpose of sale intox<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>icating liquors.\u201d Thus far the averments being positive bring the case within the principle announced in Ware v. State, 7 S. W. (2d) 551; Bird v. State, 7 S. W. (2d) 953; McFarland v. State, 7 S. W. (2d) 955; Staglik v. State, 13 S. W. (2d) 377. Following the positive averment mentioned there appears in the affidavit this recital.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">\u201c* * * That the facts, circumstances and statements mentioned and set out in this affidavit are within the knowledge of affiants true and correct and that affiants obtained their evidence and knowledge of the same as follows: to-wit: The sheriff of Baylor County, Texas, had arrested a party in Baylor County, Texas, charged with possession for the purpose of sale of intoxicating liquor and had secured information - that whisky was on the above described farm and in possession of Bud Boone. Said sheriff advised affiants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">If the foregoing recital qualifies the positive averment theretofore made the affidavit still appears sufficient under the following authorities. Rozner v. State, 109 Tex. Cr. R. 127, 3 S. W. (2d) 441; Harris v. State, 15 S. W. (2d) 1048; Villareal v. State, 21 S. W. (2d) 739; Ruhman v. State, No. 12,765 (opinion on rehearing January 15, 1930;) Smith v. State, No. 12,706, (opinion on rehearing January 22, 1930). In any event we are of opinion the attack on the affidavit cannot be sustained, and that no error was committed in admitting evidence as to the result of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The facts may be stated briefly as follows: Officers went to appellant\u2019s house shortly before daylight and the search conducted by them revealed a quantity of empty fruit jars in the cellar and some empty pasteboard fruit jar cartons under the bed. The cartons would accommodate six jars. They discovered nothing in the search of the barn or lot. After the officers had made this first fruitless search appellant asked and obtained permission to go milk his cow; he got his bucket and went to the lot. One of the officers watched him and observed that he did not stop at the lot but set his bucket down, crawled through the fence and went some eight or ten rows into a field. Here he started doing something and the officer\u2019s attention was attracted by sounds of breaking glass. He immediately started to appellant who was seen by the officer to break twelve jars which had contained whisky; he had already broken six others before the officer got near enough to see exactly what appellant was doing. When the officer reached appellant he said he supposed he had done wrong and said a number of times that all they had him for was destroying the evidence. The sheriff said to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>pellant, .\u201cYes, some fellows drink it up, but you have destroyed it;\u201d to which appellant replied, \u201cSome people are able to work, but I am not a strong man, though I look like one, and it is the only way I have to make a living, but I am going to quit fooling with it any more.\u201d The sheriff gathered up a small quantity of whisky and placed it in a fruit jar and set the jar in the automobile. When they started to town with appellant he reached back and got this jar and poured the\" whisky out.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Bills of exception bring forward complaint because the court admitted evidence that appellant broke the fruit jars containing the whisky, and poured out the small quantity salvaged by the sheriffs, and of appellant\u2019s statement made to the officers on the ground that these things occurred while appellant was under arrest. That appellant\u2019s conduct was provable against him under the circumstances stated seems clear. Klein v. State, 102 Tex. Cr. R. 256, 277 S. W. 1074; Kelly v. State, 102 Tex. Cr. R. 395, 278 S. W. 449; Carrell v. State, 3 S. W. (2d) 435; Wright v. State, 13 S. W. (2d) 111. Some of appellant\u2019s statements were contemporaneous with his conduct and explanatory thereof, and all of them seem to fall within the rule of res gestae. Appellant relies on Calloway v. State, 15 S. W. (2d) 13; Glover v. State, 247 S. W. 556; and Harris v. State, 10 S. W. (2d) 551 as supporting his position. The facts which were dealt with in those cases are thought to make them inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b680-9\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai1N\">The original opinion of the court is criticized for the use of the word \u201cfruitless\u201d in discussing the fact that in the first part of their search the officers found in appellant\u2019s dwelling house practically nothing deemed of any great consequence, and especially in view of what was later found. It appears true, as stated by one of the officers, that in their search of the house they found \u201ca little wine\u201d in the kitchen by the stove. We deem the use of the word \u201cfruitless\u201d of no materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">The officers reached appellant\u2019s house before day, and as soon as it was light enough to permit, they informed him of their purpose, and began searching his house, out-buildings, etc. During the progress of this search appellant asked if he would be permitted to go and milk his cows. Evidently from the record this occurred soon after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>daylight came. The facts subsequently developed are set out in the original opinion. We think the fact that there was in appellant\u2019s possession and in his field, something like one hundred yards from his house, three cartons of whiskey, amply sufficient to justify the conclusion of guilt reached by the jury. We think it no violation of the rule of res gestae for the officers to give testimony as to what was done and said by appellant in regard to and in connection with his breaking the cartons of whisky after the search had begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
