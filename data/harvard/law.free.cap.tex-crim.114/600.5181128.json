The indictment was returned on-February 23, 1929. Appellant was arrested on the same day. The case was called for trial on the tenth day of June, 1929, at which time appellant filed his first application for a continuance. He averred in the application that he caused a subpoena to be issued by the district clerk of Hill County \u201ccommanding him to summon\u201d Frank Baker to appear as a witness in appellant\u2019s behalf on the tenth of June, 1929. It is not shown in the application that the subpoena was directed to the sheriff of Falls County, the alleged residence of the witness. It is not shown what became of the process, in whose hands it was placed, and when. It is not shown whether it was served and when it was returned. It appears that appellant waited from the twenty-third of February, 1929, until the twenty-seventh of May in the same year to file his application for process for the witness. No excuse for such delay was offered. The burden was on appellant to establish the exercise of diligence in support of his application for a continuance.
