This horse had a gap broken off its left fore foot which caused it to make a distinctive track. Prosecuting witness left appellant at his home and on his return two of his horses had been shot, one of which died. Appellant had a dog following him. Witness and the Sheriff of the County took up the track of the horse ridden by appellant and followed a chain of tracks which appeared to be accompanied by a dog to where the horses were wounded and from thence to appellant\u2019s home. A-witness nearby heard some shots and heard</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>a voice which he recognized as that of appellant calling a dog. The voice came from the direction of the shots and only a short distance away. Ill feeling was shown to exist between appellant and the owner of the horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The only question presented is the alleged insufficiency of the evidence. This we deem sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
