The first arises in the following manner. The confession of appellant was introduced by the state. It is claimed that contained therein are exculpatory statements, and that the state failed to discharge the burden of showing them to have been untrue; the second question arises upon the argument of the prosecuting attorney. Appellant is a negro, as was also deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-18\">According to the confession, appellant had known deceased about five months during which time they had been living together. Appellant admits that he shot her to death with a shot gun in Freestone County, on the evening of February 11th, 1928, about four p. m. The confession is lengthy; several pages of it deals with the vicissitudes of appellant and deceased during the five months they lived together, their differences, deceased\u2019s belligerent attitude at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>times towards appellant and towards their employers, about deceased leaving home and returning, sometimes over appellant\u2019s protest, her threats toward him, etc. We here set out that part of the confession relating to the occurrences on the day of the homicide, and which contains the exculpatory statements:</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">\u2018T stayed around the house until 11:30 or 12:00 o\u2019clock, and got my shot gun and told her I was going down in the bottom to kill a rabbit. I told her I might be back directly, it might be 2 hours and it might be night and she said all right. * * * I killed a rabbit and went back to the house about 1 or 2 o\u2019clock, and nobody was there. \u2018I skinned my rabbit and sat around there a little while, and she did not come, and I went in there and got my gun and lit out down the road. I was going looking for her, I carried my gun because I thought maybe Elizabeth and her man had got her again and they might try to do something to me. But when I found her, they were not with her. She was at Doc\u2019s. She was standing up in the floor talking when I got to Doc Hall\u2019s house, she had three eggs. Doc spoke when I went in, she didn\u2019t say nothing. I wasn\u2019t there a minute when she said, T reckon I better go.\u2019 Doc Hall said, \u2018Ain\u2019t no need of you hurrying.\u2019 She said, T am not hurrying, but I reckon I had better get on back to the shack.\u2019 She also told him, \u2018When I get a dime, I will pay you for the eggs.\u2019 We left Doc\u2019s house together and we went about 20 steps, and she said, T thought you had gone to kill a rabbit,\u2019 and I said T did.\u2019 She said, \u2018Where is the rabbit ?\u2019 I said, \u2018It\u2019s at home.\u2019 She said, \u2018Hell, I bet you ain\u2019t seed a rabbit, I bet you been around over here somewhere,\u2019 and one word brought on another, and when we got opposite Mr. Noah Martin\u2019s house, she was cursing. I told her not to be cursing near Mr. Martin\u2019s house. She said she did not give a God-damn for me or the white folks at the house either. I said, \u2018All right, it is a day coming that you will care.\u2019 She said, \u2018There was no day coming and that I or nobody else was going to do anything to her.\u2019 Then said, \u2018Well, I am going to tell you, you or me one are going to die and go to hell twixt now and sundown, I betcher,\u2019 and she said, T guess you did not hear me.\u2019 She had two eggs in one hand and one egg in the other hand and her arms folded, and she began to walk faster and her arms were down by her side and I didn\u2019t know but what she had got a razor. She was about 12 or 15 steps from me when I fired. * * * When I fired she said, \u2018Lord, have mercy,\u2019 and throwed up her hands. When I first looked back she was kinder standing up, and the next time I looked back she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>rolling over and over. I could hear her groaning way down the road. I shot her because she said she was going to kill me. I shot her to keep her from killing me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Two witnesses met appellant in the road within two hundred yards of the place of the killing. They.asked appellant what he was doing with a gun that time of evening, and appellant replied that he had gone up to Dock Hall\u2019s after deceased, and upon being asked where she was, according to one witness, replied: \u201cShe is up there in the road, on the right hand side of the road where I shot hell out of her and drug her out of the road;\u201d the other witness\u2019 version of what was said by appellant is in substance the same but couched in more obscene language. Appellant made no claim to these parties that he was in fear of his life when he killed deceased. When deceased\u2019s body was picked up to place it in a wagon a razor fell from somewhere about her clothing. It may. be admitted that evidence introduced by appellant strongly suggested, if it did not establish, that deceased bore the reputation of a dangerous woman, and one who.would likely carry out a threat. This may account for the small punishment assessed against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The only exculpatory statements in the confession are those in which appellant claims that deceased said she or appellant would die and go to hell before sun down, that he did not \u201cknow but what she had got a razor;\u201d that he shot her because she said she was going to kill him, and that he shot her to keep her from killing him. It is true the state is bound by exculpatory statements in a confession introduced by the state unless the exculpatory statements are shown to be untrue; but other parts of the confession may be looked to for that very purpose. We quote from Nichols v. State, 10 S. W. (2d) 109:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">\u201cWhile the state is bound by the whole confession, this certainly could not mean an inhibition against the state\u2019s counsel analyzing the entire statement to determine whether the exculpatory portion is reasonable in the light of other facts contained in such statement. In other words, while bound by the exculpatory statement, unless proven false, the state may properly point to other portions of the admitted confession which tend to prove the falsity of the defensive matter set out in such confession. Being bound by the statement does not mean being restricted to the appellant\u2019s interpretation of same. The exculpatory portions of the statement, may, we think, be disproved as well by other portions of the same statement as by independent testimony. The statement as a whole may furnish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>sufficient proof of the falsity of the exculpatory matters contained therein, * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\">Appellant did not testify. No claim was made on the trial or in the confession that appellant saw deceased with a razor at the time she was killed, he just \u201cdidn\u2019t know but what she had\u201d one; she had two eggs in one hand, and one egg in the other and was thirty-five or forty feet from him when he fired. There is no claim that appellant was advancing on him in a threatening manner with a razor. In our opinion the confession itself overturns completely the weak exculpatory statements, without reference to what appellant told the two witnesses whom he met a short distance down the road after the killing. There is no complaint of the court\u2019s charge upon the subject. The jury was fully warranted in finding that the exculpatory statements had been shown to be untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">It does not appear that appellant asked for a continuance, but he put in' evidence an attachment to Leon County for Will Lacy, which attachment as it appears in the record shows no return by the officer. Mr. Dawson testified for appellant that while appellant and deceased were living on his place in Leon County he heard a disturbance in the servants\u2019 house, and upon going there found deceased with a razor or knife trying to get to appellant and a negro named \u201cWill Lacy or Will Ellis or something like that\u201d was between them. During his closing argument the prosecuting attorney said:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">\u201cI don\u2019t believe there is such a negro in existence as Will Lacy. This is not the first time I have seen a defendant issue a process for a witness that could not be found in order to secure an acquittal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Appellant objected to the argument on the ground that there was no evidence in the record indicating that the witness, Will Lacy, was not in existence. Mr. Dawson, who referred to the witness in question seems to have been uncertain himself as to what the witness\u2019 name was, whether Lacy or Ellis. Under the circumstances a part of the district attorney\u2019s statement seems not very far afield. The other part, we think, does not present sufficient reason for reversal under the facts of this case. Dawson seems to have testified to everything the absent witness \u2014 whatever his name \u2014 could swear to. If the jury believed Dawson the district attorney\u2019s argument tended to re-act against the state rather than against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
