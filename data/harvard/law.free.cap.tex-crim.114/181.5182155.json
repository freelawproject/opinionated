The testimony seems amply sufficient. Officers met appellant on a public road, and testified that he had in his truck a gallon of whiskey. Appellant\u2019s only defense was that the whisky belonged to a negro who had asked him to let him ride. He said when they met the officers the negro jumped off the truck and ran. The officers testified that they had on plain clothes when they met appellant, and that no one jumped from the truck and ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-16\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-17\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
