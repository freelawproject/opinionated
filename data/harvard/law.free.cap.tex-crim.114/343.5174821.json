It is stated therein that appellant stands charged with and has been convicted of the offense of driving a car while intoxicated. Unless the motor vehicle be driven in a place prohibited by the statute, while the driver is intoxicated, the law is not offended against. Hence one of the important elements of the offense defined by the statute is omitted. Art. 802, P. C.; McFadden v. State, 300 S.

The State\u2019s proof showed appellant to have been drunk on the occasion referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">There was no proof that appellant drove a car on any highway east of the town of Breckenridge. In making out the' case plead by the allegations in the third count, viz.: that Breckenridge was an incorporated city, the State was allowed to introduce copies of certified copies of instruments entered on pages 65 to 71 inclusive in a book called \u201cOrdinance Book No. One of the City of Breckenridge.\u201d By various bills of exception complaint was made of the introduction of each such copy. We are cited to no authority by the State and know of none' justifying the introduction of this testimony. A copy, although a certified copy of a copy, which latter is also a certified copy of an original recorded instrument or minute entry in court records, does not thus become authorized as proper to be introduced in evidence to prove the facts set out in such copy, or the original recorded instrument or minute entry. The original instruments, or certified copies thereof duly filed and of which proper notice is given, might be used to make the proof referred to, or same might be made in other ways under certain circumstances. Ex parte Drake, 55 Texas Crim. Rep. 233. See Civil Statutes regulating introduction of proof of contents of recorded instruments. In no other way was proof made in this case that the City of Breckenridge was an incorporated city. This being a descriptive allegation in the count of the indictment under which conviction was had, it would seem necessary to prove same in some way. The State having failed to make out its case for lack of such proof, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
