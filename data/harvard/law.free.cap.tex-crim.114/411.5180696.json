'</p>\n<p id=\"b435-18\">An assault becomes aggravated when committed by an <em>adult </em>male upon the person of a female. (Art. 1147, P. C., Subd. 5.) The complaint averred that appellant was a \u201cmale person,\u201d and that he committed an assault upon Estell Prock who was a female. Having omitted to aver that appellant was an \u201cadult\u201d male the complaint charged a simple assault only. The information charged an assault but averred that appellant was an \u201cadult\u201d male and that he committed an assault upon Estell Prock,. a female. Furthermore, the information alleged the date of the offense to have been on or about October 3d, 1929, but it was filed in court on January 28th, 1929, which was eight months before the offense was alleged to have been committed. One of the indispensable requisites of an information is that the time mentioned therein as the date of the offense be \u201csome date anterior to the filing of the information.\u201d (Art. 414, C. C. P., Subd. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The variance between the complaint and information and the defect as to \u201ctime\u201d mentioned in the information were raised and called to the trial court\u2019s attention in various ways, but appellant\u2019s complaints were in every instance overruled. Upon the question of variance many cases are found collated in Note 6, under Art. 415, Vernon\u2019s Texas C. C. P., Vol. 1, and upon the question of \u201ctime\u201d many are. collated under Note 10, same article and volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Under the record presented this court has no option but to reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"APd\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
