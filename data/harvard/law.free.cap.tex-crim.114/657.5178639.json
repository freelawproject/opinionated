Appellant made a motion to quash on the ground that it appeared upon the face of the information that the offense had been committed subsequent to the date upon which said information was filed. The motion should have been sustained. The statute requires that the time of the commission of the offense be some date anterior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>filing of the information. Art. 414, C. C. P. This requisite must be apparent from the information itself. The complaint upon which the information is filed cannot be resorted to to supply it. Kennedy v. State, 3 S.
