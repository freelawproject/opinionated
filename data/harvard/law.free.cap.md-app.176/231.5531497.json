After an investigation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Board brought charges against appellant. A hearing followed, at the conclusion of which the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued a proposed decision finding appellant guilty of \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine,\u201d in violation of Maryland Code (1981, 2005 Repl.Vol., 2006 Supp.) \u00a7 14-404(a)(3) of the Health Occupations Article (\u201cH.O.\u201d). She recommended that appellant\u2019s license b e revoked, that he be prohibited for a maximum of three years from applying for reinstatement, and that he be fined $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Adopting the ALJ\u2019s \u201cfindings,\u201d the Board concluded that appellant had violated H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(3), but declined to find that he \u201clack[ed] the good moral character necessary for the Board to approve reinstatement of his license.\u201d It therefore imposed a lesser sanction. It ordered, among other things, that appellant be placed on probation for a minimum of two years and fined $5,000, but indicated that its decision would not be \u201ca bar to reinstatement of his license on moral character grounds____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">After the Circuit Court for Montgomery County affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, appellant noted an appeal, claiming:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">I. The Board did not recognize and apply the correct principles of law in finding it had jurisdiction to adjudicate and impose sanctions upon Dr. Salerian based on the complaint filed by the Attorney General.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">II.

The Board did not apply the law correctly in finding that a forensic evaluation is the practice of medicine and, further, the facts were not substantial to determine that Dr. Salerian was conducting a forensic evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">IV. The Board did not recognize and apply the correct principles of law in finding that the conduct alleged to be unethical occurred in the practice of medicine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">V. The Board did not have substantial evidence to find that Dr. Salerian\u2019s conduct was immoral and unprofessional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>in the practice of medicine and the Board failed to apply the correct principles of law in finding that Dr. Salerian was in violation of the immoral and unprofessional conduct provision of the Maryland Practice [Act].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">VI. The Board failed to recognize and apply the correct principles of law regarding the fairness and due process to be accorded Dr. Salerian in the conduct of the hearing including the acceptance of testimony not given under oath, testimony not given under a proper oath, testimony not subject to full and complete cross-examination, refusal to allow depositions of [Evaluee] to be taken, refusal to allow the substitution of a witness on the issue of confidentiality, and not advising counsel that a decision to admit the testimony of [Evaluee] had been allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">VII. The Board failed to recognize and apply the correct principles of law in finding that Dr. Salerian was an agent of Plato Caeheris. [Evaluee\u2019s former attorney.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">VIII. The Board failed to recognize and apply the correct principles of law in determining that the moral imperative exception to confidentiality was not justifiable in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">IX.

The Board did not correctly apply the principles of law when admitting the investigatory file in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">In February 2001, appellant wrote to attorney Plato Cacheris, who was then counsel for Evaluee, a former FBI employee charged with espionage. Appellant was eventually engaged by Caeheris, but, according to Caeheris, only for the limited purpose of performing a forensic psychiatric evaluation of Evaluee. He was to determine if Evaluee was competent to stand trial and whether a psychiatric defense was available. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Cacheris warned appellant that he was only authorized to disclose to the media that he had been engaged by the defense and nothing further.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Because of the \u201cnational security interests\u201d that were involved in Evaluee\u2019s case, in March 2001, the United States Attorney General imposed \u201cSpecial Administrative Measures\u201d (SAM) of confinement on Evaluee \u201cto prevent disclosure of classified information.\u201d The SAM restricted Evaluee\u2019s access to the media, mail, visitors, the telephone, and even limited his ability to communicate with his attorney. It further provided that only \u201cthe inmate\u2019s attorney, and not ... the attorney\u2019s staff\u2019 would be permitted to \u201cdisseminate the contents of the inmate\u2019s communications to third parties\u201d and then, \u201cfor the sole purpose of preparing the inmate\u2019s defense \u2014 and not for any other reason____\u201d Appellant signed a \u201cPhysician\u2019s Affirmation\u201d stating that he had \u201creceived and read\u201d the SAM conditions, and furthermore, that he was \u201cthe physician retained by defense counsel.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Appellant visited Evaluee in prison seven days in late April and early May, for a total of ten hours and fifty minutes. According to appellant\u2019s notes, Evaluee disclosed to appellant what the Board described as his \u201clong history of sexual betrayal and exploitation\u201d of his wife,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which Evaluee had not, up til then, revealed to his wife. On May 4, 2001, appellant wrote a letter to Cacheris suggesting that Evaluee would benefit from pharmacotherapy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One day later, appellant visited Evaluee and wrote him a prescription for <em>Paxil, </em>a medication for depression and anxiety.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">On May 11, 2001, appellant disclosed to Cacheris what Evaluee had told him about his \u201csexual exploitation\u201d of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>wife. Cacheris instructed appellant not to reveal this information to anyone, including Evaluee\u2019s wife. Yet, one day later, appellant disclosed Evaluee\u2019s sexual activities to Evaluee\u2019s wife. He did so, appellant explained in a letter to Cacheris, to \u201cengender enhanced understanding and reconeilment [sic] between [Evaluee] and his wife.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Four days later, on May 16, 2001, Cacheris wrote appellant a letter stating that Cacheris and the defense team had \u201cpermitted [appellant] to state publicly that [he] ha[d] been engaged by [the defense]\u201d but reminding him that he \u201cha[d] also stated that [appellant] [was] not to disclose any confidences.\u201d \u201c[E]verything,\u201d he instructed appellant, \u201cfalls within the attorney/client privilege and is not to be disclosed.\u201d He then \u201csuggested]\u201d that appellant have \u201cno further contact\u201d with Evaluee and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The next day, May 17, 2001, Cacheris met with appellant and gave him a letter terminating his services. The letter further instructed appellant that \u201call privileges and confidences remain intact and are inviolate,\u201d and \u201cnot ... to discuss this matter with any other persons.\u201d That same day, Evaluee himself wrote a letter to appellant, asserting that he \u201cno longer wish[ed]\u201d appellant \u201cto provide [him] with psychiatric services\u201d and specifically instructing appellant \u201cnot to discuss this case or conversations you have had with me with anyone other than my attorneys.\u201d He concluded the letter by stating, \u201cI am specifically forbidding you from discussing my case with any members of my family and certainly with anyone outside the family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The next day, appellant wrote a letter to Cacheris \u201csummariz[ing] [his] medical/psychiatric recommendations for [Evaluee],\u201d including his opinion that Evaluee \u201cresponded very well to Paxil____\u201d Three days later, on May 21, 2001, appellant sent a letter to Cacheris, in which he stated that he \u201csaw [himself] as a member of the [defense] team as soon as [he] began working\u201d with Cacheris. He explained his disclosure of Evaluee\u2019s sexual activities to Evaluee\u2019s wife by stating that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>felt Evaluee could \u201cbetter participate in his defense\u201d if he was not \u201cshackled by [the] guilt\u201d of what he had done to his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">A week later, on May 30, 2001, appellant sent Cacheris the \u201cpsychiatric evaluation\u201d of Evaluee that he had been engaged by Cacheris to perform. The evaluation concluded that Evaluee had been \u201csuffering from several psychiatric disorders\u201d and that there was \u201cstrong evidence for a possible insanity defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On June 12, 2001, Cacheris wrote to appellant, informing him that a producer for \u201cSixty Minutes\u201d told Cacheris that appellant \u201chad discussions with him concerning confidential matters involving [Evaluee].\u201d Cacheris again warned appellant that appellant was \u201cnot permitted to disclose to anybody communications [he] may have had with [Evaluee] and members of his family\u201d and that \u201cany such disclosures will be violative of the attorney/client privilege and [appellant\u2019s] own canons of medical ethics prohibiting disclosures,\u201d and, furthermore, he reminded appellant that appellant signed the United States government\u2019s \u201cSpecial Administrative Measures,\u201d which \u201cprohibit public disclosures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Evaluee also sent a letter to appellant, dated June 21, 2001, confirming \u201cagain\u201d that he had not authorized appellant \u201cto speak to anyone about [Evaluee] or [Evaluee\u2019s] case.\u201d Nonetheless, on numerous occasions appellant discussed Evaluee\u2019s psychological state with the media, which resulted in the publication of Evaluee\u2019s confidential statements to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Board Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">On September 13, 2001, the Board received a complaint about appellant from the attorneys for Evaluee and his wife, alleging that appellant \u201cwas retained by [Evaluee\u2019s] legal defense team to perform a forensic evaluation on [Evaluee]\u201d and that appellant had \u201cdisclosed confidential and privileged information without proper authorization.\u201d On November 21, 2001, the Board reviewed the case at its weekly review panel, which is a panel that reviews complaints \u201cin light of the preliminary investigation\u201d to decide if \u201cfurther investigation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>is necessary. COMAR 10.32.02.03.A(2). After reviewing the complaint about appellant, the panel directed further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">On September 30, 2001, appellant\u2019s license to practice medicine in Maryland expired. A year later, on September 11, 2002, appellant submitted an application for reinstatement of his medical license to the Maryland State Board of Physician Quality Assurance, now the Maryland State Board of Physicians (\u201cBoard\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ultimately, the Board sent appellant a notice informing him of its intent to deny his \u201capplication for reinstatement of medical license\u201d under the Maryland Medical Practice Act, H.O. \u00a7 14-401 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">It further notified appellant that the Board was charging him with \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine,\u201d in violation of H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(3). The Board stated that appellant\u2019s conduct violated the \u201cethics of forensic psychiatry\u201d because, among other things, he purportedly \u201centered into a treatment relationship with the Evaluee,\u201d \u201cviolated attorney-client and physician-patient confidentiality in the forensic setting,\u201d and \u201cattempted to exploit, manipulate and coerce the Evaluee and the Evaluee\u2019s wife.... \u201d The notice further notified appellant that a hearing in this matter had been scheduled at the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d), as well as a \u201ccase resolution conference\u201d and a \u201cprehearing conference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In July 2003, appellant sent a letter to the Board asking it to withdraw his license application. The Board responded by informing appellant that an applicant cannot withdraw an application while charges are pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">ALJ Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The issues before the ALJ were, as she put it, whether appellant \u201cengaged in immoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of [H.O.] \u00a7 14-404(a)(3),\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>and whether appellant\u2019s \u201c[application for [reinstatement maybe denied for such violations under [H.O.] \u00a7 14-205, and for not being of good moral character conduct in violation of [H.O.] \u00a7 14-307.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">By the time the hearing was conducted, Evaluee had been convicted of espionage and was serving a life sentence in a federal prison in Colorado. Because of the restrictions imposed by his detention, he had to testify by telephone. At that time, he testified that he had agreed to let appellant disclose his sexual activities to his wife because appellant had told him that that information was already \u201cin the hands of the media and would be revealed in the news media and that ... he thought it would be better that she not hear it from the news media but that [appellant] were there and related it----\u201d Since he was not allowed to have any contact with the news media, he believed appellant\u2019s representation that the media was ready to publish this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">At the hearings, the Board and appellant presented expert witnesses: Jeffrey S. Janofsky, M.D., testified for the Board and James R. Merikangas, M.D., testified for appellant. Both experts, the ALJ found, \u201cagreed that psychiatrists are bound by the ethical standards set out in:\u201d the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law\u2019s Ethical Values in the Practice of Forensic Psychiatry (\u201cAAPL\u201d), American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics, and the American Medical Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Dr. Janofsky testified that forensic psychiatry is a subspecialty of psychiatry. But, in forensic psychiatry, he noted, the forensic evaluator is \u201cretained\u201d by the defense attorney and so he must follow that attorney\u2019s instructions. The forensic evaluator, he explained, \u201cget[s] access to the defendant through the defense attorney [and is] instructed to answer the question by him and ... send the information back to that defense attorney, and he\u2019s the one who ... decides whether that information will go forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">He asserted that, when performing a forensic psychiatric evaluation, in contrast to standard psychiatric treatment, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>forensic evaluator is not to treat the evaluee for psychiatric problems. His duty is only to make an objective diagnosis for the defense team within a legal context. Consequently, according to Janofsky, appellant\u2019s prescribing of medication for Evaluee was \u201cabsolutely ... inappropriate,\u201d his disclosures to the media were a \u201cgross breach of professionalism,\u201d and his revelation of Evaluee\u2019s sexual activities to Evaluee\u2019s wife was \u201ca truly grotesque violation of forensic practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In reply, appellant called to the stand James R. Merikangas, M.D. Dr. Merikangas, a psychiatrist, testified that appellant\u2019s activities did not occur \u201cin the practice of medicine\u201d because forensic psychiatry is not the practice of medicine. He explained that the purpose of the \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d is to treat a patient, and that is not the purpose of forensic psychiatry. He further stated that appellant was not engaged as a forensic evaluator because he \u201cdid not conduct and produce a report of the depth and type that is generally produced by forensic evaluators,\u201d nor was appellant treating Evaluee. Rather, according to Merikangas, appellant was conducting a \u201ccrisis management or an investigation as to what might be done\u201d and therefore did not have a \u201cconfidential relationship\u201d with Evaluee.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Appellant testified that he had \u201cnever promised to be a forensic psychiatrist to Plato Cacheris or anybody\u201d and that he was to serve as the \u201ccrisis expert\u201d or the \u201ccrisis doctor\u201d for the defense, pointing out that he had previously performed such work for Cacheris. Appellant opined that he had an ethical duty to disclose the information Evaluee had conveyed to him to inform the public that the FBI had failed Evaluee by not taking Evaluee\u2019s \u201cpsychological behaviorial\u201d incidents seriously; and that the Catholic institution, Opus Dei, of which Evaluee was a member, had failed Evaluee by not persuading Evaluee to \u201cturn himself in\u201d after Evaluee confessed to a priest that he had committed espionage.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Evaluee\u2019s wife testified that appellant \u201cregular[ly]\u201d told her that he \u201cthought that someone, himself, should speak to the media to gain compassion and understanding and get [Evaluee] a lighter sentence.\u201d Because of appellant\u2019s \u201cpersistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>requests for a name\u201d of a reporter he could talk to, she eventually gave him the name of someone she knew \u201coccasionally\u201d wrote for <em>The Washington Times, </em>to \u201cmake [appellant] happy,\u201d but she \u201cknew that [the writer] wouldn\u2019t give [appellant] the time of day\u201d and she had been assured by Cacheris that appellant \u201ccouldn\u2019t talk to the media----\u201d She said she \u201cwasn\u2019t speaking to anybody\u201d about Evaluee\u2019s case. She \u201cdidn\u2019t permit [her] attorney to and [she] didn\u2019t want any of [her friends]\u201d to speak about it, and that \u201ceveryone who knew [her] kn[e]w [ ] that [she] did not want anybody speaking on [her] behalf or his behalf at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The ALJ issued her proposed decision on April 2, 2004. Opining that appellant was not \u201ca credible witness,\u201d she found that appellant was engaged to conduct a forensic psychiatric evaluation of Evaluee and therefore had violated H.O. \u00a7\u00a7 14-307 and 404(a)(3) by revealing confidential information he had obtained from Evaluee in the course of conducting that evaluation. She found that appellant disclosed Evaluee\u2019s confidential information to the \u201cnational and international press and media on multiple occasions, including CBS Evening News, the Associated Press, the BBC, The Washington Post, USA Today, and Sixty Minutes.\u201d She proposed (1) that appellant\u2019s \u201clicense to practice medicine in Maryland be revoked;\u201d (2) that \u201chis application for reinstatement be denied;\u201d (3) that he \u201cnot be permitted to apply for reinstatement for a period not to exceed three years, and then only upon demonstration of his rehabilitated moral character;\u201d and (4) that he \u201cpay a monetary penalty not to exceed $20,000.\u201d Appellant filed exceptions to the proposed decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Board\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">On January 4, 2005, the Board issued its final opinion and order, adopting the ALJ\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact\u201d and \u201ccredibility findings\u201d and incorporating by reference the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision into its final opinion and order. It further ordered that appellant\u2019s request to withdraw his application for reinstatement be denied, that he be reprimanded, that he be fined $5,000, and that he be placed on probation for a \u201cminimum of two years, with no early termination of probation.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>probation period was not to expire until appellant \u201csuccessfully completed an ethics course\u201d at his expense. The Board stated that appellant\u2019s unprofessional conduct \u201cwill not act as a bar to reinstatement of his license on moral character grounds\u201d and that he would not be precluded from seeking reinstatement to the practice of medicine in Maryland. That decision was thereafter affirmed by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u201cIn reviewing a decision of an administrative agency, our role \u2018is precisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grand Bel Manor Condominium v. Gancayco, </em>167 Md.App. 471, 478, 893 A.2d 1144 (2006) <em>(quoting Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 303-04, 641 A.2d 899 (1994)).

On the other hand, had the investigation begun before his license expired, his license would not have lapsed, as he maintains, on September 30, 2001, because H.O. \u00a7 14-403(a) provides that a \u201clicense, certification, or registration [may not] lapse by operation of law while the individual is under investigation or while charges are pending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Although the Board\u2019s investigative summary says that appellant\u2019s case was \u201creviewed\u201d at the Weekly Review Panel on November 21, 2001 and \u201copen[ed] for investigation,\u201d a preliminary investigation of appellant was actually begun on September 13, 2001,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> when the Board received the complaint. In fact, it is not the Panel\u2019s task to begin an investigation but, according to COMAR 10.32.02.03.A(2), to review a complaint \u201cin light of the preliminary investigation\u201d and to decide if \u201cfurther investigation\u201d is necessary. COMAR 10.32.02.03.-A(2). Since the investigation of appellant began on September 13, 2001, when the Board received the complaint about him, seventeen days before his license was due to expire on September 30, 2001, his license did not lapse on that date and the Board had jurisdiction to sanction him in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Appellant next argues that the Board erred in finding that the term \u201cunprofessional conduct,\u201d as used in H.O. 14-404(a)(3), and as alleged in the charging document, is not void <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>for vagueness. The Court of Appeals in <em>Finucan v. Maryland Board of Physician Quality Assurance, </em>380 Md. 577, 846 A.2d 377 (2004), addressed this very issue. In that case, Finucan, a physician, \u201cengaged in a series of inappropriate sexual relationships with at least three of his female patients while he was acting in his capacity as their treating physician.\u201d <em>Id., </em>380 Md. at 587, 846 A.2d 377. The Board found that Finuean\u2019s behavior was \u201cunprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine\u201d under H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(3), and it recommended that his license be revoked. <em>Id. </em>at 586-87, 846 A.2d 377. The circuit court agreed, and this matter wound its way up to the Court of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 588, 846 A.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Before the Court of Appeals, Finucan claimed that \u201cthe prohibition of \u2018immoral or unprofessional conduct\u2019 contained in Maryland Code (1981, 2000 RepLVol., 2003 Supp.), \u00a7 14-404(a)(3) of the Health Occupations Article [was], on its face, unconstitutionally vague,\u201d because \u201cthe statute does not prohibit explicitly a physician from engaging in sexual relations with patients, nor fairly warn the physician that such conduct falls within its proscription.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591, 846 A.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The Court of Appeals responded with the observation that \u201c[t]erms such as \u2018unprofessional conduct\u2019 generally are sufficiently definite to withstand constitutional scrutiny if they are \u2018susceptible to common understanding by members of the [regulated] profession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593, 846 A.2d 377 (citation omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he meaning of terms such as \u2018immoral conduct,\u2019 \u201d it opined, \u201cis determined by the \u2018common judgment\u2019 of the profession as found by the professional licensing board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cA statute prohibiting \u2018unprofessional conduct\u2019 or \u2018immoral conduct,\u2019 therefore, is not per se unconstitutionally vague,\u201d it explained, because \u201cthe term refers to \u2018conduct which breaches the rules or ethical code of a profession, or conduct which is unbecoming a member in good standing of a profession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Then, pointing out that the record \u201ccontain[ed] evidence that the prohibition against a physician engaging in sex with a current patient is commonly understood within the medical profession,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 594, 846 A.2d 377, the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>concluded that the circuit court did not err in finding that Finucan breached H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(3) by engaging in such a relationship with his patients. <em>Id. </em>at 596, 846 A.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">As in <em>Finucan, </em>the conduct at issue here \u2014 the prohibition against the disclosure of confidential communications \u2014 \u201cis commonly understood within the medical profession.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 594, 846 A.2d 377. The Principles of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (\u201cAMA Guidelines\u201d), which the Board describes as the \u201cethical codes of medicine in general\u201d; The American Psychiatric Society\u2019s Annotations of the AMA Principles of Medical Ethics Especially Applicable to Psychiatry (\u201cPsychiatry Annotations\u201d), which, according to the Board, is the ethical code of \u201cpsychiatry as a specialty branch of medicine\u201d; and The American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law\u2019s Ethical Guidelines for the Practice of Forensic Psychiatry (\u201cAAPL\u201d), which, in the words of the Board, is the ethical code of \u201cforensic psychiatry as a sub-specialty of psychiatry,\u201d contain clear guidelines as to the duty of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The general AMA Guidelines state that a \u201cphysician shall ... safeguard patient confidences within the constraints of the law.\u201d The Psychiatry Annotations state that \u201c[pjsychiatric records, including even the identification of a person as a patient, must be protected with extreme care.\u201d Finally, the AAPL states that \u201c[r]espect for the individual\u2019s right of privacy and the maintenance of confidentiality are major concerns of the psychiatrist performing forensic evaluations.\u201d Furthermore, the Board\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Janofsky, an expert in forensic psychiatry, testified that appellant\u2019s multiple disclosures of Evaluee\u2019s confidential statements violated these ethical standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Appellant nonetheless insists that COMAR 10.32.02. 10 renders H.O. \u00a7 14.404(a)(3) unconstitutionally vague by stating that \u201c[t]he Board may consider the Principles of Ethics of the American Medical Association, but these principles are not binding on the Board.\u201d That statement, appellant asserts, makes it difficult for \u201ca person of ordinary intelligence and experience\u201d to have a \u201creasonable opportunity to know what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ethics or law the Board will be enforcing[.]\u201d Appellant argues that the Board\u2019s reliance on not only the AMA Guidelines, but also on the Psychiatry Annotations and the AAPL in evaluating his conduct, contributed to the vagueness of H.O. \u00a7 14.404(a)(3). To the extent that appellant is arguing that the Psychiatry Annotations and the AAPL should not have been considered by the Board, he has waived that issue on appeal because he did not object to their introduction before the ALJ. We feel compelled to note, however, that even appellant\u2019s expert witness testified that all three canons of medical ethics apply to psychiatrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Appellant\u2019s next argument consists of two claims: that the Board erred \u201cin finding that a forensic evaluation is the practice of medicine,\u201d and that \u201cthe facts were not substantial to determine that Dr. Salerian was conducting a forensic evaluation.\u201d We find no merit to either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Appellant specifically argues that the Board erred in crediting the testimony of the State\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Janofsky, that conducting a forensic evaluation is the practice of medicine, and in rejecting the contrary testimony of appellant\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Merikangas.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In assessing this claim, we are guided by the principle that, \u201c[w]hen two experts offer conflicting opinions, the trier of fact must evaluate the testimony of both experts and decide which opinion, if either, to accept.\u201d <em>Blaker v. State Bd. of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>123 Md.App. 243, 259, 717 A.2d 964 (1998) <em>(citing Quinn v. Quinn, </em>83 Md.App. 460, 470, 575 A.2d 764 (1990)). That is what the Board did here, and there is no basis for finding that it erred in crediting the testimony of Dr. Janofsky as to this issue rather than that of Dr. Merikangas.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Moreover, the AAPL states that \u201c[fjorensic [pjsychiatry is a subspecialty of psychiatry, a medical specialty.\u201d In fact, one cannot be a member of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law without first being a member of the American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Psychiatric Association, a medical association, or its equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">We further observe that the Board\u2019s interpretation of the provisions it administers is entitled to deference. <em>See Gancayco, </em>167 Md.App. at 479, 893 A.2d 1144 (citations omitted). Citing H.O. \u00a7 14-101(0, the Board found that \u201c[diagnosis of an emotional ailment, or a supposed ailment, is defined as the practice of medicine.\u201d In fact, that section defines to \u201c[practice medicine\u201d as \u201cto engage, with or without compensation, in medical: (i) Diagnosis; (ii) Healing; (iii) Treatment; or (iv) Surgery.\u201d H.O. \u00a7 14-101(0- It further \u201cincludes doing, undertaking, professing to do, and attempting any of the following: (i) Diagnosing, healing, treating, preventing, [or] prescribing for.... \u201d H.O. \u00a7 14-101(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Appellant was retained by Cacheris to diagnose Evaluee. In fact, in the report appellant eventually submitted to Cacheris, appellant included some of his opinions under a heading entitled \u201cFINAL DIAGNOSIS.\u201d Thus, we agree with the Board that a forensic evaluation is the practice of medicine. Moreover, appellant gave Evaluee a prescription for Paxil and was thus irrefragably practicing medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Appellant also claims that \u201cthe facts were not substantial to determine that Dr. Salerian was conducting a forensic evaluation.\u201d But he makes this blanket assertion without any supporting argument and thus we shall not address it beyond quoting the Board\u2019s statement that appellant\u2019s argument that he was not performing a forensic evaluation \u201cflies in the face of all of the evidence except his own testimony, which the [ALJ] found not credible both on this point and in general.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Appellant claims that the Board erred \u201cin finding that the conduct alleged to be unethical occurred in the practice of medicine.\u201d Specifically, he maintains that the Board erred in finding that appellant was \u201cpracticing medicine\u201d when he disclosed Evaluee\u2019s confidential information to the media, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>cause appellant was \u201cno longer associated at all with [Cacheris\u2019] team or [Evaluee] ... when [the] disclosures were made.... \u201d He further points out that \u201cDr. Janofsky testified that [Evaluee\u2019s] treatment ended when Dr. Salerian was discharged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Appellant\u2019s ethical duty to maintain Evaluee\u2019s confidences did not end when appellant was terminated from the defense team on May 17, 2001. Dr. Janofsky testified that \u201cin doctor-patient therapeutic relationships, the general standard is that you maintain confidentiality until the patient allows you to release it through consent\u201d and that, in the forensic setting, the \u201cpsychiatrist maintains confidentiality to the extent possible given the legal context.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Yet, appellant breached this duty by not maintaining Evaluee\u2019s confidences after being terminated, even though Cacheris\u2019 letter of May 17, 2001, ending their relationship, clearly warned him that \u201cdisclosure of confidential communications would violate ethical rules and privilege laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Moreover, the Board cited numerous instances of appellant\u2019s unprofessional conduct that occurred while appellant was still engaged by Cacheris to conduct the forensic evaluation of Evaluee. Specifically, appellant \u201cviolated the boundaries of forensic psychiatry by prescribing an antidepressant for the Evaluee\u201d; by \u201cimportuning the Evaluee to authorize him ... to reveal to Evaluee\u2019s wife [Evaluee\u2019s] long history of sexual betrayal and exploitation [of her]\u201d; by \u201ccoerc[ing] the Evaluee\u2019s assent to this disclosure by stating to the Evaluee that the information was going to be printed or aired in the media anyway\u201d; and by \u201cattempt[ing] to obtain Evaluee\u2019s permission to reveal this information to the media.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Finally, to bolster his argument that his disclosures did not occur \u201cin the practice of medicine,\u201d appellant cites <em>McDonnell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>v. Commission on Medical Discipline, </em>301 Md. 426, 483 A.2d 76 (1984). In <em>McDonnell, </em>the Court of Appeals held that a physician that intimidated expert witnesses, who were to testify against him in a malpractice trial, by calling their medical colleagues and communicating to them his \u201cintention of having transcripts of [the witnesses\u2019] depositions disseminated to their local and national medical societies,\u201d <em>McDonnell, </em>301 Md. at 428, 483 A.2d 76, did not engage in that conduct while \u201cin the practice of medicine\u201d because those actions were not \u201cdirectly tied to the physician\u2019s conduct in the actual performance of the practice of medicine, i.e., in the diagnosis, care, or treatment of patients.\u201d <em>McDonnell, </em>301 Md. at 437, 483 A.2d 76. In other words, the doctor\u2019s conduct \u201coccurred during judicial proceedings against him based upon conduct constituting malpractice\u201d but did not occur \u201cin the workplace where he was present for the purpose of practicing medicine.\u201d <em>Cornfeld v. State Board of Physicians, </em>174 Md. App. 456, 475, 921 A.2d 893 (2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Fifteen years later, in <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 729 A.2d 376 (1999), the Court of Appeals upheld the Board\u2019s finding that a hospital physician who, while on duty in the hospital, sexually harassed other hospital employees who were attempting to perform their jobs, was \u201cguilty of immoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76-77, 729 A.2d 376. Relying on <em>Banks, </em>we recently asserted that \u201cthe touchstone for determining whether misconduct occurred \u2018in the practice of medicine\u2019 must be whether it was \u2018sufficiently intertwined with patient care\u2019 to pose a threat to patients or the medical profession.\u201d <em>Cornfeld, </em>174 Md.App. at 474, 921 A.2d 893 <em>(citing Banks, </em>354 Md. at 76-77, 729 A.2d 376).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Appellant\u2019s misconduct was, to be sure, \u201c \u2018sufficiently intertwined with patient care\u2019 to pose a threat to patients or the medical profession.\u201d <em>Cornfeld, </em>174 Md.App. at 474, 921 A.2d 893 <em>(citing Banks, </em>354 Md. at 76-77, 729 A.2d 376). In fact, his conduct was more intertwined with patient care than Banks\u2019s conduct was. Whereas Banks\u2019s conduct was directed at hospital employees and thereby affected the medical profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>sion but not patients themselves, appellant\u2019s acts \u2014 the disclosure of Evaluee\u2019s confidential communications \u2014 directly affected both. Appellant, as we previously noted, was treating Evaluee by prescribing Paxil and his disclosures also posed a threat to the medical profession by having, as the ALJ found, a \u201cchilling effect on patients and potential patients alike\u201d who should be \u201cassured that information divulged to the psychiatrist, whether in the treatment or the forensic setting, will be held in utmost confidence.\u201d Thus, the Board did not err in finding that appellant\u2019s conduct occurred in the practice of medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Appellant contends that the Board did no t have \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to find that his conduct was \u201cimmoral and unprofessional in the practice of medicine\u201d and that he violated the immoral and unprofessional conduct provision of the Maryland Practice Act. Specifically, appellant claims that, although H.O. 14-404(a)(3) alleges \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct,\u201d the State, in its charging document, charged him with \u201cimmoral and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a),(3).\u201d Thus the State had to prove, he asserts, that his conduct was both immoral and unprofessional, instead of simply unprofessional.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument has no merit. He was clearly charged under H.O. 14-404(a)(3), which unequivocally prohibits \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct....\u201d A typographical error in a charging document which otherwise correctly cites the relevant statute under which a doctor is charged is of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Appellant contends that the Board employed various procedures that violated \u201cfairness and due process.\u201d Specifically, he argues: (1) that he sought a pre-trial deposition and/or video deposition of Evaluee and that the ALJ erred in not granting one because it had power to order it by ordering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Administrative Prosecutor to Colorado to attend such a deposition; (2) that Evaluee\u2019s testimony by telephone was \u201cso fraught with problems\u201d that it \u201cdenied [appellant a fair hearing\u201d; (3) that Evaluee was not effectively under oath when he testified by telephone because the ALJ, who administered the oath, was sitting in Maryland and thus had \u201cno statutory power to administer an oath to a person in Colorado\u201d; (4) that his due process rights were violated by the introduction into evidence of the hearsay notes of the Board\u2019s investigator, Carol Palmer; (5) that his due process rights were violated by the ALJ\u2019s admitting into evidence the memo of Catherine Heuer, a former client of Cacheris; and (6) that his hearing was unfair because the ALJ refused to allow appellant to substitute a witness for a Washington Post writer who purportedly would have testified favorably for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">First, appellant argues that the ALJ erred in denying him a pre-trial deposition and/or video deposition of Evaluee, but he cites no authority in support of this position. Discovery in cases before the Board is governed by COMAR 10.32.02.03E.(3) and (4) which permit only limited discovery of such things as witness lists and statements of expert opinions. Beyond that, discovery is not permitted. COMAR 10.32.02.03E(5) (\u201cParties are not entitled to discovery of items other than as listed in \u00a7 E(3) and (4) of this regulation.\u201d). Because \u00a7 E(3) and (4) do not list depositions, the ALJ did not err in denying appellant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In any event, Evaluee testified by phone, which given the security arrangement put in effect by the federal government, was the only way Evaluee could testify at all and appellant had, at that time, the opportunity to cross-examine him.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Second, appellant argues that Evaluee\u2019s testimony by telephone was \u201cso fraught with problems\u201d that it \u201cdenied [appellant a fair hearing.\u201d Evaluee\u2019s telephonic testimony was subject to federal government restrictions. The telephone connection with Evaluee could be sustained only for fifteen minutes at a time, at which point the connection was dropped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>and had to be reconnected. In addition, there were points at which Evaluee could not be heard clearly. After hearing argument on the admissibility of Evaluee\u2019s telephonic testimony, the ALJ ruled that she would not consider it because she did not have the \u201cconfidence that the record would be clear and complete.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">When the Board\u2019s counsel requested that the ALJ reconsider her decision to strike Evaluee\u2019s entire testimony, the ALJ reviewed her notes and the transcript of Evaluee\u2019s testimony. She found that \u201calthough the Evaluee was asked to repeat his responses multiple times throughout, his answers were ultimately repeated, heard, and reported.\u201d She found that appellant had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity to cross examine the Evaluee, via telephone, and had every opportunity to request that the Evaluee repeat his responses to the satisfaction of Counsel.\u201d The AL J reversed her earlier decision and held quite properly that, in accordance with these findings, she would consider the telephonic testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Moreover, Evaluee\u2019s testimony was corroborated by other witnesses who testified in person at the hearing, including Cacheris and Evaluee\u2019s wife, and by documents introduced into evidence, such as Evaluee\u2019s letter instructing appellant not to disclose his confidences. There was thus substantial evidence in the record independent of Evaluee\u2019s telephonic testimony to support the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Third, appellant argues that Evaluee was not effectively under oath when he testified by telephone because the ALJ, who administered the oath, was sitting in Maryland and thus had \u201cno statutory power to administer an oath to a person in Colorado.\u201d Appellant cites no authority in support of this thesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The ALJ ruled that she had the power \u201cto conduct all or part of hearings by telephone\u201d under the Board\u2019s \u201crules of procedure,\u201d that \u201cauthorization carries with it the power for [her] to swear in witnesses that are going to testify by telephone,\u201d and that there is \u201cno limitation under those rules about whether or not the person has to be present in the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>of Maryland in order for the oath to be effective.\u201d We see no error of law in her conclusion. In any case, as we stated earlier, there was substantial evidence in the record to corroborate Evaluee\u2019s testimony that appellant acted unprofessionally in the practice of medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Fourth, appellant argues that his due process rights were violated by the introduction into evidence of the notes of the Board\u2019s investigator, Carol Palmer, who accompanied the administrative prosecutor to a meeting with Evaluee while he was incarcerated in Virginia. He argues that the notes were hearsay. But \u201cit is well settled in Maryland that hearsay evidence is admissible into evidence at administrative hearings.\u201d <em>Eichberg v. Maryland Bd. of Pharmacy, </em>50 Md. App. 189, 193, 436 A.2d 525 (1981). Furthermore, appellant cross-examined Palmer about the notes, and he also cross-examined Evaluee, who purportedly made the statements contained in the notes. Appellant\u2019s argument is therefore unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Fifth, appellant claims that his due process rights were violated by the ALJ\u2019s admitting into evidence the memo of Catherine Heuer, a former client of Cacheris, who called him apparently to complain about appellant. He argues that he could not properly cross-examine Heuer because he had represented her in the past on another matter. However, Heuer was not on the witness stand; Cacheris was, attempting to speak about a conversation he had with Heuer in which she told him appellant had disclosed to her information about Evaluee. In any event, as the Board notes, Heuer\u2019s allegation against appellant \u201cplayed no role in the ALJ\u2019s or the Board\u2019s decision.\u201d The Board specifically found that appellant\u2019s disclosure of Evaluee\u2019s mental state to Heuer, though \u201csignificant,\u201d did not \u201chave any effect on the Board\u2019s ultimate conclusion, or on the sanction.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Sixth, appellant argues that his hearing was unfair because the ALJ refused to allow appellant to \u201csubstitute one witness\u201d with a Washington Post writer. Before the ALJ, appellant proffered that the reporter in question contacted appellant for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>material on Evaluee and that appellant refused to provide any information beyond the fact that he was involved as a forensic evaluator. It is difficult to see how this testimony is of any material consequence as appellant further proffered that the reporter would testify that this phone call occurred before Evaluee purportedly gave appellant his consent to disclose information to the media.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Moreover, as we previously noted, there was ample evidence that appellant had been instructed by Cacheris and Evaluee not to disclose any information to the media except to inform them that he had been engaged by the defense. And Dr. Janofsky opined that, even if Evaluee had given appellant consent to use media contacts, appellant\u2019s proper course of action as a forensic evaluator would be to consult with Cacheris before making any statements to the media.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Appellant contends that the Board erred in \u201cfinding that [he] was an agent of Plato Cacheris.\u201d He argues that he was a \u201ccrisis manager\u201d for Evaluee, not a forensic evaluator for Cacheris. And thus, his disclosure of Evaluee\u2019s sexual activities to Evaluee\u2019s wife, his Paxil prescription, and his statements to the press \u2014 all of which he asserts were consented to by appellant \u2014 were consistent with his role as Evaluee\u2019s \u201ccrisis manager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">However, the Board\u2019s finding that appellant was engaged as a forensic evaluator was supported by substantial evidence, as we discussed earlier in this opinion. We reiterate that Dr. Janofsky testified that appellant\u2019s assignment was a \u201ctypical\u201d one for a forensic evaluator, that Cacheris testified that he engaged appellant to render an opinion as to whether Evaluee had any viable psychiatric defenses, that appellant himself produced the forensic psychiatric report answering the very questions Cacheris posed to him, and finally, that appellant signed the government\u2019s SAM agreement spelling out that the information he obtained could be used, as the Board found, \u201conly in preparation for the defense of the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Appellant claims that the Board erred in \u201cfinding that the moral imperative exception to confidentiality was not justifiable in this matter.\u201d He argues that the AMA Ethical Guidelines create an exception to a physician\u2019s duty not to disclose confidential communications that can be invoked \u201cto protect the welfare of the individual or the public interest.\u201d He says he \u201cexercised the imperative, morally, to speak out in the interest of the community out of the grave concern for the community\u2019s safety.\u201d The public interest, according to appellant, was the \u201cfailure of the FBI, the Catholic Church, and the medical profession to fulfill [their] obligations,\u201d that is, to provide Evaluee with needed \u201ctherapeutic intervention.\u201d He asserts that the Catholic Church failed to recommend Evaluee for treatment even though Evaluee, a Catholic, confessed his sexual activities and his espionage activities to Catholic priests; and the medical community, which treated Evaluee for migraine headaches, \u201cdid nothing to determine the underlying issues.\u201d Appellant believed these institutions needed reform and, as he testified during the hearing, he followed an ethic that was \u201cbigger than forensic psychiatry,\u201d and he \u201clisten[ed] to [his] heart and ... d[id] what [he] believe[d] [wa]s right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Appellant cites no authority for his argument that under such circumstances, a forensic evaluator, or even a treating psychiatrist, may disclose an evaluee\u2019s confidential information to promote institutional reform. The seminal case defining a mental health expert\u2019s duty to disclose a patient\u2019s confidential information to a third party is <em>Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, </em>17 Cal.3d 425, 131 Cal.Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334 (1976). In that case, a patient told his therapist that he was going to kill Tatiana Tarasoff, and he subsequently did. <em>Tarasoff, </em>17 Cal.3d at 430, 131 Cal.Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334. The California court held that the therapists could be liable for not warning Tarasoff, stating that \u201cthe therapist\u2019s obligations to his patient require that he not disclose a confidence unless such disclosure is necessary to avert danger to others,\u201d and, even then, that \u201che do so discreetly, and in a fashion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>would preserve the privacy of his patient to the fullest extent compatible with the prevention of the threatened danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441, 131 Cal.Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In contrast, Evaluee obviously did not pose a threat or danger to the public at the time of appellant\u2019s disclosures; nor does appellant contend otherwise. Furthermore, Dr. Janofsky testified that he was familiar with the <em>Tarasoff </em>case. When asked by the State during the hearing if he knew of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d or \u201ccommunity interest\u201d exception to \u201cpatient confidentiality in a criminal forensic setting,\u201d he testified that \u201c[i]t simply doesn\u2019t exist\u201d and that he knew of \u201cno exception in the literature, either the legal or in the psychiatric or the forensic psychiatric literature, of such an exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Relying on <em>Tarasoff </em>and Dr. Janofsky\u2019s opinion, the ALJ found, as did the Board, that there was no \u201cmoral imperative\u201d or community interest exception to appellant\u2019s duty to maintain Evaluee\u2019s confidences. We agree and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Appellant contends that the Board erred in its application of \u201cthe law of waiver concerning [Evaluee\u2019s] assertion of breach of confidence.\u201d Specifically, he maintains that \u201c[a] communication can be confidential and receive legal protection only so long as the one who holds the privilege ... keeps the confidence himself,\u201d and that, because Evaluee had posted stories about the sexual exploitation of his wife on the Internet prior to meeting appellant, the information was \u201cclearly [not] confidential or protected by privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Appellant confuses \u201cprivilege\u201d and \u201cconfidentiality.\u201d \u201cPrivilege statutes must be narrowly construed,\u201d as \u201c[p]rivilege is the legal protection given to certain communications and relationships, <em>i.e., </em>attorney-client privilege____\u201d <em>Doe v. Maryland Bd. of Social Workers, </em>154 Md.App. 520, 528, 840 A.2d 744, <em>aff'd, </em>384 Md. 161, 862 A.2d 996 (2004) (citations omitted). \u201c[P]rivileges provide for an environment in which open communication can occur without the fear that the communication will later be used in a court or administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>proceeding against the person making the communication.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>384 Md. at 170, 862 A.2d 996. Confidentiality, on the other hand, is broader than privilege. <em>See id. </em>at 171, 862 A.2d 996. Thus, information that is not protected by a privilege statute can still be confidential information. <em>Doe, </em>154 Md. App. at 528, 840 A.2d 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">As the Board stated, Evaluee is not trying to prevent appellant from using his communications against him in a court or administrative proceeding. Thus, the cases appellant cites in support of his argument, notably, <em>In re Alethea W., </em>130 Md.App. 635, 747 A.2d 736 (2000); <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>98 Md.App. 348, 633 A.2d 455 (1993); and <em>Hamilton v. Verdow, </em>287 Md. 544, 414 A.2d 914 (1980), are not applicable to the case at bar because those cases dealt with the waiver of privileged information in court proceedings. In the instant case, privilege does not apply, but confidentiality does.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The Board also found that simply because some of the information Evaluee disclosed to appellant was already available to the public does not mean appellant\u2019s duty to keep the information confidential was waived in any way. This finding by the Board was supported by the ethical guidelines admitted into evidence and by Dr. Janofsky, who testified that it would have made \u201cno difference\u201d if the information was already released to the press before appellant released it himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Finally, appellant claims that the Board erred in admitting into evidence letters in the investigatory file from Steven Salky, Evaluee\u2019s attorney at the time of the hearing, because the letters were hearsay. As we stated earlier, \u201cit is well settled in Maryland that hearsay evidence is admissible into evidence at administrative hearings.\u201d <em>Eichberg, </em>50 Md.App. at 193, 436 A.2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

The Board\u2019s Investigative Summary states that the complaint was received on September 21, 2001, but the ALJ found that it was received on September 13, 2001.
