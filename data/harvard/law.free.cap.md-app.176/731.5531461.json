BLOOM, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ApR\">Ret\u2019d, Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">This appeal by Montgomery County is from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County that affirmed an order of the Maryland Tax Court directing the County to refund, with interest, $88,259.25 paid by appellee to record a deed conveying real estate to Wildwood Medical Center, L.L.C., a Maryland Limited Liability Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In 1962, Alvin L. Aubinoe and Dorothy B. Aubinoe, his wife, acquired title to certain parcels of land known as Wildwood Manor, in Montgomery County. In ensuing years, multiple conveyances (all duly recorded) were made of undivided partial, fractional interests in the Wildwood Manor property, each for a nominal consideration, either to the children or grandchildren of the Aubinoes or to trusts created on behalf of the children or grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">As of 22 December 2003, title to undivided fractional interests in the Wildwood Manor property was vested in the names of Alvin and Dorothy\u2019s daughter, Dorothy A. Shelton (25%); Worthington H. Talcott, Jr., Trustee of the Dorothy A. Shelton Trust (37.5%); Alvin L. Aubinoe, III, Trustee of the Alvin L. Aubinoe Trust, # 3 (9.375%); Victoria L. Aubinoe (9.375%); Scot M. Aubinoe (9.375%); and Amanda M. Aubinoe (9.375%). Each family member and trust, hereinafter collectively referred to as the Aubinoe Family and Trusts, had acquired title to his, her, or its fractional share of the subject real estate by a succession of duly recorded deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">On 22 December 2003, the Aubinoe Family and Trusts, the title owners of the Wildwood property, signed a formal General Partnership Agreement. They assert that they had been operating as a partnership for several years, as evidenced by partnership tax returns they had been filing. On 23 December 2003, the Aubinoe Family and Trusts signed and sealed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>deed conveying the property that is the subject of this case to Wildwood Medical Center, L.L.C. (\u201cthe LLC\u201d), a limited liability company created for that purpose. The subject property was identified in that deed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-4\">Parcel \u201cB\u201d in the subdivision known as \u2018WILDWOOD MANOR SHOPPING CENTER,\u201d as per plat thereof recorded in Plat Book 156 at Plat No. 17744 among the Land Records of Montgomery County, Maryland, together with the right of ingress and egress over a private drive pursuant to an Easement for Ingress and Egress dated December 27, 1989, and recorded among the Land Records of Montgomery County, Maryland in Liber 9166 at Folio 079.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The conveyance listed and described the \u201cGrantor, party of the first part,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">Dorothy A. Shelton formerly known as Dorothy Aubinoe Griffith, Alvin L. Aubinoe, III, Trustee of an unrecorded revocable trust known as the Alvin L. Aubinoe III Trust No. 3, Victoria L. Aubinoe, Scot M. Aubinoe, Amanda M. Aubinoe, and Dorothy Aubinoe Shelton and Worthington H. Talcott, Jr., Trustees of the Dorothy Griffith Shelton Family Trust, all of the above dba Wildwood Medical Center General Partnership, a Maryland General Partnership, party of the first part____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The LLC, a Maryland Limited Liability Company, was described as \u201cGrantee, party of the second part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The <em>habendum </em>and <em>tenendum </em>clause of the deed read, \u201cTo Have and To Hold the said tract of ground and premises above described and mentioned, and hereby intended to be conveyed ... in fee simple.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Pursuant to Md.Code (1985, 2001 RepLVol., 2006 Cum. Supp.), Tax-Property Article, sections 12-108(y)(2) and 13-405(c), concerning \u201cRecordation Taxes\u201d and \u201cTransfer Taxes,\u201d the grantee, the LLC, presented to the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, or one of her assistants, the deed to it from the Aubinoe Family and Trusts as an \u201c[instrument of writing\u201d that purported to convey title to real property as defined in section 12 \u2014 101(e)(l)(i). And, in accordance with section 12-102 of the Tax-Property Article, the grantee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>the LLC, paid a recordation tax, calculated in accordance with section 12-105. It also paid a county transfer tax in accordance with Title 13 of the Tax-Property Article. The total amount paid by the LLC as recordation and transfer taxes was $88,259.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Having paid recordation and transfer taxes in order to record the deed, the LLC requested a refund of those taxes, asserting that, as the grantee of property from a Maryland general partnership, it was exempt from paying such taxes according to provisions in Title 12 and 13 of the Tax-Property Article. The Montgomery County Department of Finance denied the request. The LLC then appealed to the Maryland Tax Court. The Tax Court conducted a hearing and issued a decision in favor of the LLC.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Montgomery County was ordered to refund, with interest, the recordation and transfer taxes paid by the LLC. The county then sought judicial review by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The circuit court, after conducting a hearing, affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s ruling, whereupon Montgomery County filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AM6\">I. History</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In Maryland, prior to 1766, title to land, at least an inheritable title, such as fee simple or fee simple absolute, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>transferred by livery of seisin, a ritual in which the grantor and the grantee would go upon the land where the grantor would deliver possession of the land by handing over a twig, a clod of dirt, or a piece of turf. Livery of seisin was abolished in Maryland in 1766, and thereafter title to real estate has been transferred only by enrollment of deeds, a substitute for, and equivalent to, an act of livery. <em>See Matthews v. Ward, </em>10 G. &amp; J. 443 (1839). The recording of a deed or lease is a final and complete act that passes title; until this is accomplished, everything else is unavailing. Until the deed is recorded, the legal title remains in the grantor. <em>See Nickel v. Brown, </em>75 Md. 172, 23 A. 736 (1892). The legal title to land does not pass, other than by operation of law, until a deed is properly executed and recorded. <em>See Kingsley v. Makay, </em>253 Md. 24, 251 A.2d 585 (1969). \u201cRecorded\u201d signifies \u201ccopied or transcribed into some permanent book.\u201d <em>Maryland Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. v. Hirsch, </em>42 Md.App. 457, 477, 401 A.2d 491 (1979), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>288 Md. 95, 416 A.2d 10 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The statutory provision that imposes a tax on the recordation of documents that transfer title to real estate is precise in its requirements. With respect to a change of ownership, the recorded document, or \u201cinstrument of writing,\u201d is a document that \u201cconveys <em>title </em>to ... real property.\u201d Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-101(c)(1)\u00ae (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The act of recordation of a deed is the substitute for livery of seisin that effects the transfer of title. An event, occurrence, or transaction that merely reflects a change of <em>ownership </em>of property need not even be in writing, as the Court of Appeals noted in <em>Vlamis v. DeWeese, </em>216 Md. 384, 140 A.2d 665 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">In <em>Vlamis v. DeWeese, </em>Warren E. Malin bought land in Elkton, erected a building on it, and began to operate a garage and automobile sales agency. The following year, Malin sold to Reuben Deilbert a one-half interest, as a tenant in common in the real estate and personal property used in the business, giving Deilbert a deed to an undivided half interest in the land. The deed was timely recorded. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>then operated the business as partners. Several months later, Deilbert died. The issues before the court were the nature of the property and whether Deilbert\u2019s daughter had inherited an interest in the real estate. Based on the evidence with respect to the operation of the business, the Court held that, although Deilbert had <em>title </em>to an undivided one-half interest in the real estate, the property itself, having been dedicated to and essential to the operation of the partnership, had become partnership property without any formal or even informal transfer from the partners to the partnership. <em>Vlamis v. DeWeese, </em>therefore, makes it clear that <em>ownership </em>of property may be, either formally or informally, separated from <em>title </em>to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">II. The Present Version of the Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In <em>Dean v. Pinder, </em>312 Md. 154, 159, 538 A.2d 1184 (1988), the Court of Appeals traced the history of Maryland\u2019s transfer tax:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">In 1937, the General Assembly enacted \u00a7 213 of Article 81 of the Annotated Code of Maryland under the subtitle \u201cTax on the Recordation of Instruments in Writing.\u201d 1937 Md. Laws. Sp. Sess., Ch. 11, \u00a7 213. Since its enactment, this provision has been repealed and reenacted several times and was codified as Maryland Code (1947, 1980 Repl. Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.) Article 81, \u00a7 277 at the time this dispute arose. This 1984 provision provided in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">(a) <em>Written instruments. </em>\u2014 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a tax is hereby imposed upon every instrument of writing conveying title to real or personal property, or creating liens or encumbrances upon real or personal property, offered for record and recorded in this State with the clerks of the circuit courts of the respective counties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">(b) <em>Instruments conveying title or securing debts. </em>\u2014 (1) In the case of instruments conveying tile to property, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>tax shall be at the rate of 55 cents for each $500 or fractional part thereof of the actual consideration paid or to be paid; in the case of instruments securing a debt, the tax shall be at the rate of 55 cents for each $500 of the principal amount of the debt secured (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The Court explained that, \u201c[a]lthough this tax is computable on the amount of consideration transferred, it is not considered a tax on property but rather an excise tax imposed upon the privilege of recording the deed.\u201d <em>Dean, </em>312 Md. at 159-60, 538 A.2d 1184 (citing <em>Central Credit Union v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>243 Md. 175, 182, 220 A.2d 568 (1966), and <em>Pittman v. Housing Authority of Baltimore, </em>180 Md. 457, 459, 25 A.2d 466 (1942)).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The current version of the \u201cRecordation Tax\u201d are set forth in sections 12-101 through 12-115 of the 2001 Replacement Volume of, and the 2006 Cumulative Supplement to, the Tax-Property Article. As it relates to this case, section 12-101 defines \u201cInstrument of Writing\u201d like the predecessors thereto did, a written instrument that <em>\u201cconveys title to </em>... real property____\u201d (Emphasis added.) Under section 12-102, a tax is imposed on the recordation of an instrument in writing, that is, a written document that conveys title to real property, as well as to written documents that transfer title to personal property or that creates liens on property.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Section 12-108 contains exemptions from recordation taxes. Subsection (y)(2) of section 2-108, \u201cTransfers from certain entities to limited liability company,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">An instrument of writing that transfers <em>title </em>to real property from a predecessor entity [such as a Maryland general partnership] to a limited liability company is not subject to recordation tax if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-10\">(i)l. the members of the limited liability are identical to the partners of the converting general partnership....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-11\">(ii) each member\u2019s allocation of the profits and losses of the limited liability company is identical to that member\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>allocation of the profits and losses of the converting predecessor entity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">(iii) the instrument in writing that transfers <em>title </em>to real property represents the dissolution of the predecessor entity for purposes of conversion to a limited liability company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">II. Statutory Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The statutes governing this case are revenue statutes that impose taxes (recordation and transfer taxes) on, <em>inter alia, </em>conveyances of real property that require recordation of deeds, \u201cinstruments of writing that require recording in order to transfer title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">The goal of statutory construction is to discover and effect the General Assembly\u2019s intent. <em>See Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>110 Md.App. 677, 688, 678 A.2d 602 (1996), <em>aff'd, </em>348 Md. 2, 702 A.2d 690 (1997).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">If, as in the instant case, the parties call upon us to interpret an exemption, we first look to the general principles of statutory construction, and then, narrowing our inquiry, turn to those principles that are applicable to the taxation arena. Ever mindful of our desire to discern and effectuate the General Assembly\u2019s intent, ... we examine the language of the enactment and give to the language its natural and ordinary import.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-10\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">\u201cIt is well-settled that when the Legislature has chosen not to define a term used in a statute, that term should be given its ordinary and natural meaning.\u201d <em>Dean, </em>312 Md. at 161, 538 A.2d 1184. \u201c[W]hen the term in a statute is a legal term, absent any legislative intent to the contrary, the term is presumed to be used in its legal sense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">Appellee\u2019s argument for exemptions from recordation tax and transfer tax is based on sections 12-108(y) and 13-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>405(c). The former exempts from the recordation tax a limited liability company when recording an \u201cinstrument of writing\u201d (a deed) \u201cthat transfers <em>title </em>to real property from a predecessor entity\u201d (such as a Maryland general partnership) under certain conditions applicable to the members of the LLC, who are the former partners of the grantor partnership. The latter exempts from the county transfer tax an entity exempt from a recordation tax by virtue of section 12-108(y). The key word in section 12-108(y) is \u201ctitle,\u201d defined in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1522 (8th ed.2004), as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-4\">[t]he union of all elements (as ownership, possession and custody) constituting the legal right to control and dispose of property; the legal link between a person who owns property and the property itself....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">It is used in the sense of legal evidence of a person\u2019s ownership rights in property; an instrument (such as a deed) that constitutes such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">\u201cTitle\u201d and \u201cownership\u201d are not synonymous. \u201cOwnership\u201d is but one element of \u201ctitle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">In <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>317 Md. 3, 11-12, 561 A.2d 1034 (1989), the Court of Appeals set forth some rules applicable to exemptions from taxing statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">\u201cIt is fundamental that statutory tax exemptions are strictly construed in favor of the taxing authority and if any real doubt exists as to the propriety of an exemption that doubt <em>must </em>be resolved in favor of the State. In other words, \u2018to doubt an exemption is to deny it.\u2019 ... [T]he State\u2019s taxing prerogative is never presumed to be relinquished and the abandonment of this power must be proved by the party assessing the exemption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">(quoting <em>Xerox Corp. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>290 Md. 126, 137, 428 A.2d 1208 (1981) (emphasis in original) (in turn quoting from <em>Perdue v. St. Dep\u2019t of Assess. &amp; T., </em>264 Md. 228, 232-33, 286 A.2d 165 (1972), which quoted <em>Suburban Propane Gas Corp. v. Tawes, </em>205 Md. 83, 87, 106 A.2d 119 (1954))).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>IV. This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The Aubinoe Family and Trusts could have avoided payment of recordation and transfer taxes upon recording the deed from their partnership to their limited liability company only by a deed conveying their combined titles (\u201cinstrument of writing\u201d) to the partnership and recording that deed with the clerk of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County or with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation. Then the deed from the partnership to the limited liability company would, by conveying to the LLC title to the Wildwood Manor property, qualify the deed from the partnership to the LLC for the exemptions from recordation and transfer taxes provided by sections 12-108(y) and 13-405. But they would have had to pay the same amount of taxes on <em>that </em>conveyance as they paid upon recordation of the deed from the partnership to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In short, if the word \u201ctitle\u201d in section 12-108(y) of the Tax-Property Article is given its technical and legal definition, only an instrument of writing (deed) that conveys <em>title </em>to real estate from a \u201cpredecessor entity\u201d (in this case, a general partnership) to a limited liability company owned by the same members who were the partners in the partnership would be exempted from payment of recordation and county transfer taxes. Mindful of our obligation to construe tax exemption statutes strictly in favor of the taxing authority, <em>see Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co., </em>317 Md. 3, 561 A.2d 1034, we hold that the deed from the general partnership to the appellee is not exempted from payment of the recordation and transfer taxes collected by Montgomery County because the partnership did not have <em>title </em>that it could convey to the LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">There is a logical basis for exempting from recordation taxes a deed from a \u201cpredecessor entity\u201d conveying title to real estate to a limited liability company composed of the same persons who compose the grantor. In order to convey title, the predecessor entity must have acquired it by a deed, recorded among the land records, on which a recordation tax had been levied and paid. A tax imposed on the deed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the predecessor entity (in this case the general partnership) to a limited liability company would amount to a second tax on what is, in effect, the same entity in a different form.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">In this case, the Aubinoe Family and Trusts sought to avoid payment of recordation and transfer taxes on <em>both </em>transfers. In view of the language of section 12-108(y), which exempts a transfer of <em>title </em>to real property from a predecessor entity to a limited liability company, we hold that the exemption from the recordation tax provided in section 12-108(y) \u2014 and thereby the exemption from a transfer tax provided in section 13-405 of the Tax-Property Article of the Maryland Code \u2014 does not apply to a conveyance of real property that does not transfer <em>title </em>to that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Consequently, we hold that the ruling of the Tax Court to the effect that the appellee was entitled to a refund of the recordation and transfer taxes that it had paid upon the recordation of the deed to it from the predecessor partnership was an error of law, as was the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in affirming the Tax Court\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand this case to that court -with instruction to enter a judgment reversing the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR ENTRY OF A JUDGMENT REVERSING THE DECISION OF THE TAX COURT. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Dissenting Opinion by JAMES A. KENNEY, III, Judge (Retired, specially assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">In its opinion, the Tax Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-9\">The conveyance is exempt from both the State recording and the Montgomery County transfer tax as the transferor was a General Partnership made up of certain Partners or members, and the transferee is a Limited Liability Company made up of the identical members that made up the Partnership as required by Section 12-108(y)(2). The Part<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>nership Agreement clearly identifies the members of the Partnership, those members being the same persons who executed the subject deed. The Operating Agreement of the Wildwood Medical Center, L.L.C. states as its members the same identical members of the Partnership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">The consideration of partnership law is critical in the Court\u2019s analysis. Section 9A-101(i) of the Corporations and Associations Article defines partnership, \u201can association of two or more members \u2014 of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners of a business for profit under Section 9A-202\u201d of that article. 9A-202(a) states that, except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the unincorporated association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners of a business for profit forms a partnership, whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership and whether or not the association is called partnership, joint venture, or any other name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">The Court believes that Maryland law has supported this provision that\u2019s set forth in the appropriate statutes. The transferor named in the subject deed was a Maryland General Partnership, and, further, the Partnership confirmed its existence as such by the terms of the written Partnership Agreement. The intent of the Partners was also manifested by the fact that the United States Partnership Tax Returns for the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, under its Federal Employer Identification Number 52-2292852, further manifests a subjective intent of the Partners by filing said United States Partnership Tax Returns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">The fact that the property was not titled in the name of the Partnership, never titled in the name of or transferred to the Partnership or a trustee or a nominee of the Partnership does not in itself defeat the exemption. The record title is not dispositive as to the requirements for the claimed exemption. It is the intention of the parties, not record title alone that determines whether property not held in the name of the partnership is partnership property. Further, Maryland law does not require a deed to transfer title from the individuals to the partnership for purposes of transferring title of partnership property to a limited liability com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>pany. Thus, by the plain and ordinary meaning of the words set forth in 12-108(y)(2), the statutory exemptions would apply to the subject deed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Williams v. Dovell, </em>202 Md. 351, 96 A.2d 484 (1953), concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVq4\">where real estate is acquired as partnership property, but is conveyed to the partners by name without reference to the partnership, every right of ownership and disposition is in the partnership, and no interest of the partner in such real estate passes by devise or inheritance or by his individual deed except in the case of a conveyance to a purchaser for value without notice. With that exception, the legal title of individual partners is an empty technicality. The legal title to partnership property cannot be conveyed, devised or inherited as the individual property of any of the partners either as joint tenant or as tenant in common.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">The partner\u2019s interest in the partnership, which is a personal chose in action, is all that he may assign or bequeath, and upon his death intestate that interest passes to his administrator as personal property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">202 Md. at 357, 96 A.2d 484.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Later, in <em>Kay v. Gitomer, </em>253 Md. 32, 37, 251 A.2d 853, 856 (1969), the Court of Appeals held \u201cpartnership property is not subject to dower, curtesy, allowances to widows heirs or next of kin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Under the Maryland Revised Uniform Partnership Act, Maryland Code Annotated (1975, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9A-201 of the Corporations and Associations Article, \u201c[a] partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.\u201d <em>See Republic Prop. Corp. v. Mission West Prop., L.P., </em>391 Md. 732, 895 A.2d 1006 (2006). Section 9A-203 expressly provides that \u201c[partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>property is property of the partnership and not the partners individually.\u201d Subsection 9A-302(a)(3) indicates that \u201c[p]artnership property held in the name of one or more persons other than the partnership, without an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">By resting its determination of legislative intent on a distinction between \u201ctitle\u201d and \u201cownership,\u201d the Majority resurrects an \u201cempty technicality\u201d that has long been put to rest by case and statutory law. We should instead assume that the General Assembly was aware: that partnerships are separate entities from their individual partners; that partnership real property can be held by one or more persons without reference to the partnership in the instrument transferring the property to them; and that those persons can, in turn, transfer that property by an instrument to another person or entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Subsection 12 \u2014 108(y)(l) of the Tax Property Article states that a \u201c \u2018Predecessor entity\u2019 includes a: 1. Maryland general partnership,\u201d and subsection 12 \u2014 108(y)(2) states that \u201c[a]n instrument of writing that transfers title to real property from a predecessor entity ... to a limited liability company is not subject to recordation tax if: (i) 1. the members of the limited liability company are identical to the partners of the converting general partnership ... \u201d; and \u201c(ii) each member\u2019s allocation of the profits and losses of the limited liability company is identical to that member\u2019s allocation of profits and losses of the converting predecessor entity\u201d; and \u201c(iii) the instrument of writing that transfers title to real property represents the dissolution of the predecessor entity for purposes of conversion to a limited liability company.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>A deed is an instrument that conveys title to real property. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(8th ed.2004) at 334 defines \u201cconvey\u201d as \u201cto transfer or deliver something such as a right or property to another especially by deed or other \u25a0writing.\u201d In this context, \u201cconvey\u201d and \u201ctransfer\u201d are interchangeable terms. A deed of partnership property from the partners on behalf of the partnership to the limited liability company conveys or transfers title from the \u201cpredecessor entity\u201d to the limited liability company. Certainly, no one contends that the limited liability company does not receive legal title to property as a result of such a deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Conversion is \u201cthe act of changing from one form to another.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s </em>at 356. To require the converting general partnership to first title the partnership property in the name of the partnership in order to avail itself of the exemptions at issue is to ignore the past treatment of partnership property and the recognition that partnership property need not be held in the name of the partnership. To me, the intent of the General Assembly, as reflected by the statutory language, was simply to permit, under certain specified conditions, a general partnership converting to a limited liability company to reflect that conversion in the land records without incurring a recordation or transfer tax. That is consistent with \u00a7 4A-213(a) of the Corporations and Associations Article, which provides that \u201c[a]ll property <em>owned </em>by the converting general ... partnership ... remains vested in the converted entity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Recording the deed in the land records merely reflects and confirms the statutory vesting of the partnership property in the limited liability company.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">That interpretation is not inconsistent with the exemption provided in \u00a7 12-108(q) that an instrument of writing conveying real property from corporations, limited liability companies and partnerships to the original shareholders, members, or partners of the partnership \u201con liquidation, dissolution or termination is not subject to recordation tax.\u201d In order to qualify for the exemptions at issue, the conversion of a general partnership to a limited liability company must represent a \u201cdissolution of the predecessor entity\u201d and the real property of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the dissolved partnership must be conveyed to an entity made up of the identical partners with the same rights and obligations as to profits and losses. That conveyance is not unlike a conveyance to the original partners of a dissolved partnership. In both instances, there has been no real change in ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Respectfully, I believe that the Tax Court was correct and that the decision of the circuit court should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\">.
