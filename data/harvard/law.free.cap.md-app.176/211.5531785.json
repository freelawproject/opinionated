Taylor. Jennifer brought an action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Taylor for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>against the State of Maryland<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for violations of Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, but his suit proved unavailing. Holding that Jennifer\u2019s exclusive remedy against the State lay with the Sundry Claims Board, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the State and thereafter entered a default judgment against Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">On appeal, Jennifer claims that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because his injury neither \u201carose out of his employment\u201d nor was \u201caccidental\u201d: two conditions that must be met, he insists, before Sundry Claims Board review can be obtained. Because we find that Jennifer\u2019s injury did indeed arise out of his employment, and because we conclude that the Board\u2019s jurisdiction is not limited to injuries that are \u201caccidental,\u201d at least as that term is interpreted by Jennifer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but includes injuries caused by the willful acts of third parties, we hold that Jennifer\u2019s exclusive remedy lies with the Sundry Claims Board. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">On August 23, 2002, Jennifer was working in the Central Laundry Facility with fellow inmate Stanley B. Taylor, where he received a wage for the work he performed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On that August day, Jennifer asked the dietary officer on duty in the kitchen for permission to have a hamburger. The officer agreed and directed Taylor to serve Jennifer the food he requested. But Taylor refused and, according to Jennifer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>complaint, \u201c[a] heated argument\u201d erupted between Taylor and the officer. It ended when Taylor stated that \u201che would rather throw [the hamburger] on the floor than give it to [Jennifer],\u201d and then proceeded to do precisely that. The officer then ordered Taylor to leave the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The next day, Taylor was again assigned to work in the kitchen. Although the two prisoners were placed in different areas of the kitchen and given separate duties, at some point Taylor \u201capproached [Jennifer] from behind, holding a large spatula used to stir large pots\u201d and struck him in the head with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Taylor was, at that time, according to Jennifer\u2019s complaint, \u201cunder care by [the State] for mental health problems ... related to [his] violent disposition,\u201d but had, at that point, exhausted the medication he was taking for that condition. \u201cDespite requests to [prison officials] for additional medicine,\u201d none, the complaint averred, was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Jennifer contends that the circuit court erred in holding that his sole remedy against the State lay with the Sundry Claims Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) and, on that basis, entering summary judgment for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Because this case was disposed of on a motion for summary judgment, our task would normally be to \u201c \u2018determine if there is a genuine dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goldstein v. Miles, </em>159 Md.App. 403, 422, 859 A.2d 313 (2004) (quoting <em>Crews v. Hollenbach, </em>126 Md.App. 609, 624, 730 A.2d 742 (1999), <em>aff'd, </em>358 Md. 627, 751 A.2d 481 (2000)). But, since neither party alleges that there are any material facts in dispute, we confine our review of that motion to \u201cwhether summary judgment was correctly entered as a matter of law,\u201d <em>Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Berrett, </em>395 Md. 439, 450-451, 910 A.2d 1072 (2006) (citing <em>Ross v. State Bd. of Elections, </em>387 Md. 649, 658, 876 A.2d 692, (2005); <em>Todd v. MTA, </em>373 Md. 149, 154, 816 A.2d 930 (2003); <em>Beyer v. Morgan State Univ., </em>369 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Md. 335, 359, 800 A.2d 707 (2002)), that is, \u201c \u201cwhether the trial court was legally correct\u2019\u201d in granting summary judgment. <em>Messing v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>143 Md.App. 1, 10, 792 A.2d 312 (2002) (quoting <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990)). We conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The Sundry Claims Board Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u201cSCBA\u201d) provides that the compensation authorized by that act is the \u201cexclusive remedy against the State for a claim,\u201d \u00a7 10-308(c)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, made by \u201can individual, who while an inmate in the Patuxent Institution, the Baltimore City Detention Center, or a correctional facility in the Division of Correction: (1) was engaged in work for which wages or a stipulated sum of money was paid by a correctional facility; and (2) sustained a permanent partial disability or permanent total disability: (i) as a result of a personal injury arising out of and in the course of work for which wages or a stipulated sum of money was paid by a correctional facility; and (ii) that incapacitated [the claimant] or materially reduced [his or her] earning power in that type of work.\u201d \u00a7 10-304. <em>See Dixon v. Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, </em>175 Md.App. 384, 927 A.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Although Jennifer does not dispute that his injury occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 his employment, while he was \u201cengaged in work for which wages or a stipulated sum of money was paid by a correctional facility,\u201d and that he \u201csustained a permanent partial disability or total disability,\u201d <em>id., </em>he maintains that, because his injury neither \u201ca[rose] out of\u2019 his work nor was \u201caccidental,\u201d <em>id., </em>it did not fall within the exclusive province of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\n<em>\u201cArising Out Of\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The SCBA does not explicitly define the phrase \u201carising out of.\u201d Nor have our appellate courts considered the meaning of this phrase in the context of that act. But they have repeatedly considered its import in other statutory settings, notably \u00a7 9-101(b) of what is now entitled the Workers\u2019<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Compensation Act (\u201cWCA\u201d),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which employs this locution, as the SCBA does, in defining compensable claims. Section 9-101(b) of the WCA states that an injury covered by that act is one \u201cthat <em>arises out of </em>and in the course\u201d of the claimant\u2019s employment. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Jennifer maintains, however, that it would be error for us to assume that the legislature intended that the phrase, \u201carising out of,\u201d be given the same meaning in the SCBA that it has been given in the WCA. He claims that, where the legislature intended that phrases common to both acts would have the same meaning, it expressly said so in the SCBA. To illustrate his point, he invokes \u00a7 10-301(c) and \u00a7 10-301(d) of the SCBA, which respectively state that \u201cpermanent partial disability\u201d and \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d shall have the same meanings in the SCBA that they have in the WCA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>But this argument is misleading. The SCBA relies on the WCA for the definitions of \u201cpermanent partial disability\u201d and \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d because those locutions, unlike \u201carising out of,\u201d are expressly defined in that act. In other words, the reason that the SCBA does not refer to the WCA\u2019s definition of \u201carising out of\u2019 is simply because it contains no such definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">If those sections of the SCBA provide little support for Jennifer\u2019s position, the legislative history of the SCBA provides even less. In fact, as we shall see, that history compels us to conclude that the phrase, \u201carising out of,\u201d was placed in the SCBA to convey the same meaning that it does in the WCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Before the legislature enacted the SCBA, the WCA governed claims made by all workers, including inmates at Maryland\u2019s correctional facilities, for injuries \u201carising out of and in the course of\u2019 their employment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md.Code (1939), Art. 101, \u00a7 14. But, in 1961, inmate claims were removed from the WCA for all workers with the passage of the SCBA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That act established a separate board, the Sundry Claims Board, to handle claims for compensation made by prison inmates for work-related injuries. To be more precise, its purpose, in the words of the act, was to \u201camend[ ] the compensation laws to remove therefrom references to the payment of workmen\u2019s compensation to certain prisoners and inmates of penal institutions ... [and] creat[e] a \u2018Sundry Claims Board\u2019 to provide for the payment of claims for injuries to certain prisoners in this State, and relating generally to the payment of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits and to the payment of other claims for injuries incurred by prisoners and inmates of [Maryland] penal institutions.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1961 Supp.), Art. 41, \u00a7 188A.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>In 1993, the SCBA was amended and the phrase, \u201carising out of,\u201d was added so that the act now expressly required that a prisoner\u2019s injury <em>\u201caris[e] out of </em>and in the course of work\u201d to fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sundry Claims Board. <em>See </em>1993 Md. Laws, Chap. 133.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Re-codified in 1999 as \u00a7\u00a7 10-301-10-310 of the Maryland Code, the statute currently provides, as we stated earlier, that the Board \u201cshall administer benefits ... to an individual who, while an inmate in the Patuxent Institution, the Baltimore City Detention Center, or a correctional facility in the Division of Corrections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">(1) was engaged in work for which wages or a stipulated sum of money was paid by a correctional facility; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">(2) sustained a permanent partial disability or permanent total disability:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">(i) as a result of a personal injury <em>arising out of </em>and in the course of work for which wages or a stipulated sum of money was paid by a correctional facility; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWV\">(\u00fc) that incapacitated the individual or materially reduced t he individual\u2019s earning power in that type of work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u00a7 10-304. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">After defining what is compensable in \u00a7 10-304, the SCBA goes on to list, in \u00a7 10-308(a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>, what factors may be considered by the Board as to whether a claim should be compensated and, if so, in what amount, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">In determining what compensation, if any, to allow a claimant, the Board shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">(1) the good faith of the claimant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">(2) <em>the possibility that the alleged injury was self-inflicted or not accidental;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>(3) the extent and nature of the injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">(4) the degree of disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">(5) the period of disability or incapacity for other work; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">(6) the ordinary earning power of the claimant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u00a7 10-308(a) (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">The phrase, \u201carising out of\u2019 was added to the WCA, as we noted earlier, in 1939, when prisoner compensation claims were still covered by that act. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1939), Art. 101, \u00a7 14. That phrase was thereafter interpreted by our appellate courts in the context of that act and that interpretation applied to all <em>workers </em>\u2014 see, <em>e.g., Livering v. Richardson\u2019s Restaurant, </em>374 Md. 566, 823 A.2d 687 (2003); <em>Mulready v. Univ. Research Corp., </em>360 Md. 51, 756 A.2d 575 (2000); and <em>Montgomery County v. Smith, </em>144 Md.App. 548, 799 A.2d 406 (2002) \u2014 including prison inmates. <em>See Gray v. Dept. of Correction, </em>230 Md. 508, 187 A.2d 860 (1963). Later, after the SCBA was passed, this language was added to more specifically define compensable injuries. In so doing, the legislature, we presume, was \u201caware of the interpretation\u201d that our appellate courts had previously placed on that language in interpreting the WCA and consequently added that language with the expectation that it would be given the same interpretation when it was judicially construed in the context of the SCBA. <em>See Del Marr v. Montgomery County, </em>169 Md.App. 187, 212, 900 A.2d 243 (2006) (\u201c[T]he Legislature is presumed to be aware of the interpretation that the courts ha[ve] placed upon its enactments.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">We further presume the legislature \u201cintended statutes that affect [the] same subject matter to blend into [a] consistent and harmonious body of law.\u201d That is to say, \u201cvarious consistent and related enactments, although made at different times and without reference to one another, nevertheless should be harmonized as much as possible.\u201d <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 93, 581 A.2d 9 (1990) (citing <em>Taxiera v. Malkus, </em>320 Md. 471, 481, 578 A.2d 761 (1990); <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v. Schlossberg, </em>306 Md. 48, 56, 507 A.2d 172 (1986); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>Bridges v. Nicely, </em>304 Md. 1, 10, 497 A.2d 142, 146 (1985)). Given that the SCBA and the WCA \u201caffect the same subject matter\u201d and are \u201cconsistent and related,\u201d we conclude that the legislature intended them \u201cto blend into [a] consistent and harmonious body of law.\u201d <em>Bricker, </em>321 Md. at 93, 581 A.2d 9 (other citations omitted). To achieve that end, we must give the phrases they share, such as \u201carising out of,\u201d the same meaning in both acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Still, hoping to persuade us to do otherwise, Jennifer cites <em>Dept. of Public Safety &amp; Correctional Servs. v. Le Van, 288 </em>Md. 533, 419 A.2d 1052 (1980), for the proposition that the WCA provides no guidance in such matters. But a review of that case leads us to question its relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In <em>Le Van, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the circuit court had erred in applying the WCA \u2014 specifically, Art. 101, \u00a7 36(4)(a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 to calculate an award for a claimant\u2019s back injury under the SCBA when the latter act had a specific provision \u2014 namely, Art. 41 \u00a7 188A(e) \u2014 setting forth the factors that should be considered in determining the amount of compensation that should be awarded<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>. In substituting the factors set forth in Art. 101, \u00a7 36(4)(a) of the WCA for those expressly stated in Art. 41 \u00a7 188A(e) of the SCBA, the circuit court rendered a significant part of that act \u201cmeaningless, surplusage, superfluous or nugatory\u201d and thereby violated a cardinal rule of statutory construction. <em>See, e.g., Government Employees Ins. Co. and GEICO v. Insurance Commissioner of the State of Maryland, </em>332 Md. 124, 132, 630 A.2d 713 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>(1993) (citing <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590 (1992); <em>D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 538, 578 A.2d 1177 (1990); <em>Kindley v. Governor of Md., </em>289 Md. 620, 625, 426 A.2d 908 (1981); <em>Moberly v. Herboldsheimer, </em>276 Md. 211, 217, 345 A.2d 855 (1975)). (It is a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation that, in construing \u201ctwo statutes, enacted at different times and not referring to each other ... neither statute should be read ... so as to render the other ... meaningless, surplusage, superfluous or nugatory.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">But that is clearly not what either party is requesting us to do here. To the contrary, we are not being asked to ignore the plain language of the SCBA in favor of competing language in the WCA but to determine whether a phrase, which both acts share, should be given the same interpretation in the SCBA that we have given it in that act\u2019s legislative predecessor and now counterpart, the WCA, in light of the common goals and history of those two acts. Thus, <em>Le Van </em>is simply not applicable to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The phrase \u201carises out of\u2019 in \u00a7 9-101 of the WCA has been interpreted by the Court of Appeals as \u201crequir[ing] not that the performance of an employment-related task be the direct or physical cause of the injury, but, more broadly, that the injury be incidental to the employment, such that it was by reason of the employment that the employee was exposed to the risk resulting in the injury.\u201d <em>Livering v. Richardson\u2019s Restaurant, </em>374 Md. 566, 574-575, 823 A.2d 687 (2003). In other words, \u201c[a]n injury arises out of the employment if it would not have occurred but for the fact that the conditions and obligations of the employment placed [the employee] in the position where he [or she] was injured.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 575, 823 A.2d 687 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Illustrative of this principle is <em>Mulready v. Univ. Research Corp., </em>360 Md. 51, 53, 66, 756 A.2d 575 (2000). In that case, an employee\u2019s injury caused by her slip and fall in her hotel bathtub, which occurred while she was attending a seminar in Canada on behalf of her employer, was held to arise out of her employment under the WCA because \u201cit occurred as a result of an activity <em>reasonably incidental </em>to the travel that the employer required.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Conversely, in <em>Montgomery County v. Smith, </em>144 Md.App. 548, 551, 799 A.2d 406 (2002), an off-duty injury suffered by a correctional officer while he was playing basketball at the detention center where he worked was held not to have arisen out of his employment because such \u201crecreational activities\u201d were not \u201c \u2018incident\u2019 to his job as a prison guard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578, 799 A.2d 406. In so holding, we explained that \u201c[a]n injury arises out of the employment if it would not have occurred but for the fact that the employee\u2019s job required the employee to be in the place where he was injured.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>144 Md.App. at 577, 799 A.2d 406 (citing <em>Mulready, </em>360 Md. at 66, 756 A.2d 575). Since the officer\u2019s \u201cjob did not require him to be on the basketball court where he was injured,\u201d his injury, we concluded, did not satisfy that test. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">But Jennifer\u2019s injury does. Certainly, he would not have suffered the injury he did \u201cbut for the fact that the conditions and obligations of the employment placed [him] in the position where he was injured.\u201d <em>Livering, </em>374 Md. at 574-75, 823 A.2d 687. At the time the assault took place, Jennifer was required by his employer, the Central Laundry Facility, to be in the kitchen. His presence there provided Taylor, who had also been assigned to work in the kitchen that day, with the opportunity to assault him as well as the instrument with which to carry out that attack. Thus, Jennifer\u2019s injury was incidental to his work. Because a \u201creasonably incidental\u201d relationship between the injury and the claimant\u2019s work is sufficient, in itself, to establish that an injury arose out of employment, we conclude that Jennifer\u2019s injury satisfied that requirement. <em>Mulready, </em>360 Md. at 53, 66, 756 A.2d 575 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Although Jennifer appears to concede this very point,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> he claims that the assault was motivated by Taylor\u2019s animosity toward him and that it therefore \u201ccould have occurred anywhere.\u201d Relying on <em>Gray v. Dept. of Correction, </em>230 Md. 508, 187 A.2d 860 (1963), Jennifer argues that his injury did not arise out of his employment. In <em>Gray, </em>a prisoner was injured under what Jennifer claims were analogous circumstances: that is, as a result of being assaulted while working in the laundry at a Maryland penitentiary. Because the <em>Gray </em>Court found that the prisoner\u2019s injuries did not \u201carise out of\u2019 his work, we must, Jennifer claims, reach the same result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">But, apart from the fact that in both <em>Gray </em>and the instant case the claimant and his assailant were inmates at a Maryland prison when the claimant was injured, the two cases have few material facts in common. Indeed, in rejecting recovery under the Sundry Board Claims Act, the <em>Gray </em>Court stressed that \u201ca clear inference\u201d could be drawn from the evidence \u201cthat [the prisoner] was injured as the result of a fight with another inmate\u201d that had previously occurred outside of work and in \u201cretaliation for a homosexual advance by [the injured prisoner].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512, 187 A.2d 860. In contrast, Jennifer has offered no basis from which an inference may be drawn that his injury was the product of a prior confrontation unrelated to his work activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Indeed, the only explanation Jennifer offers in his complaint for the assault was that Taylor was \u201cunder care by [the State] for mental health problems,\u201d relating to his \u201cviolent disposition\u201d; that he had exhausted the medication he was taking for that problem; and that the State had failed to provide him with additional medication to keep his \u201cpropensity for violent outbursts\u201d in check. There is no suggestion in the complaint that the attack had anything to do with any prior relationship or confrontation with Taylor. And, although Jennifer suggests in his brief, as he did in his unsuccessful opposition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment, that Taylor\u2019s assault was motivated by animus, he offers no explanation or basis for this bald accusation. Hence, <em>Gray </em>has no applicability here.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">This exception to the compensability of at-work injuries\u2014 that is, injury-causing assaults triggered by antecedent quarrels unrelated to the parties\u2019 work \u2014 did not, we observe, originate with <em>Gray. </em>On the contrary, long before <em>Gray, </em>our state\u2019s highest court held that, where evidence of such a quarrel exists, any injuries resulting from an at-work assault precipitated by that quarrel are not compensable. <em>See Rice v. Revere Copper &amp; Brass, Inc., </em>186 Md. 561, 48 A.2d 166 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><em>Rice </em>involved a workers\u2019 compensation claim brought by the widow of a utility worker, whose injury and subsequent death resulted from a fellow employee\u2019s attack at their mutual workplace. Affirming the denial of that claim below, the Court of Appeals held that that attack did not arise out of the employee\u2019s work because there was evidence that \u201can antecedent quarrel, <em>unrelated to the work, </em>[was] the primary cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 48 A.2d 166. (Emphasis added). There apparently had been \u201cbad blood,\u201d the Court observed, between the injured employee and his attacker, concerning, in part, the injured employee\u2019s prior conduct at the attacker\u2019s house. <em>Id. </em>at 565, 48 A.2d 166. The Court further noted that the assault \u201cwas not due to an emotional flare-up generated by friction inseparable from the working conditions, nor was the opportunity for revenge enhanced thereby.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568, 48 A.2d 166.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>In contrast, Taylor\u2019s attack on Jennifer clearly was \u201cgenerated by friction inseparable from [their] working conditions,\u201d specifically, the friction caused by the prison official ordering Taylor to serve his co-worker, Jennifer, a hamburger, while both were working in the prison kitchen. Moreover, Taylor\u2019s \u201copportunity for revenge\u201d was \u201cenhanced\u201d by those working conditions, as his job placed him in close proximity to Jennifer and provided him with the tool with which to carry out the assault. And, finally, as we have pointed out, there was no claim of a prior confrontation between Jennifer and Taylor, only the whisper of a suggestion that there had been \u201canimosity\u201d between the two.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, unlike in <em>Gray </em>and <em>Rice, </em>the assault that injured Jennifer was not triggered by \u201can antecedent quarrel, <em>unrelated to the work,\u201d </em>but was inseparable from the parties\u2019 working conditions and thus did, in fact, \u201carise out of\u2019 his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\n<em>\u201cAccidental Injury\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Anticipating that we might reach this conclusion, Jennifer argues, in the alternative, that, even if his injury arose out of his employment, the circuit court nonetheless erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the State on the grounds that the Sundry Claims Board was his exclusive remedy because, according to Jennifer, \u00a7 10-308<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>SCBA covers only an accidental injury and not an injury that was \u201cinflicted by the willful act of a third party,\u201d as his was.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">But, as the State points out, the term \u201caccidental\u201d is defined in the WCA to expressly include \u201can injury caused by the <em>willful </em>or negligent act of a third person.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) That definition of \u201caccidental\u201d predates the enactment of the SCBA. And, as we previously observed in interpreting the phrase, \u201carising out of\u2019 \u2014 which, like the term \u201caccidental,\u201d is ensconced in both statutes \u2014 the legislature \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>presumed to be aware of the interpretation that this Court has placed upon its enactments,\u201d <em>Del Marr, </em>169 Md.App. at 212, 900 A.2d 243. We must therefore assume that in inserting the term \u201caccidental\u201d in the SCBA, the legislature expected that it would carry the same meaning in the SCBA that it does in the WCA, that is, to include an injury caused by the willful acts of a third party. Indeed, there is no indication in the text or history of \u00a7 10-308 that the General Assembly intended otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Under the WCA, \u201can injury to an employee inflicted by a third person in the course of the employment, either willfully or negligently,\u201d is compensable \u201cif the danger of such injury was an incident of the special conditions of the employment^] that is, if it arose out of the employment.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Edgewood Nursing Home v. Maxwell, </em>282 Md. 422, 425, 384 A.2d 748 (1978) (citing <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Gooch, </em>245 Md. 160, 165, 225 A.2d 431 (1967)). That may be so, Jennifer acknowledges, but he insists that the scope of the term \u201caccidental,\u201d in the context of the SCBA, is narrower and covers only an injury \u201cfrom an accidental cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">To bolster his argument, Jennifer cites one particular part of \u00a7 10-308(a) of the SCBA, which states that, \u201c[i]n determining what compensation, if any, to allow a claimant, the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>shall consider ... the possibility that the alleged injury was self-inflicted or not accidental.\u201d From this statement, Jennifer draws the questionable conclusion that any injury which is not \u201caccidental\u201d falls outside the purview of the Sundry Claims Board. We heartily disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Section 10-308(a), in its entirety, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">In determining what compensation, if any, to allow a claimant, the Board shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">(1) the good faith of the claimant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">(2) <em>the possibility that the alleged injury was self-inflicted or not accidental;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">(3) the extent and nature of the injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">(4) the degree of disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">(5) the period of disability or incapacity for other work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akm\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">(6) the ordinary earning power of the claimant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">The plain language of that provision clearly does not preclude recovery for non-accidental injuries, but only requires that the Sundry Claims Board consider \u201cthe possibility that the alleged injury was self-inflicted or not accidental,\u201d as one of six factors, in deciding whether and at what level to compensate a claimant for an injury he has sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">Moreover, reading \u00a7 10-308(a), not as a set of discrete phrases, but \u201cas a whole, considering the interrelationship or connection among all of its provisions,\u201d as the canons of statutory construction advise us to do, <em>see Coburn v. Coburn, </em>342 Md. 244, 256, 674 A.2d 951 (1996) (citing <em>Vest v. Giant Food Stores, Inc., </em>329 Md. 461, 466-467, 620 A.2d 340 (1993)), we conclude that \u201cnot accidental\u201d is a catch-all phrase and, in that capacity, refers to injuries which, while not technically \u201cself-inflicted,\u201d are ones which the claimant played some role in bringing about. For example, the Board may take into account whether the claimant provoked the assault or sparked the confrontation which caused his injuries. And since, in this case, there is no claim that Jennifer did anything to precipitate Taylor\u2019s attack, that provision is of no relevance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Finally, Jennifer asks us to consider Maryland Code of Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d), 12.05.01.06B.(4)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>, which implements the SCBA, for the proposition that only accidental injuries are covered by that act. But Jennifer\u2019s reliance on COMAR 12.05.01.06B is misplaced. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">Compensation provided for in [the SCBA] ... shall be payable for injuries sustained by prisoners engaged in work under the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">(4) The injury cannot be self-inflicted or result from activities other than work for which wages or a stipulated sum are paid by the institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>This provision contains nothing that suggests that injuries inflicted by third parties are not covered by the SCBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\">.
