We hold that in any proceeding filed pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21, when a defendant objects to utilizing an alternative to the child\u2019s in-court testimony, the judge must adhere to the statutory procedures outlined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4, prior to allowing <em>in camera </em>testimony of a child-witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">In this matter, defendant C.W. appeals from two Family Part orders entered in this Title Nine action initiated by plaintiff, the Division of Youth and Family Services (Division).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first order under review was filed on April 20, 2012, following trial, and included the judge\u2019s findings that C.W.\u2019s daughter, I.N.W., was an abused or neglected child pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.21(e), and C.W. \u201cfailed to provide a minimum degree of care for the child due to her drinking problem.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second order, filed on August 15, 2012, placed I.N.W. in the custody of her adult sibling, awarded custody of her younger sibling to a paternal relative, and concluded the litigation. On appeal, C.W. challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and argues the trial judge erred in grounding her factual findings upon then seventeen-year-old I.N.W.\u2019s <em>in camera </em>interview. Although the procedure followed in this matter did not conform to the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4, defendant did not object to the use of the alternate procedure. Further, the evidence of record, after excluding I.N.W.\u2019s <em>in camera </em>statements, amply supports the judge\u2019s findings of abuse and neglect. Aceord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ingly, we conclude C.W.\u2019s due process rights were not impinged and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">At trial, the Division chose to admit documentary evidence, without objection from defendants or the Law Guardian. This included six multi-page exhibits containing: prior Division records beginning in 1996, substantiating incidents of abuse or neglect by C.W.; Division case notes and reports, redacted by agreement, recording the Division\u2019s investigation of the instant referral and interviews regarding the alleged assault of I.N.W. by C.W. and K.R.; and a report prepared by the Gloucester Township Police Department (GTPD) documenting the investigation of the alleged assault by C.W. and K.R., along with photographs depicting I.N.W.\u2019s injuries. The Division offered no witnesses. Neither C.W. nor K.R. testified. However, K.R. presented testimony from his brother and a friend who were present in the home when the subject altercation occurred. At the close of evidence, the trial judge spoke to I.N.W. in chambers, while counsel and the parties listened, as the interview was broadcast into the courtroom. Prior to the interview, the judge had requested all parties to submit questions to be posed to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">These facts are found in the exhibits admitted into evidence. The GTPD contacted the Division on the evening of December 2, 2011, when sixteen-year-old I.N.W. appeared at the police station with her adult sibling. I.N.W. reported C.W. and K.R. had physically assaulted her at a time when the two had been drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Family Services Specialist Demetrius Briggs and another Division caseworker responded. The Division\u2019s ease notes recited the information obtained from the police station interviews of I.N.W. and her older sibling. At that time, Briggs also recorded his observations of I.N.W.\u2019s physical appearance, stating she had \u201cseveral scratches\u201d on her face, including \u201ca scratch on the left cheek approximately an inch and a half [sic] long; a linear abrasion approximately three inches long on the right side of her neck; an abrasion on the back/left side of her neck; and bruising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>on the left jaw area.\u201d A police officer photographed I.N.W.\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In her interview with Briggs, I.N.W. stated when she returned home from school, C.W. and K.R. had been drinking. She stated \u201ceveryday\u201d C.W. and K.R. drink \u201cbeer and vodka\u201d before she and her sibling return home from school and \u201cboth become very angry when they drink[ ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">C.W. and her youngest child began joking, but the banter turned into an argument when C.W. \u201csuddenly became irritated and started yelling,\u201d purportedly because I.N.W. began laughing. I.N.W. intended to go to the library and may have \u201ccalled her mother crazy,\u201d as she left the residence. C.W. followed I.N.W. outside and \u201cbegan hitting her while her back was turned.\u201d C.W. pushed I.N.W. to the ground and \u201ccontinued to punch and hit her, knocking her into the chair on the porch.\u201d I.N.W. \u201creported as she was on the ground, her mother grabbed her by the throat and was strangling her.\u201d I.N.W. \u201cgrabbed [C.W.j\u2019s wrists,\u201d in an attempt to try to remove her hands from her neck. When C.W. released I.N.W., she got up and ran to her friend\u2019s home and never returned. I.N.W. also told Briggs of an earlier incident when K.R. struck her. Ultimately, I.N.W.\u2019s older sibling was called and drove her to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">That night, Briggs and his co-worker went to the home, accompanied by the GTPD investigating officers. Briggs removed I.N.W. and her younger sibling from their parents\u2019 care and placed them in a resource home. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-12. Thereafter, the Family Part granted the Division custody, care and supervision of both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Briggs also recorded the following notes after his December 2, 2011 investigation. \u201cFrom the time workers entered the home there was a very strong smell of alcohol\u201d emanating from C.W., which police also confirmed. Although coherent, C.W.\u2019s \u201cspeech appeared to be slurred and she smelled of alcohol.\u201d However, no testing was performed to confirm this suspicion. C.W. and K.R. denied drinking before 10:00 p.m.; C.W. stated at that time she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>had consumed three beers. C.W. acknowledged she drinks \u201cmaybe on the weekends, or when a football game is on[,]\u201d but denied being an alcoholic and asserted her family had no previous involvement with the Division. Briggs inspected the premises and found \u201can empty Genuine Draft six[-]pack box in the kitchen and half a bottle of beer in the refrigerator.\u201d Additionally, he observed \u201can empty vodka bottle and three empty beer bottles in the trash can\u201d of C.W.\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Briggs interviewed C.W. in the dining room, while his co-worker interviewed K.R. on the steps. C.W. explained I.N.W. was \u201cvery disrespectful\u201d earlier in the day. C.W. told her to complete her chores, but I.N.W. \u201cwas not listening and was just laughing\u201d and mimicking her. After I.N.W. left the house, again saying something disrespectful, C.W. followed her outside to tell her such behavior was unacceptable. C.W. told Briggs I.N.W. \u201ctook a swipe,\u201d scratching the right side of her jaw line. The police report identified \u201credness and some swelling to [C.W.\u2019s] bottom right jaw.\u201d C.W. told Briggs I.N.W. scratched her, but he noted the scratch was \u201cnot very visible\u201d; rather, C.W. \u201cappeared to be attempting to make a scratch and/or mark appear on her own face\u201d during the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">C.W. admitted she placed her hands on I.N.W.\u2019s chest and pushed her against a wall, as a defensive maneuver. However, she denied I.N.W. fell or was pushed to the ground. She also maintained K.R. did not punch I.N.W. and insisted I.N.W. had no scratches or abrasions when she left the house, subsequently she \u201cmay have scratched herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">KR.\u2019s two trial witnesses described their observations of the day\u2019s events. However, both admitted they did not know when and how the \u201clittle tussle\u201d between C.W. and I.N.W. began, as they did not see the entire altercation. Neither witness observed K.R. strike anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">At the close of testimony, the judge interviewed I.N.W. in chambers. No other party was present. The details of the events described in this interview vary slightly from those recorded by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Briggs. Despite the minor discrepancies, I.N.W. consistently reported the significant events the trial judge relied upon to support her legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The judge issued a written opinion on April 20, 2012. Crediting I. N.W.\u2019s testimony, she found the Division had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that I.N.W. was \u201can abused and/or neglected child within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>The judge memorialized her conclusions in the April 20, 2012 order, and conducted a dispositional hearing immediately thereafter, to address the children\u2019s placements. I.N.W. remained with her resource family until the school year concluded, when she moved to her older sibling\u2019s home. Her younger sibling was placed with a paternal relative, where she remained. On August 15, after a follow-up dispositional hearing, the judge found it was not safe to return either child to C.W.\u2019s care, as she was homeless and only recently commenced substance abuse treatment. The same day, the trial court entered the final order, provided I.N.W. would remain in the custody of her sibling, her younger sibling would remain with relatives, and terminated the litigation. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Our review of determinations made following a bench trial is limited. \u201cA reviewing court should uphold the factual findings undergirding the trial court\u2019s decision if they are supported by \u2018adequate, substantial and credible evidence\u2019 on the record.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. M.M., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>261, 279, 914 A.2d 1265 (2007) (quoting <em>In re Guardianship of J.T., </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 188, 634 A.2d 1361 (App.Div.1993)); <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 411-12, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). We afford particular deference \u201cto factfindings of the family court because it has the superior ability to gauge the credibility of the witnesses who testify before it and because it possesses special expertise in matters related to the family.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. F.M., </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>420, 448, 48 A.3d 1075 (2012). This \u201c \u2018feel of the ease\u2019 ... can never be realized by a review of the cold record.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. E.P., </em>196 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number><em>N.J. </em>88, 104, 952 A.2d 486 (2008) (quoting <em>M.M., supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 293, 914 A.2d 1265). Consequently, a family court\u2019s factual findings \u201cshould not be disturbed unless \u2018they are so wholly insupportable as to result in a denial of justice[.]\u2019\u201d <em>J.T., supra, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 188, 634 A.2d 1361 (quoting <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-84, 323 A.2d 495 (1974)). <em>See also N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. F.M., </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>235, 259, 867 A.2d 499 (App.Div.2005) (\u201cWhen the credibility of witnesses is an important factor, the trial court\u2019s conclusions must be given great weight and must be accepted by the appellate court unless clearly lacking in reasonable support.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Reversal is warranted only when a trial judge\u2019s findings are \u201c\u2018so manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with the competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the interests of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rova Farms, supra, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>at 484, 323 A.2d 495 (quoting <em>Fagliarone v. Twp. of N. Bergen, </em>78 <em>N.J.Super. </em>154, 155, 188 A.2d 43 (App.Div), <em>certif. denied, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>221, 191 A.2d 61 (1963)). Further, the trial judge\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts\u201d are not subject to deference and are reviewed de novo by this court de novo. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On appeal, C.W. argues the judge erred by conducting an <em>in camera </em>interview of then seventeen-year-old I.N.W., \u201crather than requiring her to testify,\u201d a practice which C.W. suggests contravenes the plain language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-32.4, and \u201cabrogate[s] [her] due process rights.\u201d C.W. also maintains the judge failed to administer an oath to I.N.W. and merely discussed with her the importance of telling the truth and obtained her assurance she understood the need to \u201cbe honest[.]\u201d C.W. insists these defects require the trial judge\u2019s factual findings be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The Division and the Law Guardian argue any error resulting from the <em>in camera </em>interview was harmless. Alternatively, the Division and Law Guardian maintain the procedures employed by the trial judge precisely complied with <em>Rule </em>5:12-4(b), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>grants the judge discretion to take the child\u2019s testimony \u201cprivately in chambers,\u201d and were not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We agree the statute was not followed in this proceeding. I.N.W. was over sixteen years-ol'-age and the record on appeal does not include judicial findings to support the necessity of an <em>in camera </em>proceeding in lieu of the child\u2019s trial testimony. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4. Nevertheless, we determine the record reflects sufficient credible evidence, aside from I.N.W.\u2019s <em>in camera </em>statements, which fully support the trial judge\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u201cOur decisional law has ... recognized the State\u2019s interests in eliciting testimony of child abuse.... \u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. J.B., </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>112, 126, 576 A.2d 261 (1990). In that regard, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4 provides the framework for taking a child\u2019s closed circuit testimony in abuse and neglect proceedings, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">a. ... in any action alleging an abused or neglected child under <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 to -8.73J, the court may, on motion and after conducting a hearing <em>in camera, </em>order the taking of the testimony of a witness on closed circuit television at the trial, out of the view of ... defendant, ... as provided in subsection b. of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">b. An order under this section may be made only if the court finds that the witness is 16 years of age or younger and that there is a substantial likelihood that the witness would suffer severe emotional or mental distress if required to testify in open court. The order shall be specific as to whether the witness will testify outside the presence of ... defendant, ... and shall be based on specific findings relating to the impact of the presence of each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">d. The defendant\u2019s counsel shall be present at the taking of testimony <em>in camera.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">The statute also applies to specified criminal proceedings, when the testimony of a child-witness is necessary. <em>Ibid. </em>Certainly, the statutory protections are designed to preserve a criminal defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses, as granted by the Sixth Amendment of our federal Constitution through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. VI and XIV, and by the New Jersey Constitution, <em>N.J. Const., </em>Art. I, par. 10. <em>In re B.F., </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>153, 158, 553 A.2d 40 (App.Div.1989) (citing <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>Washington, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 191, 494 A.2d 335 (App.Div. 1985)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">The basic elements of confrontation are physical presence, oath, cross-examination, and observation of demeanor by the trier of fact. <em>[Maryland </em>v] <em>Craig, </em>[ ] 497 <em>U.S. </em>[836,] 846, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>[3157,] 3163, 111 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>[666,] 678 [ (1990) ]. However, \u201c[t]he central concern of the Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 845, 110 <em>S.Ct </em>at 3163, 111 L.Ed.2d at 678.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\"><em>[State v. Smith, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>376, 385, 730 A.2d 311 (1999).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The focus in civil matters, such as this one, differs. \u201c[A]l-though the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation is not applicable in civil proceedings, due process guarantees civil litigants a measure of confrontation.\u201d <em>A.B. v. Y.Z., </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>599, 604, 878 A.2d 807 (2005) (citation omitted). At the same time, public policy requires the judiciary to prevent further victimization or traumatization of young children called to testify in court proceedings. Our Supreme Court has cautioned a \u201cchild\u2019s fear ... prevents] the proper functioning of the truth-finding proeess[.]\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 387, 730 A.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Moreover, our court rules contain provisions governing proceedings initiated by the Division, when a child\u2019s testimony may be necessary. <em>See Rule </em>5:12-1 to -7. The Division and Law Guardian rely on <em>Rule </em>5:12-4(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">Hearings and trials shall be conducted in private. In the child\u2019s best interests, the court may order that a child not be present at a hearing or trial unless the child\u2019s testimony is necessary for the determination of the matter. The testimony of a child may, in the court\u2019s discretion, be taken privately in chambers or under such protective orders as the court may provide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\"><em>See also N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs, v. S.S., </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>3, 6, 447 A.2d 183 (App.Div.) (approving use of \u201cthe somewhat novel procedure utilized by the judge\u201d for interviewing a child-witness in chambers with the minor\u2019s law guardian present and defendant, who was charged with child abuse, permitted to submit questions he wished the judge to ask), <em>certif. denied, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>572, 453 A.2d 883 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>In considering, the Division and Law Guardian\u2019s suggestion that compliance with <em>Rule </em>5:12-4(b) is all that is required when a Family Part judge exercises his or her discretion to conduct an <em>in camera </em>interview of a child, we have located no decisional authority regarding the application of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-32.4 in Title Nine actions nor have we found any discussion of how the statute interfaces with the court rules governing proceedings initiated by the Division. We note both the statute and rule require the exercise of reasoned discretion, when determining whether to allow a child to be questioned using an alternative procedure, instead of being required to take the stand. <em>See B.F., supra, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 158, 553 A.2d 40 (\u201c[T]he decision as to whether one is to be granted relief under the statute is in the sound discretion of the court.\u201d); <em>see also R. </em>5:12-4(b). Also, both the statute and the rule require a judge to make specific findings warranting use of alternate procedures. This court has found \u201c[tjrial judges have broad discretion in abuse and neglect cases ... to conduct a private examination of a child.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. L.A., </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>155, 168, 814 A.2d 656 (App.Div. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Under <em>Rule </em>5:12-4(b), the testimony of a child taken in chambers or under provisions of a protective order allows the judge to pursue an inquiry in a less intrusive atmosphere for a child whose \u201ctestimony is necessary for the determination of the matter.\u201d To that extent, the provisions of the rule do not conflict with <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-32.4. However, a child-witness\u2019s testimony that is necessary to determine a matter pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21, is expressly governed by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-32.4. Accordingly, we conclude when a Title Nine defendant objects to utilizing a procedure other than presenting a child\u2019s in-court testimony, the trial judge must follow the requisites of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-32.4a to -c, including first making detailed findings of the necessity of an alternative to the child\u2019s in-court testimony, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-32.4(b). Any alternate procedures used must assure protection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>a defendant\u2019s due process rights and the order must also detail the procedures used to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Also, when a minor child is summoned to testify using an alternative procedure, the judge must determine whether the child-witness is competent to testify, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>601, and comprehends the need to tell the truth. <em>Morrone v. Morrone, </em>44 <em>N. J.Super. </em>305, 313, 130 A.2d 396 (App.Div.1957). The child must be placed under oath, or instructed of the need to tell the truth and determined to understand that obligation. <em>See State v. G.C., </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>118, 132-33, 902 A.2d 1174 (2006) (stating in taking testimony from a child-witness \u201cthe clearly preferred procedure would have entailed the use of an oath or oath substitute that acknowledged both the obligation to testify truthfully and that the failure to do so could result in adverse consequences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The child-witness also must be available for cross-examination. Most assuredly, presentation of testimony from a child-witness requires sensitivity, and most parents would demur when faced with the prospect of forcing a child to appear in court. While we do not suggest every child-witness should face the unbridled interrogation of skilled counsel, we remain confident our Family Part judges may craft procedures acceptable to the parties to assure the child is not subjected to badgering or harshness, while nonetheless protecting a defendant\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Turning to the record in this matter, we cannot determine who initiated the <em>in camera </em>interview procedure. We do know that neither C.W. nor K.R. requested I.N.W. take the stand and neither objected to using this alternative procedure. The record also reflects the parties reached a consensus on the nature of the documentary evidence once the Division provided photographs corroborating I.N.W.\u2019s injuries, such that the exhibits, as redacted, were admitted without objection. Perhaps this explains why the trial judge did not consider the statute\u2019s plain language\u2014no one thought it necessary and the parties never questioned the use of an <em>in camera </em>interview of I.N.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>However, our determination is not concluded by the apparent acceptance of the process. \u201cBecause due process guarantees civil litigants a measure of confrontation, the burden to prove the denial of such confrontation harmless ... rests with plaintiff[ ], who benefited from the circumscription of defendant\u2019s right to face his accuser.\u201d <em>A.B., supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 605, 878 A.2d 807 (citing <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>18, 24, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>824, 828, 17 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>705, 710 (1967)). Accordingly, we must consider whether C.W. was given a sufficient opportunity to confront the Division\u2019s evidence in light of the interview procedures followed by the judge. The analysis is twofold: was C.W. prejudiced by the procedure utilized, and did the Division\u2019s other evidence satisfy its burden of proof. We conclude C.W. was not prejudiced by the <em>in camera </em>interview procedure because she had the opportunity to confront the Division\u2019s evidence, which standing alone proved by a preponderance of the evidence I.N.W. was an abused or neglected child.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">By definition, actions under Title Nine seek to impose protective services when parental conduct jeopardizes a child\u2019s safety and security.

Such a finding cannot be based solely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201cprevious statements made by the child relating to any allegation of abuse or neglect,\u201d without further corroboration. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.46a(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">C.W. was provided with all evidence the Division intended to rely upon to prove its ease. She was also given the names of the investigating police officers and the photographs taken by police on December 2, 2011. C.W. was afforded the opportunity to present interview questions to be posed to I.N.W., and, as noted during the pre-trial conference, could have requested additional inquiries if prompted by the child\u2019s responses. The judge also advised rebuttal testimony could be offered after I.N.W.\u2019s interview. C.W. heard I.N.W.\u2019s interview as it was conducted, and was represented by and readily able to confer with counsel during the entire proceeding. The totality of these procedures safeguarded C.W.\u2019s ability to consider the evidence presented by the Division to support its complaint, allowed her to challenge that evidence, and enabled her to assist in and present her defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">If I.N.W.\u2019s interview statements are excluded, we easily conclude the remaining uneontroverted evidence demonstrates C.W.\u2019s conduct resulted in I.N.W. being an abused child. <em>See N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. C.M., </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 201, 436 A.2d 1158 (N.J.Juv. &amp; Dom.Rel.1981) (when determining whether a child is abused or neglected, the court must \u201cevaluat[e] the whole picture each part cannot be separately determined.\u201d). The Division proved C.W. struck, punched, scratched, and attempted to strangle I.N.W. on December 2, 2011, because she was angry. Although C.W. suggested I.N.W. initiated the altercation by swinging at her, that possibility does not excuse the resultant physical assault on her teenage daughter. Further, C.W.\u2019s alcohol abuse was documented in the case notes and verified by observation of the police and the caseworkers, who found empty beer and vodka bottles in her bedroom. Subsequent substance abuse evaluations, also substantiated C.W.\u2019s need for treatment. These facts emphasized the need for court intervention to prevent further injury to I.N.W. and her younger sibling. Based upon the totality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>of the evidence, we conclude the Division proved its case and any possible error resulting from the trial judge\u2019s <em>in camera </em>interview' of I.N.W. was not \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The remaining arguments advanced by C.W. on appeal lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in our opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E). Following our review, we find no basis to set aside the court\u2019s orders. <em>See A.B., supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 606, 878 A.2d 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\"> On June 29, 2012, the Governor signed into law A-3101, which reorganizes the Department of Children and Families, including the renaming of the Division as the Division of Child Protection and Permanency. <em>L. </em>2012, <em>c. </em>16, eff.
