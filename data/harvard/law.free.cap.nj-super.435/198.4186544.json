Before trial, Van Aulen and Liebowitz were granted summary judgment, while defendants\u2019 motions seeking summary judgment dismissing the complaint were denied. The court also sua sponte severed defendants\u2019 third-party complaint against Carrascosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Immediately before trial, defendants moved to exclude any claim for counsel fees, and to bar the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 professional expert, attorney George Conk. The judge denied both requests. The judge reserved decision on defendants\u2019 motion to bar plaintiffs\u2019 claims for emotional distress damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to establish proximate cause, and to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claims for emotional distress damages. The judge denied both requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs and awarded damages of $700,000 to Innes and $250,000 to Victoria. On May 20, 2011, judgment was entered that also included pre-judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>interest of $133,815.07 for Innes and $47,791.09 for Victoria. On June 28, 2011, the judge entered an amended order for judgment that additionally included counsel fees and costs for Innes and Victoria in the amounts of $158,517.70 and $126,397.07, respectively-</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Defendants moved for a new trial or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), which the judge denied after initially reserving decision. The judge granted a stay of judgment pending disposition of the third-party complaint against Carrascosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">On July 18, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to participate in the trial of defendants\u2019 third-party complaint against Carrascosa and to \u201cbar[ ] the allocation of fault at ... trial.\u201d In a written opinion, the judge dismissed defendants\u2019 third-party complaint with prejudice, concluding essentially that defendants were not entitled to contribution from Carrascosa. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Defendants raise myriad arguments regarding the interlocutory orders denying their pre-trial motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the complaint, as well as the orders granting Van Aulen and Liebowitz summary judgment. As to the trial itself, defendants contend the judge erred by permitting Conk to testify, allowing the jury to award emotional distress damages without any medical testimony and amending his charge to the jury after defendants\u2019 summation. Defendants also argue their motions for judgment and JNOV should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Defendants also contend their third-party claim against Carrascosa should not have been severed from the trial, and the judge erred by ultimately dismissing the complaint. Lastly, defendants contest the award of any counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">We have considered these arguments in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for entry of an amended judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We first consider defendants\u2019 arguments regarding the pre-trial orders granting Van Aulen and Liebowitz summary judgment. We need not set forth the entire factual history between Innes and Carrascosa, which was detailed in our prior opinion, <em>see Innes, supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 461-65, 918 A.2d 686, and we limit our consideration as necessary to the motion record that existed when the orders were entered. <em>See, e.g., Ji v. Palmer, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. 451, </em>463-64, 755 A.2d 1221 (App.Div.2000) (\u201cIn reviewing a summary judgment, we can consider the case only as it had been unfolded to that point and the evidential material submitted on that motion.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In October 2004, Innes and Carrascosa were separated but neither had filed a divorce complaint. Innes was represented by Van Aulen, and Carrascosa was represented by Liebowitz. Victoria was four and one-half years old and resided with Carrascosa after the separation. It suffices to say that the instant litigation centered on the October 2004 agreement (the Agreement) executed by Innes and Carrascosa as it related to restrictions upon travel with Victoria. <em>Innes, supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 462, 918 A.2d 686. Specifically, the Agreement, drafted by Liebowitz on his letterhead, provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">Neither ... Carrascosa nor ... Innes may travel outside of the United States with Victoria ... without the written permission of the other party. To that end, Victorians] ... United States and Spanish passport [sic] shall be held in trust by Mitchell A. Liebowitz, Esq. Victoria[\u2019s] ... Spanish passport has been lost and not replaced, and its loss was reported to the Spanish Consulate in New York____ Carascosa [sic] will file an application for a replacement Spanish passport within [twenty] days of today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>On November 23, 2004, Liebowitz responded to a letter written by Sarah J. Jacobs, an associate with the Lesnevieh firm, advising that Carrascosa had retained them and seeking release of the file.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Liebowitz wrote: \u201cAs you may know, I am holding her daughter\u2019s United States Passport. I would prefer if you arranged for the original file to be picked up by messenger with the messenger acknowledging receipt of the passport.\u201d On November 24, Jacobs wrote to Van Aulen, indicating the Lesnevieh firm\u2019s representation of Carrascosa and noting that, despite having signed the Agreement, Carrascosa \u201cha[d] grave concerns\u201d regarding provisions dealing with Innes\u2019 parenting time. Notes taken by Jacobs during an office conference with Carrascosa on November 18, 2004, were filed in support of both Van Aulen\u2019s and Liebowitz\u2019s summary judgment motions. The notes contained the following: \u201cSpanish passport stole[n.] American passport turned over to attorney!.] GET BACK!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In her deposition, Marzano-Lesnevieh stated she received the file from Liebowitz and reviewed the Agreement sometime in December. Victoria\u2019s United States passport was in the file at the time, but it was missing after a December meeting with Carrascosa. The implication was that Carrascosa had taken the passport without Marzano-Lesnevich\u2019s foreknowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">It was first revealed that Victoria was in Spain during proceedings before the Family Part in February 2005. In a February 2006 letter to plaintiffs\u2019 attorney in this litigation, Marzano-Lesnevieh claimed Liebowitz never advised her of \u201ca requirement to hold [the passport] in trust.\u201d She also wrote: <em>\u201cAt the time we turned over the passport to the mother, </em>the [A]greement between the parties was moot!,]\u201d because \u201cit had been repudiated by both parties immediately.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">On this motion record, in December 2009, the judge granted Van Aulen summary judgment and dismissed the third-party claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>against him. Defendants moved for reconsideration in August 2010 after securing the expert report of attorney John F. DeBartolo. In November 2010, the judge denied the motion for reconsideration. In his written opinion, the judge explained: \u201cBased on the facts herein, Van Aulen cannot be classified as a joint tortfeasor because he did not breach his duty to Innes and did not have a duty to anticipate that [defendants] would violate a fiduciary obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Liebowitz sought summary judgment in August 2010. In support, he attached defendants\u2019 answers to interrogatories in which they claimed that Carrascosa \u201ctook her daughter\u2019s passport. No one [at the firm] \u2018gave it\u2019 to her or \u2018turned it over to her.\u2019 \u201d They also denied knowing that Carrascosa intended to \u201cremove Victoria ... from the jurisdiction o[f] New Jersey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">By the time Liebowitz\u2019s motion was filed, Jacobs had been deposed. She testified that Marzano-Lesnevich told her that she (Marzano-Lesnevich) gave Victoria\u2019s passport to Carrascosa. Carrascosa had also been deposed and testified that she always had Victoria\u2019s Spanish passport and it was never lost or stolen. Carrascosa asked the Lesnevich firm for Victoria\u2019s United States passport and picked it up the day before her daughter travelled to Spain with her grandparents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Carrascosa also stated that she told the firm \u201cwe were going to travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In November 2010, the judge granted summary judgment to Liebowitz. In his written opinion, the judge concluded that after Carrascosa discharged him, Liebowitz could not have reasonably anticipated that Innes would continue to rely on his (Liebowitz\u2019s) actions or representations. Liebowitz did not owe a duty of care to Innes after transferring his file containing the passport to the Lesnevich firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Defendants argue the judge erred by denying their motion for reconsideration of the prior summary judgment granted to Van Aulen and by granting Liebowitz summary judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cIn an appeal of an order granting summary judgment, appellate courts \u2018employ the same standard [of review] that governs the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henry v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>320, 330, 9 A.3d 882 (2010) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Busciglio v. Della-Fave, </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 139, 840 A.2d 897 (App.Div.2004)). We first determine whether the moving party has demonstrated there were no genuine disputes as to material facts. <em>Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hillside Bottling Co., Inc., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>224, 230, 903 A.2d 513 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>104, 912 A.2d 1264 (2006).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">[A1 determination whether there exists a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d of material fact that precludes summary judgment requires the motion judge to consider whether the competent evidential materials presented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, are sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\"><em>[Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am,., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANE\">We then decide \u201cwhether the motion judge\u2019s application of the law was correct.\u201d <em>Atl. Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 231, 903 A.2d 513. We conduct our review de novo. <em>Gere v. Louis, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>486, 499, 38 A.3d 591 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Defendants were entitled to contribution from Van Aulen or Liebowitz only if either respectively was a joint tortfeasor, pursuant to the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-1 to -5 (JTCL). Under the JTCL, \u201c \u2018joint tortfeasors\u2019 means two or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the same injury.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-1. \u201c \u2018It is common liability at the time of the accrual of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action which is the Sine qua non of defendant\u2019s contribution right.\u2019\u201d <em>Cherry Hill Manor </em>Assocs. <em>v. Faugno, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>64, 72, 861 A.2d 123 (2004) (quoting <em>Markey v. Skog, </em>129 <em>N.J.Super. </em>192, 200, 322 A.2d 513 (Law Div.1974)). Since plaintiffs never asserted any claim against either Van Aulen or Liebowitz, the inquiry is whether defendants presented a prima facie case that either was liable to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u201cThe elements of a cause of action for legal malpractice are (1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship creating a duty of care by the defendant attorney, (2) the breach of that duty by the defendant, and (3) proximate causation of the damages claimed by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>McGrogan v. Till, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>414, 425, 771 A.2d 1187 (2001) (citing <em>Conklin v. Hannoch Weisman, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>395, 416, 678 A.2d 1060 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Defendants failed to present a prima facie case that Van Aulen committed legal malpractice in his representation of Innes. When Van Aulen first moved for summary judgment, defendants produced no expert report supporting the elements of professional negligence. <em>See e.g., Buchanan v. Leonard, </em>428 <em>N.J.Super. 211, </em>288-289, 52 A.3d 1064 (App.Div.2012) (\u201cAs 'the duties a lawyer owes to his client are not known by the average juror,\u2019 expert testimony must necessarily set forth that duty and explain the breach.\u201d) (quoting <em>Carbis Sales, Inc. v. Eisenberg, </em>397 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64, 78, 935 A.2d 1236 (App.Div.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">When defendants sought reconsideration, they furnished DeBartolo\u2019s report. While the report proposed some \u201cstraightforward and prudent steps\u201d Van Aulen might have taken, it did not state that he breached any professional standards or that proximately-caused damages resulted. Indeed, DeBartolo opined that, because Carrascosa was solely responsible for removing Victoria from the United States, defendants themselves were not a proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number> The record also fails to support a claim that Liebowitz, who was not Innes\u2019s attorney, could be liable for breaching a duty owed to a non-client. Although our courts are generally reluctant to permit a non-client to sue an adversary\u2019s attorney, <em>LoBiondo v. Schwartz, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>62, 100, 970 A.2d 1007 (2009), in limited circumstances, \u201cattorneys may owe a duty of care to non-clients when the attorneys know, or should know, that non-clients will rely on the attorneys\u2019 representations and the non-clients are not too remote from the attorneys to be entitled to protection.\u201d <em>Petrillo v. Bachenberg, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>472, 483-84, 655 A.2d 1354 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u201c[T]he rule announced in <em>Petrillo </em>has been applied rather sparingly, ... [but] [i]t is not ... the only basis on which [the Court] ha[s] recognized the potential for a direct claim against an attorney by a nonclient.\u201d <em>LoBiondo, supra, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>at 102, 970 A.2d 1007. The Court has \u201cauthorized in principle a claim against an attorney who participated in a civil conspiracy with the goal of assisting a client to engage in a fraudulent transfer of assets to the detriment of a lender.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Banco Popular N. Am. v. Gandi, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>161, 177-78, 876 A.2d 253 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">We have also recognized that \u201c[p]rivity between an attorney and a non-client is not necessary for a duty to attach \u2018where the attorney had reason to foresee the specific harm which occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estate of Albanese v. Lolio, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>355, 368-69, 923 A.2d 325 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Albright v. Burns, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>625, 633, 503 A.2d 386 (App.Div.1986)). Ultimately, in determining whether a duty exists, \u201c[t]he primary question ... is one of fairness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 923 A.2d 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">In this case, Innes knew that Liebowitz had been discharged, and that defendants were now representing Carrascosa. At that point, he could no longer reasonably rely upon Liebowitz\u2019s agreement to retain Victoria\u2019s passport. Absent such reliance, Liebowitz owed no duty of care to plaintiffs. <em>Petrillo, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 482, 655 A.2d 1354. Liebowitz could not reasonably foresee that, armed with full knowledge of the agreement and his expressed caution regarding the passport, defendants would simply turn it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>over to Carrascosa. Absent any reliance by Innes upon Liebowitz\u2019s continued retention of the passport, it would be patently unfair to extend a duty to Liebowitz to safeguard the passport after he was discharged by Carrascosa. <em>Albanese, supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 369, 923 A.2d 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Summary judgment was properly granted dismissing defendants\u2019 third-party complaint against Van Aulen and Liebowitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Defendants argue the judge erred by denying their motion for summary judgment before trial. In essence, they contend the motion record failed to establish, and the judge did not find, that defendants owed Innes any duty, or that they made any representations upon which Innes reasonably relied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In denying defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, the judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">[Liability may be imposed on [defendants], not merely because [defendants] violated an BPC, but because of the affirmative acts of [defendants], specifically, the letters [defendants] sent to Liebowitz, [defendants\u2019] awareness of the Agreement regarding Victoria\u2019s United States passport, accepting the passport with Carrascosa\u2019s file, and the notes and deposition testimony of the [defendants\u2019] associates referencing the importance of the United States passport.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">The judge also concluded that a fact finder could determine that defendants should have foreseen Innes would rely upon them to retain Victoria\u2019s passport, return it to Liebowitz if they were not going to honor the agreement, or at least not let the passport fall into Carrascosa\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">We agree with defendants that whether a legal duty exists is a matter of law for the court. <em>Petrillo, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 479, 655 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>A.2d 1354. But, contrary to defendants\u2019 assertions, the motion judge decided there was a duty. We discern defendants\u2019 argument more precisely to be that since they made no affirmative representation to honor the agreement, imposing a duty upon them to maintain possession of Victoria\u2019s passport unreasonably extends existing precedent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">As already noted, we have held a duty to a non-client may \u201cattach where the attorney had reason to foresee the specific harm which occurred.\u201d <em>Albanese, supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 368-69, 923 A.2d 325 (internal quotations omitted). It was entirely foreseeable that Carrascosa\u2019s possession of Victoria\u2019s passport would facilitate her ability to remove her daughter from the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">A lawyer may also be liable to a non-client third party \u201cwhere an independent duty is owed.\u201d <em>Estate of Fitzgerald v. Linnus, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super </em>458, 468, 765 A.2d 251 (App.Div.2001) (citing <em>Davin, L.L.C. v. Daham, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super </em>54, 73-75, 746 A.2d 1034 (App.Div.2000); <em>DeAngelis v.

Neither the landlords nor Jaffe advised the defendants-tenants of the foreclosure proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 746 A.2d 1034. The motion judge granted summary judgment, \u201cconcluding] that Jaffe owed no duty to [the] defendants since he had never represented them or spoke to them, and would have been acting adversely to the best interests of his clients, the [landlords], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>if he advised [the] defendants of the [landlords\u2019] financial difficulties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 746 A.2d 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In reversing summary judgment, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">The practice of law is a profession, not a business. An attorney is not merely a hired gun, but, rather, a professional required to act with candor and honesty____ Jaffe, as an attorney who participated to the extent he did in the efforts to stave off foreclosure, had an affirmative obligation to be fair and candid with [the] defendants. Moreover, he had an obligation not to insert the covenant of quiet enjoyment in the lease. He had an obligation to advise his clients ... that they should disclose to defendants the fact that the property was in foreclosure. He also had a duty to advise his clients that the lease should not contain a covenant of quiet enjoyment in light of the fact that it was highly unlikely that [the] defendants would obtain the benefits of the covenant in light of the foreclosure. If they failed <em>to </em>follow his advice, he had the right, if not the duty, to cease representing them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 76-77, 78, 746 A.2d 1034.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">We held that \u201cthe lawyer\u2019s duty of effective and vigorous representation of his client is tempered by his corresponding duty to be fair, candid and forthright.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 746 A.2d 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">In denying defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion here, the judge properly concluded that, despite the lack of any affirmative representation, defendants owed a duty to Innes. If they were unwilling to abide by the agreement, they were obligated to so advise Van Aulen or Liebowitz. Simply giving the passport to Carrascosa was a breach of defendants\u2019 duty, even if they believed in good faith that the Agreement had been \u201crepudiated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">Not only is this obligation entirely consistent with prior precedent, it is consistent with the <em>Rules of Professional Conduct </em>(RPC). While \u201ca cause of action for malpractice cannot be based exclusively on the asserted breach of\u2019 an <em>RPC, </em>\u201cit is clear that the <em>[RPCs </em>] may be relied on as prescribing the requisite standard of care and the scope of the attorney\u2019s duty to the client.\u201d <em>Gilles v. Wiley, Malehorn &amp; Sirota, </em>345 <em>N. J.Super. </em>119, 125, 783 A.2d 756 (App.Div.2001) (citing <em>Baxt v.

Therefore, a breach of an <em>RPC </em>\u201cis evidential of [a] defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the required standard of care.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>at 125-26, 783 A.2d 756 (citation omitted); <em>see also Johnson v. Schragger, Lavine, Nagy &amp; Krasny, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 90, 773 A.2d 1164 (App.Div.2001) (noting that \u201cthe Rules of Professional Conduct may provide guidance to the court in determining whether a duty exists\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\"><em>RPC </em>1.15(a) requires a lawyer to appropriately safeguard the property of clients or third parties in his or her possession. <em>RPC </em>1.15(b) obligates a lawyer to promptly notify a third party of receipt of property in which the third party has an interest. \u201cExcept as stated in this <em>Rule </em>or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or third person any ... property that the client or third person is entitled to receive.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The clear import of these <em>RPCs </em>is that, in light of the Agreement and Innes\u2019s competing claim to the passport as Victoria\u2019s father, defendants were not free to dispose of the passport as they saw fit. The judge properly denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">We turn to the issues raised regarding the trial itself by first reviewing some of the testimony. Carrascosa was a Spanish citizen and an attorney admitted to practice in the European Union. Victoria was a citizen of both the United States and Spain. Innes was concerned that Carrascosa might take Victoria to Spain, and he noted that, while Victoria also had a Spanish passport, the family used the United States passport whenever it traveled to Spain.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Although the Agreement had been executed by both parties, problems arose immediately. On November 22, 2004, Carrascosa obtained a domestic violence temporary restraining order (TRO) against Innes. Liebowitz testified that he advised Carrascosa against the filing, \u201cgiven [the] facts she was presenting to [him] in support of the restraining order.\u201d The issuance of the TRO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>resulted in the suspension of Innes\u2019s parenting time with Victoria.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">On December 8, 2004, Liebowitz transferred his entire file, including Victoria\u2019s United States passport, to defendants. Efforts to negotiate a parenting time schedule thereafter were contentious and fruitless. Innes\u2019s last visit with his daughter took place on November 4, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Innes first learned that his daughter was in Spain when Marzano-Lesnevich disclosed the information to the Family Part judge during the hearing in February 2005. Innes subsequently was told by law enforcement authorities that Victoria left the country on January 13, 2005, with her maternal grandfather aboard a British Airways Flight to London. She and her grandfather then traveled from England to Spain.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Innes retained a Spanish lawyer, Elena Zarraluqui, to assist with filing a petition to return his daughter and contest the annulment proceedings that Carrascosa had commenced in Spain.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Innes went to Spain for a hearing in June 2005. The Spanish court denied Innes\u2019s petition and ordered Victoria to remain in Spain until age eighteen. Innes, through Zarraluqui, filed several unsuccessful appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Innes returned to Spain in fall 2005 for the nullity proceeding in which Carrascosa sought, among other relief, termination of his parental rights. According to Innes, at the time of the trial in this case, the issue remained undecided. During both trips to Spain, Innes briefly saw Victoria. Zarraluqui testified that she asked Carrascosa\u2019s lawyer if Innes and Victoria could speak to each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>other. Carrascosa initially agreed, but then tried to prevent Victoria from going to her father, and Carrascosa\u2019s lawyer had to intervene. Zarraluqui said that Victoria was \u201creally kind with him,\u201d that Innes kissed her and started crying when Carrascosa ended the meeting after five or ten minutes. Zarraluqui described the scene as \u201cvery hard, emotional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Innes never returned to Spain again, explaining that fourteen criminal complaints had been filed against him and three were still pending. He denied committing any crime or abusing Carrascosa or Victoria. Given the notoriety of the case and the wealth and position of Carrascosa\u2019s family, Innes believed he would be unjustly accused and imprisoned if he returned. Innes\u2019 attempts to maintain a relationship with Victoria were rebuffed by Carrascosa\u2019s family. Aside from a brief telephone conversation in 2007, he has not spoken to her since their 2005 meeting in the courthouse. The family refuses to accept delivery of the Christmas and birthday gifts Innes sends every year.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Innes testified extensively regarding his relationship with his daughter prior to her leaving the country in January 2005. He moved his office to the ground floor of the couple\u2019s high-rise apartment building so he could be close to home and see her frequently. After the couple separated, he saw Victoria nearly every day until Carrascosa ordered him to stay away.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Innes also stated that he thinks about \u201cthis whole situation\u201d every day, cannot sleep and his business suffered. He received treatment from his doctor for anxiety, and he saw a therapist, who \u201chelped [him] learn how to grieve the loss of [his] daughter,\u201d although he admitted seeing the therapist infrequently in 2009 and not at all since.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">In 2006, Carrascosa returned to the United States for the divorce trial, leaving Victoria in Spain with her grandparents. On August 24, 2006, the Family Part granted the parties a divorce, awarded Innes sole legal and residential custody of Victoria, ordered Carrascosa to dismiss all actions in Spain and return Victoria to New Jersey within ten days. The court imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>sanctions of $148,000 in favor of Innes. Carrascosa did not comply with any of these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Carrascosa was arrested in New York City in November 2006 and subsequently indicted. She was found guilty and sentenced to a prison term of fourteen years. At the time of trial, Carrascosa remained incarcerated and testified via video conference. She accused Innes of attempting to murder Victoria and said she filed the TRO because of Innes\u2019s \u201crelentless stalking, abuse, [and] battering.\u201d She claimed that she signed the Agreement under duress and repudiated it \u201cthe very next day,\u201d something she told Marzano-Lesnevich.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Carrascosa claimed that she asked Jacobs to retrieve Victoria\u2019s passport from Liebowitz because she wanted to travel with her daughter. She told Innes about her plans, and he replied: \u201cAll right. Go ahead. Get on the boat.\u201d She also told another associate at the Lesnevieh firm, Francesca Marzano-Lesnevich (Francesca),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> who told Carrascosa \u201cthey had spoken to ... Van Aulen on the phone and everything was okay.\u201d In an e-mail dated January 11, 2005, Carrascosa notified the Lesnevieh firm that she was going to stop by. She then arrived in the reception area where Francesca gave her the passport. Carrascosa confirmed that she had never lost Victoria\u2019s Spanish passport, and that her daughter was still in Spain.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The judge conducted a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing and denied defendants\u2019 request to bar Conk as an expert witness.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Succinctly stated, Conk rendered the following opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">It was the duty of Marzano-Lesnevich as successor in fact to the possessory right of Liebowitz to inform Innes via his attorney and Liebowitz, who reasonably expected Marzano-Lesnevich to abide by the agreement, that she intended to dispose of the passport as her client sought fit and that she was renouncing any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>obligation to operate under the constraints imposed by the agreement on her predecessor ... attorney. If adequate notice of such intention had been givenL,] Liebowitz could have retaken possession and Innes or his attorney could have sought the assistance of a court if a ... new escrow agent, could not be agreed upon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Thomas Kilbride, who worked for the Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), testified that he received a request from the Bergen County Prosecutor\u2019s Office to determine Victoria\u2019s travel history to and from the United States. His examination of ICE\u2019s database showed Victoria left the country from Newark Liberty International Airport on January 13, 2005, using her United States passport, as she had on September 12, and December 11, 2003, and January 8, 2004. Kilbride acknowledged that a person with dual citizenship could depart the United States using a foreign passport, but his search failed to reveal any record of Victoria ever leaving the United States using her Spanish passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Plaintiffs read Marzano-Lesnevich\u2019s deposition testimony and defendants\u2019 interrogatory answers to the jury that implied Carrascosa took the passport without the firm\u2019s foreknowledge. However, Jacobs testified that Marzano-Lesnevich said she gave the passport to Carrascosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">In her testimony before the jury, Marzano-Lesnevich admitted that she did not notify Innes or Van Aulen before giving Carrascosa her daughter\u2019s passport. She believed that because neither she nor Liebowitz held the passport in trust, Carrascosa, the parent with primary residential custody, had the right to safeguard the passport herself. Marzano-Lesnevich knew of the Agreement and that Carrascosa had signed it, but she maintained it was repudiated because no one had followed its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Marzano-Lesnevich described the passport as \u201csimply abandoned by ... Liebowitz and placed in a file.\u201d She maintained that she did not have the right to hold the passport absent a court order or successor agreement. Marzano-Lesnevich also testified that Victoria could have traveled using her Spanish passport and that an itinerary Carrascosa sent to the firm indicated mother and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>daughter intended to return to this country. However, the Spanish courts ordered Victoria to remain in Spain until she turned eighteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Marzano-Lesnevich acknowledged on cross-examination that her firm\u2019s strategy was to focus initially on jurisdiction, explaining that proceedings already had begun in Spain and it was important for Carrascosa to receive an ecclesiastical nullity of her marriage. She acknowledged that Carrascosa wanted the matter heard in Spain.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">DeBartolo testified as an expert in the fields of family law and ethics. He opined that Liebowitz \u201cshould have notified ... Van Aulen that he was seeking to terminate his role as escrow agent, he should have notified his client, he should have notified any successor attorney, he should have asked to be relieved of the obligations that he voluntarily undertook as an escrow agent, as a trustee.\u201d He also concluded that Marzano-Lesnevich did not violate professional standards by returning the passport to Carrascosa because she was not bound by the Agreement and never agreed to become trustee of the passport. In DeBartolo\u2019s opinion, Marzano-Lesnevich properly relied on Carrascosa\u2019s representations that the agreement had been repudiated, and that Carrascosa had the superior property interest in the passport as the primary custodial parent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>DeBartolo also opined that Carrascosa, not defendants, was the proximate cause of any damages. Even if Liebowitz had retained the passport in trust or properly obtained a substitute trustee, DeBartolo believed Carrascosa could have easily traveled with Victoria using her Spanish passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case. <em>See R. </em>4:37\u20142(b). They argued plaintiffs failed to prove the release of Victoria\u2019s United States passport was a proximate cause of any damages. The judge denied the motion. Defendants renewed the argument post-verdict when they sought a new trial or JNOV, specifically contending that the finding of proximate cause was \u201cagainst the weight of the evidenced]\u201d The judge denied the motion in a brief written opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defendants now renew this argument before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Motions for involuntary dismissal, <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b), and JNOV, <em>Rule </em>4:40-2(b), are \u201cgoverned by the same evidential standard: [I]f, accepting as true all the evidence which supports the position of the party defending against the motion and according [her] the benefit of all inferences which can reasonably and legitimately be deduced therefrom, reasonable minds could differ, the motion must be denied.\u201d <em>Verdicchio v. Ricca, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>1, 30, 843 A.2d 1042 (2004) (first alteration in original) (citations omitted). We apply the same standard on review. <em>Estate of Roach v. TRW, Inc., </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>598, 612, 754 A.2d 544 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201cThe trial judge\u2019s obligation on a motion for a new trial because the verdict is said to be against the weight of the evidence is quite a different and more difficult one.\u201d <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969). Under <em>Rule </em>4:49-l(a), a court shall grant a motion for a new trial \u201cif, having given due regard to the opportunity of the jury to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses, it clearly and convincingly appears that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The judge must take into account \u201cnot only tangible factors ... as shown by the record, but also appropriate matters of credibility, generally peculiarly within the jury\u2019s domain, ... and the intangible \u2018feel of the case\u2019 ... gained by presiding over the trial.\u201d <em>Dolson, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 6, 258 A.2d 706. We apply a similar standard, deferring to the trial court\u2019s assessment of those factors \u201cwhich are not transmitted by the written record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 258 A.2d 706. Thus, \u201c[a]n appellate court may overturn a jury verdict \u2018only if [that] verdict is so far contrary to the weight of the evidence as to give rise to the inescapable conclusion of mistake, passion, prejudice, or partiality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kassick v. Milwaukee Elec. Tool Corp., </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>130, 134, 576 A.2d 270 (1990) (quoting <em>Wytupeck v. City of Camden, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>450, 466, 136 A.2d 887 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">To prevail at trial, plaintiffs needed to establish that defendants\u2019 breach of their professional duty was <em>a proximate cause of </em>their damages. <em>Conklin, supra, 145 N.J. </em>at 416, 678 A.2d 1060. When there are concurrent independent causes of harm, the jury must determine whether the negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the ultimate harm. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 678 A.2d 1060; <em>see also Froom v. Perel, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>298, 313, 872 A.2d 1067 (App.Div.) (\u201cplaintiff must present evidence to support a finding that defendant\u2019s negligent conduct was a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 in bringing about plaintiffs injury, even though there may be other concurrent causes of harm\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>267, 883 A.2d 1063 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Here, the undisputed evidence was that Victoria exited the country using her United States passport. Whether Victoria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>could have used her Spanish passport, or even whether her Spanish passport was necessary for her entry into Spain, does not matter. Defendants\u2019 release of the United States passport was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in bringing about the damages plaintiffs claimed to have suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Defendants moved pre-trial to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claim for emotional distress damages, and the judge reserved decision. At trial, plaintiffs called Janet S. Berson, a licensed clinical psychologist, as an expert regarding the effects of parental alienation on Innes and Victoria. However, following a <em>Rule </em>104 hearing, the judge precluded Berson from testifying, finding that she could not testify within a reasonable degree of psychological certainty, in part because she had never examined Victoria and her opinions were based on an out-of-date psychological report from Spain. Plaintiffs do not challenge that ruling on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case, defendants moved to dismiss Victoria\u2019s emotional distress claims. The judge considered the motion as if it applied to both plaintiffs. He concluded that \u201cunder traditional tort concepts the loss of the child\u2019s society and companionship could give rise to emotional distress.\u201d Citing our decision in <em>Segal v. Lynch, </em>413 <em>N.J.Super. </em>171, 993 A.2d 1229 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>96, 999 A.2d 464 (2010), the judge noted such circumstances \u201cclearly engenderf] a right to compensation,\u201d and he concluded that emotional distress damages could be presumed without evidence of physical injury or expert psychological testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Following lengthy debate during the charge conference, the judge provided the following instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">If you find in favor of the plaintiffs, the law recognizes as a proper item for recovery the mental suffering and distress that a person may endure as a result of the wrongful conduct of a defendant in a case such as the one before you. Since a parent is entitled to the services and companionship of a minor child, until that child reaches majority, you may award damages to ... Innes for the loss of his daughter\u2019s companionship and society for as long as you reasonably and rationally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>conclude it has and will last. The measure of damages is what a reasonable person would consider to be adequate and just under all of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">Likewise, Victoria ... is entitled to damages for the mental suffering and distress which she may endure as a result of being separated from her father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">When they moved for a new trial or JNOV, defendants reiterated the argument, which the judge rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Before us, defendants argue it was error to submit the issue of emotional distress damages to the jury because in a legal malpractice action emotional distress damages cannot be awarded \u201cin the absence of medical evidence establishing substantial bodily injury or severe and demonstrable psychiatric sequelae proximately caused by the tortfeasor\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>Gautam v. De Luca, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 399, 521 A.2d 1343 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>39, 532 A.2d 1107 (1987). Defendants specifically argue that there was no such medical evidence in this ease as to either Innes or Victoria.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">It is well-established that a plaintiff \u201c \u2018may recover for losses which are proximately caused by the attorney\u2019s negligence or malpractice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Saffer v. Willoughby, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>256, 271, 670 A.2d 527 (1996) (quoting <em>Lieberman v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>325, 341, 419 A.2d 417 (1980)). The availability of emotional distress damages in a legal malpractice case has not been subject to extensive discussion in reported decisions in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">In <em>Gautam, </em>the plaintiffs alleged that their attorneys\u2019 malpractice resulted in the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 medical negligence claim. <em>Gautam, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 391-92, 521 A.2d 1343. The \u201c[p]laintiffs made no effort to establish the viability or value of their underlying medical malpractice action. Rather, they sought to recover damages for the mental anguish and emotional distress allegedly caused by the legal malpractice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390, 521 A.2d 1343. Plaintiffs testified \u201cthat they developed various psychological problems because of their dashed expectations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392, 521 A.2d 1343. The jury awarded both compensatory and punitive damages against the defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 394, 521 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>1343. Although we reversed because of the inadequacy of the jury instructions, <em>id. </em>at 394-96, 521 A.2d 1343, we concluded that a remand was unnecessary because \u201cthe evidence was wholly insufficient to support a recovery of either compensatory or punitive damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 521 A.2d 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">We began by noting \u201c[t]he general rule is that an attorney is responsible for the loss proximately caused the client by his negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397, 521 A.2d 1343. \u201c[T]he measure of damages is ordinarily the amount that the client would have received but for his attorney\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Lieberman, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 342, 419 A.2d 417).

There, the plaintiffs, a police officer and his wife, filed a legal malpractice claim against their attorney who had provided them with advice concerning the legality of operating a club hosting poker games. <em>Id. </em>at 399-401, 64 A.3d 1012. The plaintiffs were subsequently arrested and criminally charged with perjury and various gambling offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 408, 64 A.3d 1012. As part of a global plea agreement with the State, the husband entered a guilty plea and his wife entered the Pre-Trial Intervention Program. <em>Id. </em>at 395, 64 A.3d 1012.

Citing <em>Gautam, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 399, 521 A.2d 1343, we noted, \u201c[tjhere is nothing in the record before us that substantiates a finding of \u2018egregious or extraordinary circumstances\u2019 warranting this form of relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418-19, 521 A.2d 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The only other reported decision from our courts that directly addresses the issue is <em>Kohn v. Schiappa, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>235, 236-37, 656 A.2d 1322 (Law Div.1995), in which the court considered whether damages for emotional distress were recoverable when the attorney was retained to pursue the purely non-economie interests of his clients. In that case, the plaintiffs retained defendant to assist them in adopting a child. <em>Id. </em>at 241, 656 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>1322. They alleged that the attorney erroneously disclosed confidential information in the adoption complaint and claimed this breach caused them to suffer severe emotional distress. <em>Id. </em>at 237, 656 A.2d 1322. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and distinguished <em>Gautam:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">While <em>Gautam </em>held that damages should be limited to recompensating the injured party for his economic loss, ... that court was not asked to consider, nor did it address, whether damages for emotional distress were recoverable in cases involving non-economic claims where the \u201csuit within a suit\u201d framework is inapplicable. Consequently, it cannot be said that <em>Gautam </em>forecloses a plaintiff from alleging severe emotional distress where the underlying representation was for non-economic purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 241, 656 A.2d 1322 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). |</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The Law Division explained that, in an adoption or similar proceeding, such as contested child custody disputes, attorneys would have virtual immunity for their negligence if plaintiffs had no ability to seek emotional distress damages. <em>Id. </em>at 238-39, 241-42, 656 A.2d 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Two reported federal district court decisions also have distinguished <em>Gautam </em>so as to permit the assertion of emotional distress damages in a legal malpractice claim when the client\u2019s interest was non-pecuniary in nature. First, in <em>Lawson v. Nugent, </em>702 <em>F.Supp. </em>91, 92 (D.N.J.1988), the plaintiff brought a legal malpractice claim against his attorney whose alleged malpractice resulted in an additional twenty months of confinement upon conviction. The plaintiff sought damages for the \u201cemotional anguish he sustained\u201d as a result. <em>Ibid. </em>The court distinguished the case from <em>Gautam, </em>noting \u201c[t]he relationship between plaintiff-client and defendant-attorney was not necessarily predicated upon economic interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93. The court observed that because this was a \u201cdiversity case,\u201d it \u201cmust decide the issues in accordance with the law of New Jersey.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94. Further noting that \u201c[djamages for emotional distress have been allowed by New Jersey courts in an increasing number and variety of contexts,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>the court concluded that the \u201cplaintiff should be allowed to prove damages for emotional distress attributable to the extra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>twenty months of confinement in a maximum security penitentiary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In <em>Snyder v. Baumecker, </em>708 <em>F.Supp. </em>1451, 1453 (D.N.J.1989), the plaintiff brought suit on behalf of herself and the estate of her son, who committed suicide while in custody for motor vehicle offenses. One of the defendants was her son\u2019s court-appointed attorney, who allegedly committed malpractice. <em>Id. </em>at 1453, 1462. Citing its prior decision in <em>Lawson, supra, </em>the court again distinguished <em>Gautam, </em>noting that the attorney-client relationship there was \u201cpredicated on an economic interest, while ... in the case at bar, the attorney was retained to provide a defense to a criminal prosecution, thus making emotional distress, in the latter situation, a reasonably foreseeable consequence of an attorney\u2019s malpractice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1464.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\"><em>Kohn\u2019s </em>holding that emotional distress damages are recoverable in a legal malpractice case where non-eeonomic interests are at stake has been described as the \u201cminority rule.\u201d <em>Leonard v. Walthall, 143 F. 3d 466, 468 (8th </em>Cir.1998). In <em>Leonard, </em>the plaintiffs alleged negligence in the defendant\u2019s representation of their interests in an adoption. <em>Id. </em>at 467. The Eighth Circuit was asked to predict \u201cwhether, under Arkansas law, plaintiffs may recover damages for their alleged emotional distress resulting from defendant\u2019s negligent conduct, notwithstanding the undisputed fact that plaintiffs have suffered no physical injury or harm to a personal or economic interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468. Relying upon the decision in <em>Thornton v. Squyres, </em>317 <em>Ark. </em>374, 877 S.W.2d 921 (1994), which involved the plaintiffs \u201cclaim of outrage ... based upon allegations that her attorney mishandled her divorce and thus caused her temporarily to lose custody of her child,\u201d the <em>Leonard </em>court affirmed dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. <em>Ibid.; see also Taylor v. Paskoff &amp; Tamber, LLP, </em>29 <em>Misc.</em>3d 1125, 908 N.Y.S.2d 861, 863 (Sup.Ct.2010) (rejecting claims for emotional distress damages in a legal malpractice action involving representation in adoption or custody matters).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>However, nearly a quarter of a century ago, one commentator recognized \u201can emerging trend ... that allows a client to recover for emotional distress.\u201d Kelleher, Joseph J., \u201cAn Attorney\u2019s Liability for the Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress,\u201d 58 <em>Fordham L.Rev. </em>1309, 1319 (1990). This \u201cdeveloping trend emphasizes the client\u2019s injured interest in determining the extent of the attorney\u2019s liability for emotional distress damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1320. \u201cWhere the attorney is protecting a pecuniary interest, emotional distress damages are severely limited!,] [but] [w]here the interest is personal, ... courts adopting this view are more willing to compensate emotional harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1320-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In <em>Miranda v. Said, </em>836 <em>N.W.2d </em>8, 11-13 (Iowa 2013), relying upon their attorney\u2019s advice, the plaintiffs voluntarily left their children behind in the United States and returned to their native Ecuador, from where they intended to emigrate legally. When they attempted to return, they learned that they were subject to a ten-year bar because they had voluntarily left this country. <em>Id. </em>at 12. The Iowa Supreme Court concluded that the facts presented warranted an exception to the general rule that denied recovery of emotional distress damages in a legal malpractice ease. <em>Id. </em>at 33. The court noted it \u201cis generally foreseeable that emotional distress would accompany the prolonged separation of a parent and child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32 (citing <em>McEvoy v. Helikson, </em>277 <em>Or. </em>781, 562 P.2d 540, 542, 544 (1977), <em>superseded by rule on other grounds, Moore v. Willis, </em>307 <em>Or. </em>254, 767 P.2d 62, 64 (1988); <em>Person v.

The <em>Miranda </em>court concluded such damages are appropriate where \u201c[t]he relationship involved a transaction charged with emotions in which negligent conduct by the attorney was very likely to cause severe emotional distress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">In <em>Person, supra, </em>183 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>702, 611 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1353, the Illinois appeals court recognized \u201ca valid claim ... for noneconomic damages resulting from a plaintiffs loss of custody and visita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tion of his children which allegedly resulted from an attorney\u2019s negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\"><em>McEvoy </em>presents strikingly similar circumstances to this case. The plaintiff-father brought suit against his ex-wife\u2019s attorney. <em>McEvoy, supra, </em>562 <em>P.</em>2d at 541. Pursuant to the divorce decree, the plaintiff was awarded custody of the couple\u2019s child. However, a subsequent order, executed by all parties and the attorneys, gave the mother, a Swiss citizen, temporary custody, subject to both parents delivering all passports to the defendant until the child was returned to her father. <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiff alleged that the defendant failed to honor the order and gave his daughter\u2019s passport to his ex-wife, permitting the child to be removed to Switzerland. <em>Id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The court reversed the lower court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 544. It concluded that \u201cconduct by defendant which resulted in an infringement of\u2019 the plaintiffs right to custody of his daughter, \u201cif established by evidence on trial, would entitle [the] plaintiff to recover damages for anguish and mental [suffering] due to the loss of his minor child, as alleged in the complaint.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted) (second alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">We conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 claim for emotional distress damages was clearly appropriate under the facts of this case. We do not view this as an unwarranted extension of what we said in <em>Gautam, </em>specifically that emotional distress damages are generally unavailable in a legal malpractice action absent \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances. <em>Gautam, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 399, 521 A.2d 1343. We used those terms in <em>Gautam </em>to deny a claim in the context of a \u201crelationship between the parties\u201d \u201cpredicated upon economic interest,\u201d where the plaintiffs\u2019 loss \u201cwas purely pecuniary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 521 A.2d 1343; <em>and see Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers, </em>\u00a7 53 comment g. (2000) (emotional distress \u201cdamages are inappropriate in types of cases in which emotional distress is unforeseeable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">However, when the harm caused by an attorney\u2019s professional negligence is personal in nature and emanates from the fundamen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tal relationship between parent and child, we must assess whether it was \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d through a different prism. The trial judge specifically relied upon our decision in <em>Segal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">There, a father brought suit on behalf of himself and his children against the children\u2019s mother for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on alienation of the children\u2019s affections. <em>Segal, supra, </em>413 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 176-77, 993 A.2d 1229. For essentially two different reasons, we concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed by the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">First, we noted that the suit presented a \u201clitigation tug-of-war\u201d with the children in the middle. <em>Id. </em>at 189, 993 A.2d 1229. We were \u201csatisfied that [the] plaintiffs cause of action ... constituted] a prima facie case of potential harm to the children named as parties thereto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190-91, 993 A.2d 1229. \u201cAs a matter of public policy,\u201d we concluded that plaintiffs \u201cgrievances\u201d must be brought in the Family Part \u201cas part of an action for custody or parenting time, where the governing principle for adjudication will be the best interests of these two children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 993 A.2d 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">We also concluded that the plaintiff had \u201cnot established a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 993 A.2d 1229. We noted that, among other things, the elements of that tort required a showing that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s conduct was \u2018so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Buckley v. Trenton Sav. Fund Soc., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>355, 366, 544 A.2d 857 (1988)). Although the plaintiff failed to allege such conduct in the case, we specifically did not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaZ\">foreclose the possibility that a cause of action may be brought alleging facts that are so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community, thus satisfying prong two of the <em>Buckley </em>standard As <em>we previously noted, cases involving prolonged parental abduction, where children are intentionally removed to foreign jurisdictions for the purpose of frustrating the innocent parent\u2019s custodial rights, </em>or intentional false accusations of par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ent/ehild sexual abuse, are but two examples of factual scenarios that may satisfy the outrageous conduct requirement under <em>Buckley.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 192, 993 A.2d 1229 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Defendants contend that applying <em>Segal </em>here would be an unwarranted \u201cextension of liability for a client\u2019s intentional infliction of emotional distress to the tortfeasor\u2019s attorney by way of a legal malpractice claim[.]\u201d We do not necessarily agree. However, we need not directly address that contention because we conclude that <em>Segal </em>does have relevance to the extent that it explained the kind of \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d conduct that, when combined with the personal interests at stake, permit recovery for emotional distress damages in an action sounding in legal malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">We hasten to add that most factual situations will not support such a claim, even when the underlying interests are non-pecuniary and personal in nature. We view the \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d qualifier as a sensible limitation on what might otherwise become an increasing slew of litigation arising out of the obviously emotionally-charged proceedings that occur daily in the Family Part. So, for example, absent egregious and extraordinary circumstances, a client\u2019s claim that his attorney\u2019s malpractice resulted in an order awarding custody to his adversary or limiting his parenting time would not support an award of emotional distress damages. In such situations, the deprivation to the client can be fully redressed by the Family Court through applications addressed to the sound discretion and equitable powers of the judge, including future modification of the award. To the extent <em>Kohn </em>suggested otherwise, we disapprove it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Moreover, permitting claims for emotional distress in a legal malpractice action, even one centered on the client\u2019s personal as opposed to pecuniary interests, might provide thinly-veiled cover for damage claims attributable to the unfortunate, but well-recognized, anxiety that accompanies litigation in all forms. <em>See Picogna v. Bd. of Educ. of Cherry Hill, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>391, 399, 671 A.2d 1035 (1996) (denying \u201clitigation-induced\u201d stress as a component of emotional distress damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In this case, however, defendants\u2019 actions were \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cextraordinary.\u201d Despite knowing of the Agreement, including that it had been signed by the parties and the attorneys, the already contentious nature of the parties\u2019 separation and Innes\u2019s reliance on the safekeeping of Victoria\u2019s passport, defendants breached their duty and simply gave the passport to Carrascosa. They did so without notifying Van Aulen and without seeking approval from the court. Defendants\u2019 conduct was sufficiently \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d to permit an award of emotional distress damages in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence of emotional distress damages because they failed to prove, through expert medical testimony or otherwise, that they suffered \u201cdemonstrable psychiatric sequelae proximately caused\u201d by defendants\u2019 negligence. <em>Gautam, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 399, 521 A.2d 1343. To address this argument, we need to consider the origin of the requirement for this \u201cheightened showing of emotional distress.\u201d <em>Menorah Chapels at Millbum v.

City of Newark, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>251, 277, 793 A.2d 731 (App.Div. 2002). A second type of claim, first recognized in <em>Portee v.

The nature of this particular harm mitigates against the reason for an enhanced standard of proof in the first instance\u2014the elimination of spurious claims.

Unlike <em>Gautam, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 400, 521 A.2d 1343, where \u201cthe relationship between the parties was predicated upon economic interest^] [and] [t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>loss, if one occurred, was purely pecuniary[,]\u201d the loss in this case was particularly personal in nature\u2014the inability of a father to see his daughter for many years, and the likely prospect that he may never see her again.

The emotional distress caused by the irreparable severance of the parent-child bond is expected, undoubtedly genuine and easily appreciated by the average person without the need for expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Furthermore, there is no other form of redress for defendants\u2019 tortious conduct in this case. <em>Geler, supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 451, 818 A.2d 402. \u201cAny other ruling would in effect immunize [defendants] from liability[.]\u201d <em>Berman, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 432, 404 A.2d 8.

There was simply no testimony regarding her emotional distress, meaning the jury\u2019s award was based upon speculation. <em>See Jablonowska v.

So I can\u2019t possibly answer that.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that they were denied the opportunity to have Victoria evaluated because of defendants\u2019 actions. We cannot determine on this record whether that is necessarily true, but the trial judge rejected that excuse as a reason to permit Berson\u2019s testimony. We therefore reverse that part of the judgment awarding emotional distress damages to Victoria.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Citing <em>Packard-Bamberger &amp; Co. v.

Nonetheless, if it does not and is instead prosecuted as an independent tort, a claimant is entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees so long as the claimant proves that the attorney\u2019s breach arose from the attorney-client relationship. Accordingly, we hold that a successful claimant in an attorney-misconduct case may recover reasonable counsel fees incurred in prosecuting that action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 443, 771 <em>A.2d </em>1194.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">However, the Court also said that \u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate the existence of an attorney-client relationship as a prerequisite to recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 771 A.2d 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">The Court subsequently explained the expansion of this exception to the American Rule as having its \u201cfocus on the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees as damages directly and proximately arising <em>from the attorney\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty to the plaintiff.\u2019\u2019 Estate of Vayda, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 122, 875 A.2d 925 (emphasis added). In <em>In re Estate of Stockdale, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>275, 307, 953 A.2d 454 (2008), the Court described its holding in <em>Packardr-Bamberger </em>as permitting the recovery of counsel fees \u201cin claims against attorneys who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>intentionally violate their fiduciary duties[.]\u201d (Citing <em>Packard-Bamberger, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 443, 771 A.2d 1194). And, in <em>Litton Industries, Inc. v. IMO Industries, Inc., </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>372, 405, 982 A.2d 420 (2009), the Court described <em>Saffer </em>and <em>Packard-Bamberger </em>as examples of \u201ca tightly circumscribed common law exception to the American Rule that defies ready description, but may be titled loosely as fiduciary malfeasance cases[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We conclude that although no reported case specifically extends <em>Saffer\u2019s </em>exception to the American Rule to a suit brought against an attorney by a non-client, attorney's fees should be awarded in this case as a direct and proximate result of defendants\u2019 actions. <em>Saffer, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 272, 670 A.2d 527; <em>Lieberman, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 341, 419 A.2d 417. To hold otherwise would essentially eviscerate the very purpose of the exception to the American Rule by denying plaintiffs a full award for the consequential damages suffered as a result of defendants\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The attorney fee award is particularly appropriate in this case, since defendants were holding Victoria\u2019s passport in trust and knew Innes and his attorney were relying upon the Agreement. Nevertheless, they intentionally violated the Agreement and gave the passport to Carrascosa upon her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We affirm that portion of the judgment that reflects the award of counsel fees to Innes. Because we have reversed the judgment on behalf of Victoria, she is not a prevailing party, and therefore is not entitled to an award of fees. We vacate that portion of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">We next consider defendants\u2019 claim that it was error to sever their third-party complaint against Carrascosa from trial and to dismiss the complaint with prejudice after trial. The trial judge raised the severance issue sua sponte and provided all parties with an opportunity to address the issue several months before the trial began.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>In a short written opinion dated February 18, 2011, the judge decided severance was appropriate \u201cfor the convenience of the parties, and to avoid prejudice to ... Carrascosa.\u201d The judge noted that defendants were being represented at trial by Walter Lesnevich, a principal in the Lesnevich firm and husband of Marzano-Lesnevieh. Relying on <em>RPC </em>1.9, the judge determined that Lesnevich was disqualified from representing defendants in litigation against their former client, Carrascosa. The judge concluded that defendants would not be prejudiced by a severance because they were able to present their defense at trial, and, if successful, the contribution claim against Carrascosa would \u201cevaporate.\u201d If unsuccessful, defendants were free to pursue their contribution claim at a second trial represented by other counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\"><em>Rule </em>4:38-2(a) provides that a court may order a separate trial of any claim for the convenience of the parties or to avoid prejudice. \u201c[0]ur <em>Rules </em>vest the determination whether or not to sever claims to the sound exercise of a trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Rendine, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 310, 661 A.2d 1202 (citing <em>R. </em>4:38-2(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\"><em>\u201cRPC </em>1.9(a) plainly provides that [a] lawyer who has represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent another client in the same or substantially related matter in which that client\u2019s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consent confirmed in writing.\u201d <em>City of Atlantic City v.

In his written opinion, citing <em>Blazovic v. Andrich, </em>124 <em>N.J. 90, 590 A.2d </em>222 (1991), the judge concluded that any apportionment of fault was inappropriate because defendants had a duty to prevent the \u201cspecific misconduct\u201d of their client. As the judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">As a result of the attorney-client relationship between ... Carrascosa and the defendants, a relationship that derives its genesis from Victoria\u2019s passport and the attendant ramifications arising from that document, the Lesnevich firm was also charged with preventing any harm from befalling Peter and Victoria Innes. The jury verdict was issued in accordance with this notion. All of these factors therefore coalesce to place ... Carrascosa outside the boundaries of the traditional joint tortfeasor realm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Defendants argue before us that they are entitled to contribution from Carrascosa under the JTCL. We disagree and affirm the judge\u2019s dismissal of defendants\u2019 third-party complaint for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Pro rata apportionment of liability among negligent and intentional tortfeasors is appropriate based upon the \u201cpercentages of fault assigned by the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Blazovic, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 105, 107-12, 590 A.2d 222. However, an exception to the general rule applies \u201cwhen the duty of one encompassed the obligation to prevent the specific misconduct of the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, 590 A.2d 222 (citing <em>Butler v. Acme Markets, Inc., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>270, 445 A.2d 1141 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Application of this exception relies upon both the foreseeability of the \u201cspecific misconduct\u201d and its \u201cadequate causal relationship\u201d to the duty imposed on the other tortfeasor to prevent it. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 590 A.2d 222. <em>See e.g., Waldron v.

(rejecting the <em>Blazovic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>exception where the plaintiffs recovery against a shopping mall for an assault at an automatic teller machine \u201cwas not so foreseeable nor did it bear such a close causal connection to the [m]all\u2019s slow response to the melee that it should justify imposing upon the [mjall the entire responsibility for [the] plaintiffs injuries\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>139, 861 A.2d 844 (2004); <em>Martin v.

Defendants were fully aware of the Agreement and assumed a duty to safeguard Victoria\u2019s passport. Because they released the passport to Carrascosa without notice to Innes or his attorney, defendants failed to prevent the \u201cspecific misconduct\u201d that enabled Victoria\u2019s removal to Spain.
