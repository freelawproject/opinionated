Relying upon <em>Pasqua v. Council, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>127, 892 A.2d 663 (2006), he argues that such appointment is constitutionally required because he faces possible incarceration if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the trial court finds he -willfully failed to pay his support obligations. For the reasons that follow, we conclude he has failed to show that the appointment of experts at public expense is constitutionally required in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The facts and procedural history, as represented by the parties, can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Plaintiff Ariel Schochet was a portfolio manager at several hedge funds before \u201cthe market collapse in 2007.\u201d However, he dates the downturn in his income to several years later, the year before the parties\u2019 2012 divorce, when he lost a high-paying job. He states that, since then, he has been unable to duplicate that level of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The Amended Judgment of Divorce required plaintiff to pay weekly amounts of $1500 for alimony and $390 for child support. Later orders required the payment of $50 per week toward arrears and increased the child support based upon a cost of living adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Plaintiff represents that he now earns $600 per week. He states that, as of February 2014, his arrears were approximately $250,000 and continue to increase by almost $1500 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Plaintiff was first incarcerated for non-support in August 2013. His incarceration was stayed by the Supreme Court in October 2013. By order dated November 7, 2013, the trial court: denied plaintiffs request that he be granted leave to proceed as an indigent; appointed counsel to represent him for an ability to pay hearing and \u201cfor future filings and hearings on that issue that may result in incarceration\u201d; granted his motion for the adjournment of his ability to pay hearing; and scheduled the hearing for November 12, 2013. The ability to pay hearing was further adjourned and scheduled for February 4, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">On January 31, 2014, less than one week before the scheduled hearing, plaintiffs counsel wrote to the Bergen County Counsel and requested that the County retain David B. Stein, Ph.D., an employability expert, and an as-yet-unidentified certified public accountant for plaintiff. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Both experts are needed to testify as to Mr. Schochet\u2019s employability and his past, present and future earnings, income, job placement and his current ability to pay child support. It is necessary and essential to our case and to the issue of Mr. Schochet\u2019s current ability to pay child support that we retain these experts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">His requests were rejected by Bergen County Counsel and denied by the trial court by order dated February 6, 2014. An ability to pay hearing commenced in February 2014 and was adjourned to April 30, 2014, in part, to permit the trial court to consider the results of plaintiffs ninety-day review by his current employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Plaintiff submitted an application for leave to file an emergent motion allowing him to appeal from the trial court\u2019s order denying his request. As defendant correctly points out, this order is interlocutory. Nonetheless, we exercise our discretion to grant leave to appeal from the February 6, 2014 order in the interest of justice, <em>R. </em>2:2-4, and now affirm the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">In <em>Pasqua v. Council, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe appointment of counsel to assist parents found to be indigent and facing incarceration at child support enforcement hearings\u201d was mandated by both the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the New Jersey Constitution, Article I, Paragraph 1. <em>Id. </em>at 146, 892 A.2d 663. Plaintiff argues that <em>Pasqua </em>also requires the appointment of experts to testify at his ability to pay hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">The 2014 Directive regarding the enforcement of child support orders identifies two issues a trial court must decide when an obligor is taken into custody on a child support-related warrant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, the trial court must determine \u201cwhether the obligor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>is indigent for representation purposes.\u201d 2014 Directive, <em>supra, </em>at 2. Then, the trial court must \u201cmake a second finding as to the obligor\u2019s ability to comply with the current child support obligation, that is, a finding as to the obligor\u2019s \u2018ability to pay.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">As a preliminary matter, there has been no finding that plaintiff is indigent. He represents that he is currently employed, earning $600 per week.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, although <em>Pasqua </em>requires the appointment of counsel for indigent obligors because they face the possibility of incarceration, <em>ibid., </em>it is silent as to other services that must be provided to the indigent obligor to protect his or her constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Central to the Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Pasqua </em>was its concern that, \u201c[w]hen an indigent litigant is forced to proceed at an ability-to-pay hearing without counsel, there is a high risk of an erroneous determination and wrongful incarceration.\u201d <em>Pasqua, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 145, 892 A.2d 663. Plaintiff has failed to show any increased risk of an erroneous determination if his requested relief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Directive # 15-08, (the 2008 Directive)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> issued by the Administrative Office of the Courts on November 17, 2008, includes forms that detail the extensive inquiry associated with an enforcement hearing, including the Probation Child Support Enforcement Obligor Questionnaire, CN 10819 (the Obligor Questionnaire), and the checklist of questions to be asked at the enforcement hearing, CN 11212.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Prior to the ability to pay hearing, the Probation Department elicits information from the obligor to complete a questionnaire that provides the court with relevant facts such as: the obligor\u2019s residence status; whether support is paid on another case; the number of dependents; whether the mortgage or rent payment is current; employment status and history; any reason for unemployment and the length of unemployment; other sources of income such as general assistance, disability, or workers compensation; whether the obligor has medical insurance; the obligor\u2019s monthly expenses for housing, loans, support obligations, medical insurance, household utilities, and other household expenses; the value of assets; and details of the obligor\u2019s total debts, including loan balances, medical debts, debts owed to other courts, credit card balances, and civil judgments owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The trial court also addresses the obligor directly. The 2008 Directive provides suggested inquiries to assist the court to clarity \u201cinconsistent, inconclusive or ambiguous answers,\u201d determine why support has not been paid and how much the obligor can pay that day, and to ensure the obligor has a plan to address arrearages. <em>See id. </em>at 23. Pursuant to the 2014 Directive, the trial court is further required to make \u201cspecific factual findings regarding the obligor\u2019s ability to comply with the child support obligation\u201d and, if coercive incarceration is ordered, the court\u2019s justification for ordering it. 2014 Directive, <em>supra, </em>at 2-3; <em>see also id. </em>at 5-7 (Revised Form promulgated by Directive # 02-14, CN 11213).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The information provided by the Obligor Questionnaire and the court\u2019s further questioning can reasonably be expected to provide the trial court with sufficient information to make the required determination in all but the extraordinary case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although not addressing the adequacy of the information and inquiry conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>pursuant to the 2008 Directive, plaintiffs argument presumes its insufficiency. In support of this motion, plaintiffs counsel states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFB\">In order to show that he is unable to secure [a job paying enough to cover his obligation], the Plaintiff has prepared hundreds of pages of employment search documents which show the evidence of his search within and outside his primary field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">To make a proper determination, the court will need to examine the evidence presented and evaluate if the Plaintiff has made an appropriate job search commensurate with his history and experience. I believe that for the court to make this evaluation, the specifics of the employability of the Plaintiff are sufficiently complex that in order for a just decision to be made, an expert is needed that would qualify the Plaintiffs employability and provide an independent analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">... Without the expert testimony, the Court will be asked to make this determination without the proper foundation as to the specifics of Plaintiffs area of expertise and how the marketability for such services has materially changed in the past nine year\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Plaintiff has identified no documents other than the \u201chundreds of pages of employment search documents\u201d that require expert analysis. In relying upon the fact that similar expert testimony is frequently admitted in Family Court, he blurs the very real distinction between the issue decided at an ability to comply hearing and that decided when similar evidence is considered at a plenary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The <em>Rule </em>1:10-3 hearing is not a plenary hearing to decide the appropriate amount of support an obligor <em>should </em>pay. That amount has been determined, either by the court following a trial or post-judgment motion, or by the parties themselves. The hearing is also not a substitute for an appeal or a motion to modify the obligation based on changed circumstances. The hearing comes about because an obligor has failed to comply with an order. The objective of the hearing is simply to determine whether that failure was excusable or willful, i.e., the obligor was able to pay and did not. <em>See Pasqua, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 145, 892 A.2d 663. It does not establish the future obligation of the party paying support.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The Supreme Court has observed that the purpose of the <em>Rule </em>1:10-3 proceeding is \u201cto coerce the defendant into compliance with the court\u2019s order for the benefit of the private litigant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 892 A.2d 663 (quoting <em>Essex Cnty. Welfare Bd. v. Perkins, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>189, 195, 336 A.2d 16 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>161, 343 A.2d 449 (1975)). Before a court may order the ultimate coercive means, incarceration, \u201cthe court must find that the parent was capable of providing the required support, but willfully refused to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141 n. 2, 892 A.2d 663; <em>see also Milne v. Goldenberg, </em>428 <em>N.J.Super. </em>184, 198, 51 A.3d 161 (App. Div.2012). Because incarceration \u201cmay be ordered only if made contingent upon defendant\u2019s continuing failure to comply with the order,\u201d <em>Pasqua, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 140, 892 A.2d 663, the obligor is said to \u201cpossess[ ] the keys to the jailhouse door.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 145, 892 A.2d 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">An example helps to illustrate the difference between the two hearings. Let us assume an obligor with an annual income of $100,000 is ordered to pay weekly child support of $350 for two children. The obligor subsequently loses that employment and finds a job that pays $60,000 per year. If the trial court finds he or she has made a prima facie case of changed circumstances and holds a plenary hearing, the court will evaluate the \u201cpotential earning capacity of an individual\u201d to determine an appropriate support obligation. <em>See Caplan v. Caplan, </em>364 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 88-89, 834 A.2d 459 (App.Div.2003) (quoting <em>Halliwell v. Halliwell, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>442, 448, 741 A.2d 638 (App.Div.1999)), <em>aff'd, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>250, 864 A.2d 1108 (2005). That evaluation may result in the imputation of income to the obligor if the judge concludes that he or she \u201cis, \"without just cause, voluntarily underemployed or unemployed.\u201d Child Support Guidelines, Pressler and Verniero, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>Appendix IX-A at 2589 (2014) (\u201cImputing Income to Parents\u201d). The Appendix provides guidance on the manner in which such income should be imputed. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The review of employment search evidence in an ability to comply hearing has a far more limited purpose: to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>whether the failure to pay was willful. Let us assume the matter comes to court for enforcement of the $350 support order pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:10-3 because the obligor has paid only $250 per week and arrears have accumulated. The court will not determine whether $250 per week is the appropriate level of support; it will determine what amount of the $350 court-ordered support the obligor was able to pay. If the court should determine that the obligor paid what he or she was able to pay, no incarceration would be warranted despite the accrual of arrears and the fact that the amount of support is unchanged. <em>See </em>2008 Directive, <em>supra, </em>at 8 (stating that, in ordering coercive incarceration, \u201cit is essential that the court at the hearing find the obligor has an ability to pay an amount acceptable to the court\u201d); <em>see also Pierce v. Pierce, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>359, 361, 300 A.2d 568 (App.Div.1973) (reversing an order entered following an ability to pay hearing and stating, \u201c[N]owhere is demonstrated in the record before us the ability of defendant to comply with the order sought to be enforced by the coercive remedy.\u201d). As a result, the judge conducting an ability to comply hearing will generally not need to delve beyond determining whether the obligor has made a good faith effort to secure a reasonable level of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Moreover, although plaintiff states he would retain such experts himself if not indigent, the admissibility of such testimony remains subject to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702. Expert testimony is admitted when the subject matter is \u201cbeyond the ken of the average [factfinder],\u201d <em>DeHanes v. Rothman, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>90, 100, 727 A.2d 8 (1999), and \u201cwill assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702. No showing has been made here that the subject matter of the expert testimony sought is beyond the ken of a Family Part judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The issue to be decided at an ability to comply hearing closely parallels determinations Family Part judges make on a daily basis concerning the evaluation of financial information provided through documents and testimony, generally without any expert testimony. In attempting to achieve a fair resolution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>economic issues of parties going through the emotionally charged process of divorce, judges review testimony, case information statements and other financial information, and necessarily make assessments of the parties\u2019 needs, wants, and ability to fund costs. That experience gives rise to the well-established deference paid to factual findings Family Part judges make that are supported by the evidence, <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 412-13, 713 A.2d 390 (1998), deference that \u201cis especially appropriate \u2018when the evidence is largely testimonial and involves questions of credibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>MacKinnon v. MacKinnon, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>240, 254, 922 A.2d 1252 (2007) (quoting <em>Cesare, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 412, 713 A.2d 390).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In particular, Family Part judges are well versed in reviewing the good faith of litigants who fail to meet their obligations in the full spectrum of post-judgment litigation. For example, in <em>Milne, </em>the former wife appealed from an order that imposed community service hours upon her as a means of coercing her to comply with past orders regarding the payment of a joint federal income tax liability. The trial court observed that the former wife \u201chad \u2018a significant amount of money ... [at] her disposal, while she was not complying with these court orders\u2019 \u201d and had \u201cintentionally \u2018prioritize[d]\u2019 her funds and ignored the obligation.\u201d <em>Milne, supra, </em>428 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 199, 51 A.3d 161 (alterations in original). Accordingly, the trial court found her \u201cnon-compliance was deliberately designed to delay satisfaction of the obligation\u201d and concluded \u201cher failure to pay was willful.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In sum, even in the absence of a finding of indigence, plaintiff has been afforded legal representation at public expense. He has failed to show that the expert evidence he seeks is necessary to avert an enhanced \u201crisk of an erroneous determination and wrongful incarceration,\u201d <em>Pasqua, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 145, 892 A.2d 663, or even that such expert evidence would assist the trier of fact to evaluate evidence of a kind routinely reviewed by Family Part judges. We therefore conclude that the appointment of experts was not constitutionally required under the facts of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-16\">This hearing is now more aptly called an \u201cability to comply hearing\u201d as set forth in Directive # 02-14, (the 2014 Directive) issued by the Administrative Office of the Courts on April 14, 2014, and available at <em>http://www.jud.iciary.state. nj.usldirectivel2014ldir-02-14.pdf </em>(last visited April 15, 2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-13\"> The United States Supreme Court has since held that the appointment of counsel in such proceedings is not automatically required by the United States Constitution. <em>Turner v.
