A September 27, 2012 order of the Family Part awarded petitioner custody of M.S., but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>denied or did not make the factual findings requested. Petitioner appeals. We affirm in part and reverse and modify the court\u2019s order in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The proceedings have been non-adversarial. The facts were presented by petitioner without participation by any opposing or neutral party. We recite the pertinent facts with an assumption of their accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Petitioner H.S.P. is a United States citizen and lives with his wife and children in Passaic County. He works as a taxi driver in New York City. M.S. is a citizen of India, born there in December 1994 to J.K. (his mother) and B.S. (his father). In July 2011, at the age of sixteen, M.S. entered the United States without documentation, that is, illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">In India, M.S. was raised by his mother. He has no recollection of ever meeting his father. He lived in poverty-stricken, disease-ridden slums. His older brother and sister died of unknown causes when they were about seventeen years old. Medical care was not available in their community, and his mother could not afford to travel and to pay for medical treatment for her children. His mother also suffered from ill health. They went to live with his maternal grandmother, who was also ill. M.S. left school and, at the age of fifteen, worked long hours in construction jobs. He developed back pain and a skin condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">In an effort to save M.S. from unsanitary and potentially deadly living conditions, his mother and grandmother determined to send him to the United States to live with petitioner, who is the mother\u2019s brother. The mother arranged and paid for M.S. to be transported by ship to Turkey and then to Mexico. M.S. walked across the United States border in July 2011 without being admitted and without entry documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">He has been living in New Jersey with petitioner\u2019s family, and now considers them to be his family. Although he dropped out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>school in New Jersey because he was too far behind the other students, he has obtained a General Educational Development (GED) diploma and hopes to go to college. He maintains weekly telephone contact with his mother in India.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Petitioner\u2019s complaint, filed in the Family Part in May 2012, stated that M.S. \u201cis in need of an order granting custody of him to [petitioner] so that he may regularize his immigration status pursuant to\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J) (\u201cSubparagraph J\u201d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1101-1537. Subsequently, petitioner filed a sworn acknowledgement of service from M.S.\u2019s mother, in which she declined to answer the complaint and requested that default be entered against her. She said she did not oppose the petition, and she \u201cabandoned\u201d M.S. to petitioner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Petitioner asked the Family Part judge to make findings referenced in Subparagraph J of the federal statute and its implementing regulation, 8 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 204.11(d) (\u201cthe Regulation\u201d). Specifically, petitioner asked the court to find that M.S. was dependent on the New Jersey family court, that he had been abandoned or neglected by his father and mother, and that it was not in his best interest to return to India. At a hearing on September 27, 2012, the judge heard testimony from petitioner and M.S., and reviewed the documentary evidence submitted by petitioner. Finding that the Family Part had jurisdiction to consider the petition because M.S. was a minor residing in New Jersey, the court awarded physical custody of M.S. to petitioner. However, the court found insufficient evidence that M.S. was neglected or abandoned by either of his parents, and therefore, a \u201cbest interest analysis is not required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Petitioner appeals from the Family Part\u2019s order to the extent it denied or did not make the findings he sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">SIJ status brings significant advantages for an undocumented juvenile. The INA contains special provisions for the issuance of immigrant visas to special immigrants, including juveniles. 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1153(b)(4), 1204. SIJ status provides exemption from deportation on certain grounds, including for being \u201cpresent in the United States\u201d unlawfully. 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), (c). A juvenile granted SIJ status is deemed \u201cto have been paroled into the United States\u201d for purposes of discretionary adjustment of his status \u201cto that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1255(a), (h)(1). In determining the admissibility of such a juvenile as an immigrant, certain grounds of inadmissibility do not apply (including unlawful entry into the United States) and other grounds may be waived by the Attorney General. 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1255(h)(2); <em>see </em>8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In Subparagraph J, the INA defines the term \u201cspecial immigrant\u201d to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">an immigrant who is present in the United States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">(i) who has been declared dependent on a juvenile court located in the United States or whom such a court has legally committed to, or placed under the custody of, an agency or department of a State, or an individual or entity appointed by a State or juvenile court located in the United States, and whose reunification with 1 or both of the immigrant\u2019s parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis found under State law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">(ii) for whom it has been determined in administrative or judicial proceedings that it would not be in the alien\u2019s best interest to be returned to the alien\u2019s or parent\u2019s previous country of nationality or country of last habitual residence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">(iii) in whose case the Secretary of Homeland Security consents to the grant of special immigrant juvenile status[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">[8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">The implementing Regulation requires a petition for SIJ status to have attached a juvenile court order with findings as set forth in the statute. 8 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 204.11(b), (d)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Subparagraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>J creates \u201ca special circumstance \u2018where a state juvenile court is charged with addressing an issue relevant only to federal immigration law.\u2019 \u201d <em>E.C.D. v. P.D.R.D., </em>114 So.3d 33, 36 (Ala.Civ.App. 2012) (quoting <em>In re J.J.X.C., </em>318 <em>Ga.App. </em>420, 734 S.E.2d 120, 124 (2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">To fulfill his objectives in this case, petitioner first asked the Family Part to find that M.S. \u201chas been declared dependent on a juvenile court located in the United States or whom such a court has legally committed to, or placed under the custody of, an agency or department of a State, or an individual or entity appointed by a State or juvenile court.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J)(i).* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the court exercised jurisdiction over M.S. and placed him in the custody of petitioner, we are concerned at the invocation of the Family Part\u2019s jurisdiction to obtain custody with no apparent purpose other than to seek immigration benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The petition was not brought in an adversarial proceeding for custody, or initiated by any juvenile court or child welfare agency seeking to protect the health and well-being of M.S. Petitioner is M.S.\u2019s uncle, and already had physical custody of him with the consent and approval of the boy\u2019s only available parent. M.S. was living in petitioner\u2019s home in the United States, sent voluntarily to this country by his mother to be cared for by petitioner. No showing was made that a judicial declaration of custody was needed for any reason related to the custody statutes of this State. Most important, the only reason the Family Part\u2019s jurisdiction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>invoked was petitioner\u2019s declaration that M.S. was \u201cin need of ... regularizing his immigration status.\u201d We question whether Congress intended Subparagraph J to apply to juveniles who are placed in the custody of an individual not because necessity was shown under State law, but because custody was requested for immigration purposes. <em>Cf. In re C.G.H., </em>75 A.3d 166, 172-74 (D.C.2013) (finding the court had jurisdiction and was required to make SIJ findings when called upon to approve a child\u2019s adoption).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In a ease with facts similar to this matter, our Family Part expressed doubt that the court\u2019s jurisdiction was being invoked for proper purposes. <em>D.C. v. A.B.C., </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41, 47, 8 A.3d 260 (Ch.Div.2010). A juvenile\u2019s step-mother sought to be appointed his guardian so the juvenile could establish the first prerequisite for SIJ status. <em>Id. </em>at 44, 8 A.3d 260. The plaintiff could offer no reason why she should have received guardianship or custody, because the juvenile was already living with his father. <em>Id. </em>at 47-48, 8 A.3d 260. The court ruled that \u201cit is not necessary to appoint plaintiff as [the juvenile\u2019s] guardian as the child is thriving in the custody of his father. There is no need for this court to exercise jurisdiction____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 8 A.3d 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Petitioner did not cite any New Jersey statute in support of his request for custody. The trial court in <em>D.C. </em>cited as its jurisdictional authority <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-9, which allows a third party to bring an action regarding a child. <em>Id. </em>at 47, 8 A.3d 260.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>9:2-10 then allows a court, in an action brought by a third party pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-9, to award custody of the child to that third party.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Nelson, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>235, 244, 748 A.2d 558 (2000). In a proceeding under <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:2-9 and 9:2-10, \u201ca presumption of custody exists in favor of the parent,\u201d which a third party can overcome \u201cby satisfying the standard required for termination of the rights of a non-consenting parent,\u201d including abandonment or neglect. <em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 748 A.2d 558. Here, the family court awarded custody of M.S. to petitioner even though it did not find that M.S.\u2019s mother had abandoned or neglected him.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">We are also concerned that petitioner asked the Family Part to find that M.S.\u2019s father neglected and abandoned him, and to award custody of M.S. to petitioner, without naming the father in the complaint, or even attempting to serve him. A parent normally must be given the opportunity to oppose an accusation of abandonment and neglect, or an award of custody of a child to a third party, which in many respects resembles the termination of parental rights. <em>Id. </em>at 253-54, 748 A.2d 558. Service on the parent is generally required, <em>R. </em>5:4-4(a); <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-69, even if the parent is out of state, <em>N.J.SA </em>2A:34-60, or out of the country, <em>R. </em>4:4-4(b)(l)(B). \u201c[W]here the adverse party cannot be located,\u201d our rules require diligent inquiry to locate a parent for service. <em>R. </em>5:4-4(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>We note, however, that the INA states that a juvenile \u201cwho has been battered, abused, neglected, or abandoned, shall not be compelled to contact the alleged abuser (or family member of the alleged abuser) at any stage of applying for special immigrant juvenile status.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1357(h); <em>see </em>151 <em>Cong. Rec. </em>S 13,749 (2005) (Sen. Biden) (\u201cThis section assures that immigration authorities are not required to contact abusive parents or family members,\u201d and \u201cprevents abusive parents from keeping their children from accessing help and support in the United States\u201d). Thus, there may be a conflict between this section and our State laws that require efforts to provide notice to an absent parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We do not attempt in this appeal to resolve that apparent conflict. Despite our concerns, we will assume that the judge\u2019s custody determination is sufficient to satisfy the first precondition for SIJ status, and we will examine the judge\u2019s other findings under Subparagraph J.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The second finding petitioner sought was that M.S.\u2019s \u201creunification with <em>1 or both </em>of the immigrant\u2019s parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis found under State law.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J)(i) (emphasis added). The Family Part found that neither the mother nor the father had abused, neglected, or abandoned the juvenile. We agree with the court\u2019s finding as to the mother, but disagree as to the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">There was no allegation that the juvenile had been intentionally abused by his parents. We will therefore focus on neglect and abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Petitioner argued that the mother\u2019s neglect of M.S. was shown by his lack of medical care and schooling. The judge declined to find that the mother committed an act of neglect under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1, which includes: \u201c(a) willfully failing to provide proper and sufficient food, clothing, maintenance, regular school education as required by law, medical attendance or surgical treatment, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>clean and proper home, or (b) failure to do or permit to be done any act necessary for the child\u2019s physical or moral well-being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Though \u201cwillfully\u201d does not require an \u201cevil intent or bad motive,\u201d it does require that the parent deny proper care \u201cintentionally or purposely as distinguished from inadvertently or accidentally.\u201d <em>State v. Burden, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>424, 427, 315 A.2d 43 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>282, 321 A.2d 243 (1974). Other New Jersey statutes similarly define neglect to include a parent\u2019s failure \u201cto exercise a minimum degree of care ... in supplying the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, education, medical or surgical care though financially able to do so.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.9(d); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c)(4). Failure to exercise a minimum degree of care \u201cat least requires grossly negligent or reckless conduct.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs, v. T.B., </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>294, 306, 24 A.3d 290 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The evidence submitted by petitioner did not show that the mother had the financial means to provide better care to M.S. but refused to do so willfully, recklessly, or with gross negligence. Rather, petitioner\u2019s evidence showed that the mother was financially unable to provide better care for M.S. <em>See N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs, v. P.W.R., </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>17, 37-38, 11 A.3d 844 (2011) (finding failure to provide heat or medical checkups is not neglect where parents lack the financial means to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">In <em>D.C., supra, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 49, 8 A.3d 260 the petitioner similarly alleged that the juvenile\u2019s ill mother in Guatemala had abused and neglected him by failing to provide adequate food, clothing, and education. The <em>D.C. </em>court concluded that mother\u2019s inability to provide for the child \u201cwas not the result of intentional neglect but was caused by her inability to earn enough money to adequately support the family.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the mother had also paid to transport the juvenile to the United States to be reunited with his father. <em>Id. </em>at 45, 8 A.3d 260. The court concluded: \u201cThese are not the actions of an abusive or neglectful parent; instead, they describe a caring mother [living in poverty] who is trying to provide better living conditions for her son.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>at 49, 8 A.3d 260. We agree, and find the same conclusions applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Petitioner stresses that, because M.S. was the only person in the household who was physically able to work, he stopped going to school and, at the age of fifteen, worked long hours doing manual labor in construction. As a result, he developed back and skin problems, and became very thin, ill, and depressed. The judge found that M.S. had done harsh work for at least a year, causing back problems, but the judge did not find any protracted impairment to M.S. or any abuse or neglect by the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">New Jersey law considers it to be abuse for a parent to \u201cpermit! ] a child to be employed in any vocation or employment injurious to its health or dangerous to its life or limb, or contrary to the laws of this State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1. However, M.S. was employed in India, not New Jersey, and petitioner has not shown that M.S. was employed contrary to the laws of India. Similarly, petitioner has not shown that M.S.\u2019s employment exposed M.S. to danger to life or limb or injured his health in a serious or protracted way. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>9:6\u20148.9(b); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c)(2). We cannot conclude on this record that M.S.\u2019s employment in India, which has not been shown to violate that country\u2019s child labor laws, shows that his mother has willfully or grossly negligently abused or neglected him within the meaning of our State child welfare laws. <em>See D.C., supra, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 49-51, 8 A.3d 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Finally, petitioner asserted that the mother\u2019s neglect of M.S. was corroborated by the fatal illnesses of his two older siblings. In his testimony, M.S. was vague about the causes of the deaths of his sister and brother in 2001 and 2005, respectively. Nor was petitioner fully aware of the circumstances under which the older siblings died because he lived in the United States and had no direct knowledge. Petitioner testified generally that their deaths were due to the mother\u2019s poverty and her inability to obtain medical care and otherwise to provide for her children. In her acknowledgment of service, the mother stated that her children\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>illnesses and deaths were \u201ccaused by a lack of nutrition.\u201d Although proof of neglect of one child is admissible to show neglect of another child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6\u20148.46(a)(1), the judge properly found no evidence that the mother willfully failed to provide food or medical care to the siblings despite having the financial ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">With respect to the father, although the petitioner raised abandonment and neglect, he principally contends that the father abandoned M.S. before he was born.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In considering whether there had been \u201cabandonment\u201d of M.S. by either his mother or his father, the judge properly utilized the definition of that term in <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">Abandonment of a child shall consist in any of the following acts by anyone having the custody or control of the child: (a) willfully forsaking a child; (b) failing to care for and keep the control and custody of a child so that the child shall be exposed to physical or moral risk without proper and sufficient protection; (c) failing to care for and keep the control and custody of a child so that the child shall be liable to be supported and maintained at the expense of the public, or by child caring societies or private persons not legally chargeable with its or their care, custody and control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Other statutes similarly protect \u201ca child who has been willfully abandoned by his parent.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6\u20148.9(e); <em>N.J.SA. </em>9:6-8.21(c)(5). Under these statutes, abandonment requires \u201ca finding that \u2018a parent has willfully forsaken obligations, although physically and financially able to discharge those obligations.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Adoption of a Child by D.M.H., </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>473, 481, 641 A.2d 235 (1994) (quoting <em>In re Adoption of Children by L.A.S., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>127, 134-35, 631 A.2d 928 (1993)), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>967, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>433, 130 L.Ed.2d 345 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">The judge found that M.S. had not been abandoned by the mother, who \u201cis actively involved in the child\u2019s life,\u201d is in \u201cconstant contact with\u201d him, and participated in this litigation by providing the acknowledgment. The judge noted that the mother desired the award of custody to her brother in the United States because it would be better for M.S. Further, the mother paid for M.S. to be transported from India, through Turkey and Mexico, to the United States. As the judge found, these facts gave \u201cclear indications of a mother who is unable to take care of this child and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>who wants nothing but the best for this child.\u201d Our Supreme Court has held that it is not willful abandonment for a parent to voluntarily surrender a child to foster care because it is in the child\u2019s best interest, or because the parent is currently incapable of providing the needed care, so long as the parent stays or tries to stay in regular contact with the child. <em>In re Guardianship of K.L.F., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>32, 38-39, 608 A.2d 1327 (1992); <em>In re Guardianship of J.C., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 16-17, 608 A.2d 1312 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In <em>D.C., </em>the court reached the same conclusion on similar facts. An impoverished mother paid to smuggle her son from Guatemala to the United States to live with his father, because she was not \u201cphysically and financially able\u201d to care for him, and she remained in contact with the juvenile after he arrived here. <em>D.C., supra, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 45, 48, 8 A.3d 260. The court aptly found that \u201c[n]o rational view of this evidence can support the conclusion that defendant abandoned her son.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 8 A.3d 260. The United States District Court has also declined to find parental abandonment in factual circumstances similar to this case. The federal court concluded that an African father who sent his son to the United States and \u201cwanted the best for his son and remained in regular communication with him,\u201d was \u201ca concerned father\u201d rather than \u201can abusive, neglectful father who abandons his son.\u201d <em>Yeboah v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>223 F.Supp.2d 650, 658 (E.D.Pa.2002), <em>aff'd, </em>345 F.3d 216 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Here, the evidence supports the judge\u2019s finding that the juvenile\u2019s mother did not abuse, neglect, or abandon him. Therefore, under the terms of Subparagraph J, petitioner did not show that reunification of M.S. with his mother was \u201cnot viable due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">We do not reach the same conclusion with respect to the juvenile\u2019s father. The mother certified that the father was addicted to alcohol and drugs and abandoned the family before M.S. was born. M.S. testified that he never met his father. He was unaware that his father had ever sent any money for him or his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>mother. Petitioner claimed that no one knew the father\u2019s whereabouts or even his date of birth to assist in locating him.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The family court cited the allegation that the father\u2019s abandonment was a result of alcoholism or drug addiction, and concluded there was insufficient evidence that the father\u2019s conduct was willful. Some cases have found that addicted parents have not abandoned their child. <em>In re Guardianship of K.H.O., </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>432, 455, 706 A.2d 226 (App.Div.1998), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>337, 736 A.2d 1246 (1999); <em>In re Adoption of a Child by J.R.D., </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>619, 629, 588 A.2d 446 (Ch.Div. 1990). In those cases, however, the parent made efforts to maintain contact with the child, and expressed a desire for reunification. <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 437, 706 A.2d 226 (noting the parent\u2019s many visits); <em>J.R.D., supra, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 623-25, 628-29, 588 A.2d 446 (noting the parent\u2019s visits with his child, efforts to find her after the child moved, intermittent payment of child support, and opposition to the adoption petition). We are not aware of any case that holds that a total disregard of parental duties, although caused by alcohol or drug addiction, is insufficient to constitute abandonment of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">As we have stated, abandonment must be willful. The \u201cparent \u2018must have engaged in a course of conduct that \u201cevidences a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>D.M.H., supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 481, 641 A.2d 235 (citations omitted). Here, the evidence was that the father engaged in such a course of conduct and abandoned his parental duties to his children. The father\u2019s absence during the juvenile\u2019s entire life plainly demonstrates his settled purpose to forego his parental duties and relinquish parental claims to M.S. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(b)(1)(a)-(b) (permitting the termination of parental rights for abandonment if the parent has had no contact with the child for six months or more and the parent\u2019s whereabouts are unknown).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The family court also noted that petitioner and the juvenile\u2019s mother had not tried to find the father for purposes of adjudicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ing this petition. As noted above, it is unclear what if any contact, notice, or service is required or permitted in the context of an SIJ determination. In any event, as the Family Part proceeded to grant custody and make findings without such an effort, we do not regard this as a basis on which to refuse to find abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We must hew to our standard of review, which requires deference to a trial court\u2019s factual findings. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. L.L., </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>210, 226, 989 A.2d 829 (2010) (citations omitted). We nevertheless conclude that the court erred in finding insufficient evidence that father had in fact abandoned the juvenile. <em>See N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. C.S., </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>76, 114-15, 842 A.2d 215 (App.Div.2004). Petitioner was thus entitled to a finding that M.S.\u2019s reunification with his father is not viable because of abandonment. <em>See </em>8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Petitioner also asked the Family Part to make an additional finding that \u201cit would not be in the [juvenile\u2019s] best interest to be returned to the [juvenile\u2019s] or parent\u2019s previous country of nationality or country of last habitual residence.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J)(ii). Petitioner presented evidence of the deplorable conditions in the slums of India, the greater opportunities available in the United States for nutrition, education, and medical care, and the love and support of M.S. by petitioner and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The judge declined to make a \u201cbest-interest\u201d determination because he found insufficient evidence that either parent had abandoned or neglected the juvenile. Because we disagree with the judge\u2019s finding regarding the father, we must address the federal statute further and determine whether it applies to circumstances where only one parent has abused, neglected, or abandoned the juvenile but the other parent has not, and reunification with the other parent is viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Several commentators<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and several courts, <em>In re Minor Children of J.E., </em>432 <em>N.J.Super. </em>361, 372, 74 A.3d 1013 (Ch.Div. 2013); <em>In re Marisol N.H., </em>115 A.D.3d 185, 979 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>643, 647 (2014); <em>In re Marcelina M.-G. v.

On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Nebraska fully analyzed the federal statute and held that the requirements of Subparagraph J are not met where one parent is available and did not abuse, neglect, or abandon the juvenile. <em>State v. Erick M., </em>284 <em>Neb. </em>340, 820 N.W.2d 639, 644-47 (2012). The Nebraska court stated: \u201cwhen ruling on a petitioner\u2019s motion for an eligibility order under \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J), a court should generally consider whether reunification with either parent is feasible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648. The Nebraska court ruled that because \u201creunification with [the juvenile\u2019s] mother was feasible, he was not eligible for SIJ status,\u201d and he \u201cwas not seeking SIJ status to escape parental abuse, neglect, or abandonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642, 648. We agree with the holding of the Nebraska court, and overrule the contrary holding of <em>J.E., supra, </em>432 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 372, 74 A.3d 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Subparagraph J requires a finding by the family court that a juvenile\u2019s \u201creunification with 1 or both of the immigrant\u2019s parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis found under State law.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J)(i). We understand the \u201c1 or both\u201d phrase to require that reunification with neither parent is viable because of abuse, neglect, or abandonment of the juvenile. In other words, the statute is not satisfied where reunification with one or both parents is viable. We hold that it is insufficient that reunification with one parent is not viable due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment, if the juvenile has another \u201csafe\u201d parent who has not abused, neglected or abandoned the juvenile. If that parent is deceased or unable to protect the child against abuse or neglect by the unsafe parent, then reunification with one or both of the juvenile\u2019s parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The legislative history of Subparagraph J supports our understanding of the statute. \u201cThe SIJ provisions of the INA were enacted in 1990 to protect abused, neglected, or abandoned children who, with their families, illegally entered the United States.\u201d <em>Yeboah v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>345 F.3d 216, 221 (3d Cir.2003). \u201cRather than being deported along with abusive or neglectful parents, or deported to parents who had abandoned them once in the United States, such children may seek special status to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As originally enacted, however, the statute \u201cwas abused ... by juveniles entering the United States as visiting students\u201d who used it to improve their immigration status. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In 1997 Congress amended Subparagraph J to require the juvenile to have \u201cbeen deemed eligible ... for long-term foster care due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment.\u201d Depts. of Commerce, Justice, &amp; State, the Judiciary, &amp; Related Agencies Appropriation Act, Pub. L. No. 105-119, \u00a7 113, 111 <em>Stat. </em>2440, 2460 (1997). Congress also added that the Attorney General (now the Secretary of Homeland Security) must expressly consent to the grant of SIJ status. <em>Ibid. </em>The conference report stated that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>language has been modified in order to limit the beneficiaries of this provision to those juveniles for whom it was created, namely abandoned, neglected, or abused children,\u201d and to ensure that the juvenile court determination was not \u201csought primarily for the purpose of obtaining the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, rather than for the purpose of obtaining relief from abuse or neglect.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 105-405, at 130 (1997), 1997 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N. </em>2941, 2981. Congress thus sought to deter juveniles and their parents from \u201cattempting to manipulate the system to obtain permanent residence\u201d for juveniles in the United States. <em>Yeboah, supra, </em>345 F.3d at 224; <em>see also M.B. v. Quarantillo, </em>301 <em>F. </em>3d 109, 114 (3d Cir.2002) (\u201cThe legislative history confirms that the revision in the statute was intended to curtail the granting of special immigrant juvenile status.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In 2008, Congress amended the statute further by enacting the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110^57, \u00a7 235(d)(l)-(3), 122 <em>Stat. </em>5044, 5079-80 (2008). Section 235 of the Wilberforce Act made two pertinent changes to Subparagraph J. First, by permitting SIJ applications from juveniles who were placed under the custody of \u201can individual or entity appointed by a State or juvenile court,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>the amendment \u201cbroadened the category of those to whom a child\u2019s custody could be legally committed.\u201d <em>C.G.H., supra, </em>75 A.3d at 168 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Second, the 2008 amendment removed the phrase \u201celigible for long-term foster care,\u201d and substituted \u201creunification with 1 or both of the immigrant\u2019s parents is not viable.\u201d This represented less of a change than it appeared, as the Regulation already provided that \u201c[eligible for long-term foster care means that a determination has been made by the juvenile court that family reunification is no longer a viable option.\u201d 8 <em>C.F.B. </em>\u00a7 204.11(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The 2008 amendment retained the 1997 requirement that reunifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>cation not be viable because of \u201cabuse, neglect, [or] abandonment,\u201d adding \u201cor a similar basis found under State law.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">There is no specific legislative history on the \u201c1 or both\u201d language. 3 Charles Gordon et al., <em>Immigration Law &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 35.09 at 35-44 (rev. ed. 2013) (\u201cThe shift in language ... was accomplished without a trace of legislative history.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, some guidance can be gained from the legislative history of the 2008 legislation as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The 2008 Wilberforee Act was intended to continue the fight against human trafficking. H.R.Rep. No. 110-430, pt. 1 at 3.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The legislation was named to recognize \u201cthe immense contributions of British Parliamentarian William Wilberforee to the abolition of the global slave trade in the 19th Century.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34. One of its key initiatives was \u201c[preventing the trafficking of unaccompanied alien children found in the United States by ensuring that they are not repatriated into the hands of traffickers or abusive families.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33; <em>see </em>153 <em>Cong. Rec. </em>H. 14,098, 14,121 (Rep. Sanchez); 154 <em>Cong. Rec. </em>S. 4,795, 4,800 (2008) (Sen. Biden); 154 <em>Cong. Rec. </em>H. 10,888, 10,903 (2008) (Rep. Berman). The legislation\u2019s section that amended Subparagraph J was entitled \u201cEnhancing Efforts to Combat the Trafficking of Children.\u201d \u00a7 235,122 Stat. at 5074-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">At the same time, Congress did not forget the concerns it had expressed in 1997. At the introduction of the bill, Representative Lamar Smith stated that the bill would add \u201creasonable protections for unaccompanied alien minors,\u201d and thanked the sponsors for addressing his concerns by modifying provisions to discourage \u201cillegal immigration and immigration fraud.\u201d 153 <em>Cong. Rec. </em>H. 14,098, 14,121 (2007). When the bill was ultimately passed, Sena<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>tor Dianne Feinstein stated: \u201cThis legislation does not expand the current immigration rights of any child. Instead, it presumes that children will be placed in removal proceedings\u2014unless they qualify for immigration benefits under current law.\u201d 154 <em>Corig. Rec. </em>S. 10,886,10,887 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Congress\u2019s continued concern with misuse of the law was reflected in the Executive Branch\u2019s implementation of Subparagraph J. Guidance memoranda to federal immigration directors, issued both before and after the 2008 amendment, instruct that the Secretary of Homeland Security \u201cwill not consent to a petition for SIJ status if it was sought primarily for the purpose of obtaining the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, rather than for the purpose of obtaining relief from abuse or neglect or abandonment.\u201d <em>See Erick M., supra, </em>820 N.W.2d at 646 &amp; n. 25 (citations and quotation marks omitted). The proposed regulations would explicitly incorporate this language into 8 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 204.11. Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, 76 <em>Fed. Reg. </em>54,978, 54,981-82, 54,985 (proposed Sept. 6, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Thus, the legislative and administrative history of Subparagraph J shows two competing goals. Congress wanted to permit use of the SIJ procedure when necessary to prevent the return of juveniles to unsafe parents. Where such protection is unnecessary, however, Congress wanted to prevent misuse of the SIJ statute for immigration advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Our understanding of Subparagraph J\u2014that it requires a finding that reunification with neither parent is viable because of abuse, neglect, or abandonment\u2014achieves both of Congress\u2019s goals. It effectuates Congress\u2019s protective goal by making a juvenile eligible for SIJ status if the juvenile cannot be reunited with a parent without being put in danger by an unsafe parent. It also serves Congress\u2019s goal of preventing misuse of the statute by not granting immigration advantages when the juvenile has a safe parent with whom he can be reunited.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The contrary interpretation does not achieve both of Congress\u2019s goals. It would mean that a juvenile could apply for SIJ status, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>with its immigration advantages, even if that juvenile could be viably reunified with one parent who never abused, neglected, or abandoned the juvenile. Indeed, it would permit SIJ status even if that safe parent had raised the juvenile from birth, in love, comfort, and security, and even if reunification with the safe parent would not result in any further contact with the unsafe parent. Nothing in the legislative history of Subparagraph J supports such a broad interpretation. Finally, that broad interpretation would render Subparagraph J\u2019s words \u201cor both\u201d superfluous, because it would always be sufficient that \u201creunification with 1 ... of the immigrant\u2019s parents is not viable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Petitioner and M.S. presented a sympathetic case to the family court. However, courts misuse their power and authority if they misinterpret and misapply a statute contrary to its legislative intent. If Congress wished to create a \u201c \u2018gateway\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for all abused or impoverished foreign juveniles to enter the United States and benefit from the better conditions provided in this country, it could have done so. It did not do so by enacting the 2008 amendments to Subparagraph J. <em>See Garcia v. Holder, </em>659 F.3d 1261, 1271 (9th Cir.2011) (Subparagraph J shows \u201ca congressional intent to assist a limited group of abused children to remain safely in the country\u201d). The purpose of Subparagraph J remains the protection of those abused, neglected, or abandoned juveniles whose compelled repatriation would place them in danger from a parent who abused, neglected, or abandoned them.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In <em>Yeboah, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">SIJ status is supported if \u201cneither the dependency order nor the administrative or judicial determination of the alien\u2019s best interest was sought primarily for the purpose of obtaining the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, rather than for the purpose of obtaining relief from abuse or neglect.\u201d <em>[Yeboah, supra, </em>345 F.3d at 222 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 105-405, at 130 (1997), 1997 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N. </em>2941).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The 2008 amendments did not alter that intent of the federal law. <em>Erick M., supra, </em>820 N.W.2d. at 645 &amp; n. 23. Here, the express objective of the petition was for M.S. to obtain relief for purposes of his immigration status, rather than for the purpose of obtaining relief from abuse, neglect, or abandonment, as his mother had not abused, neglected, or abandoned him.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We therefore hold that the Family Part was not required to make a \u201cbest interest\u201d finding under 8 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J)(ii) because petitioner failed to satisfy 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J)(i). As set forth above, there was sufficient credible evidence supporting the court\u2019s finding that the mother had not abused, neglected, or abandoned M.S., and petitioner failed to show reunification with the mother was not viable for those reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Finally, we note that when M.S. was before the trial court, he was seventeen years old, and that he is now nineteen. The Family Part in this State would typically not decide the issue of a juvenile\u2019s custodial status and best interests if he has reached the age of majority, generally eighteen years old. <em>See N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. W.F., </em>434 <em>N.J.Super. </em>288, 294-98, 83 A.3d 892 (App.Div.2014). However, under federal law, an alien remains eligible for SIJ status if he \u201c[i]s under twenty-one years of age,\u201d \u201c[i]s unmarried,\u201d and \u201c[h]as been\u201d found to meet the criteria of Subparagraph J. 8 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 204.11(c); <em>see also </em>8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1232(d)(6) (\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, an alien described in [Subparagraph J] may not be denied special immigrant status under such section after the date of the enactment of this Act based on age if the alien was a child on the date on which the alien applied for such status.\u201d).
