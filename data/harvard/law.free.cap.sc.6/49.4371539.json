Mobley, executor of Biggers Mobley, deceased, against J. S. Cureton, F. D. Green and M. V. Green, his wife, and J. M. Green and Eliza J. Green, his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The case and exceptions, as set forth in the brief upon which the case was heard in this Court, are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\">This action was begun in the Court of Common Pleas for Lancaster County on the 13th day of June, 1871, by Edward B. Mobley, as executor of Biggers Mobley, against the above named defendants, as heirs at law of Thomas K. Cureton, deceased. The cause of action is a sealed note, made by the said Thomas K. Cureton, on the 23d of February, 1854, in favor of the said Biggers Mobley, for the sum of $1,373.88, due on 18th day of March, 1854, with interest due and payable annually; credited with the sum of $25 on the 18th of March, 1855, the sum of $25 on the 18th of March, 1856, and with the sum of $100 on 15th April, 1857.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-6\">The complaint sets out copies of said note and credits; alleges the death of the said Thomas K. Cureton on the 3d of July, 1854, seized in fee of the real estate therein described, leaving as his heirs at law his widow, Eliza R. Cureton, his children, James E. Cureton, T. K. Cureton, Jr., and the defendants, J. 8. Cureton, M. V., now the wife of the defendant F. D. Green, and Eliza J., now the wife of the defendant James M. Green; that the said Eliza R., widow, has since died testate, and the said T. K. Cureton, Jr., as executor of her will, has commenced proceedings in the Court of Common Pleas for said County for the settlement of her estate, alleging its insolvency, and that the Court has made an order under said proceeding restraining creditors from suing the executor at law, and requiring them to establish their respective claims before a Referee; that the said J. E. Cureton has since died intestate and insolvent; that he has no administrator and no estate upon which to administer; and that the said T. K. Cureton, Jr., has been adjudicated a bankrupt under the laws of the United States; alleges that certain real estate therein described descended to the defendants, J. S. Cureton, M. V. Green and Eliza J. Green, as heirs at law of the said Thomas K. Cureton, deceased, and that the same exceeded in value the amount of the debt and interest herein claimed; alleges the death of Biggers Mobley testate, the appointment and qualification of the plaintiff as his executor; that the said note has never been paid, except as to the credits heretofore stated, and demands judgment against the defendants for the amount and interest still due upon the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The answer of the defendant J. S. Cureton is contained in the following paragraphs:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">' 1. That he denies that the lands described in the complaint as \u201cthe Stinson Place\u201d and \u201cthe Pea Top Place\u201d descended to him and the defendant Eliza Jane Green, as heirs at law of T. K. Cureton, deceased, but states that in the partition and division of the real and personal estate of said deceased amongst his distributees and heirs at law, by the order or decree of a Court of Equity held for Lancaster District, the said lands were assigned or allotted to them at prices or values fixed upon the same by Commissioners appointed by the said Court. So that defendant states that, although they were both infants at the time, the one being about five and the other about eleven years of age, they thereby became virtually the purchasers of said land at the prices fixed upon the same as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-6\">2. That on or about the 15th day of October, A. D. 1860, at Lancaster Court Plouse, in an action brought in the Court of Common Pleas by the said Biggers Mobley against Samuel B. Massey and James E. Cureton, as administrators of the estate of the said T. K. Cureton, deceased, for the same cause of action as that set forth in the complaint herein, the said Biggers Mobley recovered judgment, duly allowed upon the merits thereof, against the said administrators for $1,959.53.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-7\">3. That subsequent to the recovery of said judgment, the said administrators, this defendant is informed and believes, with a view to the payment and satisfaction thereof, assigned to the said Biggers Mobley several sealed notes by one Wm. Stevens, to them the said administrators made payable, for sums of money in the aggregate exceeding in amount the money then due on said judgment ; and that the said Wra. Stevens was abundantly solvent and fully able to pay said amount of money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-8\">4. That the personal estate left by the said T. K. Cureton was very large and far more than sufficient for the payment of all just debts against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-9\">5. That the lapse of time since the execution of the note set forth as the cause of action in the complaint, the ample sufficiency of the personal estate left by the said T. K. Cureton for the payment of all just debts against him, and the failure of the said Biggers Mobley to urge the claim until after the death of both of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>administrators of said estate, in connection with other circumstances, this defendant insists, show that said debt has been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-5\">6. That if the said Biggers Mobley did fail to obtain from the said administrators payment and satisfaction of said debt, such failure arose from laches on his part so great and neglect so gross as to absolve .this defendant from any liability which may have existed on his part to pay or contribute towards the payment of the same:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">7. That there is a defect of parties defendant in the omission of the other heirs at law of the said T. K. Cureton or their representatives, to wit, of T. K. Cureton, Jr., Eliza R. Cureton, the widow of said deceased, and James E. Cureton, the two last named, who are now dead, having survived the said T. K. Cureton as his heirs at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">8. That the said plaintiff ought not to be admitted to say that this defendant is bound, as heir at law of the said T. K. Cureton, deceased, by reason of real estate descended to him, to pay the said debt or any part thereof, because he says that the said Biggers Mobley, in his lifetime, on or about the 28th day of November, A. D. 1868, filed his bill of complaint in this Court against Thomas K. Cureton, Jr., this defendant, Francis D. Green and wife Virginia, James M. Green and wife Eliza Jane, therein and thereby, amongst other things, seeking to compel the payment and satisfaction of said debt from this defendant and other heirs at law of the said T. K. Cureton, deceased; and that thereupon, after full hearing, it was determined and adjudged by the said Court that this defendant is not bound to pay said debt or any part thereof, and that said bill, <em>\u201c </em>so far as it seeks leave to make the heirs of the late T. K. Cureton liable for his said debt by reason of lands descended to them, be dismissed,\u201d which said bill, as to other matters, is still pending in this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-8\">To this answer the plaintiff made no reply, but demurred as follows, viz.: \u201c The plaintiff demurs to the first, fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth paragraphs of the answer of the defendant J. Samuel Cureton for insufficiency in not stating facts sufficient to constitute a defense or counter claim.\u201d Afterwards, by leave of the Court, before trial, the demurrer, so far as the same relates to the eighth section of the above answer, was withdrawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>F. D. Green and wife answered as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">The defendants Francis D. Green and wife M. Virginia Green, answering the complaint herein, deny that the debt of Thomas K. Cureton to Biggers Mobley, referred to and described in the complaint, is still due and unpaid, as claimed by the plaintiff in his complaint; but, on the contrary, affirm (as they are informed) that the same has been fully paid and satisfied, and that now no liability for the same rests on the heirs at law of the said Thomas K. Cureton, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-6\">These defendants, on further answering, allege:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-7\">1. That Biggers Mobley himself, some six years after the note referred to became due, and about six years after the property of the late T. I\u00a3. Cureton, described in the complaint, was partitioned and divided among the heirs at law, viz., some time in the year 1860, brought his action on the said uote against S. B. Massey and J. E. Cureton, as administrator of said T. K. Cureton, deceased, for the collection of the same; that the said S. B. Massey and J. E. Cureton, as administrators aforesaid, had already, at the time the property, real and personal, of the said T. K. Cureton was partitioned, in 1854, reserved a sufficiency of the assets of the estate of their intestate to defray the expenses and pay off the debts outstanding against the estate; and that, after such reservation, they did not enter an appearance to the action aforesaid of Biggers Mobley on the note aforesaid, and that, by entering no appearance, making no defense to the action and suffering judgment to go against them by default on the said note, they admitted in their hands assets sufficient to pay the said debt, and that the heirs are in no way liable for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-8\">2. That Biggers Mobley (if he has not collected the money from the said administrators, which defendants are unwilling to admit,) has all the time been looking to the said administrators to pay the said debt, and he has been guilty of gross negligence and laches, so that the plaintiff, as his representative, has now no right in this Court as against the heirs at law of the said T. K. Cureton, deceased, to recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-9\">3. That the personal assets of the said T. K. Cureton, deceased, were amply sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness of the said deceased, and that a sufficiency to pay the same passed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>into the hands of his administrators, Samuel B. Massey and James E. Cureton, and that the heirs at law are not liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">4. That on the 6th day of December, 1869, at Charleston, the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina duly made a decree discharging the defendant F. D. Green from all his debts provable under the Act of Congress entitled \u201cAn Act to establish a system of uniform bankruptcy throughout the United States,\u201d approved March 2, 1867 ; that the supposed indebtdeness alleged in this complaint,if any such ever did accrue, occurred before the granting of such discharge; and the alleged indebtedness is one that was provable against the estate of the defendant F. D. Green, in the proceedings in which said discharge was granted, and was not, nor any part thereof, created in consequence of a defalcation as a public officer or as an executor, administrator, guardian or trustee, or while acting in any fiduciary capacity. And that the lands which descended to defendant M. Virginia Green have all been sold as defendant Francis D. Green\u2019s property, under the same proceedings in bankruptcy, and that defendants, have now, since said proceedings in .bankruptcy, no lands, tenements or hereditaments by descent from the said T. K. Cureton, deceased, and are not liable for tbe debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">5. That on the day of , 1870, at Columbia, on an appeal taken to the Supreme Court of the- State from Circuit decree, in an action or bill of complaint brought in the Equity Court for Lancaster County by Biggers Mobley (theintestate of present plaintiff) against all the heirs of said Thos. K. Cureton, deceased, and one John M. Beaty, as administrator of Samuel B. Massey, deceased, who was one of the administrators of the said Thos. IC. Cureton, deceased, on the very same cause of action as that set forth in the complaint herein, the said bill of complaint was dismissed by the decree or judgment of the Court duly rendered, upon the merits of the whole ease as presented, and by the said decree or judgment the defendant was relieved from paying the said sealed note or debt, being the very same as that upon which the present complaint is founded. And defendants claim that the said judgment is a bar to any recovery in this action, and so plead and claim judgment for costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-7\">The answer of the defendants J. M. Green and wife Eliza J. contains the same number of sections as the answer of F. D. Green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>and wife, and is substantially the same in statement, with the exception that there is no allegation of bankruptcy in paragraph 5.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">To the said answers of F. D. Green and wife, and of J. M. Green and wife, the plaintiff made no reply, but demurred to each as follows: \u201cThe plaintiff demurs to the paragraphs marked 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the answer of the defendants F. D. Green and wife M. Virgina Green (and the same as to J. M. Green and wife) for insufficiency in not stating facts sufficient to constitute a defense or counter claim.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">The cause upon the demurrers was heard before His Honor Judge Thomas at the June Term for 1872. The Judge overruled the demurrer generally by endorsing upon the record of the demurrer to each of the three answers the words \u201c demurrer overruled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-7\">Predicated on this order, the defendant J. S. Cureton, on the 20th of August, 1872, without notice to the plaintiff, put on file in the Clerk\u2019s office the following, entitled \u201c a judgment for J. S. Cureton on demurrer,\u201d viz.: \u201cAn order having been entered in this action at regular term of the Court on 20th June, 1872, overruling the demurrer of the plaintiff to the answer of the defendant J. Samuel Cureton; now, on motion of W. A. Moore, attorney for said defendant, J. S. Cureton, it is adjudged that the complaint herein be dismissed, and that the defendant J. Samuel Cureton recover of the plaintiff the sum of dollars for his costs and disbursements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-8\">After service of the notice of adjustment of costs hereinafter mentioned, the costs and disbursements were inserted in the blank above, and execution for the same issued. A similar paper was signed and filed by the Clerk in favor of the defendants F. D. Green and wife, and J. M. Green and wife, without notice to the plaintiff, and similar action had in regard thereto-.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-9\">Three days after entry of said papers entitled \u201cjudgment on demurrer,\u201d &amp;e., as aforesaid, the plaintiff was served by the defendant J. S. Cureton with notice to be made before the Clerk for adjustment of costs, in the following words, viz.: \u201c The plaintiff\u2019s</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-10\">counsel will please notice the within statement of costs and disburser ments of the defendant J. Samuel Cureton, and that defendant will apply to the Clerk -for an adjustment of the same on the 26th day of August, instant, 10 o\u2019clock, A. M.\u201d A similar notice was given by the other defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-11\">At the time mentioned in the foregoing notice, the plaintiff filed with the Clerk his protest and grounds against the adjustment of costs in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201cThe plaintiff having been served with notice of motion for an adjustment of costs in this ease, enters the following protest against said motion, and objects to the entry of judgment and execution for costs herein, upon the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">\u201c1. Because no order or decree has yet been made to warrant said motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">\u201c2. Because the said case, above stated, is still upon the dockets of the Court, and no order affecting the merits thereof has yet been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">\u201c3. Because, after the overruling of the demurrer, the plaintiff has the right, under Section 195 of the Code of Procedure, to controvert the allegations in the defendant\u2019s answer which were demurred to, and the only effect of the decision upon the demurrer is to allow the defendant to bring up as matters of defense the facts set out in his answer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-8\">Whereupon the Clerk, without notice to the defendants or their attorneys, made the following order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-9\">\u201cOn hearing the following protest, and deeming the grounds therein stated to be sufficient, it is adjudged that the motion for adjustment of costs be denied, and that the judgments for costs, filed 20th August, 1872, signed by me in blank, severally, in favhr of the defendants, J. S. Cureton, F. D. Green and wife, and J. M. Green and wife, in the absence and without notice to the counsel for the plaintiff; be, and the said judgments are hereby, vacated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-10\">The cause then remained upon the docket until regularly called at the extra term of the Court held in July, 1874, when the presiding Judge made the following order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-11\">\u201c The demurrers to the answers in this case having been overruled by His Honor Judge Thomas, it is ordered that the complaint herein be dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-12\">Whereupon the defendants\u2019 attorneys and the said Clerk were served on the 7th day of August, 1874, with the following notice and grounds of appeal:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-13\">The defendants, or their attorneys, and Thomas H. Clyburn, Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas, will take notice that the plaintiff appeals to the Supreme Court from the order of His Honor Judge Thomas, in this action, filed on the 20th day of June, 1872, overruling the demurrers to certain parts of the answers of the defendants ; and from the so-called judgment thereupon signed by the said Clerk on the 20th day of August, 1872, and set aside by him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>on the 29th day of the same month; and also from the order of the Hon. T. J. Mackey, presiding Judge, made in this action at the extra term of this Court, entered July 10th, 1874, dismissing the complaint herein, upon the grounds following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">\n<em>Exceptions to order of Judge Thomas:</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">1. Because the answers of the defendants were not sufficient in law in the particulars demurred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">2. Because His Honor Judge Thomas should have accompanied his decision upon the demurrers with a provision saving the right of plaintiff to controvert said answers, as by the plaintiff's counsel requested at the argument on the demurrers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-8\"><em>Exceptions </em>to. <em>the so-called judgment taken before the Clerk of the Court:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-9\">1. Because the said judgment could not be legally entered upon the order of Judge Thomas therein referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-10\">2. Because the plaintiff had no notice of the entry of said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-11\">3. Because the same was annulled by the order whereby it was set aside by the Clerk because of the irregularity of its issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-12\">\n<em>Exceptions to the order of Judge Mackey:</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-13\">1.

Has the Circuit Court erred or not? We think not. Law and equity has been blended. This action has been brought under the Code of Procedure.

Cureton, as his heirs with assets descended.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">Several answers were interposed by the parties defendant, and demurrers filed to certain portions of their answers. The Circuit Court overruled these demurrers and gave judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>A preliminary objection is interposed to the appeal on the ground that it was not taken within three months after the entry of the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The facts bearing on this objection are, briefly, as follows : At the hearing at June Term, 1872, an order was endorsed by the Circuit Judge upon the record of the demurrers as follows: \u201cDemurrer overruled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">No other order appears to have been made by the Circuit Judge until July 10th, 1874. Without other authority than the order contained in the memorandum just recited, the defendants entered up a judgment dismissing the complaint with costs. The Clerk was proceeding to adjust the costs, when, on objection on the part of the plaintiff', he refused to proceed further, and made an order as follows : \u201c On hearing the following protest, and deeming the grounds therein stated tobe sufficient, it is adjudged that the motion for adjustment of costs be denied, and that the judgment for costs filed 20th August, 1872, signed by me in blank, severally, in favor of the defendants J. S. Cureton, F. D. Green and wife, and J. M. Green and wife, in the absence and without notice to counsel for the plaintiff,- be, and the said judgments are hereby, vacated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">This order was signed by the Clerk, and dated August 29, 1872. No further action was taken until July 10, 1874, when the following order was made by the Circuit Judge : \u201c The demurrers to the answers in this case having been overruled by His Honor Judge Thomas, it is ordered that the complaint herein be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The appeal was taken in due time, so far as the last named order is concerned ; but it is contended that the order overruling the demurrers, having been made more than three months prior to the appeal, cannot be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">The order for judgment made July 10, 1874, must be regarded as equivalent to a final judgment based on the order overruling the demurrers. The order overruling the demurrers was necessarily interlocutory, as it did not follow as a necessity from it that.the complaint should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The judgment in form entered by the Clerk without the direction of the Court was invalid. \u2014 Code, \u00a7 302. The order of the' Clerk assuming to vacate that judgment need not be considered; for no powers of that nature can be exercised by the Clerk, but by the Court alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The appeal having been duly taken from the final judgment, all interlocutory orders necessarily affecting the judgment were open for revisal. \u2014 Code, \u00a7 11, Sub. 1, as amended, 15 Stat., 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The objection to the regularity of the appeal is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Theffirst objection raised by the demurrer relates to paragraph 1 of the answers of J. S. Cureton.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">This paragraph denies that the defendant holds as hei.rs at law, on the ground that actual partition had been made among the distributees ofT.K. Cureton, and that, for the purpose of such partition, the allotment was made according to prices or value fixed on the land by Commissioners appointed by the Court, and that the defendants, then infants, took the premises held by them at prices so' fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The fact that defendant holds under title derived through partition, as it regards the particular tract assigned to him, does not discharge his liability for the debts of his ancestor, imposed by the fact of assets of that ancestor descended to him. This point was ruled by this Court in <em>Barber </em>vs. <em>McAlliley, </em>(S. C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">But although t'his averment is not good as a plea in bar to the whole of plaintiff\u2019s demand, it is ground in equity for relief as against the other defendants, \u2014 at least if the share of this defendant, being in excess of his proportion as distributee, was compensated for out of his individual estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">The averments of the answer are somewhat indefinite and uncertain as it regards the statement of their ground of equitable interference; but the remedy in such case is, under \u00a7 183, to obtain an order that the pleading be made certain and definite, and not a demurrer. It follows that the proper consequence of overruling the demurrer, so far as this clause was concerned, was not a dismissal of the complaint, but its retention for the enforcement of plaintiff\u2019s1 legal demand and the consideration of any equities that might be showu to have arisen out of such advance by the defendant interposing the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">The fourth paragraph, which was also demurred to, alleged that the personal estate left by the said T. K. Cureton was very large, and far more than sufficient for the payment of all just debts against him. Considering this paragraph as intended as in itself a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action, it was insufficient. It must be concluded that the order overruling the demurrers treated this paragraph as setting up a defense in bar, and, as such, affirming the sufficiency in point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>of law of such matter in bar. Such being the ease, the order overruling the demurrer to this paragraph is erroneous. It was held in <em>Vernon </em>vs. <em>Valk </em>(2 Hill Ch., 257,) that the heir cannot plead that the executor has assets. For the same reason he cannot plead that personal assets originally sufficient had been wasted in the hands of the personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The demurrer to the fifth and sixth paragraphs was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The fifth paragraph pleads payment. Although it unnecessarily assumes to set forth the nature of the proof by which the defendant hopes to establish the fact of payment, yet the facts and circumstances are not sufficiently detailed to enable the Court to determine on the face of the pleading whether an inference of payment properly arises from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The same observation is applicable to the sixth paragraph. Gross laches is alleged against the plaintiff. The nature of that laches is not disclosed, and the Court cannot determine on the face of the pleading whether that laches is of such a nature as to amount to a wrong as it regards any duty that the plaintiff may have owed to the defendant. It is obvious, that, as it regards these paragraphs, the order overruling the demurrer should have been followed by proper orders for the trial of the issues of fact raised by these paragraphs.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The defendants F. D. Green and wife answered, and portions of their answer were affected by the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Paragraph 1st pleads in bar a recovery had in the same cause of action by Biggers Mobley, the plaintiff\u2019s testator, against the personal representatives of T. K. Cureton. Judgment recovered without satisfaction in an action against the personal representatives is not a bar to an action against the heir for the debt of his ancestor by reason of assets descended.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">This would follow from ,what was held in <em>Bird </em>vs. <em>Houze, </em>Speer Eq., 250. The right of the creditor to proceed against the heir after judgment against the personal representative is there fully recognized. The effect of the ruling upon the demurrer was to sustain the validity of their obligation as a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s demand, and in this respect it was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">Paragraph 2 alleges gross laches, but the matter of inducement, as laid, points to the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s testator had looked to the administrator for payment as the ground of affirming laches. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>This does not constitute a defense, and the \u2022 demurrer to this paragraph should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Paragraph 4 pleads discharge in bankruptcy under proceedings instituted subsequent to the indebtedness alleged in the complaint and the sale of the lands descended under such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Ground existed for overruling the demurrer to this clause. It does not appear what interest in the lands descended was treated as assets of the husband\u2019s estate, or what became of the wife\u2019s interest, if any such interest existed at the time of bankruptcy, so that the rights of the parties cannot be determined on the face of the pleading. Under any aspect, it is presumable that the facts and circumstances relating to the proceedings in bankruptcy are a material part of the defendant\u2019s case, either as bearing on their legal or equitable rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Paragraph 5, as it stands, contains a good plea of a former action on the same cause of action between the same parties and final judgment denying the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s demand. This, plea, as demurred to, must be tested by the matter set forth in the pleading, and recourse cannot be had to the record in the case recited therein to modify or affect the terms of the plea. The inspection of the record is matter of proof under an issue joined on the truth of the plea, and cannot be considered upon demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The answers of J. M. Green and wife were demurred to likewise; but as all the grounds of demurrer taken thereto are already disposed of in relation to the answers of F. D. Green and wife, it will not be necessary to make further reference to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">In each of the three answers already considered there was one or more defenses which, if established by proof, would constitute a complete bar to the plaintiff\u2019s demand. Demurrers being interposed to these pleas, and these demurrers being overruled, a question arises whether a judgment dismissing the complaint was the proper proceeding on the part of the Court. This raises the question of the effect of a demurrer to an answer under the Code of Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Where an answer sets forth matter amounting to a counter claim, the plaintiff is bound either to demur or reply, (Code, \u00a7 176,) and, failing to do so, the defendant is entitled to judgment as it regards the matter of such counter claim, as upon an admission of the truth of its allegations. \u2014 \u00a7 191. A counter claim relates to matter that; might be the subject of an action and give rise to a judgment independently of the matters set forth in the complaint to which it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>interposed. It is rather in the nature of a cross action than of a defense, and may be pleaded conjointly with as many defenses to the complaint as the defendant may have to offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Matters set forth by way of defense, whether of a legal or equitable nature, in an answer, and not amounting to a counter claim, are, by the Code, \u201cdeemed controverted by the adverse party as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case may require.\u2019\u2019\u2014 \u00a7 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The plaintiff, however, may demur or reply to any matter set forth in \u00bfhe answer. This is conferred as a privilege and not as a necessity of pleading. On the other hand, the Court may, if justice requires it, make an order requiring the plaintiff to reply to any new matter set up in the answer. \u2014 \u00a7 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">As the effect of a demurrer is not specifically defined by the Code, it must be gathered inferentially <em>from </em>it. That the Code intended materially to change the nature and effect of pleading, is clearly evinced by Section 163, which says: \u201cAll the forms of pleading heretofore existing are abolished, and hereafter the forms of pleading in civil actions in Courts of record and the rules by which the sufficiency of the pleading is to be determined are those prescribed by this Code of Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Abolishing the forms of pleading necessarily abolishes the technical incidents depending wholly on such forms. But the Code does not in terms or intention abolish the substantial characteristics of the several pleadings that are retained either in name or by their equivalents under other names. Where an incident of pleading arises out of its substantial nature and not merely from its technical form, it cannot be considered as affected by this general provision of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">The clause of Section 191, putting the allegations of the answer as affecting defenses other than counter claims at issue, without regard to subsequent pleading on the part of the plaintiff, is absolute, and nowhere in terms conditioned on the plaintiff\u2019s abstaining from interposing a demurrer as authorized in Section 176. The two last mentioned Sections must be read together. If consistent, there is no ground for qualifying the terms of Section 191 so as to exclude the case of matters demurred to. Such an inconsistency cannot arise unless there is something in the substantial nature of a demurrer that renders it inconsistent with its use that matters demurred to should, after the demurrer is overruled, be regarded as subject to traverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>A demurrer does not necessarily test the rights of the parties in suit. It questions alone the mode of statement of them in the pleadings demurred to, and tests the rights involved only so far as they are correctly stated in the pleading. If the defendant interposes a defense which, in the judgment of the plaintiff, is both insufficient in law and false in fact, it is perfectly consistent that he should question its legal character by demurrer in order to avoid the expense and delay attending the trial of an immaterial issue, and that, if in the Court its sufficiency in point of law should be established, he should be in a position to deny the truth of the matter alleged. It may be concluded that there is nothing in the substantial nature of a demurrer that is inconsistent with a subsequent issue of fact upon the very matter to which it relates. As the technical characteristics of a demurrer at common law, as dependent upon form, is inapplicable to pleadings under the Code, the rules of the common law practice determining the character of the judgment that should follow the overruling of a demurrer need not be considered, for they cannot operate on the text of the Code so as to give rise to a necessity for modifying Section 191 on the principles of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The judgment should be set aside aiid the order overruling the demurrer modified to conform to the foregoing conclusions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b77-6\"><em>Moses, </em>C.
