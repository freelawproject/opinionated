B. DeSaussure, the appellant, obtained an order for judgment against one Joseph A. Reese, and on the 21st March of the same year, after the rising of the Court, he entered his judgment in the Clerk\u2019s office, issued execution thereon and lodged the same with the Sheriff. At the same term, D. Zeigler, the respondent, also obtained an order for judgment against the same defendant, and his judgment was entered in the Clerk\u2019s office one day later than that of the appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-10\">The Sheriff sold property of the defendant, and, the proceeds of the sale being in the Sheriff\u2019s hands, His Honor, on motion of Zeigler\u2019s attorney, made an order that the date of the entry of Zeigler\u2019s judgment be amended so as to make it bear date the 21st March, 1867, and that the funds in the Sheriff\u2019s hands be applied <em>pro rata </em>to both judgments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-11\">It was said that there was a usage of the bar for all judgments carried to the Clerk within thirty days after the rising of the Court to be entered as of the term, but this was denied by the counsel for the appellant, and Mr. Hutson, who was Zeigler\u2019s attorney when his judgment was entered, admitted by affidavit that he had no knowledge of the usage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-12\">An appeal was taken on behalf of D. B. DeSaussure to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-13\">---, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-14\"><em>Hutson &amp; Hutson, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b20-15\">January 20, 1875.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Au\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b20-16\">Moses, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGy\">It is not necessary to consider whether the understanding and agreement of the bar, referred to' in the brief, can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>defeat the lien of the judgment of the appellant, which was created by its entry. Mr. Hutson, in his affidavit, does not ascribe the delay on his part to the knowledge of such agreement. If he had deferred the entry of his judgment by reason of even a misapprehension of its terms, he could not avail himself of its benefits, because, in fact, he did not come within its provisions as to the time to which it was to extend. He did not offer his judgment to the Clerk for entry until March 22, 1867.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">In his affidavit he disclaims all knowledge of the said agreement, and therefore stood, so far as he was concerned, as if none had existed. His condition was, in fact, better than that of the attorney of the respondent, who may have felt himself bound by professional honor to regard the understanding to which he was a party. Mr. Hutson excuses himself for the delay by an impression \u201cthat the usage was for the judgments carried to the Clerk at any time within thirty days to be entered by him as of the term.\u201d No such practice, even if it had been proved to exist among the Richland bar, could override the law, which gave the lien to the judgment first entered up, without priority as to the order of time where two or more were entered on the same day. The fact that the order for judgment in the two cases were taken at the same term does not change the rights of the parties. The lien is only created by the entry itself. The interlocutory order for judgment created in neither case any lien on the land of the defendant Reese. It conferred on the respective plaintiffs the right to enter a binding judgment at any time after the adjournment of the Court until the next term without leave, but in themselves established no lien. \u2014 10th Rule of Court, then of force; <em>Dibble </em>vs. <em>Taylor, </em>2 Sp., 211; <em>McIntosh </em>vs. <em>Wright, </em>Rich.
