There is no intrinsic <em>force </em>in a deed to transieran estate.

But upon a contract to convey land, made upon a valuable consideration, (and the plaintiff\u2019s deed expresses one,) the bargainor is seized to the use of the bargainee, and the Statute of Uses executes the estate, and the plaintiff\u2019s deed is therefore good and effectual as a <em>bargain and sale. </em>\u2014 2 BL, 338; 4 K., 544; <em>Rugge </em>vs. <em>Ellis, 1 </em>Bay, 104; <em>Craig </em>vs. <em>Pinson, </em>Chev., 272; <em>Chancellor's.

Because the Act of 1795 (5 Stat., 258, which is also incorporated in the Eevised Statutes, page 423, \u00a7 4,) prescribes the form or purport of a release, which is declared valid and effectual to pass the title of real estate, but provides that the Section shall be so construed as not to invalidate the \u201c forms heretofore in use in this State.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-9\">In <em>Craig </em>vs. <em>Pinson, </em>(Chev. B., 272,) the form prescribed by the Act of 1795 was held to be the form for a <em>bargain and sale, </em>and a deed not pursuing that form and having only one subscribing witness was adjudged invalid. Judge Butler, delivering the opinion of the Court, said (on page 277) : \u201cThe Act of the Legislature does say that the form prescribed should not invalidate the forms heretofore in use in this State; that is, all common law modes of conveyance, which were attended with notoriety and transmutation of possession from one to another. All other forms are excluded by the one presented.\u201d This language, however, was too general or broad, for it has been adjudged that the covenant to stand seized, when founded on consideration of <em>blood or marriage, </em>is still effectual to pass title to land under the operation of the Statute of Uses, and that such covenant avails under that statute to convey a freehold to commence in future.\u2014 <em>Chancellor </em>vs. <em>Windham &amp; Daw, </em>1 Eich., 161; <em>Kinsler et al. </em>vs. <em>Clark, </em>1 Eich., 170; <em>Dinkins </em>vs. <em>Samuels </em>10 Eich., 66.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-10\">But <em>Craig </em>vs. <em>Pinson </em>seems to have settled the point that a deed of bargain and sale to be valid and effectual must pursue the Act of 1795; and such deed operates in this State, not by virtue of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Statute of Uses, but as a direct conveyance passing the estate with transmutation of possession as effectually as a feoffment with livery of seizin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-5\">The -writing here in question, if valid at all, must be supported as a deed of bargain and sale. But it lacks the operative words of conveyance expressed in our statutory form, and contains none equivalent thereto; \u201cassign, transfer and set over\u201d are not equivalent to \u201cbargain and sell.\u201d <em>\u201cAlien or grant,\u201d \u201cdemise and grant,\u201d </em>have been held sufficient. \u2014 Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone, 219. Chancellor Kent (in 4 Com., 496,) says: \u201cNothing can be more liberal than the rules of law as to the words requisite to create a bargain and sale. There must be a valuable consideration, and then any words that will raise a use will amount to a bargain and sale.\u201d But our statutory form of a bargain and sale excludes the operation of the Statute of Uses, and the statute has converted the bargain and sale, as a conveyance to uses, into a conveyance working transmutation of possession <em>exvi faoti, </em>without help from the Statute of Uses. \u2014 4 Kent, 461. Therefore words that formerly might have been sufficient to raise an use or trust which the Statute of Uses would execute, do not, since the Act of 1795, necessarily constitute a bargain and sale effectual under that Act. The rule is fully recognized that when a deed cannot operate in the mode contemplated by the parties, it should be construed in such a manner as to operate, if possible, in some other way.\u2014 <em>Chancellor </em>vs. <em>Windham, </em>1 Rich., 167.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-6\">It is, however, submitted that this instrument, if not valid as a bargain and sale, can avail in no other way than as an agreement to convey, enforcible in equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-7\">It would hardly be contended that this instrument is a covenant to stand seized to uses, since it professes to be founded on a pecuniary consideration <em>alone. </em>\u2014 1 Rich., 161,170. Moreover, Sanders reserved no estate to himself, so the question of freehold to commence <em>in futuro </em>is not involved, and hence no necessity to construe as a covenant to stand seized. Submitted that where, as in this instance, the manifest intention is to pass a present estate, to hold that the instrument \u00cd3 effectual as a covenant to stand seized, and that the use raised is forthwith executed by the Statute of Uses, would be to set at naught our statute which prescribes the form of a deed, when the object is to convey a present and not merely a future intent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-8\">In the case of <em>Clark </em>vs. <em>O\u2019Margery, </em>(2 Brev. Rep., 134,) a similar assignment of a grant was held by this Court to be not sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>pass any estate therein, as upon no principle of legal construction could it be considered equivalent to any of the legal conveyances hitherto in use for effecting the transfer of real estate, as the endorsement in question does not even import a <em>bargain and sale of </em>the land, but imports only an assignment of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-5\">In 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 579, the distinction between <em>bargain and sale </em>and covenant to stand seized to uses is, that while the former requires a valuable consideration, the latter requires a consideration of <em>blood or marriage, </em>which latter consideration is not embraced in the language of the assignment in question, nor was it given in evidence at the trial. And as it is said in the same volume and page that \u201c the instrument, to operate, must partake of the qualities of the deed assumed, this assignment cannot operate as a <em>bargain and sale </em>for the numerous reasons above stated, or as a covenant to stand seized to uses, forwant of the required consideration of <em>blood or marriage.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-6\">In <em>Ingram </em>vs. <em>Porter, </em>(4 McC., 201,) Judge Coleock, in delivering the opinion of the Court, says: \u201cWhen it is said the deed must operate if it can, it is meant if it can consistently with the meaning of the parties, as regulated by the rules of law. It is not intended that the plain and obvious meaning of words are to be entirely changed, and that those words which are entirely applicable to one subject are to be applied to another, for this would in effect be making a deed and not construing one.\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b491-7\">February 2, 1876.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Ayry\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b491-8\">Moses, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP2\">The Act of 1795, (General Statutes, 423,) while it prescribes the form of a release which shall be effectual for the transfer of real estate, provides \u201cthat it shall beso construed as not to invalidate the forms heretofore in use in this State.\u201d Among those in use at its passage were not only lease and release, but bargain and sale, and a covenant to stand seized to uses. \u2014 Lessee of <em>Ruggs </em>vs. <em>Ellis, </em>1 Bay., 109; <em>Craig </em>vs. <em>Pinson, </em>1 Chev., 272; <em>Chancellor vs. Windham, </em>1 Rich., 161. The statutory form created by the Act may be said to embrace both a lease and release, and a bargain and sale, by the introduction of modes usually employed in both. The instrument by which the land conveyed by Counts to Burrill Sanders was transferred to Eliza G. Sanders, the appellant, while it cannot take effect as a conveyance at common law, nor as a covenant to stand seized, because it failed in the consideration of marriage or consanguinity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>may, nevertheless, be effectual as a bargain and sale, which, alike with the covenant to stand seized, owes its creation to the Statute of Uses, if the words employed are sufficient to sustain the instrument as a contract for the sale of the land, in consideration of money or its equivalent paid. The Statute of Uses, which, immediately on its enactment, converted what had been equitable into legal estates, gave rise to new modes by which the title to land could be as securely transferred as by any form of conveyance at common law then recognized and in use. Among these was a title derived through a bargain and sale; for the use being given by the deed, the statute conveys the legal estate, and thereby confirms in the purchaser the title as well as the use.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Can the deed to Eliza G. Sanders take effect as a bargain and sale ? It recites a money consideration paid, and an intention beyond dispute to vest in her the land covered by the conveyance to her grantor from Counts. While it may not employ technical words, its language is sufficient to express the purpose which the party paying the money and the party executing the deed had in view. It was evidently the design of Burrell Sanders that his grantee should \u201chave and hold\u201d the land in fee simple; for if any estate is conveyed it is one of inheritance. He makes no reservation, and clearly manifests his purpose to part with all \u201chis right, title and interest\u201d in the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">But to maintain an instrument as a valid bargain and sale, it is not necessary that technical words should be employed. Chancellor Kent, in the fourth volume of his Commentaries, 496, says: \u201c Nothing can be more liberal than the rules of law as to the words requisite to create a bargain and sale. There must be a valuable consideration, and then any words that will raise a use will amount to a bargain and sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Mr. Washburne, in his work on Real Property, (3 voh, 620,) quoting from 2 Wood Com., says: \u201cThe elementary writers insist upon the importance of the words of grant being suitable to the nature of the deed, and it is accordingly stated that for a feoffment the proper words are \u2018 give,\u2019 \u2018 grant,\u2019 \u2018 en feoff,\u2019 &amp;c., and for bargain and sale, \u2018grant,\u2019 \u2018 bargain\u2019 and \u2018sell,\u2019 &amp;c. But the words \u2018bargain and sell\u2019 are not essential to such a conveyance, and any words of equivalent signification, which would at common law raise a use, will be sufficient, if they show the intent of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>In <em>Roe </em>vs. <em>Tranmarr, </em>(Willes, 682,) the judgment of the Court, resting, as it says, on.the general rules of law in respect to the exposition of deeds laid down in many of the books, and which are collected out of them by Shephard on Common Assurances, gives effect to the maxim that <em>verba intentioni et non e contra debent inservire, </em>and that, \u201c therefore, deeds which are intended and made to operate one way, may operate another way, if the intention of the parties cannot take place, unless they operate a different way from what they were intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Parke, B., in <em>ex dem Lewis </em>vs. <em>Davies, </em>2 M. &amp; W., 516, referring to <em>Roe </em>vs. <em>Tranmarr, </em>cites, with approbation what is there said by the Lord Chief Justice, quoting from the opinion in <em>Osman </em>vs. <em>Sheafe, </em>3 Lev., 370, \u201c that the Judges in these latter times (and he thinks very rightly) have gone further than formerly, and have had more consideration for the substance, to wit, the passing of the estate according to the intent of the parties, than the shadow, to wit, the manner of passing it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In <em>Jackson </em>and others vs. <em>Fish </em>and others, 10 John., 457, it was said by the Court, of which Mr. Kent was then the Chief Justice: \u201c There are no precise technical words required to raise a use. If the words amount to a present contract of sale or bargain, a trust is instantly raised on which the statute operates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">We think that the words in the deed before us amount to such a contract, and the motion to set aside the nonsuit is granted, and the case is remanded to the Circuit Court for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b493-8\"><em>Wright, </em>A.
