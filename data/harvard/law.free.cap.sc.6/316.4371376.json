A bill is now before this Court for the settlement of the estate of Julius A. Dargan, deceased. An order, in the progress of the cause, has been heretofore granted, requiring creditors to come in and establish their claims against his estate. W. E. Charles, Clerk of the Court, has submitted his report, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>taining the names of such creditors as have, in obedience to the order, proved their claims, and a classification of the same in regard to their rank. Exceptions have been filed to the report, suggesting error as to the classification of four of the claims. The first, designated as No. \u20203 in his report under the class of mortgage and judgment, was a bond executed by the intestate, J. A. Dargan, to T. C. Evans, the then Commissioner in Equity, given for the purchase money of a tract of land sold by the Commissioner belonging to the estate of T. J. K. Dargan, and on the same day, to wit, first of February, 1858, executed ,a mortgage of the said land to the Commissioner to secure the payment of the purchase money. After the death of the obligor and mortgagor; this tract of land was sold as a part of his estate, and purchased by one J. J. McCown, who gave a mortgage to secure the payment of his purchase and made payments on same to the amount of $1,500. Afterwards the mortgage given by J. A. Dargan was, under proceedings in which the Commissioner in Equity and J. J. McCown were parties, foreclosed, and the land sold. B. W. Edwards was the purchaser at this sale and is now the owner of the land.. He has also become the owner of the bond and mortgage against J. A. Dargan. This claim of B. W. Edwards has been classified by the Clerk as a mortgage debt, after allowing on it a credit of the amount of the bid of the purchaser. The second and third, designated as Nos. \u20204 and \u20205, in the same class, are bonds executed by J. A. Dargan to T. C. Evans, the then Commissioner in Equity, on the 1st day of February, 1858, for the purchase money of slaves purchased by him at a Commissioner\u2019s sale, and payable in one, two and three years from date, the payment of which bonds were secured by the execution' of mortgages of the said slaves by J. A. Dargan on the same day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\">The fourth, designated as No. \u20206 in the same class, are bonds executed by S. PI. Wilds to T. C. Evans, the then Commissioner in Equity, for certain slaves purchased by him at a Commissioner\u2019s sale, with one James Bell and J. A. Dargan, the intestate, as his sureties, which bonds were dated on the 14th day of January, 1857, and payable in one, two, three and four years; and further to secure the said bond, the said S. H. Wilds executed mortgages of the said slaves. E. B. Brunson, the former Referee appointed to take proof of claims, made no report to the Court. Before him the claims above enumerated and described were established as specialty debts and not as mortgages. W. E. Charles, in his report, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>alludes to this action before the former Referee and \u2022 allows the same claims to be established before him as mortgage debts. The exceptions allege that there was error in this classification, and that the claims should have been allowed and classified as specialty debts and not as mortgage debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\">The exceptions will be considered <em>seriatim,. </em>The first exception is: \u201cBecause the Referee has erred in classing as mortgage debts the claims of Thomas C. Evans, (numbered 4 and 5 in the schedule,) amounting to $2,133.71 and $929.41, the same being bonds secured by mortgages of slaves, which had matured while the said slaves were property; and the property mortgaged having been exhausted, the debts secured thereby no longer exist as mortgage debts but must stand as specialty debts merely.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">The 26th clause of the statute of 1789, (5 Stat., Ill,) furnishes a rule or guide for the appropriation to the payment of debts of the assets of an intestate or testator. Certain claims are therein specified,, and when the nature of the obligation or debt is ascertained it must be arbitrarily placed within its appropriate class. In the administration of the assets of an intestate or testator\u2019s estate, this Court is governed by the requirements of the statute, for in administering legal assets the Court distributes them according to the strict rule of law. In the administration of assets that are purely equitable, it is governed by a rule peculiar to itself, founded upon the principle that equality is <em>equity. </em>\u2014 Tennant vs. <em>Stoney, </em>1 Rich. Eq., 235. This Court, in the distribution of funds, recognizes liens, and enforces, in the same manner that a law Court would, if it had jurisdiction, all antecedent liens on, property. \u2014 Story Eq., 519; <em>Tennant </em>vs. <em>Stoney, </em>1 Rich. Eq., 235.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-7\">In the administration of the assets of an insolvent testator or intestate, mortgages, as mortgages, are not entitled to priority over rents, specialties and simple contract debts, except so far as they are liens on any particular part of the estate. After the lien is exhausted, the grade of the demand must be determined by the nature of the instrument which the mortgage was given to secure.\u2014 <em>Kinard </em>vs. <em>Young, </em>2 Rich. Eq., 247.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-8\">To determine the question as to whether these debts of Evans are mortgage debts or mere specialty debts, the inquiry is pertinent whether the liens of the mortgages given to secure the debts have been exhausted. It is contended that they have not by seizure of the mortgaged property and its appropriation or sale by the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>gagee, but because the slaves so mortgaged have been emancipated and the liens are thus extinguished. What is .the legal effect of a mortgage of personal property as to the title ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-5\">\u201c The legal title to personal property conveyed by mortgage vests in the mortgagee, but the breach of the condition does not confer so absolute aright as to give a perfect and independent claim to the chattel as one holds property subject to his own control arid dominion. Even if he has possession of the chattel, his title is diverted on the payment of the debt and transferred to the mortgagor. His possession, if he had it, is a qualified one, and, though he may be clothed with a mere legal title, he is a trustee for the mortgagor, who still continues to hold the equity of redemption, and who has-the real and beneficial <em>interest.\u201d </em>\u2014 Calhoun vs. <em>Calhoun, </em>2 S. C., 307. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\">The Act of 1712 vests the mortgagee with the complete title and ownership, if he takes possession after breach of condition and retains possession for ten years. In <em>BlaeJc </em>vs. <em>Hair, </em>2 Hill Ch., 624, it is held: \u201cThat a creditor holding a mortgage security is a trustee, to sell not only for the benefit of the mortgagor but for his own use.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-7\">The interest in or title to the slaves in this case was a qualified one, and the mortgagee was not the owner. His mortgage was a mere pledge or security for his debts, taken with a view to recover his money and not to obtain the possession of the property itself. The mortgage debt was due on the 1st day of February, 1861. On that day there was a breach of the condition of the mortgage. The mortgagee was authorized, at that time, to seize the slaves and convert them into money, to be applied to the satisfaction of his debt, or to seize them and retain the possession of the property and appropriate it, <em>in specie, </em>to his own use. This would have operated as a satisfaction of his secured demand. In either event, after the seizure and sale or appropriation of the property, the mortgagee would have been accountable for the surplus over and above the amount of his debt. The mortgagee did not satisfy his mortgage debt by a seizure of the property, but, after condition broken, left the slaves in the possession of the mortgagor until their emancipation. When were they emancipated? In the case-of <em>Pickett </em>vs. <em>Wilkins, </em>13 Rich. Eq., 366, it was held: \u201c That slaves in this State did not become either <em>de jure </em>or <em>defacto </em>free until 1865, when they were emancipated by the United States authorities.\u201d The slaves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>continued, then, in the possession of the mortgagor more than four years after their emancipation. But this possession by the mortgagor, after condition broken, neither conferred on him an absolute beneficiary interest nor in the mortgagee an unqualified legal title. Ten years, under the statute, are necessary to confer such a title upon the latter after possession is acquired by him. In this case he never obtained possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">But in 1865 the slaves were emancipated. This was a destruction of the property so mortgaged. A mortgage is not a general but a special lien. It is a charge upon specific prop\u00e9rty therein mentioned and described. When the specific property so mortgaged or charged is seized and sold in payment of the debt, this is an extinguishment of the lien. So when the specific property is destroyed, the lien is lost, as when the slave so mortgaged dies or the property so charged is destroyed. The lien of a mortgage in such a case, would be exhausted. In this case the property in the slaves so mortgaged was destroyed by the United States authorities, and, being so destroyed, where is the distinction between this case and one in which the property dies or perishes in some other way ? If the lien of the mortgage is lost by the destruction of the property in the one case, why would it not be in the other ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-6\">But it may be said the mortgagor had the benefit of the slaves, and was in the possession of them at the time of emancipation, and contributed by his own act to the loss of the slaves. The act of the government is not to be regarded as the act of any citizen. This doctrine has not been recognized in this country.\u2014 <em>Calhoun </em>vs. <em>Calhoun, </em>2 S. C., 305. \u201cThe emancipation of slaves by governmental authority was a possible contingency, which must be assumed, from the peculiar character of -the property, to have been understood by the parties treating for their sale and purchase. To whatever immediate cause emancipation is to be referred, it is not to be denied that it was effected by a power to which the citizen was bound to yield obedience and which he could not <em>resist.\u201d </em>\u2014 Calhoun vs. <em>Calhoun, </em>2 S. C., 304. Neither the mortgagor nor the mortgagee can be said to have contributed to emancipation, and neither party should be held responsible for the governmental act which they were not able to resist and to which they were bound to yield obedience. But the mortgagee will be responsible for his laches in not taking possession of the slaves after condition broken, while they were property, or for not enforcing the mortgage by a foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>and sale. He was a public functionary, whose duty it was to enforce it immediately after condition broken. The mortgagor was in possession, and it was neither his duty nor to his interest to have it enforced. The mortgage cannot now be enforced by reason of the emancipation of the slaves, and the mortgagee, therefore, loses his lien. The mortgagor\u2019s estate should not be held responsible for the laches of the mortgagee, or for the destruction of the property, and to allow these as mortgage debts would practically impose this hardship upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\">There are. other creditors of the estate; and to allow this claim to rank as a mortgage debt, under all the circumstances, would be, to say the least of it, inequitable so far as they are concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-6\">In my judgment, the lien of the mortgages in question has been extinguished by the emancipation of the slaves, but the creditor is entitled to prove his claim as a specialty debt. The bond which the mortgage was given to secure has not been paid, and the claim will, therefore, rank as a bond debt against the intestate\u2019s estate.\u2014 <em>Kinard </em>vs. <em>Young, </em>2 Rich. Eq., 247; <em>Tennant </em>vs. <em>Sfoney, </em>1 Rich. Eq., 263.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-7\">The first exception is, therefore, sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-8\">The third exception is \u201c because the claim proved as a mortgage debt by Thomas C. Evans, as Commissioner in Equity, stated as No. \u20203 in the schedule, is improperly classed as a mortgage debt, the same having been extinguished by operation of law, by reason of the purchase of the mortgaged land by the assignee and holder of the said mortgage, under proceedings to foreclose the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-9\">J. A. Dargan, the intestate, purchased a tract of land, and executed a bond and mortgage to T. C. Evans, Commissioner in Equity, to secure the payment of the purchase money. Under the bill filed for the settlement of the intestate Dargan\u2019s estate, an order of sale was granted. J. J. McCown was the purchaser at the sale, and executed a mortgage of the land to secure the payment of the purchase money. What did McCown purchase at the Commissioner\u2019s or Clerk\u2019s sale? Nothing but the right, title and interest, whatever that was, of J. A. Dargan. What was this ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-10\">\u201cThe equity doctrine is that the mortgage is a mere security for the debt and only a chattel interest, and that until a decree for foreclosure the mortgagor continues the real owner of the fee.\u201d\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>4 Kent\u2019s Com., 159. In equity the mortgagee is considered as having a transfer of the property itself as a security for the debt, and, according to the intention of the parties, a qualified estate and security.\u2014 <em>Williams </em>vs. <em>Beard, </em>1 S. C., 323.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-5\">\u201cIn the Court of Equity the equity of redemption is considered to be the real and beneficial estate, tantamount to the fee at law.\u201d\u2014 <em>Williams </em>vs. <em>Beard, </em>1 S. C., 824.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\">J. J. McCown, then, purchased the equity of redemption of J. A. Dargan, which is said to be tantamount to the fee at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-7\">After the purchase by McCown, and the payment of a part of the purchase money, the mortgage given by J. A. Dargan to the Commissioner in Equity was foreclosed by proceedings in which the Commissioner and McCown were the only parties. B. W. Edwards purchased the land at the sale and is now the owner. At the time of the purchase, he was not the assignee of the bond and mortgage of J. A. Dargan, but has since become the owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-8\">What was the effect of the sale of the land under the order of foreclosure ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-9\">In this case the mortgagor, Dargan, was out of possession, but McCown claimed through him and stood in his place. The Act of 1791 changes the relation which exists between the mortgagee and mortgagor, as to the legal estate, when the latter is out of possession. When, by reason of the mortgagor being out of possession, the legal estate is vested in- the mortgagee, he can occupy no other or higher position than the mortgagee at common law. All the rights and equities which attach to the one the other is entitled to, and no more; and, unless there is some covenant restraining him, he may enforce his legal rights by a possessory action or claim the reception of the rents and profits.\u2014 <em>Williams </em>vs. <em>Beard.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-10\">The Act of 1791 applies exclusively to the proceedings in the Courts of law.\u2014 <em>Oruger </em>vs. <em>Daniel, </em>Riley Ch., 151.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-11\">When a mortgagee comes into a Court of Equity for a foreclosure, he does not proceed under his legal title for a recovery of the land, but to enforce the security for his debt; and the relief which he thus seeks he can obtain only by an order for the sale of the property, that the equity of redemption may be barred, and all the rights which attach to both parties will vest in the purchaser under such sale. It is the equity of redemption, which is tantamount to the fee at law, that equity acts upon in a bill for foreclosure.\u2014 <em>Williams vs. Beard, </em>1 S. C., 324.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Under the sale made to B. W. Edwards, the purchaser, all the rights which attached to the mortgagor and mortgagee vested in him. Were all the parties necessary or required before the Court in the proceedings to foreclose the mortgage? In the case of <em>Gruffer </em>vs. <em>Daniel, </em>Riley\u2019s Eq., 151, it is held: \u201cA decree for foreclosure does not mean that the title to the land shall be immediately vested in the mortgagee and make the mortgagor a stranger to the land. It is for a sale. The common course is that the payment of the money due should be decreed. Then asale.is directed, and if the land should sell for less than the debt, the mortgagee may have an execution for the residue. If it sell for more, the mortgagor is entitled to the surplus. The mortgagee, if out of possession, has a right to come for a sale of the land, that he may have his debt. So the mortgagor, if out of possession, has a right to enforce a sale, that he may have the surplus, if any. When the mortgagee is out of possession, he has a clear right to come for a sale to satisfy his debt; but he must make the proper parties ; then who would be entitled to the surplus or who have the fee of the land?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">Was the estate of Dargan entitled to the surplus, if any, in this sale? or was the fee in this mortgaged land in his heirs at law at the time of the sale to Edwards? The Court of Equity ordered the equity of redemption of J. A. Dargan, then vested in his heirs, to be sold. McCown purchased it, and it was conveyed to him by the officer of the Court. The effect of this conveyance was to vest in him the real and beneficial estate, the equity of redemption of Dargan, which is tantamount to the fee at law. So that, by operation of the order of the Court, he was the purchaser of the fee in the sense in which the term is used in the ease last cited. Who was entitled to the surplus, if any, over and above the mortgaged debt? If McCown acquired the right, title and interest, the equity of redemption of Dargan, he was certainly entitled to the surplus. If he was, then, entitled to the surplus, if any, and the equity of redemption, which is tantamount to the fee, was in him, was he not the proper and only party to be made in the proceedings for foreclosure? It seems so to me.\u2014 <em>Wighlman </em>vs. <em>Gray, </em>10 Rich. Eq., 586.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">In w.hat character did Evans come into the Court, except as mortgagee, asking that McCown, who was claiming through Dargan, should be barred of all equity of redemption by a sale, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>that the proceeds should be applied to the debt as a security for which the mortgage was taken and held ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\">The purchaser, Edwards, then, at the sale and by his deed, is vested with the equity of redemption of Dargan originally and McCown afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">But Edwards is also the assignee or owner of the bond and mortgage given by J. A. Dargan to T. C. Evans. By virtue of this purchase and transfer, he has acquired all of the rights and title of Evans as mortgagee in the land sold. He stands as the mortgagee by assignment and the purchaser of the equity of redemption. By operation of law the mortgage debt is extinguished. \u2014 2 Story Eq. Juris., \u00a7 1035, b. \u201cA purchase of the equity of redemption by the mortgagee extinguishes the mortgage debt; and the effect is the same whether the purchase is by a direct conveyance from the mortgagor or at a sale of the land under a junior <em>judgment.\u201d </em>\u2014 Sehnell vs. <em>Schroder, </em>Bail. Eq., 328. The effect of a sale under foreclosure proceedings .in a Court of Equity is to bar the equity of redemption and vest all the rights which attach to mortgagor and mortgagee in the purchaser. The special lien is then extinguished, and the mortgagee must recover the balance, if any is due, out of the mortgagor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-7\">The mortgage debt of the assignee, Edwards, has been extinguished, and nothing remains but the balance due on his security.

It is not merely a right to have a certain portion of his debt paid. But this right of the creditor to a certain portion of the assets becomes divested so soon as his debt is paid or is otherwise extinguished. So here we say that the holder of the mortgage had at the death of the intestate a right to have the assets applied to it as a mortgage, but so soon as the mortgage was extinguished such right was divested.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b339-6\">Oct. 14, 1875.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AnI\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b339-7\">Moses, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvH\">We shall first dispose of the questions which are raised in regard to the mortgages of personal property. It is urged that they are not within the meaning and intent of Section 26 of the Act of 1789, (5 Stat., 116,) which prescribes the order in which \u201cthe debts due by any testator or intestate shall be paid by executors or administrators,\u201d because the term mortgage, in our statutes, always applies to conveyances of land by way of security, and never to an instrument conveying chattels for a like purpose. If the proposition is not sustained by the fact, on which alone it rests for support, it is not necessary to do more than to show that at the passage of the Act it was applied as well to mortgages of personal as of real estate. As long ago as 1698, mortgages of negroes and other chattels were recognized, and a rule prescribed as to their priority, where more than one of the same property was given. \u2014 2 Stat., 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Again, in 1745, (3 Stat., 664; 1759, 4 <em>ib., </em>89, and 1785, 7 <em>ib., </em>234,) provisions are made for their security as existing valid liens, operating to as full an extent, on the property which they cover, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>those of real estate. Indeed, on the very day of the ratification of the Act which prescribed the order in which payment of the debts of a decedent was to be made, the Legislature, in an Act providing for the transmission of an abstract of all judgments to the Clerk of the Court at Charleston, declared \u201cthat no judgment not so entered in the books of the said Clerk shall affect any property, real or personal, as to purchasers or mortgagees.\u201d \u2014 Stat., 256. It would thus seem that the term was applied without distinction as to the character of the security. Indeed, the-expression \u201cchattel mortgage\u201d has never been used in this State, and is not to be found in any of its statutes. Even in the General Statutes, although the heading under Chapter- 120 is of \u201cchattel mortgages and liens,\u201d the very first provision refers to the recording of \u201ca mortgage or other instrument in the nature of a mortgage of personal property.\u201d Even in England it is also applied to the pledge which is made of personal property for the security of a debt by loan or otherwise. Mr. Coote, in his work on mortgages, devotes a chapter to \u201c mortgages of chattels personal,\u201d and the right of such a mortgagee to foreclose is recognized in <em>Kemp </em>vs. <em>Westbrook, </em>Betts\u2019 Suppt. to Vesey, 141; in <em>Dyson </em>vs. <em>Moris, </em>1 Hare, 422; <em>Slade </em>vs. <em>Riggs, </em>3 Hare, 35. Regarding them as mortgages within the designation of the Act of 1789, we fail to discover any rule or principle by which they are to be excluded from the rank to which, by its express terms, they are entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">It is not without some diffidence that we enter on the consideration of this point in the case, as the judgment of the Court below in relation to it was in conformity to the decision in <em>Young </em>vs. Ki<em>nard, </em>2 Rich. Eq., 258. The deference which we have been accustomed to accord to the decided cases in our own Courts, we must admit, has here lost-some of its force, not only by reason of the full and convincing argument of Chancellor Johnston in the Circuit decree, but by the language of the Appeal Court in reversing it. That Court thus expressed itself: \u201cIt feels much difficulty in giving construction to the Act of 1789, recited in the decree, and is not prepared to say that, if the question were entirely open to them, the construction adopted by the Chancellor is not a fair deduction from its phraseology. But it is deemed expedient to defer to the case of <em>Tunno </em>vs. <em>Happoldt, </em>cited in the decree, as an exposition of the Court of law, leaving to that Court, or to a future occasion, the consideration of the suggestion made in this case.\u201d Notwithstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ing this, it is with deference we venture to say that the question raised and decided in <em>Tunno </em>vs. <em>Happoldt, </em>(2 McC., 188,) was not identical with that made in the case in which it was accepted and followed as a guide for its ruling. The point which the Court there seems to have considered was whether the mortgage deed could change the character of the note which it was given to secure, and elevate it from the class of simple contracts, to which it belonged, to the higher grade of a specialty. Concede, as we must, that it could not, still that did not decide the point made by the appeal. The note could have no preference over other simple contracts, and the rank which should be accorded to the mortgage, in the order of priority in the payment of the debts by the administrator, remained undetermined. The Act of 1789 does not interfere with liens as they existed at the death of the debtor. Whatever rights they confer are still secured to the holder, and the property, if if exists, remains subject to their satisfaction. The order of payment which it declares has no application to <em>liens </em>which could be enforced against the property on which they attached. As to those, the concluding words of the Section clearly show that they are to prevail as they existed at the death of the debtor. The order of priority was only to be observed in the application of such general assets in the hands of the executor or administrator as were not bound by any specific <em>lien. </em>\u2014 Rutledge vs. <em>Rutledge, </em>1 McC. Ch., 471; <em>Keckley </em>vs. <em>Keckley, </em>2 Hill Ch., 257; <em>Haynsworth </em>vs. <em>Frierson, </em>11 Rich., 476. It is then not the lien which the Act deals with but the character of the debt, and it is that which is to determine its rank in the order of payment. It prescribes the order in which \u201c the <em>debts </em>due by any testator or intestate shall be paid by executors or administrators.\u201d It embraces \u201cmortgages\u201d in the classification; they are to take precedence of \u201c bonds or other obligations.\u201d In the Circuit opinion in <em>Young </em>vs. <em>Kinard, </em>Chancellor Johnston said : <em>\u201c </em>If it <em>be </em>a mortgage, it suits the description of the Act, and is entitled to what the Act gives it, and that is a rank above not only simple contracts but bonds and all other specialties.\u201d \u201cThe assets of a deceased debtor are distributable among his creditors with reference to the rank of their demands at the time of his <em>death.\u201d </em>\u2014 Tucker vs. <em>Andy, </em>(7 Rich. Eq., 281,) affirming what is said in <em>Morton &amp; Courtenay </em>vs. <em>Caldwell, </em>3 Strob. Eq., 164, and <em>Ex parte Ware, </em>5 Rich., 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The instruments in question here were executed by the intestate in his lifetime, and were valid and effective at his death. By the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Act they are entitled to share in the distribution of the assets in the hands of his administrator or the Court according to the rank which, by its provision, is accorded to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">With the doubts expressed by the Court as to its judgment in <em>Young </em>vs. <em>Kinard, </em>we do not feel ourselves constrained to follow it as authority by which we must be controlled. It is with respect that we differ, and can well interpose for our justification, if necessary, its own misgivings as to its construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The remaining question to be considered is whether the mortgage debt of Dargan to the Commissioner, assigned to Edwards, has not been satisfied by his purchase of the land under the proceeding for the foreclosure of the mortgage, and cannot, therefore, as the respondents contend, take rank as such under the said Act of 1789. It is true that McCown, under the sale of Dargan\u2019s interest in the land, which was still subject to the mortgage of the Commissioner, acquired by his purchase only the right and title which Dargau held therein, and this was nothing more than the right to redeem. He thus held what in the Court of Equity is considered to be the real and beneficial interest, tantamount to the fee at law.\u2014 <em>Williams </em>vs. <em>Beard, </em>1 S. C., 324. Where the mortgagee acquires this right through a Sheriff\u2019s sale, by a purchase under a judgment junior to the mortgage, the debt which it was to secure is extinguished; \u2014 the like result follows where the mortgagor releases to the mortgagee the equity of <em>redemption. </em>\u2014 Mounce vs. <em>McLure, </em>2 McC., 423; <em>Schnell </em>vs. <em>Schroder, </em>2 Bail. Eq., 334; <em>McLure, Brawley &amp; Co. </em>vs. <em>Wheeler, </em>6 Rich. Eq., 345; <em>Allen </em>vs. <em>Richardson, </em>9 Rich. Eq., 56. The same doctrine was announced in <em>James </em>vs. <em>Johnson &amp; </em>Morey.\u2014 6 John. Ch., 416. All the right reserved by the mortgagor is transferred to the mortgagee, who then holds in the premises the interest both of the creditor and debtor, and there is nothing left on which the lien of the mortgage can operate. Where the sale is under a junior judgment, a third party purchasing must not only pay the bid which he has made for the only interest which the Sheriff can sell, but, to enjoy an unencumbered estate in the land, he must satisfy the mortgage, which still retains its lien. If the mortgagee purchases, to whom is such payment to be made? Not only is the lien destroyed, but the debt also. In <em>McLure, Brawley &amp; Co. </em>vs. <em>Wheeler, </em>Chancellor Dunkin said: \u201cAs has been intimated, it makes no difference whether the mortgagee is the purchaser at Sheriff\u2019s sale or a stranger. Purchasing the equity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>redemption, a stranger would take the land subject to the obligation to discharge the encumbrance.\u201d If the mortgagee buys, the encumbrance is necessarily discharged by the operation of his own act.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The Circuit decree, applying these principles, while it holds not only that the lien of the mortgage but the mortgage debt also is destroyed by the purchase of Edwards at the sale for foreclosure, still gives effect to the bond, for the security of which the mortgage was executed. Following the authorities on which it relied for its conclusions, it would seem that the extinguishment of the bond also would have been an unavoidable consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The question here is not, however, to be decided by the principles which prevail where the equity of redemption is lost to the mortgagor by its transfer to the mortgagee. Edwards, the assignee of the mortgage, holds through his purchase at a judicial sale for foreclosure, and all his rights and interests under his purchases depend upon the effect of such a proceeding. A foreclosure of a mortgage by judicial process in South Carolina differs in its results from that which prevails in England.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">There, on default of payment of the debt at the time fixed by the Court, an absolute foreclosure is decreed. Action on the bond may be brought at law at the same time the bill for foreclosure is filed in equity, or it may follow. In this State, the proceeding is for the enforcement of the security for the debt. So far from the purchase or transfer through the sale of the equity of redemption, its effect is to bar and defeat it.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The interest of both mortgagor and mortgagee is sold. The title, freed and discharged of the encumbrance imposed by the equity of redemption, vests in the purchaser, the usual order, which was made, directing a sale, acting on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">It was competent for the plaintiff (and such is now the prevailing practice) to take a money decree, by force of which an execution could issue against the property of the mortgagor for any unpaid balance after the application of the proceeds of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">If, under the prayer of the bill, a money decree cannot be given, the creditor, after a sale, may proceed at law upon the bond for any balance remaining due.\u2014 <em>Gray, Commissioner, </em>vs. <em>Toomer, executrix, </em>5 Rich., 261; or, where the bill is not only for foreclosure but also for the payment of the debt, or includes a prayer for general relief, the plaintiff, after foreclosure, may apply to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Court where the bill is filed for further decree for the money still due on the debt. The sale under an-order for mere foreclosure does not extinguish the debt and leave the mortgagor without remedy for the unpaid balance, and such appears to be the view of Chancellor Wardlaw, from his language in pronouncing the opinion of the Court in <em>Allen </em>vs. <em>Richardson, </em>9 Rich. Eq., 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">We have already expressed our views in regard to the rank to which a debt secured by a mortgage of personal property is entitled under the Act of 1789 in the appropriation of the assets of a deceased dpbtor. In our conception, there is no difference where the mortgage is of real estate. In South Carolina, the whole estate is chargeable with the payment of debts. \u201c By law, the lands of o.ne deceased are assets to -pay debts.\u201d They are expressly made so by 5 George, II, C. 7, and in this respect put on the same footing with real property. The Act of 1789 uses the comprehensive term \u201c mortgages,\u201d assigns them to one rank, and in its application we do not see how any distinction can be made, whether they are of land or personal chattels.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The motion is granted, the judgment of the Circuit Court reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings in conformity to the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b344-7\"><em>Wright, </em>A.
