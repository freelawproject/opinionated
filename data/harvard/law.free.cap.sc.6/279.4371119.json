W. Thompson, for the purpose of calling on the creditors and marshaling assets for the sale of the real estate of the said testator to and in paying his debts, and for dower in said real estate. The dower was laid off, the real estate sold, and the assets marshaled by the report of Silas Johnstone, as Special Referee, to which exceptions were filed. While said case was pending on the report and exceptions, and before they were heard, Silas Johnstone filed his petition <em>in re </em>this case, praying that the costs and fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>allowed him in said report, as late Commissioner in Equity, and as Referee, should be paid to him, which was ordered to be done by His Honor M. Moses, at Chambers, on the 9th day of December, 1873. At June Term, 1874, the case came up regularly for hearing on the report and exceptions, except those disposed of by the aforesaid order at Chambers, and His Honor confirmed the said report. <em>From these two </em>orders the creditors have appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-4\">\u201cA house and lot was assigned to the plaintiff for life, as her dower in the real estate of her said husband, and at her death was sold by order of the Court, and D. Mower bought and paid for it. The two defendants, Thos. A. and John M. Thompson, filed proceedings against Cynthia Mower and G. S. Mower, the heirs at law of D. Mower, claiming homestead in said house and lot. They notified Mr. Fair, the attorney of the plaintiffs, of this suit, and required him to defend the same, and he agreed to do so, and requested Jones &amp; Jones to aid in said defense, and consented that their fee and costs should be paid out of the estate of T. W. Thompson. The attorneys for the creditors, in writing, admitted the above statement, and consented that said costs and fee should be paid out of the estate.

The rejection of the claim for costs and fees incurred by the purchaser in resisting homestead exemption in the lands sold as the estate of the testator is correct. The land was sold under these proceedings by the Sheriff, and the application for the homestead was made in the Probate Court, during the pendency of this action. Passing by all questions of warranty, express or implied, of title acquired at Sheriff\u2019s sale, and all question of jurisdiction of an inferior Court over matters undergoing full and thorough investigation in a higher tribunal, the resistance was successful, (the application being abandoned,) and the warranty was made good, whether there was any liability, therefore, on the part of the tesator\u2019s estate or not. It is expressly declared in the case of <em>Jeter </em>vs. <em>Glenn, </em>9 Rich., 374, that <em>counsel fees </em>paid by the purchaser <em>cannot </em>be recovered against the vendor in actions of this kind.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b295-7\">Willard, A. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcqR\">The questions submitted relate to costs in a suit commenced prior to the Code of Procedure, by bill in equity by an executrix to call in creditors, marshal assets, &amp;c, and transferred to the Court of. Common Pleas upon the abolition of the Courts of Equity.' The questions will be considered as they are raised by the appellant\u2019s propositions of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">It is not necessary to consider the first proposition submitted, namely, that since the adoption of the Code costs cannot be taxed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>on account of proceedings previously had under the former laws then prevailing as to costs; for it was conceded by all the counsel, upon the argument, that the costs in the Court of Equity were taxed in that Court while the former laws on that subject were in force, and that no appeal was taken from such taxation, and that such taxation embraced all the items objected to by the appellants which relate to and grow out of the proceedings prior to the transfer of the cause to the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The item of $256 allowed to the late Commissioner, mentioned in the second proposition, and, the item of $355 to the attorney for the plaintiff, mentioned in the fourth proposition, belong to the class just mentioned. Having been taxed in the Court of Equity and no appeal having been taken, the right of the parties in whose behalf they were so taxed became absolute and are unaffected by any subsequent change in (he laws relating to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The third proposition relates to an item allowed in the Court of Common Pleas in the following terms: \u201cFee to Referee Johnstone, $300.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Section 337 of the Code authorizes the fees of officers to be included among the disbursements to be allowed in addition to costs. Section 339 declares that \u201cthe fees of Referees shall be three dollars to each for every day spent in the business of the reference; but the parties may agree in writing upon any other rate of compensation.\u201d It does not appear that any such agreement of the parties was produced. Unless such an agreement appears in writing, the fees of the Referee should be computed at the rate prescribed by Section 339. The allowance of a gross sum, as the present allowance appears to have been, was not in conformity with Section 339 and should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The facts to which the fifth proposition submitted by the appellants relate appear to be as follows: A house and lot, part of the testator\u2019s estate, having been sold under proceedings in this cause, a claim of homestead adverse to the purchaser was set up by third parties. At the request of the attorneys for creditors who had appeared, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney defended this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">The attorneys for the creditors have agreed in writing that the costs of this defense, amounting, according to the report of the Referee, to $172.90, should be paid out of the fund. To this the parties interested in the testator\u2019s estate object. No other proof is offered for charging this as a debt of the estate than the consent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the attorneys for the creditors. The Referee disallowed the item and the Court sustained his conclusion. The charge is not either one of costs or of disbursments, for the services alleged were not rendered in this cause. The creditors having consented to this form of compensation to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, doubtless to relieve the fund from a possible claim by the purchaser for indemnity, there is no reason why their shares of the fund should not be charged in accordance with their consent. As they have no power to affect the rights of other parties who did not unite in such consent, the item in question can only be charged against the creditors. As the creditors are appellants, and as, if they desire so to do, they can modify the order so as to bind their shares in accordance with their consent, it is not necessary that the order should be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The sixth proposition of the appellants is not explained by any statement appearing on the Referee\u2019s report or in any part of the proceedings, except in the statement made in the sixth exception to the Referee\u2019s report of July 25th, 1873. \u2019 The language of an exception is not the source from which can be properly derived the facts and circumstances by which the Referee\u2019s report can be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">If the parties prejudiced by a report wish to object to it, they must procure a statement of all that is necessary for the information of the Court, to be made out in the manner pointed out by the Code. The language of an exception is not a substitute for such a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The orders appealed from should be modified in the manner hereinbefore pointed out and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b297-8\"><em>Moses, </em>C. J., and <em>Wright, </em>A. J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
