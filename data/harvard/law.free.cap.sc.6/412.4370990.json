An interlocutory injunction was granted in this action on the 3d day of July, 1873, restraining the defendants from issuing the bonds proposed to be issued by them, as the County Commissioners of York County, in payment of a subscription of one hundred thousand dollars to the capital stock of the Chester and Lenoir Narrow Gauge Railroad Company, which said subscription was made by the defendants for and on behalf of the County of York. The defendants having been required to show cause why the said injunction should not be continued in full force, the case came up on the 16th day of the said month for a final hearing upon the merits, under the general issues involved in the pleadings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">It appears that the respondents, as County Commissioners of York County, have subscribed, as alleged by the plaintiffs, and now propose to issue, bonds in the name of the County of York, in payment of said subscription, such bonds to be redeemable in twenty years from the date of issue and to bear interest at the rate of seven per cent, per annum; and for the payment of the annual interest on such bonds, the said defendants, as County Commissioners, propose to levy an annual tax on the real and personal property subject to taxation in the County of York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The plaintiffs, who are taxpayers of York County, deny the right of the defendants, the County Commissioners, to subscribe and issue the said bonds, and allege that the issuing of the said bonds by the defendants is not authorized by law and will subject the plaintiffs to an additional annual tax upon their real and personal property in the County of York, which tax, the plaintiffs allege, will be wrongful and illegal, and will inflict upon them, as taxpayers of York County, a loss and damage to the'extent and amount of such proposed tax.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">The defendants reply that they are authorized by law to subscribe and issue the said bonds, and that they derive such authority directly from Section 11 of an Act of the General Assembly of South Carolina, approved February 26, 1873, entitled \u201cAn Act to incorporate the Chester and Lenoir Narrow Gauge Railroad Company, and to authorize the consolidation of said company with the Carolina Narrow Gauge Railroad Company and the King\u2019s Mountain Railroad Company.\u201d Section 11 of said Act is as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AlT\">\u201cSection 11. That it shall be lawful for any County or town interested in the construction of the said Chester and Lenoir Railroad to subscribe to the capital stock of said company,\"or of any company with which it may consolidate or unite, such sum, and to be payable in such manner, as the people or proper authorities of such County or town shall deem best, determine and authorize; and in all meetings of stockholders the County Commissioners of the respective Counties, and the Town Councils of the respective towns, shall appoint some person to represent the stock of their respective Counties and towns: <em>Provided, </em>That the property of the said railroad company situated in this State shall be subject to taxation during the existence of their charter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">The real issue, the <em>questio vexata, </em>in this case springs from the diverse interpretations given to the words in the above Section \u2014 \u201c <em>the people or proper authorities of such County or town,\u201d etc.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">The learned counsel for the plaintiffs presented an exposition of these words hostile to the powers claimed by the defendants, which exposition was marked by the greatest opulence of legal research, and a most profound analysis and rational and plausible application of the rules of grammar, which should guide the judgment in its interpretation of spoken and written language.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-8\">It is an exposition, however, which, while it strikes the mind with invincible force when applied to the words in question,\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>isolated from the body of the Act of which they are an integral part \u2014 yet, in the judgment of the Court, it is not supported by the context. The conclusion of the learned counsel upon this point appears to be the result of viewing the statute in question unequally, and without due regard to kindred legislative enactments under which several Counties of this State have subscribed to the capital stock of railway companies and issued bonds in payment of such subscriptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">That illustrious jurist, Chancellor Kent, laid it down as an established rule in the exposition of statutes that \u201cthe .intention of the lawgiver is to be deduced from a view of the whole and of every part of a statute taken and compared together. The real intention, when accurately ascertained, will always prevail over the literal sense of terms. When the expression in a statute is special or particular, but the reason is general, the expression should be deemed general.\u201d \u2014 Kent Comm., vol. 1, part 3, 510.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-6\">It was urged by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs that the words <em>\u201cthe people or proper authorities of such County or town\u201d </em>should be construed to mean \u201c the <em>people </em>of such County or proper authorities of such town.\u201d In other terms, the plaintiffs contend that \u201c the people,\u201d or, what is synonymous with the people, the majority of the duly qualified electors of the County, must first authorize the subscription by their votes in the case of the County; but the Intendant and Council of the town may subscribe directly, on behalf of the town, they being the \u201cproper authorities of such town.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-7\">The plaintiffs, in support of this construction, refer to the fact that hitherto no such power of subscription has ever been exercised or even claimed by the County Commissioners of any County in this State, and that no County in South Carolina has ever issued its bonds in aid of the construction of railroads until after the majority of the people of such County had, by their votes at the ballot-box, authorized such issue. The fact cited by the plaintiffs, so far from re-enforcing the plaintiffs\u2019 construction of the words now immediately under review, would appear to be fatal to the conclusion based upon that construction. While it is true that no County of this State has subscribed or issued bonds to the capital stock of a railroad company except pursuant to a vote of the people of such County, it is also true that every Act heretofore enacted which authorized a County to issue its bonds in aid of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>construction of a railroad specially and expressly provided that, as a condition precedent to such issue, the majority of the qualified electors of the County should authorize such issue by their votes. The only Act of our General Assembly in relation to County subscriptions to the capital stock of railroad companies which does not expressly provide for a popular vote on the question of such subscription is the Act under which the defendants claim to exercise the power of subscription to such capital stock without being authorized thereto by a popular vote.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">In expounding statutes, we should have regard to what may properly be termed the comparative interpretation of laws; that is, we should not only collate and compare the several parts of the statute in question, but we should compare the whole statute with other statutes enacted by the same legislative body in reference to the same subject, and thus determine the real purpose and intent of the legislator, both by what is expressed and by what is omitted in the statute under consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">It is true that the County subscriptions hitherto made in aid of railway construction in this State have been made by the authority and under the sanction of a popular vote. It is also true, however, .that the several Acts of the General Assembly which have heretofore authorized and empowered a County to make such subscription not only provided in expressed terms, <em>in totidem verbis, </em>that such subscription should first be authorized by the majority of the legal voters of the County, but also supplied the means or agencies by and through which the judgment of the majority might be expressed, such as authorizing the County Commissioners and the Mayors or lutendants of towns to call conventions of the taxpayers in the County and towns respectively to consider , the question of submitting the proposed subscription to the popular vote; and also prescribing the mode in which such submission should be made, the appointment of managers and the manner of declaring the result of the vote.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">All of this elaborate machinery for securing an expression of the popular will at the ballot box is wanting in the Act of the General Assembly now under consideration. Is it not, therefore, a conclusive presumption of law and of sound reason that the General Assembly in this Act designed that the Counties interested in the construction of the Chester and Lenoir Narrow Gauge Railroad might subscribe to the capital stock of that company without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>being authorized thereto by a popular vote ? To conclude otherwise is to assume that the Legislature, in dispensing with an important condition which it has heretofore invariably annexed to a grant of power, meant to qualify and restrict the exercise of the power granted, the same as if it had expressed that condition. Such assumption would be an unwarrantable depreciation of the law-making power. The Courts are bound to hold that the General Assembly of the State means what it says and says what it means, although we may sometimes be reminded that Lord Coke complained, even in his day, that \u201cgreat questions have oftentimes arisen upon Acts of Parliament overladen with provisos and additions, and many times penned or corrected by men of none or very little judgment in law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">I am constrained to conclude, after a careful survey of the authorities cited and the arguments adduced by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs, that when the General Assembly declared, in Section 11 of the Act to incorporate the Chester and Lenoir Narrow Gauge Railroad Company, \u201c that it shall be lawful for any County or town interested in the construction of the said Chester and Lenoir Railroad to subscribe to the capital stock of said company, or of any company with which it may consolidate or unite, such sum, and to be payable in such manner, as the <em>people or proper authorities </em>of such County or town shall deem best, determine .and authorize,\u201d it intended to vest the power of subscription, on behalf of the County, in the \u201cproper authorities\u201d of the County, without the intervention of a popular vote. Any other conclusion -would demand also a transposition of the words of the statute, which would carry the Court into the forbidden domain of legislation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">It was urged, however, by the plaintiffs that the term \u201c proper authorities \u201d does not necessarily designate the Gounty Commissioners rather than the County Treasurer. I cannot perceive any difficulty in defining the term \u201c proper authorities,\u201d viewing it in the light of the context and in relation to the subject matter of the proposed subscription. Public officers are definable by their usual functions; and when a doubt arises as to what officers are intended by a statute that vests officials with a new power, or imposes upon them new duties, that doubt may be best solved by ascertaining whether the statute relates to a matter which is germane to the office of those who propose to exercise the power or perform the duty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The statute relates to' the construction of a railroad passing through the County of York. A railway is designated in the General Statutes of this State as a \u201c public highway,\u201d <em>(vide </em>G. S., Chap. 63, Sec. 75,) and it is manifestly a valuable internal improvement. Section 19, Article IY, of the State Constitution provides that \u201cthe qualified electors of each County shall elect three persons, for the term of two years, who shall constitute a Board of County Commissioners, which shall have jurisdiction over roads, highways, ferries, bridges, and in all matters relating to taxes, disbursements of money for County purposes, and in every other case that may be necessary to the internal improvement and local concerns of the respective Counties : <em>Provided, </em>That in all cases there shall be the right of appeal to the State Courts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">This language of the Constitution defining the jurisdiction of the County Commissioners, considered with reference to the subject matter of. the statute in question, points to them with unerring index as the \u201cproper authorities\u201d of the County, alone empowered to act in the premises. Indeed, the statute itself clearly forbids any other conclusion in declaring that \u201cthe County Commissioners of the respective Counties shall appoint some person to represent the stock of their respective <em>Counties.\u201d </em>\u2014 Vide Sec. 11. But, even though the Constitution were less clear and comprehensive as to the powers of County Commissioners, their authority to act in the premises is deducible from the very nature of their office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\">By the Act of 1868, (Gen. Stat. S. C., Chap. 18, Sec. 34,) each County is declared to be a body politic and corporate. The County Commissioners are those officers through whom the County performs its general functions of government. They are charged with the local administration, and constitute the highest political tribunal in the County. Under the Constitution and laws of this State, they exercise <em>quasi </em>judicial, legislative and executive functions. They exercise a supervisory power over all the public officers of the County. When assembled as a Board, they may punish any open or direct contempt of their authority. They are required to examine, settle and allow all accounts chargeable against the County, and draw orders on the County Treasurer for the same. They are empowered to cause to be levied, collected and paid to the Treasurer of the County such sum of money as may be necessary to construct bridges therein, and to prescribe upon what plan and in what manner the moneys so to be raised shall be expended; to make such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>orders concerning the corporate property of the County as they may deem expedient, and to lay out and construct public highways.\u2014 <em>Vide </em>Gen. Stat., Chap. 19. They are designated by law as the only officers empowered to borrow money for the use of the County, to be expended for the purchase of any real estate; and no County can create such loan until the General Assembly shall, upon notification by the County Commissioners, authorize them to create it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-5\">The distinction attempted to be drawn,- in the argument of the plaintiffs, between Counties and municipal corporations, does not appear to be very material to the main issue, nor is it well founded. That a County is a \u201c municipal corporation \u201d cannot well be denied.\u2014 <em>Vide 2 </em>Kent Comm., 275; Bla. Comm., 4, 411; <em>People </em>vs. <em>Morris, </em>13 Wend., 325-335; <em>Horton, Judge &amp; Co. vs. Mobile County School Comm., </em>43 Ala., 598; 2 Bouvier Law Die., 193. And in <em>Thomson vs. Lee County, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States use the expression \u201ca County or other municipal corporation.\u201d In that case Mr. Justice Miller says: \u201cMost certain it is that as to all their rights, powers and responsibilities, three grand classes of corporations exist: first political or <em>municipal corporations, such as Counties, </em>towns, cities,\u201d etc.\u2014 <em>Vide </em>also <em>Swann </em>vs. <em>Williams, 2 </em>Michigan, 427; 1 Coler on Munic. Bonds, 374.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-6\">That the Legislature may authorize a County, or the proper authorities thereof, or any other municipal corporation, to subscribe to the capital stock of a railroad company within its limits, or to aid in the construction of any other internal improvement for the public benefit, and issue bonds to pay for such subscription, or borrow money on the faith of such bonds, has been repeatedly declared in decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court of many of the States of our Union.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-7\">This power, so delegated, may, if the Legislature please, be exercised without the sanction of a popular vote, its validity being dependent upon the intent of the legislative body in delegating the power to the local administration; the effectiveness of the grant of power not being subject to impairment by the absence of a popular ratification on the part of the local constituency.\u2014 <em>Vide Thomson </em>vs. <em>Lee County, </em>3 Wallace, U. S. S. C. Rep., 327; <em>Gillman vs. City of Sheboygan, 2 </em>Black, 510; and <em>Barto vs. Himrod, </em>4 Seldon, 433. In comment upon this last case, it is said in 2 Coler on Municipal Bonds, 206, \u201call general reasoning is rendered unnecessary by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>explicit determination in the case of <em>Barto </em>vs. <em>Nimrod.\u201d </em>But while general statutes must be enacted by the Legislature, it is plain that the power to make local regulations, having the force of law, in limited localities, may be committed <em>to other bodies representing the people in their local divisions </em>or to the people of those districts themselves. Our whole system of local government in cities, villages, Counties and towns depends upon that distinction. The practice has existed from the foundation of the State and has always been considered a prominent feature in the American system of government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-5\">In <em>Sharpless </em>vs. <em>Mayor of Philadelphia, </em>(21 Pa. St. Rep., 147-148,) the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania says: \u201cThe Legislature may lawfully authorize municipal corporations to subscribe to the capital stock of railroad companies, <em>and such authority may be given directly to the corporate authorities or it may be made to depend upon the assent of a majority of the corporators.\u201d </em>\u2014 Vide also <em>City of Bridgeport </em>vs. <em>Nousatonic It.

The American system of government is one of complete decentralization, the primary and cardinal idea of which is that local affairs shall be managed by local authorities. In this country, beginning with the illustrious Marshall and Kent, the vast preponderance of judicial authority is with those who affirm that railways are public institutions of great and manifest benefit to communities, and the Legislature may either impose taxes directly in aid of their construction or delegate the power to the political subdivision of the State within whose immediate territorial jurisdiction such railways are to be constructed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-7\">In the case of <em>Rogers </em>vs. <em>Burlington, </em>decided in the Supreme Court of the United States, Mr. Justice Clifford, in delivering the opinion of the Court, Said: <em>\u201c </em>Railways, as a matter of usage, founded on experience, are so far considered by the Court as in the nature of improved highways, and as indispensable to the public interest, and the successful pursuit even of local business, that a State Legislature may authorize the towns and Counties of a State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>through which a railway passes to borrow money, issue their bonds, subscribe for the stock of the company, or purchase the same, with a view of aiding those engaged in constructing or completing such a public improvement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">In the case of <em>Oleott </em>vs. <em>The County Board of Supervisors of Fon du Lae County, </em>decided in the Supreme Court of the United States at the December Term, 1872, the Court say : \u201c That railroads are public highways, has been the doctrine of nearly all the Courts ever since such conveniences have had any existence.

In exercising the right of eminent domain, the State takes from the property owner, in property, more than the share that he is bound, to contribute, as a citizen, to the general good, <em>and the State compensates him therefor. </em>In exercising the taxing power, the State takes from the property owner his exact proportionate share, in money, for the advancement of the common interest, <em>without compensation, </em>save in those advantages reflected back upon the individual from the promoted welfare of the community.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-9\">The fourth and fifth clauses of the complaint were abandoned by the plaintiffs, in the argument, as untenable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-10\">The further objection, by plaintiffs, that even though the defendants have the authority to subscribe to the capital stock of the said railroad company, they are not authorized to issue the proposed bonds, cannot be sustained.

The Section under which the County Commissioners acted is one which would be very difficult to construe if we were to be confined to the mere verbiage of the Act. It frequently happens that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>an historical inquiry will explain sentences of themselves unintelligible, or which might be understood to mean something very different from their real meaning. For instance, search all our statutes through and one will fail to arrive at the meaning of \u201c benefit of clergy,\u201d and one might well suppose those words to mean the receiving of the kind offices of a clergyman when about to be executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-5\">Let us make an inquiry into the history of this Section and see if Ave can learn Avhat it means, and why it is apparently so obscure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-6\">We find that it is a literal copy, <em>mutatis mutandis, </em>of Section 1 of the Act to aid the Air Line Railroad Company, (14 Stat., 75,) except that the Avord \u201ccity\u201d is omitted. The Air Line Railroad passed through cities in North Carolina, Georgia and South Carolina, Avhile our railroad passes through no city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-7\">Now, in the Air Line Act, the Legislature could not say \u201cMayor and Aldermen of such <em>town </em>or city,\u201d nor \u201cIntendant and Wardens of such town or <em>eity,\u201d </em>and hence had the alternative of saying \u201c the Intendant and Wardens of such town, or the Mayor and Aldermen of such eity,\u201d or, more briefly, as in the Act, \u201c the proper authorities of such town or city.\u201d When the Legislature copied this Section it struck out \u201c city,\u201d for the reason before given, and left the Avords as is in Section 11.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-8\">Noav the Air Line Act Avas passed in September, 1868, and the practical contemporaneous constructiou given it was a vote by the people of the Counties, including York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-9\">After this, in February, 1873, the Legislature passed the Section in question, and must be supposed to have intended the same as Section 1 of the Air Line Act, with its meaning practically explained by a contemporaneous construction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-10\">\n<em>Contempor\u00e1nea expositio, est fortissima in lege.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-11\">But why was the Air Line Act left so doubtful and no plan of taking the vote provided ? We find, on inspection of the Act, that the railroad lies in the three States of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. In such eases it often happens that the person Avho in fact drafts the statute lives in one of the States and has in vieAv the laws of such State. The Air Line Act is evidently drafted by a North Carolinian. Such a one Avould find, on inquiry, that in Georgia the <em>Constitution, Article IV, Section </em>6, forbids any person from being compelled to contribute to a railroad, except inhabitants of towns and cities, after an election has been had Avhick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>results in favor thereof, while in South Carolina no such prohibition existed. Hence the application in Georgia is for a legislative appropriation of so much a mile made by the State, and the proper authorities of towns and cities are allowed to' vote subscriptions. In South Carolina the Section is as found, assuming (or not considering the matter) that some general law existed in South Carolina like the general law of North Carolina, which provides:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-5\">\u201c An Act to Authorize the Several Counties op the State to Take Stock in Railroad Companies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-6\">\u201cSection 1.

Hence the sentence cannot be equivalent to \u201cas tlie people or proper authorities of such County or the people or proper authorities of such town.\u201d A distribution of words being necessary at once suggests the one I propose as proper. It is the same distribution that would be made in the sentence: \u201cThe Admiral or General of the navy or army may order a general court martial for the trial of officers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-8\">The words \u201cTown Councils,\u201d or the equivalent, were not used for the reason specified in my preceding point, and \u201cthe County Commissioners \u201d are used in the same Section charged with another duty. If the County Commissioners were, <em>virtute officii, </em>the <em>\u201c </em>proper authorities\u201d of the County, then the sentence, \u201cthe County Commissioners of the respective Counties and the Town Councils of the respective towns\u201d could have been fully expressed simply by three words, \u201cthe proper authorities.\u201d This matter of representation of stock is not found in the Air Line Act, (for some reason known to the \u201cNorth Carolinian,\u201d) or else some light might thereby be thrown on this matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-9\">III.

Section 11 does not state that they are the proper authorities. This has already been abundantly shown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-6\">2. Right reason is adverse to the claim. The construction of all laws must be reasonable. Is it reasonable to suppose that in a State, where all powers not delegated are reserved to the <em>people, </em>(Cons., Art. 1, Sec. 41,) where no public debt of the State can be created without a two-thirds vote of the Legislature, and other restrictions besides having to have the sanction of a vote of the <em>people, </em>and at a time when the welfare of the State requires all the taxing resources of the Counties to be husbanded to respond to State taxation, that a little legislature of three could, by a vote of two of its members, impose a debt upon the County of $100,000, or $1,000,000, interest to be paid annually, without or against the consent of <em>thq peoplef</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-7\">Our construction is reasonable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-8\">(a.)

If the people would vote for the subscription, then why not submit it to them, \u2014 for this is all we ask in this case? And if the people would vote against the subscription, then no milder terms are appropriate than to say the Commissioners have perpetrated an outrage against the people.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-12\">3. Usage in the United States does not countenance the power claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-13\">I have in this case made extended inquiry and research, and have been able to find no <em>one </em>instance where a statute has authorized County Commissioners (or the equipollent officers) to vote a subscription to a railroad; nor <em>one </em>instance, before this case, where such a power was attempted to be exercised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-14\">The nearest I could find was one case where the Commissioners and the grand jury were so authorized; and another case where the United States Court said the Legislature <em>might </em>authorize the Commissioners. But in this latter case <em>(Thomson </em>vs. <em>Lee Co., </em>3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Wall., 327,) the Supreme Court of Iowa had changed its ruling, and the Act in question actually provided for a vote of the people.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-5\">If the research of the defendants has been rewarded with a nearer instance, they will cite the same to your Honors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-6\">But <em>usage </em>can hardly be predicated upon exceptional cases <em>when found.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-7\">4. The <em>Constitution </em>of South Carolina does not confer the power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-8\">If conferred, it must be by Article IV, Section 19, where they are given <em>jurisdiction, </em>over highways, and in every case of internal improvement; or in Article IX, Section 8, which provides that \u201c the corporate authorities of Counties, townships, school districts, cities, towns and villages may be vested with power to assess and collect taxes for corporate purposes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-9\">Now, while we admit that railroads are \u201cgreat public highways,\u201d and \u201cgreat works of internal improvements,\u201d we deny that they are <em>the </em>highways or <em>the </em>internal improvements (hat Section 19 meant; and we deny that they can be included in <em>the </em>County purposes referred to in Section' 8. Besides, Section 8 does not say that the officers mentioned in Section 19 are the corporate authorities mentioned in Section 8, and the County Auditor, for instance, is <em>a </em>corporate authority of a County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-10\">If railroads are the highways meant, then it would be proper for the County Commissioners to build bridges for them and to keep them in repair. They might order out the males of the County and work them five days on the railroad tracks. This absurd result follows, or else it is true that by highways, in Section 19, the Constitution does <em>not </em>mean railroads.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-11\">5.

The decree of the Circuit Court holds that under the terms of Section 11 of the Act to incorporate the Chester and Lenoir Railroad Company, (15 Stat., 393,) the County Commissioners of York County have authority to subscribe to the capital stock of such company an amount fixed by them for that purpose. The question raised by the appeal involves the correctness of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The Section of the Act in question is as follows : \u201c That it shall be lawful for any County or town interested in the construction of the Chester and Lenoir Railroad to subscribe to the capital stock of said company, or of any company with which it may consolidate or unite, such sum, and to be payable in such manner, as the people or proper authorities of such County or town shall deem best, determine and authorize; and in all meetings of stockholders, the County Commissioners of the respective Counties and the Town Council of the respective towns shall appoint some proper person to represent the stock of their respective Counties and towns : <em>Provided, </em>That the property of the said railroad company situated in this State shall be subject to taxation during the existence of their charter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The question is, whether in the case of a subscription under the terms of this Section in behalf of a County the County Commissioners of such County are, in the sense of the Act, \u201cproper authorities of such County,\u201d and as such authorized to determine the fact that the County is interested in such improvement, to fix the amount of such subscription, the manner of payment, and to confer authority for the actual making of such subscription.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The question is exclusively one of the proper constructions of the statute and does not involve the constitutional authority of the Legislature to confer upon County Commissioners such powers as they claim to possess in the case under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The subject of Section 11 is the interest of certain Counties and towns in the construction of a particular work of internal improvement, and the means of advancing that interest, by conferring corporate authority upon any such County or town to acquire, in its corporate capacity, the rights and assume the obligations of a stockholder of the railroad company incorporated by that Act. The object of the provision of Section 11 was to facilitate the construction of the railroad to the extent of such sums as might be acquired to the capital of the company through subscriptions of the character named.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In order to place a proper construction upon the statute, we must apply its language to its proper subject, keeping constantly in view the object of the enactment. The construction of Section 11 cannot be materially aided by special reference to the language of other parts of the Act. On the other hand the proper sense of Section 11 cannot be appreciated without having regard to considerations of public policy, derived from experience under the principles and habits of our representative governments, and which have largely influenced and given form to legislation in cases of a like character.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">We are to consider whether the powers in question were intended to be conferred, as it regards Counties, on the body of electors in the modes fixed by law, or upon the Commissioners elected by the people of the County under the authority and1 for the purposes prescribed by the Constitution and the laws creating the office of County Commissioner and fixing its powers and duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The first proposition to be brought to aid this inquiry arises out of a view of the subject under the mode in which it has generally been dealt with in legislation of the class to which the statute under consideration is properly referable. It is this: that the powers conferred by Section 11, assuming them to be conferred upon the electors of the County, are ordinary powers frequently given, and such as have been often sanctioned by both direct legislative and judicial authority, while those powers, assuming them to have been conferred upon County Commissioners, are extraordinary and unusual. They are extraordinary because they are in excess of the proper powers of such officers, and unusual in the sense that such large discretion has not generally been conferred on officers of that class.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">This consideration would not be entitled to weight if the language of the Act was clear and indisputable; but as it is doubtful, and needs the aid of construction, it becomes important to ascertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>whether the proposition just advanced is sound and applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">It would not be either necessary or convenient to do more than make a general reference to the legislation of this and other States conferring authority upon Counties to aid in the construction of railroads, in order to show that where power has been conferred on Counties to determine for themselves, as corporate bodies, whether they will advance money or assume obligations in aid of the construction of railroads, the practice has been to confer such power of determination on the body of the electors of the County, to be exercised by voting on the measure proposed. If a single instance has occurred throughout the legislation of the extended system of States where such authority has been conferred exclusively upon the ordinary officers of the County, such instance has not been brought to our notice, and the probability of finding such an instance is not sufficient to warrant so extended a research. We must assume that this is the first instance where that has been attempted, if the statute indeed bears the construction put upon it by the respondents. It is clear, therefore, that, measured by the standard of common legislative practice, the powers claimed for the County Commissioners must be regarded as. extraordinary and unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">It may be doubted whether conferring powers of this character and magnitude upon the ordinary County officers could be regarded as a wise and prudent exercise of legislative powers. Where the Legislature, acting within constitutional limits, makes a clear and explicit exposition of its will and intention, it is not for the Courts to call in question the wisdom or prudence of its determinations ; but where the legislative expression is obscure, and public officers, claiming to have derived powers through such obscure expression, come into the Courts to have the limits of those powers made clear and definite through the application of the rules of construction, the Courts are bound to see that the Legislature is not made to speak language that the judgment of the community would condemn as unwise and imprudent.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">It is not necessary to elaborate or fortify the proposition that lodging power in the hands of three administrative County officers, chosen without reference to the exercise of such extraordinary powers, and for the purpose of discharging the ordinary duties incident to the corporate business of a County, by which they may bind the County, as stockholders of a railroad corporation, to an unlimited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>amount, is of questionable propriety, if not dangerous. The simple enunciation of the proposition is sufficient to secure for it general acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">It must then be concluded that the construction contended for by the respondents will have the effect to place in the hands of the County Commissioners extraordinary, unusual and questionable, if not dangerous, powers, and, as such, cannot be admitted while any better construction is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">We have, then, to inquire whether the language of Section 11, fairly interpreted, independently of what may or may not be its tendency and effect, -warrants the claims of the respondents. If such is not the conclusive effect of the language of the Act, then we must seek its meaning in accordance with the rules of construction, having regard to the nature of the powers sought to be conferred and the end for which they are called into existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The only designation under which the respondents can claim the right of subscription in the name of the County is that of the \u201cproper authorities.\u201d If they answer to that description, then, possibly, the grant of authority to the people or proper authorities is sufficient to enable the County Commissioners to act for the County with conclusive effect and without reference to the people in any case within the provisions of that Section.</p>\n<p id=\"A5M\">It is evident that this Section does not assume to create any new office or to confer any new class of powers on any existing office. The language quoted leaves it as a question to be determined by \u2022some means independent of the Act itself, who are the proper authorities to carry out its provisions conferring on the electors, under the designation of the people, the right to act in the matter when no proper authorities exist for that purpose. We are, then, to inquire what must be the nature of the powers and duties of any particular office to enable it to answer the description \u201c proper authorities\u201d as it regards the right to act for the County in the case contemplated by Section 11, and then to refer to the Constitution and laws to ascertain whether such powers are vested in the County Commissioners. For this purpose, the precise character of the power in question must be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">In the first place, the authority conferred is in its nature purely legislative, so far at least as it involves the right to determine the nature and extent of the interest of the County in the improvement and the proper limit of aid under all the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Whether determining the mode of payment may not be regarded as a proper subject for the action of administrative officers, need not be considered, as it is a question of subordinate importance as affecting the present case. It would be difficult to find any one exact and concise definition of what constitutes the difference between an act purely legislative and an administrative act, and no exhaustive definition is here attempted. There are, however, certain clearly recognizable attributes of each, about which there can be no mistake, and which will be sufficient to test the present question.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">It is not the nature of an administrative act to create new rights or obligations, but to put in exercise such as have already been created by the legislative authority but may be dependent for their practical efficiency on the performance of some official act on the part of an administrative officer. It may be that such right and obligation were created in general terms, and that the persons or other subjects of the Act, or the existence of some fact or state of facts, must be ascertained through the intervention of an administrative officer before the Act can take complete effect according to the intent of the law-maker. On the other hand, the operation of the Act, as it regards such rights and obligations, may be made to depend on some condition involving the discharge of a duty by an administrative officer, \u2014 either the performance of an act or the ascertainment of a fact, \u2014 which duty may be either discretionary or compulsive. While the principles just stated of themselves give great latitude and importance to the action of administrative officers, still-they do not nor can any view taken of the nature of an administrative office sanction the idea that a public policy on a subject collateral to this constituting the subjects of ordinary legislation, such as affording public aid to railroads, can be determined upon and adopted by administrative officers as an act of administrative duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The Act in question does not determine that the County shall subscribe, but permits it to do so or to refrain, according to its own views of interest or duty in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Thus the question of the propriety of such aid, considered from an economic standpoint, the character of the improvement and its adaptation to the wants of the community, the extent of interest that the County has in its construction and the limit of expenditure or of the obligation assumed, as fixed by the present and pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>peetive financial ability of the County, or by more general considerations of economic prudence, are all matters that are left to be considered and acted upon' in an entirely independent manner by the people of the County or those that properly represent them in regard to matters of that sort. It is clear and indisputable that such matters can only be properly determined by those in whom legislative authority is vested by the Constitution, or by proper representatives of the people of the particular localities most interested, clothed with power to legislate in their behalf, or by the people acting as electors under the authority of an Act of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Do the County Commissioners possess authority of that kind and degree? It is clear that they do not possess general authority to exercise all such legislative powers as are, or may be, by the Constitution or laws, permitted to the Counties as bodies politic and corporate.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">There is no such grant either in the Constitution or laws, either expressly or by implication conferring any such right.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The County Commissioners are, by the Constitution, administrative officers, and the powers conferred upon them must be deemed as circumscribed by the line that separates administrative from legislative functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">There are two clear grounds for laying down the proposition just stated \u2014 the first is, that all the enumerated powers conferred upon them are of that class; and the seconcj is, that their determinations are declared to be appealable into the Courts. \u2014 Constitution, Article IV, Section 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">If those powers were legislative, it is clear that such an appeal would be meaningless, for the Courts cannot, under the Constitution, examine the merits of legislative acts upon the grounds on which they rest or the motives that prompted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">Their powers as set forth in the Constitution (Article IV, Section 19,) are \u201cjurisdiction over roads, highways, ferries, bridges and in all matters relating to taxes, disbursements of money for County pnrposes, and in every other case that may be necessary to the internal improvement and local concerns of the respective Counties.\u201d The term that here describes the nature of their powers over the, various subjects enumerated is \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d That term imports authority to expound or apply the laws, and excludes the idea of power to make laws. This word is often used in a broader sense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>but when employed for the purpose of indicating a partition of powers among the different departments of the government must be used in a strict sense. If the word jurisdiction, as here used, could be made as including legislative power, the constitutional grant of power to the County Commissioners would assume a magnitude and importance not only unusual and excessive but such as would threaten the balance between the different members constituting the political body and the very integrity of the powers of the supreme legislative body. If the words \u201cand in every other case that may be necessary to the internal improvement and local concerns of the respective Counties \u201d import a grant of legislative power, it is clearly plenary, and, being constitutional, it would be difficult to understand on what principle the Legislature could control or interfere with its exercise, or even exercise the general legislative function over the same subject as it regards the accomplishment of ends having relation to the internal government and concerns of the Counties. No such anomalous and unprecedented clash of jurisdictions was intended by the Constitution, and we must hold that the word \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d as there employed, was intended to describe either administrative or judicial function, as excluding the idea of legislative power. That the County Commissioners are not, in the strict sense of the term, a judical body, is clear, Notwithstanding that body is created by a Section of the Article relating to the judiciary of the State, the office is characterized by the nature of its powers rather than by the place occupied by the provisions of the Constitution that created it.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">This view of the nature of the office in question is fully carried out by the legislation on that subject, (Gen. Stat., Chap. 14,) while the effect of such legislation is to limit the powers of the County Commissioners rather than to enlarge them as affecting the various subjects placed by the Constitution under their jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">It is clear, then, that the County Commissioners do not possess any general right to exercise any and all functions of a legislative character that may be vested in or permitted to the Counties as bodies politic and corporate; then, unless they possess special legislative power in regard to a class of subjects embracing or at least analogous to the one under consideration, they are clearly destitute of the powers that would qualify them to be recognized as the proper authorities of the County in the sense of the Act in q\u00fcestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The only power possessed by them- at all analogous to the present is that of borrowing money for the purchase of lands, the erection of buildings, &amp;e., (Gen. Stat., 149,) but this power is clogged with the following provision : \u201c <em>Provided, </em>That no such loan shall be created by the County Commissioners until they notify the General Assembly of the necessity thereof and authority be granted to them to create said loan.\u201d This not only shows that they were considered by the Legislature as destitute of the powers claimed in this case, in the only analogous case directly placed within their jurisdiction, but that the Legislature deemed it impolitic to leave in their hands the right to create obligations to bind the County in the most necessary cases. If they cannot be trusted by the Legislature to borrow money to the limited extent necessary for the purpose of supplying County buildings, is it to be supposed that the Legislature intends to confer upon them unlimited power to bind the County by a subscription to a railroad in which the County as a corporation has only an indirect and speculative interest? The only possible answer is in the negative. We must then conclude that in employing the expression \u201cproper authorities,\u201d the view of the powers of the County Commissioners just presented was in the mind of the Legislature, having the effect to exclude County Commissioners from what was intended to be embraced within the terms of that expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Arguments have been pressed by both parties, based upon the order in which certain words and expressions stand in the Act, but they can have little right where the construction of the Act turns upon grave questions arising out of the nature of the powers sought to be conferred. It must generally be assumed that the legislative mind was looking to the consequences and effects to flow from its action rather than to the proper grammatical adjustment of the expression through which that intent is conveyed. The ground upon which the present construction rests involves vital and fundamental considerations, before which questions of literal accuracy and elegance must give way. But even these arguments present a view that strengthens the present conclusion. If the views expressed are sound, then the expression \u201c proper authorities \u201d applies to corporate bodies represented by municipal legislative bodies, and the expression \u201c the people\u201d relates to Counties that have no such legislative bodies. Such a construction gives effect to every part of the statute, while the argument of the County Commissioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>would leave no case in which the people would have a right to act to the exclusion of the public authorities, and would deprive that provision of the Section of all importance and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">It has also been urged that the clause of Section 11 that authorizes the County Commissioners to appoint a person to represent the Counties in the meetings of stockholders when such subscriptions are made evidences an intent to give them like power as it regards the original subscription. The powers exercised in the two cases are in no respect analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The County Commissioners are clearly the proper authority to appoint such representatives, as they are the general custodians of the corporate property and rights,- and, as such, proper parties to look after the interests of the County as affected by the action of the stockholders. On the other hand, the fact that the County Commissioners are named as it regards the lesser and clearly administrative duty, points the omission of their names, as it regards the higher and more important legislative function, as intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The conclusion of the Circuit Court was clearly erroneous. The judgment should be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
