Rhodes and R. Red brought separate actions <em>ex delicto </em>before a Trial Justice against the Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta Railroad Company. The defendant demurred in each case to the jurisdiction of the Court. The Trial Justice overruled' the demurrer and gave judgment for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-10\">Appeals were taken to the Circuit Court and His Honor the Circuit Judge filed his opinion and decree as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-11\">Maher, J. These Cases come up on appeal from a Court of Trial Justice. .The actions were brought to recover damages not exceeding one hundred dollars for injury to the personal propert3r of the plaintiffs. The defendants demurred to the jurisdiction of the Court by law. The demurrers were overruled, and, the cases being tried on their merits, judgments were rendered for the plaintiffs respectively. The appeals renewed here the question of law raised by the demurrers, and the only matter brought into controversy is the constitutionality of subdivision 2, Section 74, of the Code of Procedure, which confers upon Trial Justices\u2019 Courts civil jurisdiction in \u201c an action for damages pertaining to the person, or the personal or real property, if the damages claimed do not exceed one hundred dollars.\u201d Section 1, Article IV, of the Constitution, after apportioning the judicial power of the State among certain Courts therein named, authorizes the General Assembly to \u201c establish such municipal and other inferior Courts as may be deemed neces<em>sary.\u201d </em>\u2014 The <em>State </em>vs. <em>Fillebrown, </em>2 S. C., 404. This clause received construction, and it was there held that the term \u201cinferior Courts \u201d is used in its technical sense, as signifying Courts of limited and special powers, whose jurisdiction must appear on the face of the proceedings to give validity to their judgments. And upon very full and satisfactory reasoning, it was further considered by the Court that where the jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace is not made exclusive by the Constitution, either expressly or by necessary implication, a like jurisdiction co-extensive in its limits may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>be vested by Act of the Legislature in Courts of Trial Justices or other inferior Courts established by authority of Section 1, Article IV. \u201c It does not follow,\u201d says the Court, \u201c that such other inferior Courts are to be of more limited jurisdiction than the Court of the Justice of the Peace. It is by the authority of the Constitution that they are to be established; and if by the same Section it had already provided for a Court which is already recognized as an inferior Court, it clearly shows an intention not to limit such Courts to the one expressly named, but to leave it to the discretion of the Legislature to multiply them if in its judgment necessary.\u201d Section 15 of Article IV (Cons.) provides that the Courts of Common Pleas shall have \u201c exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases aud actions <em>ex delicto </em>which shall not be cognizable before Justices of the Peace.\u201d This Section relates exclusively to Courts of Common Pleas, and Justices of the Peace are evidently referred to only to indicate in general terms certain cases within their cognizance which alone are excepted from the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts whose powers are under definition. The\u2019particular actions which shall not be cognizable before the Justices, and the character of the jurisdiction to be exercised by them in such actions, whether exclusive or concurrent, are not determined by this Section. Reference must be had to other provisions of the Constitution for definite information ron these points. Section 22 of the same Article relates to Courts of Justice of the Peace, and declares among other things that they shall have \u201c such jurisdiction as may be provided by law in actions <em>ex delicto </em>when the damages claimed do not exceed one hundred dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-5\">The inquiry is, what cases and actions <em>ex delicto </em>shall not be cognizable before Justices of the Peace within the meaning of Section 15? Section 22 defines the actions which shall be cognizable before the Justices, though it makes their jurisdiction dependent upon the discretion of the Legislature. But in restricting the power of the Legislature in conferring such jurisdiction to actions where the damages claimed shall not exceed one hundred dollars, a definite answer is afforded to the inquiry what actions shall <em>not </em>be cognizable before Justices of the Peace. Manifestly, they are actions where the damages claimed do exceed one hundred dollars. Actions <em>ex delicto </em>claiming damages not exceeding one hundred dollars are potentially cognizable before Justices of the Peace, since the Legislature is expressly authorized to confer the jurisdiction; and, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>so conferred, tlie Justices, though deriving it immediately from the enabling Act, nevertheless, like the appointee of a power, may be said to hold by virtue of the original grant \u2014 the express warrant of the Constitution itself. But by no possibility short of an amendment to the Constitution could Justices of the Peace exercise rightful jurisdiction in actions <em>ex delicto </em>where the damages claimed exceed one hundred dollars. These are emphatically, in the language of Section 15, eases and actions which <em>shall not be </em>cognizable before Justices of the Peace and in all respects answer the description of the cases and actions which by that Section are placed within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Common Pleas. Eeading Sections 15 and 22 in connection, my construction is that the exclusive jurisdiction of Courts of Common Pleas extends to all cases and actions <em>ex delicto </em>in which the claim of damages exceeds one hundred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-5\">The jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace in actions <em>ex delicto </em>is not exclusive by the terms of the Constitution ; on the contrary, it is left to the discretion of the Legislature whether to confer or withhold it in whole or in part. The concurrent jurisdiction of Courts of Common Pleas in cases cognizable before the Justices may confidently be affirmed, since these Courts of superior and general jurisdiction are recognized by the Constitution as pre-established and could be outside of their cognizance in all cases of tort only by express provisions or necessary <em>implication. </em>\u2014 State vs. <em>Walher, </em>14 Eich., 36. And upon the authority of <em>State </em>vs. <em>Fillebrown, </em>it must be adjudged that the legislature has the authority under the Constitution to vest in Courts of Trial Justices, and other inferior Courts which it may establish under Section 1 of Article IV, a like concurrent jurisdiction in actions <em>ex delicto </em>where the damages claimed do not exceed one hundred dollars, and accordingly that subdivision 2 of Section 74 of the Code of Procedure is a valid and competent act of legislation, not being in conflict with the provision of the Constitution. There was, therefore, no error in the judgments of the Court below overruling the demurrers. Wherefore, it is ordered that the judgments rendered below in these cases be affirmed, and that the plaintiffs have leave to enter judgment of affirmance, with costs, to be taxed by the Clerk of this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-6\">The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>Rion, </em>for appellants:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-5\">According to Section 15, Article IV, Constitution, \u201cThe Courts of Common Pleas have <em>exclusive </em>original jurisdiction in all cases and actions <em>ex delicto </em>which shall not be cognizable1 before Justices of the Peace.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-6\">Section 22 of the same Article gives Justices of the Peace \u201csuch jurisdiction <em>as may be provided by law </em>in actions <em>ex delicto </em>where the damages claimed do not exceed one hundred dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-7\">There has been no provision of law giving Justices of the Peace any jurisdiction in actions <em>ex delicto, </em>therefore the jurisdiction of the Common 'Pleas remains <em>exclusive.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-8\">The Trial Justices are not the Justices of the Peace of the Constitution \u2014 the former being <em>appointed </em>by the Governor, and the latter elected by the people.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-9\">It is respectfully submitted that the error of Plis Honor the Circuit Judge consists in not considering:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-10\">1.
