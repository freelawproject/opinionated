See Pen. Code, \u00a7 496, subd. 3. Of the facts of the breaking, the entering, that it was in the nighttime, that a human being was in the building, and that, if the defendant was one of the persons who performed the crime, he was assisted by another actually present, there is in the record abundant evidence. The argument is whether or not there is sufficient identification of the defendant as one of the persons who committed the crime. The occupant of the dwelling, who was in the building at the time, testifies that after the alarm he heard a noise on his roof as if a half dozen men were running across. The night watchman said that he heard a noise as if two men or boys were running across the roof of the building, and he followed the noise across the roofs of several buildings up to the roof of an apartment house; that he then took his station in a secluded spot about 75 or 100 feet away from the entrance of the apartment house; that between 10 and 30 minutes thereafter the defendant and a companion came out of the door of the apartment- house and walked rapidly away; and that the witness, following them, placed them under arrest. The two men were taken to the station house and searched, but nothing of an incriminating nature was found upon them. They gave addresses which were not that of the apartment house. Within half an hour later the occupant of the dwelling and two or three officers went upon the roof of the house where the burglary had been committed, and there found some articles which might be used by burglars. They traversed the roofs of the intervening'houses until they reached that of the apartment house. Trap-doors through the roofs were open on the apartment house and upon one of the houses intervening.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">It did not appear in the people\u2019s case that the two men arrested, one of whom was the defendant, had no business in the apartment house at that time, which was between 13 and 1 o\u2019clock at night. In spite of the fact that the night watchman swore with great positiveness that he saw the defendant and his companion emerge from the entrance to the apartment house, the identification was by no means satisfactory; for it was quite as possible that the defendant and his companion were emerging from the apartment house after having been lawfully there, as that they were the individuals that had been running on the tops of the adjoining houses. It will be seen that the defect in the people\u2019s case was that there was no proof that the defendant and his companion were not in the apartment house on lawful business. However, the defendant\u2019s companion was sworn as a witness for the defense, and has, indirectly at least, supplied this deficiency in the proof. He testified that he and this defendant were in Coney Island during the evening in the company of two young ladies, and that at the time of their arrest they were on their way to take a street car after having just escorted the young ladies to their homes, and that they were not inside the apartment house, but were arrested as they passed by it. In view of the testimony not explanatory of their presence there, but denying it, for all purposes in this case it may be taken as a fact that these men had no lawful business at that time of night in the apartment house. The jury have evidently done what they were justified in doing, name<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ly, have considered the explanation of the defendant\u2019s witness tantamount to an admission that the men had no lawful business in the apartment house, and have also believed the testimony of the night watchman that the defendant and his companion actually emerged therefrom. The young ladies with whom it was said the men spent the evening were not sworn as witnesses. The evidence of the breaking and entering, the running of men across the roofs of the intervening houses to the roof of the apartment house, the open door leading to the roof of the apartment house, and the emerging of the defendant and his companion therefrom upon the street within between 10 and 20 minutes thereafter, and the fact that they had no lawful business therein, were, in my opinion, sufficient to warrant the jury in finding the defendant guilty of the perpetration of the act charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We conclude that the conviction must be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
