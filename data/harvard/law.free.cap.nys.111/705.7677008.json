The complaint having been dismissed at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the appellant is entitled to the most 'favorable view which- a jury might properly have taken of the evidence; and the theory on which the complaint was dismissed, that the plaintiff had failed to show absence of contributory negligence, is not sustained by the testimony in this case. Plaintiff\u2019s intestate was struck by a south-bound train on the defendant\u2019s double-track railroad; while crossing from her home on the west side of the tracks to a roadway on the east side, by means of a private crossing which had \u2022been maintained for many years. The plaintiff testified that his wife left the house to cross the tracks to overtake the witness\u2019 mother-in-law, who had preceded her; that the witness called to her to look out for the train; that the deceased stopped when about 4 feet from the north-bound track and looked for an approaching train; that she then started forward toward the south-bound track, about 15 feet away; and that as she reached the south-bound track she was. struck by the south-bound train and killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-17\">There was some evidence that at the point where the deceased stopped to look the view was obstructed, so that a train could not be seen more than 150 feet away, but that this view became extended'to about half a mile as the south-bound track was approached, and it appears to have been the theory of the court that it was the duty.of the plaintiff to show that his intestate looked at a time when she could have seen the greater distance, and that a failure to show this established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>\u2022contributory negligence as a matter of law. The fact of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate stopping to look for a train when within 4 feet of the north-bound track, which was only about 15 feet from the south-bound track, was some evidence of care on her part. It showed that she had in mind the danger and the purpose to avoid it, and the mere fact that \u2022she was not shown to have stopped and looked again in passing over .a space of 15 feet is hardly conclusive against the right of this plaintiff. The law of negligence is not based upon the highest possible degree of care, nor even the degree of care which a highly prudent \u2022person would use, but upon the average of reasonable care\u2014the de;gree of care that 12 man, selected at random from the vicinage, will say is reasonable under all the circumstances. It- is well established that, where the facts are such that reasonable minded men might \u25a0 differ as to what is reasonable care,- it is the duty of the court to submit the question to the jury, even in a case where the court might feel that it was its duty to set aside a verdict, and we are of the opinion that this was a case in which the plaintiff had some evidence to support his cause of action, and that the jury should have been permitted to pass upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a \u25a0new trial should be granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
