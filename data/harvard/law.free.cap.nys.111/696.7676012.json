Thereafter defendant sold the property to another party. There was no actual or binding agreement of sale that could be enforced against the party repudiating the same. Plaintiffs\u2019 commissions depended upon plaintiffs bringing the buyer and seller to an actual agreement, not a prospective or contemplated one. The commissions depended upon a sale of the property through their efforts, and where no binding contract for a sale is made, through the fault of the proposed purchaser procured by plaintiffs, the latter are not entitled to a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
