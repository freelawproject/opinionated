Two deliveries were made by the defendant's, but the plaintiffs failed to pay them therefor, whereupon the defendants refused to continue their work and tendered back the remainder of the lawn on condition that payment be made for the work already done. The defendants did not pay, and brought this action to recover possession of the goods. The defendants pleaded an artisan\u2019s lien as a defense. This was a good defense to the extent of the amount due and payable to them on the delivery of the material which they had finished, at all events, and the judgment for the plaintiffs was erroneous. An artisan\u2019s lien is lost where the material or object on which the work is to be done is by the contract to be delivered before payment and credit given. Morgan v. Congdon, 4 N. Y. 552; Blumenberg Press v. Mutual Mer. Agency. 177 N. Y. 362, 69 N. E. 641. But that is not this case in respect of the 50 per cent, to be paid on delivery. It is the contract which determines ; and mere delivery of a part without payment does not affect the lien on the goods still in hand where the contract was for payment on delivery. Cases supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.
