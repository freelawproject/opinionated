That the suit was dismissed as against the connecting carrier, the plaintiffs being seemingly not unwilling, is of no concern of the defendant appellant, which, as the initial carrier, on September 4, 1906, received a case of goods for transporta-\u2019 tian from this to a distant state and under the provisions of the act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584 (U. S. Comp. St. Supp. 1907, p. 892), amendatory of Interstate Commerce Act, Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>104, 24 Stat. 379 (U. S. Comp. St 1901, p. 3154), was bound to issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor, and whose liability to the lawful holder thereof is expressly determined by the act. That it issued a bill of lading with exemption clause, construed by counsel into a contract, because accepted by the shipper, was and is of no avail, as that was civilly illicit under the pre-existing federal statute, providing that :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-5\">\u201cNo contract, receipt, rule or regulation shall exempt such common carrier, railroad or transportation company from the liability hereby imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Proof there was, and sufficient, of unreasonable delay to justify the verdict in favor of the plaintiffs and of damage to the amount found by the jury, not to be diminished by or in consequence of a statement put upon the record by counsel for the railway company, even with the consent of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, \u201cthat on the 26th of December,\u201d of what year does not appear, \u201cthe goods in question were sold for $163.28 at Jacksonville, Fla., by the Seaboard Air Line Railway\u201d; it not appearing that such sale was by or with the consent of, or upon notice to, the plaintiffs herein. The judgment must therefore be affirmed, leaving the defendant appellant to its right and remedy, if any, against the connecting carrier, to which it claims it made delivery of the case of goods in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
