(25%) of such collection, and in event that the judgment should not be collected * * * no compensation for his services except actual cash disbursements\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-20\">\u2014the plaintiff, a lawyer, undertook to prove his employment, the judgment, and recovery of the proceeds. His evidence did show reduction to judgment in 1902. It did not show his own, but the employment of Mr. Gorham, another lawyer, of whom, in a letter to the defendant, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-21\">\u201cI represented Mr. Gorham, who did not, for reasons of importance at that time, desire to be the attorney of record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-22\">Nor did it show any recovery of the proceeds by either the attorney employed or his representative. In fact, the evidence was that, after both had failed to get anything out of the judgment debtor, they acknowledged failure by Mr. Gorham\u2019s taking the disbursements ($6.70) and returning the notes of the defendant, who a couple of years later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>collected the money, or some money, without the lawyer\u2019s assistance. The plaintiff thereupon resting his case, the defendant\u2019s counsel made a motion for dismissal of the complaint, which motion was properly granted by the learned justice, who, however, added a direction of a verdict, which he might not do on the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The judgment should be modified, by eliminating the direction of a verdict, and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
