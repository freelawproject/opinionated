It is conceded that -an examination before trial, should be had, but contended that it should be limited to proof of the transactions had with persons so introduced and the commissions earned thereon. The defendant should not be examined to prove the contract or to show the persons introduced, it is claimed, for the reason that the plaintiff must have personal knowledge thereof and can t\u00e9stify to it himself on the trial. That a party has other evidence on an issue is not a reason for refusing to allow him to examine his adversary on the issue. On the contrary, such examination may avoid the necessity of calling, witnesses. It might seem that due regard for recent decisions would deter the taking of appeals like this. Shonts v.
