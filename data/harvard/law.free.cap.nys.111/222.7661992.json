A judgment of condemnation having been entered and commissioners appointed to ascertain the damage, such proceedings were had that said commissioners made and filed a final report awarding damages to the defendants William J. Morris and Catherine G. Morris, his wife; the other defendants having executed releases to the plaintiff. A motion made by plaintiff for a confirmation of the report was denied, and an order made remitting the matter to new commissioners to ascertain the damages to be paid to the defendants. From that order the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">The respondent strenuously insists that the order is not appealable.. The contrary has been distinctly held. Man. Ry. Co. v. O\u2019Sullivan, 6 App. Div. 571, 40 N. Y. Supp. 326, affirmed on opinion below 150 N. Y. 569, 44 N. E. 1125; Erie R. R. Co. v. Steward, 59 App. Div. 1891, 69 N. Y. Supp. 187. The question of appealability decided in the Willis Avenue Bridge Case, 111 App. Div. 285, 97 N. Y. Supp. 503, Id., 185 N. Y. 391, 78 N. E. 146, arose under the street opening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>provisions of the New York City Charter, and not under the condemnation provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Two reasons are assigned' by the respondent why the order refusing to confirm the report is right, and should be affirmed. It is said that the commissioners arrived at their award by off-setting benefits against damages, and this is said to have been erroneous. This contention is based upon the fact that evidence.was admitted tending to show that the erection and maintenance of the stairway would be of benefit to the abutting property. Section 3370, Code Civ. Proc., provides that in fixing the amount of compensation to be paid by the condemnor the commissioners shall not make \u201cany allowance or deduction on account of any real or supposed benefits which the owners may derive from the public use for which the property is to be taken, or the construction of any proposed improvement connected with such public use,\u201d and both the general railway law (chapter 140, p. 211, Laws 1850) and the rapid transit act (section 20, c. 606, p. 745, Laws 1875) contain similar provisions. Where actual, tangible property is taken, these rules are applicable, and the award for the property taken cannot be decreased by off-setting the supposed enhancement of value to other property not taken. Matter of the Mayor, etc., 190 N. Y. 350, 83 N. E. 299. What is sought to be condemned in the present case, however, is not actual, tangible real estate, but easements appurtenant to the defendant\u2019s real property, and the damages to be awarded to the owner of the real property are in the nature of consequential damages. The award to the owner of the real property thus affected, but not taken, is measured, not by the supposed value of the easement in the street separate from the abutting property, but by the damages which the abutting property sustains as a result or consequence of the loss of the easement. As was said in Newman v. Met. El. Ry. Co., 118 N. Y. 618, 23 N. E. 901, 7 L. R. A. 289:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">\u201cThe special and peculiar advantages which property receives from the construction and operation of the road and the location of stations are elements which enter largely into the inquiry whether there is injury or not, and the jury must consider them, and give them due weight in their verdict. Between the rule and the statutory provisions quoted there is no conflict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">To the same effect are South Buffalo Railway Co. v. Kirkover, 176 N. Y. 301, 68 N. E. 366, and Bohm v. Met. EL Ry. Co., 129 N. Y. 576, 29 N. E. 802, 14 L. R. A. 344. In the latter case it is pointed out that where the question involved is the deprivation of easements it is not really a matter of setting off benefits against damage, but that that proof of benefit bears directly upon the question of damage. And in the very latest authority upon the subject (Matter of the Mayor, etc., 190 N. Y. 360, 83 N. E. 350), the propriety of considering benefits where the only question is the extinguishment of easements is distinctly recognized. The commissioners made no error, therefore, in admitting proof of possible benefit to the abutting property.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">It is also assigned as error that the commissioners excluded proof of what the plaintiff has paid to other persons owning interests in the abutting property in consideration of their releases of the easements in so far as their interests were affected by their extinguishment. The general rule is well established that a party may not es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>tablish the value of his own land by showing what was paid for another parcel similarly situated.u Huntington v. Attrill, 118 N. Y. 365, 23 N. E. 544; Matter of Thompson, 127 N. Y. 463, 28 N. E. 389, 14 L. R. A. 52; Jamieson v. Kings County El. Ry., 147 N. Y. 322, 41 N. E. 693; Whitmark v. N Y El. R. R. Co., 149 N. Y 393, 44 N. E. 78; Eno v. N. Y. El. R. R. Co., 158 N. Y. 730, 53 N. E. 1125. An exception to this rule has been admitted where the difficulty of otherwise proving value is very great, and the other property is so similar in kind and character to that to be acquired that the evidence is reasonably satisfactory. Langdon v. Mayor, 133 N. Y. 628, 31 N E. 98. Here the property to be acquired by the plaintiff from the defendant is similar in character to that released to it by the other defendants, but the question before the commissioners was not as to the abstract value of the easement independent of the estate to which it is appurtenant, but the loss in the value of that estate by the deprivation of the easement. In order that evidence of the amount paid to other persons for the extinguishment of the easement should be relevant and competent as to the amount of injury to be .suffered by defendant, it would be necessary that it should appear, not only that the easement to be extinguished was the same, but that the estates to be affected were so similar as to afford a basis of comparison. This does not appear in the present case. The buildings affected are known as Nos. 31 and 33 Third avenue. The defendant Morris owns No. 31 in fee, and holds a ground lease of No. 33, subject to renewals at the option of the landlord. He also owns the building on No. 33. The defendant Stuyvesant owns the fee of No. 33, subject to the lease to defendant Morris. The defendant Gaffney holds a lease of No. 31 expiring in 1900, and the defendant Brown is a sublessee under defendant of No. 33. We consider that the extent and quality of these various estates in the abutting property differ so radically from the extent and quality of defendant\u2019s estates therein that the evidence offered would have been of no value in determining the question of value which the commissioners were called upon to determine. It might not have been reversible error to have received the evidence, but it certainly was not such error to reject it. Matter of Thompson, supra We find no legal error in the proceedings of the commissioners and no apparent inadequacy in the amount of their award.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The order appealed from will therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to confirm the final order granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
