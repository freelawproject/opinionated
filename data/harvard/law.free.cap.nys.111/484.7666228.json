The plaintiffs claim for the value of the services $65, and the defendant alleges that the price agreed upon was $20, conditioned upon the acceptance of the plans by the tenement house department. The case would present the usual conflict of evidence,, with enough to support the judgment, except for the fact that there is no evidence in the case to support the full amount of the judgment. The plaintiffs claimed $50 as the value of the services. Upon the trial one of the plaintiffs testified that the fair value of the services was $50. At this point plaintiffs\u2019 counsel moved to amend the complaint to allege the value of the services at $65, and the amendment was ordered without objection, but there was no change in the evidence to meet this amended complaint. The result is that, while the plaintiffs have fairly established their claim, there is no evidence to support it above the sum of $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">Under the authority of section 310 .of the Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, p. 1578, c. 580), we are authorized to affirm, reverse, or modify the judgment, and we-are of opinion that the judgment should be reversed, unless the plaintiff is- willing to stipulate that the recovery shall be limited to $50 and costs, in which event it should be affirm'ed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
