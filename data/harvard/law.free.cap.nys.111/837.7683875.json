There are also technical defects in the moving papers. However, the appellate court is reluctant to deprive defendant of its day in court by affirming the order denying defendant\u2019s motion to open its default. Somewhat heavy terms, nevertheless, must be imposed as a condition for opening the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">The order is reversed without costs, and the motion granted, on payment by defendant to plaintiff of all costs in the case to date and the giving of an undertaking in the amount of $70 to secure plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
