Section 548 provides that it is a sufficient defense that the property was appropriated openly under a claim of title preferred in good faith, but that the section shall not excuse the retention of the property of another to pay demands held against him. An employ\u00e9 collected over $900 for his employer, and deducted therefrom over $400, which he claimed was for arrears of salary and expenses and a certain other item, and sent his check to the employer for the balance, with a statement showing how it was arrived at. <em>Held, </em>that where the employer owed less than $100, and the claim of the employ\u00e9 was made with intent to avoid payment of certain sums due, the employ\u00e9 was guilty of larceny under the Code, for the appropriation was not under a claim of title, but under a claim of indebtedness, and was not made in good faith.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b108-8\">fEd.

It was issued on the employment of one Connolly as a commercial salesman by the plaintiff, and was an agreement to indemnify the plaintiff for any pecuniary loss the plaintiff should sustain by any \u201cfraud or dishonesty\u201d of the said Connolly in his employment which should amount \u201cto embezzlement or larceny.\u201d His employment required him to make collections on his sales and remit the same to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-14\">The employment was terminated in July, 1903. In June the employ\u00e9 had made collections in Connecticut for goods sold by him in that state amounting to $960.31. In terminating his employment he deducted therefrom $464.33, which he claimed was for arrears of his salary and expenses, and $38.12 for another item, and sent his check to the plaintiff for the balance, $457.86, with a statement showing how it was arrived at, as stated above. This action was brought to recover the sum of $502.45 thus retained, and the complaint alleges a larceny of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-15\">The referee before whom the case was tried found that the plaintiff did not.owe the said employ\u00e9 the amount he so retained, but only $95.05, and that his claim that it was owing to him was not made in good faith, but with intent to avoid payment to the plaintiff of certain sums he owed it.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b108-16\">Argued before WOODWARD, HOOKER, GAYNOR, RICH, and MILLER, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-17\">John A.

Section 528 of our Penal Code makes it larceny for an agent or servant to appropriate to his own use any money or property which he has in his possession as such agent or servant, \u201cwith intent to deprive or defraud the true owner of his property or of the use or benefit thereof.\u201d Section 548 provides that it is a sufficient defence that the \u201cproperty\u201d was \u201cappropriated openly and avowedly under a claim of title preferred in good faith, even though such claim is untenable.\u201d But the referee found on sufficient evidence that the appropriation in this case was in bad faith. Moreover, such appropriation did not come under this latter provision. The money was not appropriated under a claim of title, but under a claim of indebtedness by the plaintiff to the agent; and it is provided by the last sentence of this same section, that the said section \u201cshall not excuse the retention of the property of another to offset or pay demands held against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The claim that the question of larceny should be determined under the laws of Connecticut, where the money was collected and misappropriated, is not tenable, the contract of insurance having been made and delivered in this state to the plaintiff, a resident thereof. The contract was not a roving one but intended the laws of this state. Grand v. Livingston, 4 App. Div. 589, 38 N. Y. Supp. 490; Id., 158 N. Y. 688, 53 N. E. 1125; Fidelity Co. v.
