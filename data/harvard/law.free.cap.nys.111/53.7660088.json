Postal Telegraph Cable Co., 120 App. Div. 433, 104 N. Y. Supp. 1016. A telegram was sent to plaintiff from Brooklyn by Provost Bros. Company, his brokers, on ,August 5, 1903, requiring an additional margin of $2,000 and giving notice that if the same was not sent immediately the stock purchased for him would be sold to protect the senders. It was an unrepeated message, written upon the general blank of the company, containing the same stipulations and conditions that were contained in the telegram considered in the- Halsted Case, and was written at the office of the senders by their acting cashier. When delivered to the defendant for transmission it was addressed to \u201cH. J. Monsees, Unger Cliff Hotel, Mt. Kisco, New York.\u201d It reached Mount Kisco addressed to \u201cH. J. Monse, Unger Cliff Hotel,\u201d and was not delivered to plaintiff until August 7th, when he went to the office of the defendant and called for the telegram, which was delivered to him. His stock was sold by his brokers on August 6th, resulting in an alleged loss to plaintiff of his entire margins, amounting to $4,300, $450 of which he has recovered in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">The negligence alleged in the complaint is the improper transmission and the delay in delivering the message. The principle decided in Halsted v. Postal Telegraph Cable Co., supra, is applicable to nondelivery, or delay in delivery, as well as to an error in language in transmission. It has been followed by this court in Bates v. Weir, 121 App. Div. 275, 105 N. Y. Supp. 785, and by the Appellate Term in Addoms v. Weir, 56 Misc. Rep. 487, 108 N. Y. Supp. 146, and is in accord with the views of the Court of Appeals as expressed in Kiley v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 109 N. Y. 231, 16 N. E. 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur; MILLER, J., in result, being of the opinion that the contract would not relieve from liability for nondelivery or delay in delivery, unless such nondelivery or delay were caused by an error in transmission.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
