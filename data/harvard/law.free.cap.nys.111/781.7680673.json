On the night of November 11, 1907, the plaintiff, walking up Third avenue, came into collision with a man who was being thrown from Keith &amp; Proctor\u2019s Theater. It is claimed that the man who was being thrown from the theater was intoxicated, and was being ejected by an employ\u00e9 of the defendant because he had created a disturbance in the theater.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">The plaintiff offered evidence of a conversation had with the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9 after the accident. This conversation contained an admission as to the employ\u00e9\u2019s negligence. It was received over the objection and subject to the exception of the defendant. The conversation which was admitted was not part of the res gestee, nor was there any evidence to show that the employ\u00e9 making the admission had any authority to bind the defendant. The admission of this testimony constituted error prejudicial to this defendant, and necessitates the reversal of this judgment. Cobb v. U. S. Engineering Co., 191 N. Y. 481, 84 N. E. 395; Gradner v. Schenectady Ry. Co., 113 App. Div. 133, 98 N. Y. Supp. 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
