Parker, 111 N. Y. 259, 262, 18 N. E. 727, 728. The submission of the reasonableness of delay was, therefore, proper. As failure or temporary delay was found by the jury not unreasonable, so it was not necessarily a refusal to proceed, and the right of the defendant to recover upon his counterclaim to an amount justified by the evidence adduced followed as of course. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">GIEDERSEEEVE, P. J., concurs.
