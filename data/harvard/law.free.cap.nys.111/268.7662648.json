On April 15, 1904, the plaintiff made a contract with Bradley for the purchase of realty in consideration of $2,400, payable in installments and by the execution of a purchase-money mortgage. Pursuant to this contract the plaintiff took possession of the premises under an agreement embodied in the contract to pay as rent therefor both interest upon the amount of the purchase price remaining unpaid and the taxes and assessments. That contract was extant on October 7, 1905, when the plaintiff was sent to the penitentiary for six months. On November 22, 1905, the plaintiff executed a writing whereby, in consideration of the sum of $1, he agreed to sell, assign, transfer, and set over to the defendants (his uncle and cousin, respectively) all his right, title, and interest in the Bradley contract. This writing provided that the said defendants were to make all payments under the terms of said contract, that the plaintiff should have a period of six months after his release from the penitentiary to reimburse them for such advances, and in case of his failure to do so the title to the property should become vested in the defendants. On April 17, 1906, the plaintiff and the defendants executed a certain agreement in writing with Kosstrin, whereby they assigned and sold all their right, title, and interest in and to the Bradley contract, and whereby it was provided that Kosstrin was to take the agreement as of April 16, 1906, the adjustments of rents, interest, and insurance to be made at that time, that Kosstrin was to pay the taxes for 1905, and in addition thereto the sum of $2,900, less $100 paid at the time of the signing, and less any or all amounts which at the time of the closing should be due the said Bradley or should be a lien on the said premises. The writing provided that the closing or time of final payment should be on the 16'th day of May, 1906, and .that the plaintiff \u201cconsents to this agreement and ratifies the same, and waives his right to redeem from the said Pasquale Patrono and Joseph Patrono\u201d (the defendants in this case). On May 9, 1906, the said Kosstrin and the defendants executed a writing whereby, in consideration of the sum of $225 paid b)r defendants to Kosstrin, Kosstrin \u201creleases the said Pasquale Patrono and Joseph Patrono\u201d (these defendants) \u201cfrom all the terms of an agreement between these parties made the 17th day of April, 1906, and reassigns to the said Pasquale Patrono and Joseph Patrono\u201d (these defendants) \u201call their rights under the foregoing annexed agreement, dated the 15th day of April, 1904, between Andrew R. Bradley and Pasquale Patrono\u201d (this plaintiff), \u201cwhich was assigned to them on the 22nd day of -November, 1905. The said $225 includes $100 paid by the said Max Kosstrin to the said Pasquale Patrono and Joseph Patrono.\u201d This action is to compel a reassignment to the plaintiff by the defendants of the Bradley contract; the plaintiff asking to redeem the contract and have an accounting of the rents collected by the defendants and the disbursements made to keep the Bradley contract alive and to preserve the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">I am of opinion that the findings of the Special Term are supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>by the evidence, that the conclusion of the Special Term is right, and that the judgment must be affirmed. Perforce of the Bradley contract the plaintiff was the equitable owner of the premises (Hays\u2019 Adm\u2019r v. Miller, 6 Hun, 320-326, affirmed 70 N. Y. 112-118; Rood v. N. Y. &amp; Erie R. R. Co., 18 Barb. 80; Moore v. Burrows, 34 Barb. 173), and his agreement with the defendants is regarded as an equitable mortgage (Brayton v. Jones, 5 Wis. 117; Northrup v. Cross, Selden\u2019s Notes, 111; Gamble v. Ross, 88 Mich. 315-330, 50 N. W. 379; Meigs v. McFarlan, 72 Mich. 194, 40 N. W. 246). The first contract with Kosstrin contemplated Kosstrin\u2019s performance of his obligation, and plaintiff\u2019s waiver therein was conditional upon that performance. But Kosstrin did not perform. He did not even undertake by that writing of May 9th to assign his contract to the defendants; for in the first place the purpose as expressed therein is cancellation of that contract, and in the second place he only undertook to \u201creassign\u201d to the defendants their rights under the contract of the plaintiff with Bradley, as assigned to them by the plaintiff on November 22, 1905. So far as the defendants are concerned, their rights as to these premises are expressed exclusively in and limited exclusively by the assignment to them by the plaintiff. As against the plaintiff they gain nothing from Kosstrin. As to the plaintiff, although he was not a party to the agreement of Kosstrin and the defendants of May 9, 1908, nevertheless he has elected by his present action to affirm the cancellation of Kosstrin, inasmuch as this action rests upon the plaintiff\u2019s assertion of his equitable ownership of the premises. In fine, the dealings with Kosstrin are of no moment, so far as the relative rights of these parties in the premises are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
