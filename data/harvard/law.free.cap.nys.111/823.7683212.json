The case on appeal discloses no such order, although a motion seems to have been made and denied. We are therefore confined to a' consideration of the exceptions taken during the progress of the trial. Many of them relate to the exclusion of evidence which was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The exception to the denial of defendant\u2019s motion, at the close of the testimony, to dismiss the complaint, requires, however, some consideration. The action is against the administrator of the estate of Martin Brennan, deceased, and its nature is best disclosed by the first paragraph of the complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-6\">\u201cThat on or about and between February 1, 1904, and June 1, 1906, plaintiff rendered services to Martin Brennan, deceased, at his special instance and request, in caring for and providing a home for Irene Sutters, an infant, and paid out and expended money at the request of said Martin Brennan, deceased, in purchasing food, clothing, books, and other necessaries for said infant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">From this and the following clause of the complaint it is clear that the plaintiff\u2019s claim covers both her own services in caring for the infant and moneys actually paid out and expended by her in behalf of said infant; and, in view of the rather large sum which she claims, it is evident that the item of moneys expended constituted no small part of the claim. At the close of the testimony defendant\u2019s counsel moved to dismss the complaint for failure of proof as to the items of dafnage claimed, and this motion was denied. The only evidence as to value was that given by plaintiff herself, who was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-8\">\u201cFrom the time Irene went to your house to live, up to the time of Mr. Brennan\u2019s death, considering the care that you bestowed upon her, the expense that she was to you, what you paid out for her, the care of her food, clothing, and all that, what would be the reasonable value of the services rendered and the expenses\u2014how much per week?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">To which she replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-10\">\u201cWell, I think I have\u2014 If you want to have a good education,( I think $9 to $10 would not be too much. Then she must go to school; $9 'to $10 I thought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Upon cross-examination it appeared that the witness had kept no account, and was quite unable to give any idea as to th\u00e9 amount, of her expenditures; and since the amount of such expenditures constituted an important element of her claim, and of the question which elicited her estimate, it is quite apparent that her answer was without value in establishing the amount for which a verdict should be rendered in her favor. As there was no other evidence upon that subject, there was not sufficient evidence to submit to the jury on the question of value, and the motion to dismiss should have been granted for lack of proof. The proof of the contract upon which plaintiff sues consists of the evidence of a number of witnesses, who testify that at different times they heard Brennan say that if plaintiff would care for the child he would pay what was necessary; but none of them testify to any definite sum which he agreed to pay. The plaintiff\u2019s claim, therefore, so far as concerns the question of the amount to be recovered, must rest upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>satisfactory proof, both of the value of her own services and of the amount she has been required to pay out. Such proof need not be exact to a dollar, but should be sufficiently definite to enable the jury to render an intelligent verdict. Of such proof there is none in the_ case.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The judgment and order must therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">INGRAHAM, McLAUGHLIN, and CLARKE, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b857-7\">HOUGHTON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aoef\">I dissent, on the ground that there was some proof of value, and hence, as matter of law, the defendant was not entitled to a dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
