Personal Property Law, Laws 1897, p. 510, c. 417, \u00a7 21. A motion for dismissal made on this ground at the outset of the trial was denied indulgently, and the plaintiff was given an opportunity to prove the case, if he had one, which he had not. The evidence showing that, even when told to deliver the goods and get his money, he with objurgation refused to follow the common course, may indicate the motive of the defendant for relying upon the law which, with or without motive, he, having pleaded the statute, had a right to do, whatever the criticism of counsel. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">Judgment reversed, with costs to defendant (appellant).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b716-15\">GILDERSLEEVE, P.

The defendant having pleaded the statute of frauds, and the evidence in the case showing that the agreed price of the merchandise, to recover for which this action was brought, was more than the sum of $50, and the agreement to purchase having been oral, and no portion of the purchase price paid or any part of the goods delivered, the plaintiff failed to sustain his cause of action, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
