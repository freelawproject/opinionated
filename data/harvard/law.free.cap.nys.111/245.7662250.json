That she was correct in her assumption appears from the record, as the plaintiff was permitted to amend the summons by inserting the name of \u201cRose\u201d therein in place of the one of \u201cJacob,\u201d and entering a judgment against \u201cRose.\u201d This affidavit was not disputed; the plaintiff claiming that the court below had no jurisdiction to vacate a judgment, for the reason of nonservice of process, and that the only remedy of a defendant in such a case was by appeal under section 311 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1578, c. 580). The court below denied the -motion, evidently adopting the view urged by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. In the case of Friedberger v. Stulpnagel, 112 N. Y. Supp. 89, decided by the April term of this court, the right of the Municipal Court or a justice thereof to vacate a judgment absolutely is passed upon, and there decided that the Municipal Court act as at present constituted confers no such power. Under the general prayer for relief asked for in the moving papers herein the court should have vacated the judgment and set the case down for pleading. See Raymond v. Keiley (decided at the present term of this court) 111 N. Y. Supp. 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Order modified, by directing that defendant\u2019s default be opened, the judgment vacated, and the case set down for pleading, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs on this appeal to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">DAYTON, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
