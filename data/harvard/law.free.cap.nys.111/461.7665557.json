The policy is by its terms payable to the \u201cexecutors, administrators or assigns of the insured.\u201d The paper produced to prove the assignment was found in the desk of the deceased after his death. There was no evidence that it or the policy was ever delivered to Henderson. Nor was it an assignment of the policy; it was only a direction of the deceased to the insurance company to pay the amount of the policy to Henderson if he should survive him.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-17\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-18\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.
