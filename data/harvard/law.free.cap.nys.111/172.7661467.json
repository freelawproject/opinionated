In conducting its business the plaintiff kept books showing resulting profit or loss, and these books defendant asked to be permitted to inspect. The defendant denies the wrongful eviction, or that any damage resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">The books of the plaintiff will show whether the hotel business was profitable or not, and, if profitable,' to what extent plaintiff suffered damage from its eviction. Damages being claimed and denied, their amount is a material issue in the case. Section 803 of the Code of Civil Procedure permits an inspection of the books or papers of an adverse party \u201crelating to the merits of the action, or of the defense therein.\u201d A right of inspection of books and papers is thus expressly given by the Code to a defendant where they affect the merits of the defense, and this defense need not necessarily be an affirmative one. Such inspection may greatly facilitate the trial and relieve the court from much detail, as well as apprise the parties so they meet the particular dispute involved, and should be granted where a proper case is disclosed.

Supp. 111; Edmonds v. Attucks, 117 App. Div. 486, 102 N. Y. Supp. 636. We think the defendant showed facts entitling it to the inspection asked for.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">The order should be reversed, with-$10 costs and disbursements, \u25a0and the motion granted, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
