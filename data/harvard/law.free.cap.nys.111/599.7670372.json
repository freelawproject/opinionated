The plaintiff\u2019s claim is that the boat was carrying a consignment of coal to the defendant, and that the boat was damaged by the negligent use of the \u201cdigger\u201d employed by the defendant in unloading the boat. The defendant pleaded a general denial. One of the issues raised by the pleadings related to whether or not the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s unloaded the boat. The evidence of the plaintiff upon this point was indefinite and inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">The defendant attempted to prove that the coal had been consigned to the Jurgen Rathjen Company, and that its employ\u00e9s unloaded the boat. The trial court excluded this evidence, upon the ground that these facts could not be proved under a general denial. In this ruling the learned trial justice erred. The plaintiff\u2019s contention being that the employ\u00e9s of the defendant caused the damage to his boat, it was competent for the defendant under a general denial to prove that the damage complained of was caused by others, for whose acts the defendant was not responsible.

A. 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">The judgment appealed from is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
