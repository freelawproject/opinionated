The plaintiff proved title and damages. Thte defendant then showed that more than 20 years prior to the commencement of the action the defendant entered upon the street under a charter from the rapid transit commission and under the acts of the Legislature and of the municipality of the former city of Brooklyn. This raised the presumption that defendants\u2019 predecessors entered lawfully under a deed which has been lost. To refute this presumption, the plaintiff introduced, over the objection and exception of the defendants, a lis pendens and petition in condemnation proceedings, by which one of the defendants\u2019 predecessors sought to acquire title to real estate or <em>a </em>right of way in front of the premises in question, and also a judgment of condemnation and an order appointing commissioners in those proceedings, in which the property in question was described. These proceedings were instituted about five years after the erection of the elevated structure and the commencement of the operation of trains thereupon; the judgment of condemnation and order appointing commissioners was entered seven months thereafter. We find here a solemn declaration by one of the defendants\u2019 predecessors that it had not been able to acquire title to the privilege, easement, or interest- required for the erection and maintenance of its elevated structure, that it had offered the owner of the premises in question a sum of money -for the purchase of this right, but that he would not sell. In addition to this, it seems that the condemnation proceeding itself, in which the court doubtless acquired jurisdiction upon the filing of the lis pendens and petition, was necessarily a solemn and formal declaration of record that the title of this property was in some one other than the railroad company. These declarations, it seems to me, were in absolute inconsistency with a claim of entry by right or under color of some title, and were competent and material upon this proposition. But slight evidence to overcome title by description is required. Colvin v. Burnet, 17 Wend. (N. Y.) 564, 568; Kellum v. Mission of Immaculate Virgin, 82 App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Div. 523, 81 N. Y. Supp. 603; Cutting v. Burns, 57 App. Div. 185, 68 N. Y. Supp. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The petitions to the state board of tax commissioners which were admitted in evidence in Hindley v. Manhattan Ry. Co., 185 N. Y. 335, 345, 78 N. E. 276, are not in the same category at all;_ and, further, in that case the petition was made when the prescription had, after the 20-year period, ripened into an estate. In our opinion the learned trial court was justified in finding as a fact from this evidence that defendants and their predecessors were not during the prescriptive period challenging the right of the true owner, and hence there was nothing upon which to found title by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The plaintiff also proved that since the original entry the defendants had increased the length of their trains, their number, had changed the method of operation of their road from steam to electricity, and, as an incident thereto, had laid a third rail and built a walk by the side of the structure. This, however, is not such an increase in the user or change of the character of that user as to be deemed an abandonment of any right acquired under the original entry. Bremer v. Manhattan Ry. Co., 191 N. Y. 333, 84 N. E. 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
