He had already testified to the sum of $45 for medicines and medical services, as he testified to an absence of five weeks from business. In the charge to the jury the court, among other things, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>\u201cIf you do find for him, you must not find any less than the sum of $170, the amount that is figured up already; and you can award him damages for pain and suffering for any amount additional, from $1 up to $330.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Exception was taken thereto by the defendant. There being no evidence of the cost of rent or of the amount of capital invested, the evidence of the amount of loss of profits is too speculative and conjectural. The evidence disclosed related to profits, not to the value of the personal services of the plaintiff, and so was improperly received and assumed. The judgment should therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
