The sole question presented by the appeal is whether the plaintiff was justified in refusing to take title.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">One of the deeds in the defendant\u2019s chain of title was executed by John C. Sch\u00fctz and Wilhelmina Sch\u00fctz to the People\u2019s Realty Company, dated February 6, 1899, and recorded in the office of the register of Kings county February 7, 1899. The names of the grantors were properly spelled in the deed, and it is undisputed that both signed the deed. The certificate of acknowledgment is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">\u2018\u2018State of New York, County of Kings\u2014ss.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">\u201cOn this 6th day of February, in the year 1899, before me personally came John C. Schultz and Wilhelmina Schultz, his wife, to me known and known to me to be the individuals described in and who executed the foregoing instrument, and they thereupon severally duly acknowledged to me that they executed the same. John B. Reitz,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">\u201cNotary Public, Kings Co., New York.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">The plaintiff contends that the mistake of the notary in inserting the letter \u201c1\u201d in the names of each vitiates the certificate of acknowledgment and creates such a doubt as to make the title unmarketable. The said John C. Sch\u00fctz is willing to execute and acknowledge another deed; but his wife, Wilhelmina, is unable to do so, because she is insane. I think the names are idem sonans. Certainly \u201cSch\u00fctz\u201d and \u201cSchultz\u201d are as near alike as \u201cJetta\u201d and \u201cJetter\u201d (Sporza v. German Savings Bank, 119 App. Div. 172, 104 N. Y. Supp. 260), \u201cMinner\u201d and \u201cMiner\u201d (Jackson v. Boneham, 15 Johns. 226), \u201cPatterson\u201d and \u201cPetterson\u201d (Jackson v. Cody, 9 Cow. 140), or \u201cStorrs\u201d and \u201cStores\u201d (People v. Sutherland, 81 N. Y 1). A scholar might recognize the umlaut in the German name \u201cSch\u00fctz,\u201d but it is doubtful if a man of ordinary education would; and the names \u201cSch\u00fctz\u201d and \u201cSchultz,\u201d by giving the same sound to the vowel, might easily be pronounced so nearly alike that the ear would detect no difference. Doubtless the notary thought that the name was spelled with .an \u201c1\u201d from hearing it pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">But, if there can be any doubt about this, the title was still marketable. \u201cAn acknowledgment must not be taken by any officer unless he knows, or has satisfactory evidence, that the person making it is the person described in and who executed such instrument.\u201d Real Property Law, Laws 1896, p. 610, c. 547, \u00a7 252. In this case the notary has certified that the persons whose acknowledgments he took were known to him to be the individuals described in and who executed the deed. I do not think it is even necessary to resort to paroi proof, as the deed and certificate of acknowledgment furnish sufficient internal evidence that the deed was executed by the said John C. Sch\u00fctz and wife, who concededly were the owners of the property at the time.' The title was marketable, and the plaintiff should have accepted it. Hellreigel v. Manning, 97 N. Y. 56; Hutton v.
