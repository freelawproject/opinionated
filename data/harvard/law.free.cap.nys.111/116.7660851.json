To this complaint the defendant demurred, upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the action and that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. That demurrer was overruled; and, from the judgment overruling the demurrer, the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The administrators having accounted, their duties were at an end and nothing remained, except to distribute the estate according to the decree of the surrogate.' There is nothing in sections 2706 and 2707 of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides for a summary proceeding before the surrogate and to compel a person possessed of the property of an intestate to account in the Surrogate\u2019s Court that affects the right to maintain an action on the decree of the surrogate. The action is based upon the decree of the surrogate, and to enforce the provision of that decree which adjudged that the defendant pay to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate a sum of money. The Surrogate\u2019s Court had jurisdiction to render such decree, it had the parties before it, and it has been adjudged that the defendant as administrator pay to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate a sum of money. Section 1913 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not apply because the prohibition in that section depends only upon an action between the original parties to the judgment, and an action brought by the personal representatives of the deceased person in whose favor a judgment has been rendered is not between the original parties to the judgment. It was held under section 71 of the Code of Procedure, where the phrase was \u201cthe same parties,\u201d that an administrator of a deceased judgment creditor was not within the meaning of that phrase; and certainly if the plaintiff, who seeks to enforce a judgment obtained in favor of his intestate, is not the same party to the action in which his testator recovered a judgment, he is not the original party to the judgment. Smith v. Britton, 2 Thompson &amp; Cook 498, affirming 45 How. Prac. 428. It was also decided in that case that the mere fact that the personal representative of a deceased judgment creditor could issue execution and collect the judgment was not a bar to his maintaining an action upon the judgment, and that case does not seem to have been questioned. The plaintiff in this case sets up all the facts essential to maintain an action upon the surrogate\u2019s decree. It is not between the original parties, so it was not necessary to obtain the leave of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>before commencing the action, and I can see no legal objection to maintaining it. In fact, it would seem to be expressly authorized by section 1819 of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-3\">\u2018Tf, after' the expiration of one year from the granting of letters testamentary, or letters of administration, an executor or administrator refuses upon demand, to pay a legacy, or distributive share, the person entitled thereto may maintain such an action against him as the case requires. But for the purpose of computing the* time within which such an action must be commenced, the cause of action is deemed to accrue when the executor\u2019s or administrator\u2019s account is judicially settled, and not before.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Since the plaintiff could enforce the decree under sections 3554 and 3555 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is impossible to see why this action was. necessary as the plaintiff would have a much more summary and efficient remedy to enforce the decree than by an action in the Supreme Court. But, as the plaintiff has the legal right to sue and the complaint alleges facts necessary to sustain a cause of action, it necessarily follows that the demurrer was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs, with leave to the defendant to withdraw the demurrer within 30 days on the payment of costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">CLARKE and SCOTT, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b151-7\">HOUGHTON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AA2\">I dissent on the ground that the complaint discloses that the plaintiff has a complete remedy at law by issuing an execution on the surrogate\u2019s decree, and enforcement of payment in that court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b151-8\">LAUGHLIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYt\">(dissenting). The plaintiff has only limited letters of administration issued pursuant to the provisions of section 3664 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the cause of action on the decree never vested in her under such letters. Kirwin v. Malone, 45 App. Div. 93-100, 61 N. Y. Supp. 844. I am therefore of opinion that the action cannot be maintained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
