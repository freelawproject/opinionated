Oppenheimer (decided at the present term) 111 N. Y. Supp. 609, it is clear that the defendant herein had no right either to a stay of proceedings- or a dismissal of the action by reason of the failure of the plaintiff to pay the costs entered in a judgment against him in a prior action. It also appears from the record that, after the court refused the defendant\u2019s motion to grant a stay or to dismiss the action, the defendant withdrew from further participation in the trial, and the plaintiff took an inquest, and thereupon entered a judgment. Such judgment was, therefore, one taken by default, and from such a judgment no appeal lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Appeal dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
