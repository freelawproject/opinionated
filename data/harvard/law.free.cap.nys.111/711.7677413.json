For a second defense the defendants alleged that prior to the 1st of November, 1907, the premises became untenantable and they were evicted by the building department, under an order of the Supreme Court condemning the building as unsafe. Judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants, and 'therefrom the plaintiff brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">Notwithstanding the assignment by the defendants of the lease herein, even with the consent of the landlord, and the acceptance thereafter of rent from the firm of Schwartz, Freed &amp; Speyer, the defendant still remained liable upon their express covenant to pay rent (Ranger v. Bacon, 3 Misc. Rep. 95, 22 N. Y. Supp. 551; Wallace v. Dinniny, 11 Misc. Rep. 317, 319, 32 N. Y. Supp. 159); there being no evidence herein of a determination of their estate upon a sufficient consideration or by the re-entry of their landlord. Upon their express covenant to comply with the orders of the city government they may not claim eviction, and so no liability (Markham v. Stevenson Brewing Co., 104 App. Div. 420, 93 N. Y. Supp. 684); nor may they claim surrender and acceptance by leaving the keys with the stenographer in the office of the plaintiff, so as to defeat the claim of the plaintiff, because the claim for rent was due and owing upwards of two weeks prior to either alleged eviction or surrender and acceptance (Cheesebrough v. Lieber, 18 Misc. Rep. 459, 42 N. Y. Supp. 1122; Stern v. Murphy [Sup.] 102 N. Y. Supp. 797, 798). The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
