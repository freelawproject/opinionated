The account of their proceedings and the approval of the superintendent of banks, of such resumption were also before the court. The application was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">It\u2019 was in order on the said accounting and discharge of the temporary receivers for their compensation and expenses to be fixed and ordered paid out of the assets before they should be turned over to the trust company. That is the settled practice on.the accounting of executors, trustees and receivers. It is not necessary to institute a separate proceeding for that purpose, and it is never done. It is part and parcel of the accounting. The claim that the court had no jurisdiction to fix such compensation and expenses is therefore without foundation. But the amount allowed was so grossly excessive as to amount to a spoliation of the assets of the trust company, and the order must be reversed or else modified for that reason. To allow it to stand would implant general distrust of the administration of justice. The temporary receivers served for only five months. The allowance of $75,000 to each for compensation, and the same sum to* their counsel, in all the great sum of $300,000, is so disproportionate as not to wear the appearance of unhampered judicial discretion and judgment, but of having been arranged by agreement between the temporary receivers and the directors of the trust, company, and adopted by the court inadvertently, or without the exercise of its controlling judgment and discretion. This also appears from the peculiar form of the order, viz., that the sums- fixed should be paid provided the trust company consented, which its officers promptly did. Inasmuch as the trust duty of the directors of the trust company is to be diligent to havd these charges upon the funds of the trust company fixed as low as possible, it seems strange that they should send counsel here to argue in favor of the compensation as fixed below. It imparts a strange moral aspect to the case, to say the least. It is urged that the court should not assume a paternal supervision over the directors of the trust company, but should be satisfied with or let pass what they are willing to do in the premises; but if there could be any force at all in such a suggestion in any case, this is not such a case. '</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">We deem it o.ur duty to exercise our judgment and discretion in the reduction of the amounts fixed to a proper sum, notwithstanding the persistence of the Deputy Attorney General in arguing that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>should be given opportunity to produce evidence of the extent and value of the services of the receivers and their counsel. He suggests a reference, but it is unnecessary, and only calculated to make useless expense and protract the settlement of the matter. It is not difficult for a court to see what the compensation should be without the aid of a reference; and if the Attorney General desired to introduce evidence he should have asked leave to do so at the Special Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The order is modified by reducing the compensation of each tem-z porary receiver from $75,000 to $20,000, and that of counsel from $75,000 to $20,000, and as so modified it is affirmed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">Order modified by reducing the compensation of each temporary receiver from $75,000 to $20,000, and that of counsel from $75,000 to $20,000, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur. \u2022</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\">On Rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b36-8\">GAYNOR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah\">A motion for a reargument is made by the receivers and their counsel on the grounds that they did not know that' the question of the amount of their compensation was before this court, and that the amount we have fixed is inadequate. This seems strange. What then was before us? The brief for the receivers when the appeal was argued argues at length that the work done by the receivers and their counsel was fully shown in 55 pages of the record which it points out, and that the sums allowed were not excessive. \u201cIt is not necessary,\u201d says the brief, \u201cnow to analyze these statements\u201d (i. e., the statements showing such work), \u201cbut a reference to them is sufficient to show that the court and the Attorney General were fully informed upon the subject of the services of the receivers and their counsel.\u201d But now we are asked to take the contrary position, that there was not enough before us to pass upon the question of the amount of compensation, and that that question was not before us. If not, then the same was the case with the court below, and the amounts fixed rested only on an agreement between the receivers and' their counsel, and the directors of the trust company, and the case would actually be one of the disposal of trust funds held for the court? by its receivers to themselves by agreement with the directors of the trust company\u2014a thing not to be permitted. The record disclosed the work of the receivers and their counsel and the amounts we allowed therefor were ample. This is especially so of the receivers. Very few are so fortunate as to make $20,000 inside of five months without investment, risk or anxiety. e</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">The motion is denied. Let the order on our former decision be settled on notice before Mr. Justice GAYNOR.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
