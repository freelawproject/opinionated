The action is by servant against master for negligence, and the complaint is, inter alla, of a defective machine furnished by the master in violation of his obligation to exercise due care to furnish proper appliances. Benzing v. Steinway &amp; Sons, 101 N. Y. 547, 5 N. E. 449. The servant testifies: That, on the Friday before the accident, he noticed that the hammer fell two or three times while his foot was off the treadle. That he informed the machinist of the defendant, who thereafter told him that he had \u201cfixed\u201d it, that it was in proper condition, and to resume its use. The servant continued to use the machine for two days, and it worked properly. It worked likewise for several hours on the day of the accident; but at a time when the plaintiff, with his foot off the treadle, was engaged in tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>ing out a certain material from the machine, the hammer came down automatically upon the table and injured his hand. Normally this material was thrown out from the machine automatically, but sometimes it \u201cstuck,\u201d whereupon the workmen were accustomed to take a piece of stick or a wire and use it to take out the material. The servant was using a stick at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The sole question which I decide is whether the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case so as to escape dismissal. So far as the question of his contributory negligence is concerned, which was certainly in this case, suffice it to say that at the close of his evidence it did not present a question of law for the court. Repair to this press was not a detail of the work, but was a duty of the master. Fox v. Le Comte, <em>2 </em>App. Div. at page 63, 37 N. Y. Supp. 316, affirmed on opinion below 153 N. Y. 680, 48 N. E. 1104. I am of opinion that the learned court erred, in that the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case which presented a question for the jury whether the master had discharged his obligation to the servant to exercise due care to furnish a fit and proper machine. I think that Sopherstein v. Bertels, 178 Pa. 401, 35 Atl. 1000, was well decided and is precisely in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
