A verdict was rendered for the plaintiff; the defendant appealing and urging three exceptions. The first of these is that the learned trial court erred in its charge to the jury, the secoiid that the court erred in rulings upon the evidence, and the third that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">The first alleged error in the charge is presented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">\u201cIf you find, I repeat once more, he was injured as he says, and you believe his testimony and the witnesses on the part of the- plaintiff, your verdict\" will be rendered accordingly in such sum as you believe to be fair and just and proper between the plaintiff and defendant in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Mr. Smith (on behalf of the defendant):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-13\">\u201cI respectfully except to that last portion of your honor\u2019s charge, in which you said \u2018he was injured as he says, and you believe his testimony and the witnesses on the part of the plaintiff, your verdict will be rendered accordingly,\u2019 \u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">To this the court responded, \u201cThey are at liberty to find,\u201d and counsel took no exception. Assuming there is a question raised, we are of opinion that this charge, taken in connection with the. prior portions of the charge, to which it distinctly refers, left no erroneous impression in the minds of the jury. The court had pointed out in detail the conflicting theories and the evidence in support of them, and had told the jury it was for them to determine which theory they would accept, and the clause referred to is clearly to be understood, not as limiting the jury to the determination of the credibility of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, but as a recapitulation of the previous charge,' and that if they believed the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, as against those of the defendant, they were to find for the plaintiff. It was not error, read in connection with all the court had said.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">The next alleged error is presented by Mr. Smith\u2019s request to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-16\"><em>\u201cThat </em>between blocks the railroad has a paramount right of way on all and every portion of the streets, except at the adjoinings (streets), and the motorman had a right to believe that the truck would remain clear of his track, and wasn\u2019t obliged to anticipate the truck driver would pull in on his track.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">This the court refused to charge, for the very obvious reason that it does not correctly state the law, assuming it to have any bearing upon a case in which a passenger upon the car is injured. The rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>road company between streets has not \u201ca paramount right of way on all and every portion of the streets,\u201d with the exception noted. It has a paramount right upon its tracks, and for a sufficient space for the cars to pass; but outside of that it has no more rights than any other person lawfully using the highway. Mr. Smith then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">\u201cAnd it is his duty to stop the ear only at the time he saw the driver going to go to his track.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The court responded: \u201cCharge the latter part.\u201d Without approving this proposition, it is obvious that the defendant received as broad an instruction as there was any possible justification for. The duty of the motorman is not necessarily measured by the time he saw the truck moving onto his track. His duty was to see it moving as soon as he could do so in the exercise of that degree of care which the law exacts for the carrying of passengers, and the defendant certainly has no grounds for complaint under the charge as it remained when the case went to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">We have examined the other alleged errors, but find none which would warrant this court in interfering with the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
