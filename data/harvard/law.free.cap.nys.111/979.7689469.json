Motion to confirm the report of the referee.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AEn\">Motion granted.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1012-6\">The following is the opinion of William Henry Knox, referee:</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1012-7\">This order of reference directs me to ascertain the amounts which are due to the claimants and which are liens upon the surplus money, and the priorities of those liens. The judgment of foreclosure was filed January 27, 1908, and the report of sale March 10, 1908. The lot upon which the building was erected is situated on the southwest corner of 178th street and La Fontaine avenue, in the borough of the Bronx, New York City, being 25 feet front on the avenue by 100 feet deep on the street. The amount of surplus money held by the chamberlain of the city of New York to the credit of this proceeding is $6,049.36. The sum total of the claims proved is $12,417.34.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1012-8\">The date of maturity of claim\u2014that is, of the furnishing of the last item of material\u2014by Miller, for cut stone, for $1,400, was July 15, 1907; by Bowne, for brick, lime, and cement, for $2,284.79, was July 22, 1907; by Schneider, for steamheating apparatus, for $975, was July 23, 1907; by Silleck, for lumber and timber, for $1,438.49, was July 30, 1907; by Newkirk, for nails and sash weights, for $326.56, was July 31, 1907; by Kertscher &amp; Co., for window sashes, for $2,200, was August 1, 1907; by Thomas C. Edmonds &amp; Co., for-glass, for $270, was August 2, 1907; by Heil, for stair' hand railing, for $20, was August 2, 1907; by Still, for dumb waiters, for $120, was August 2, 1907; by Galbraith, for lath, lime, and plaster, for $341, was August 6, 1907; by Klotz, for fireproofing, for $85, was August 6, 1907; and by Haldane, for gas fixtures, for $2,958.50, was August, 1907. As to the nature and justice of the claims by Phelan, for $900, by Sheridan, for $947, by Furlong, for $867, aggregating $2,714, no proof has been offered. Those persons filed notices of mechanics\u2019 liens against the real property, of which the following liens were proved before me, in the. following order of priority as to dates of filing: Henry G. Silleck, Jr., for $1,438.49, August 5, 1907, at 11:20 a. m.; Kertscher &amp; Co., for $2,200, August 6, 1907, at 9:06 a. m.; Charles Schneider, for $975, August 6, 1907, at 9:16 a. m.; Thomas O. Ed1 monds &amp; Co., for $345, August 6, 1907, at 10:23 a. m.; Thomas B. Bowne &amp; Son Company, for $2,893.90, August 6, 1907, at 10:37 a. m.; James Galbraith, for $341, August 6, 1907, at 1:32 p. m.; A. C. Newkirk &amp; Co., for $326, August 7,\" 1907, at 10 a. m.; August Heil, for $20, August 7, 1907, at 12:21 p. m.; A. E. Klotz Fireproofing Company, for $85, August 7, 1907, at 1:51 p. m.; Thomas Haldane, for $2,958.50, August 7, 1907, at 1:30 p. m.; Stephen G. Still, for $120, August 9, 1907; and Thomas B. Bowne &amp; Son Company, for $2,284.79, September 28, 1907. The lien of Edmonds &amp; Co. was filed for $345, which covered materials delivered and to be delivered. Materials to the amount of $270 were delivered, and the lien was established for that amount.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1012-9\">Thomas, the owner of the real property, made a deed of the premises to J. Charles Wechsler, as trustee, on August 2, 1907. Neither of them made any proof of claim upon the surplus money, nor was the deed put in evidence. The deed was made to J. Charles Wechsler, as trustee, without any consideration, and purported to be for the benefit of all creditors of Thomas. It was proper to receive in evidence the proof of that want of consideration for the deed (Mutual v. Anthony, 23 Wkly. Dig. [N. Y.] 427), as the deed is an executory instrument (Code, \u00a7 840), and \u00e1s the scope of this reference is as extensive as the issues (Kingsland v. Chetwood, 39 Hun, 607; Mutual Life v. Anthony, 50 Hun, 101, 4 N. Y. Supp. 501). If competent, material, or relevant evidence on that point, or on any other important one were excluded, the court would be without a guide on the question of confirming the report. Code, \u00a7 2407.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1013-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>It is contended that the liens of Silleck, Kertsdher <em>&amp; </em>Co., Schneider, Edmonds <em>&amp; </em>Co., and Bowne are invalid because their notices do not state that Mr. Wechsler was the owner of the legal title. The name of the owner is required by section 2, section 9, subd. 2, and section 10 of the lien law (Laws 1897, pp. 515, 518, 519, c. 418) to be stated in the notice. Who, then, was the true owner, Mr. Wechsler or Thomas? Those notices of lien state that Thomas was. A lien has priority over a conveyance of property as a general assignment for the benefit of all creditors within 30 days before the filing of the lien. Lien Law, \u00a7 13. An incumbrance made by the owner for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of the lien law as to lien priorities is void. Lien Law, \u00a7 7. The courts have followed the principle of these lien provisions. Mandeville v. Reed, 13 Abb. Pr. (N. Y.) 172; Kane Co. v. Kinney, 174 N. Y. 69, 66 N. E. 619; American M. Co. v. Merrick Const. Co., 120 App. Div. 150, 104 N. Y. Supp. 900; affirmed 190 N. Y. 24, 82 N. E. 739; Crane Co. v. Smythe, 182 N. Y. 545, 75 N. E. 1128. These claimants sought to hold, by their liens, the interest of the owner, and they made no mistake in Thomas\u2019 name. They accepted no benefit under his deed to Mr. Wechsler for the benefit of his creditors. They declined to accept such benefit. This is established by their filing of mechanics\u2019 liens and taking other steps to reach the surplus money. The deed, therefore, is of no effect at all as against these claimants, and as far as they are concerned Thomas remained the true owner until cut off by the foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1013-5\">It is also objected against, these liens that their notices state that the lot is 50 feet wide instead of 25. There was but this one building on this corner lot. If several buildings in a row be improved by a different quality or quantity of labor or material, they must be specified. Eisenbeis v. Wakeman, 3 Wash. St. 558, 28 Pac. 923; Portones v. Badenock, 132 Ill., 379, 23 N. E. 349; Lumber Co. v. Fehlhammer, 59 Mo. App. 664. The lien law requires only a description of the property \u201csufficient for identification.\u201d These notices of lien sufficiently complied with the requirement. That error of one dimension, being too large, has harmed or misled neither the owner nor the other lienors, and does not invalidate the lien. Lien La\"W, \u00a7 9, subd. 7; Lien Law, \u00a7 22; Walkam v. Henry, 7 Misc. Rep. 532, 27 N. Y. Supp. 997; Duffy v. McManus, 3 E. D. Smith (N. Y.) 657.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1013-6\">It is insisted that the lien of Bowne &amp; Son Co. is invalid because their notice states that their claim was $2,893.90, instead of the actual amount due, $2,284.79. The error is explained by Mr. Baisely\u2014that there was occasion for great hurry in filing the lien (as the priorities of the first five liens show), and in the absence of the bookkeeper he looked in the ledger for the balance due, which showed the balance to be $2,893.90, omitting a credit of $609.11. In their second notice of lien, filed September 28th, they correctly stated the actual amount due\u2014$2,284.79. There was obviously no willful intention to misstate the actual amount due. An erroneous statement of the amount due, to vitiate a lien, must be willful or so grossly exaggerated as to raise a presumption of willfulness. Felgenhauer v. Haas, 123 App. Div. 75, 108 N. Y. Supp. 476; American Mortgage Co. v Butler, 36 Misc. Rep. 254, 73 N. Y. Supp. 334; Ringle v. Wallis, 149 N. Y. 439, 44 N. E. 175. In Williams v. Daiker, 33 Misc. Rep. 70, 68 N. Y. Supp. 348, the true amount was $2,040, whereas the amount claimed was $4,682.79, or more than double the lienor\u2019s demand. In Hecla v. Hall, 115 App. Div. 126, 100 N. Y. Supp. 696, the true amount was $12,125.43, whereas the amount claimed in the notice of lien was $24,255.92, more than double. In Aeschlimann v. Presbyterian Hospital, 165 N. Y. 296, 59 N. E. 148, 80 Am. St. Rep. 723, the true amount was $611, and the amount claimed in the lien was $2.786.40, although the claimant had on the previous day rendered a bill for only $811 to cover the full balance due. In New Jersey Steel Co. v. Robinson, 85 App. Div. 512, 83 N. Y. Supp. 450, the true amount was $16,000, whereas the amount claimed in the lien was $43,243. These eases, in which the liens were held to have been vitiated on account of excessive amounts claimed, are extreme ones, where willfulness was either proved or inferred. A mere mistake in name, amount, or dimension does not invalidate a lien. Lien Law, \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1014-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>The contention of some junior claimants is that the surplus money should be paid over to Mr. Wechsler, to be distributed under the trust deed among the creditors pro rata. This plea, while hopeless and against the statutory order of priorities, attracts sympathy, draws attention to that order\u2019s apparent want' of equity in some cases, and suggests the wisdom of a possible amendment to suit cases like this. For instance, Miller, who furnished cut stone of the value of $1,400, has priority in date of maturity of his claim over all other claimants, and his cut stone was sold with the premises, and presumably helped to augment the amount of the surplus money. Yet he gets nothing. Of course, the answer is that the common law did not recognize a mechanic\u2019s lien (Birmingham v. Glen, 78 N. Y. 32), nor did equity (Withrow v. Glasgow, 101 Fed. 865, 42 C. C. A. 61), nor does England (Shaw v. Young, 87 Me. 274, 32 Atl. 897), and that he should have been more diligent in filing his lien. Persons standing in equal degrees have priority according to the dates of filing their respective liens. Lien Law, \u00a7\u00a7 3,13; Livingston v. Mildrum, 19 N. Y. 440.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1014-5\">The instrument by Thomas to Mr. Wechsler is not a valid deed, nor a trust mortgage, nor an incumbrance. It is nothing. It is void as against these claimants. At most it was, in effect, a trust deed in the nature of a mortgage for the benefit of creditors. As such it is not valid as against subsequent mechanics\u2019 liens; and the claimant lienors have preference in the surplus money. American Mortgage Co. v. Merrick Co., supra.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1014-6\">The claimants Newkirk and Bowne urge that, inasmuch as their liens are solely for materials furnished, they, as \u201cmaterial men,\u201d are entitled to priority over Kertscher &amp; Co., Schneider, Edmonds &amp; Co., and Galbraith. Then Silleck and Kertscher &amp; Co., who furnished materials solely, are also in the same category. They are not materialmen, unless' Thomas, the owner, was as well the contractor. Newkirk furnished nails and sash weights for $326.56, and Bowne furnished brick, lime, and cement for $2,284.79, under direct contracts with Thomas. They are, therefore, contractors, because a person who, in pursuit of an independent occupation, executes a specific thing according either to his own idea or a plan previously provided, for other persons, called .\u201cthe public,\u201d without submitting himself to their control with respect to details, but furnishing his own workmen, and representing their will only as to the result of the thing, and not as to the means by which it is accomplished, is a contractor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1014-7\">The lien law recognizes and distinguishes an owner, a contractor, a subcontractor, a materialman, and a laborer. It prefers a laborer for wages, and a materialman. Code, \u00a7 3414; Lien Law, \u00a7 13. No laborer, employ\u00e9, workman, or mechanic, nor subcontractor, nor materialman, is a lienor in this proceeding. \u201cMaterialmen,\u201d said Judge Houston (Curlett v. Aaron, 6 Houst. [Del.] 477), \u201care gentlemen in trade who do not follow the business of contracting to build homes for others, but who keep for. sale some materials that enter largely into buildings.\u201d If, for instance, Newkirk &amp; Co. themselves had only furnished the nails, say of $26.56, but had contracted with John Doe to furnish and hang the sash weights, say for $300, and if John Doe had done so, and if Newkirk &amp; Co. had filed the lien for $326.56, and if John Doe had filed a lien for the $300, John Doe, not Newkirk &amp; Co., would be, the materialman and also laborer, and under section 3414 of the Code and sec-' tian 13 of the lien law, would be entitled to be paid the amount due him before any payment to Newkirk &amp; Co. And if John Doe\u2019s daily or weekly wage workmen, who had hung the sash weights, had filed liens against him, they would also be entitled to a preference as laborers; or the Bowne Company, who contracted with Thomas, the owner, to furnish brick, lime, and cement towards the building of this house, had bought the brick from Richard Roe, the provisions of section 3414 of the Code and section 13 of the lien law would prevent the Bowne Company on filing a mechanic\u2019s lien and enforcing it in preference to a lien subsequently filed by Richard Roe, from pocketing the proceeds of their contract and major lien before the materialman, Richard Roe, was paid his minor lien. Similarly, those provisions deal with a subcontractor that owes a lot of materialmen and laborers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1014-8\">There is no privity between a man who furnishes material or performs labor for the contractor and the owner. This being so, the former could have no lien against the latter\u2019s premises unless the statute specifically gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>it to him, either as a materialman or a laborer, which it does. Lien Law, \u25a0section 3. Newkirk and Bowne, and, indeed, all the other claimants, as they \u2022contracted directly with Thomas, the owner, are original independent contractors, although in a particular line of materials, and could not be material-men unless they had furnished materials to a contractor, which they did not do. The phrase \u201cmaterialmen,\u201d besides its primary and universal meaning, has a secondary and technical meaning, certainly since 1897. \u201cThe term materialmen,\u201d defines section 2 of the lien law, \u201cmeans any person other than -a contractor who furnishes materials for such improvement.\u201d It is, therefore, a solecism to denominate an owner a contractor; and the incongruity, uselessness, and absurdity of the misnomer are apparent when one perceives that an owner could not sue and recover a judgment under the lien law against himself nor contract with himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1015-5\">Consequently the surplus moneys should be distributed as follows: First, for the fees, disbursements, and costs of this reference; second, to Henry \u25a06. Silleck, Jr., claimant, the sum of $1,438.49, with interest thereon from the 5th day of August, 1907; third, to Kertseher &amp; Co., claimant, the sum of $2,200, with interest thereon from the 6th day of August, 1907; fourth, to \u25a0Charles Schneider, claimant, the sum of $975, with interest thereon from the 6th day of August, 1907; fifth, to Thomas C.
