Section 2268, relating to contempt other than criminal contempt, provides that, where the offense consists of neglect or refusal to obey an order of the court requiring the payment of a specified sum of money, etc., the court may issue without notice a warrant to commit the offender to prison until the sum and expenses of the proceeding are paid. <em>Held, </em>that the intent of the Legislature in making the special provisions relating to matrimonial cases was to make the remedies therein provided exclusive for such cases; hence proceedings under section 2268 for contempt in failing to pay alimony will not lie.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b766-11\">2.

Such an order to show cause may also be made, without any previous sequestration, or direction to give security, where the court is satisfied that they would be ineffectual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">It is to be observed that section 1773 relates specifically to matrimonial actions, and it would seem, upon principle, that, since it contains special provisions relating to this class of actions, it, rather than a section containing provisions relating to actions generally, would govern. It is quite clear that it authorizes a proceeding for contempt on the facts disclosed by this record, namely, for a failure of a husband to comply with a decree with respect to the payment of alimony. If the Legislature intended to authorize the institution of the proceeding, either by an ex parte application, or on an order to show cause, or by attachment as provided in sections 2268 and 2269 of the Code of Civil Procedure, respectively, then there was no occasion for this special provision in the title relating to matrimonial actions. It would seem, therefore, that the Legislature, by making this special provision relating to this class of actions, intended that it should be exclusive, and, if so, it is clear that the proceeding must originate on an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Prior to the incorporation of section 1773 in the Code of Civil Procedure in 1880, there was no separate provision regulating the commencement of contempt proceedings in matrimonial actions; but, since these provisions were inserted, they have been usually, if not uniformly, construed by the courts as exclusive with respect to contempt proceedings in matrimonial actions. Stanley v. Stanley, 116 App. Div. 544, 101 N. Y. Supp. 725; Sandford v. Sandford, 9 Civ. Proc. R. 289; Isaacs v. Isaacs, 10 Daly, 306; Delanoy v. Delanoy, 19 App. Div. 295, 46 N. Y. Supp. 106; Goldie v. Goldie, 77 App. Div. 12, 79 N. Y. Supp. 268; Schweig v. Schweig (Sup.) 107 N. Y. Supp. 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Counsel for respondent argues that since the order adjudging the defendant guilty of contempt was a court order, and not a judge\u2019s order, it could be reviewed by a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction. If the order were authorized by law, doubtless that objection would be unanswerable; but an order made by a judge or court without authority and without notice may and should be vacated by the court on notice. There being no authority to issue a commitment until after notice to the defendant by an order to show cause, the order which the defendant moved to vacate was a nullity, and should have been vacated. The fact that the defendant, after having been arrested under the order, paid under duress to obtain his liberty the amount, does not debar him of the right to have the order vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">It follows that the order should be reversed, and motion to vacate the order adjudging the defendant guilty of contempt and directing his commitment granted, but without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
