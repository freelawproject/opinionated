The case came on for trial before the court without a jury, but after submission of the evidence the court directed that a trial of the issue of fact should be had by jury, pursuant to section 232 of the Municipal act (Laws 1902, p. 1557, c'. 580). The return shows on the trial day present a justice \u201cand a jury (6)\u201d; that both parties appeared; that there was an amendment of the pleading asked by the defendant and allowed; and that thereupon the defendant demanded a jury of 12, and took an exception to a jury of 6. The court \u201cdenied the motion\u201d under exception. The trial proceeded, the evidence of both parties was given, and a verdict was returned for the plaintiff. The defendant appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">I think that the exception to the refusal of the court to grant the demand for a jury of 12 was well taken. The said section 232 in part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">\u201cIf after a trial shall have been had before the court, without a jury, the judge shall, within fourteen days after the submission of the case or proceeding, certify that the evidence is of such a conflicting nature that he has been unable to determine the issue of fact, and that he deems it proper that the same should be tried by jury, he may\u00a1 by order set the same down for trial by a jury for a day not more than eight days from the time of the making of the order, and thereupon the action or proceeding shall be continued in court, and tried by jury as hereinbefore provided in the case where a trial hy jury is ordered by the court before the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">And by that section it is \u201chereinbefore provided\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-14\">\u201cThe court may, in its discretion, at any stage of the action or proceeding, direct that a trial thereof be had by jury, and a trial by jury shall thereupon be had in the same manner as though either of the parties had demanded it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">The omission of the defendant to demand a trial by jury imported only that he was satisfied to try the issues of fact before the court. It' did not involve the waiver of any of the rights afforded to him if he were required by the court to try these issues before a jury. The reason for the provision affording a jury of 12 men rests upon the amount involved alone, inasmuch as that provision applies whenever the damages or the value of the chattel claimed exceed $100. Municipal Court Act, Laws 1902, p. 1559, c. 580, \u00a7 234. When a jury trial is directed, and the defendant cannot therefore try his case before the court alone, although he had assented to that forum, he should be assured all of the rights afforded to him by this section so long as the reason for the section exists. Moreover, the defendant had the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>surance of the statute, supra, that the trial by jury \u201cshall thereupon be had in the same manner as though either of the parties had demanded it,\u201d which is broad enough to afford to him affirmatively the benefit of the said section 234. The defendant did not waive his right, but asserted it at the outset of the trial, before any evidence was offered, and then excepted to the ruling against him. Thus he reserved his right to review (Hand v. Kennedy, 83 N. Y. 149), and he did not lose it by his subsequent participation in the trial (Id.; Zollert v. Groht, 21 Wkly. Dig. 325). Although the defendant was entitled to have the issue tried by a jury of 12, it was tried by a jury of 6, and this was a mistrial. Porter v. Cass, 7 How. Prac. 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial be ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
