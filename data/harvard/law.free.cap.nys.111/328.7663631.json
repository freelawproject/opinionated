The case turns upon the meaning of the clause in the contract quoted. I think the plaintiff had a right to insist upon a title approved as provided in the contract, and this is not in conflict with the decision of this court in Downs v. Lehman, 123 App. Div. 11, 107 N. Y. Supp. 329, cited by the learned counsel for the respondent. The same question was involved in Flanagan v. Fox, 6 Misc. Rep. 132, 26 N. Y. Supp. 48, and it was there held, in a learned and well-considered opinion by Mr. Justice Bischoff, that an action in such circumstances is maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">The judgment of the Municipal Court should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
