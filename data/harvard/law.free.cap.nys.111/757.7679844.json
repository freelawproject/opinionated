He offered in evidence a letter, dated March 4, 1905, addressed to him:-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-18\">\u201cWe take pleasure in advising you that at a meeting of the board of directors of this company, held on March 4th, it was decided to apportion to you 7 per cent, of the net profits of the business for the year 1905, after allowing for the usual dividend of 6 per cent. This is done in recognition of faithful services rendered to the company in the past, and as a stimulus for you to put forth your best energies in your future conduct, thereby showing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>company that they have not misplaced their confidence by the action taken. Trusting that the year may be \"an exceedingly successful one, we are,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">\u201cYours very truly, A. G. Hyde &amp; Sons,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">\u201cPer Seymour J. Hyde, President.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">He was then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-8\">\u201cDid you have a conversation with Mr. Hyde prior to the signing of that letter? If so, when?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">\u25a0 To which he answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-10\">\u201cYes, sir; on the 9th of January. Q. In reference to a percentage of profit of the defendant\u2019s business? A. Yes, sir. Q. Will you please state the conversation?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">That was objected to, and thereupon the defendant offered in evidence the following paper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-12\">\u201cAgreement between A. G. Hyde &amp; Sons and Mr. E. P. Eraker. This agreement witnesseth that A. G. Hyde &amp; Sons have agreed to employ Mr. E. P. Eraker, and that Mr. E. P. Eraker has agreed to serve A. G. Hyde &amp; Sons, for the term of one year from January 1, 1905, to December 31, 1905, both inclusive. A. G. Hyde &amp; Sons agree to pay Mr. E. P. Eraker a salary of $10,000 per annum, payable semimonthly on the 15th and 30th of each month. It is understood that this contract can be annulled at any time by either party giving 30 days\u2019 notice in writing to the other party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-13\">\u201cE. P. Eraker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-14\">\u201cDated January 9, 1905.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-15\">Counsel for the defendant said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-16\">\u201cThis instrument is complete on its face, and whether or not it is complete or partial is a question of law, and your honor, on looking at this paper, will say whether or not it is a complete contract between the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-17\">It is quite evident it is not complete on its face, because it is simply-signed by Fraker. There is no signature of Hyde &amp; Sons, and no indication upon its face of its ever having been accepted. But perhaps we may assume that a similar paper signed by A. G. Hyde &amp; Sons was in possession of the plaintiff. The claim of the plaintiff was that the suit was brought for a percentage of the net profits; that the paper dated January 9, 1905, only covered the salary; that the part of the contract relating to the $10,000 was put in writing, but the part relating to the 7 per cent., although agreed-to, was not put in writing until the 4th of March, and that he was entitled under the circumstances to supplement the writings by oral testimony to show the entire transaction and the whole contract. After considerable discussion, the court having ruled out all conversations, the minutes of the board of directors, at a special meeting held March 4,1905, were put in evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-18\">\u201cThe following resolution was offered by Mr. Hyde: \u2018That in recognition of services to the company in the past, and as a stimulus for further effort in the future, be it resolved that the board of directors apportion the following named gentlemen the specified percentage of net profits of the business for the year 1905, after allowing for the annual dividend, set opposite their respective names: W. W. Coreill, ll per cent.; E. P. Eraker, 7 per cent.; E. S. Lucas, 1 per cent.; H. Williams, 1 per cent.\u2019\u2014and, having been regularly moved and seconded, it was.adopted. The president also recommended that a letter be addressed to. each of the above-named gentlemen, informing them of the resolution and the respective percentage apportioned to them. The' question of the president\u2019s salary was then considered by the board, and on motion, duly made and seconded, the president having retired from the room, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>it was resolved that the president\u2019s salary for the year 1905 be fixed at the \u2022sum of $60,000. The board in like manner fixed the other salaries of officers .as follows: Vice president, $12,500; treasurer, $10,000; secretary, $4,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-3\">The plaintiff was the treasurer of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">The defendant being a corporation, the board of directors controlled :its affairs. The resolution of said board, providing for the employment \u2022and compensation of the plaintiff, was evidence thereof. If we assume that the president, as the executive head of the corporation, had the power of employment, and if we assume that the paper writing dated January 9,1904, was complete upon its face, and evidence of a prior or \u2022collateral agreement with the president for further or other compensation than that expressed therein was improper, yet the board of directors had the power to confirm, or ratify, or enlarge. That paper provided that it could be annulled at any time by either party giving 30 \u25a0days\u2019 notice in writing to the other party. The abrogation of that privilege to the plaintiff was a sufficient consideration to support the new \u2022agreement made by the resolution of the board of directors, under which he was to receive, in addition to the $10,000 a year as salary as \u25a0treasurer, 7 per cent, of the net profits, and having continued in the employment of the company for the whole year upon the faith and \u25a0promise of the company, so expressed by the resolution of the board \u25a0 of directors, having fully performed the contract upon his part, he was entitled to receive the amounts so provided. We are dealing, not with -an executory contract, but with an executed <em>contract; </em>and, as we read this record, the plaintiff sustained the cause of action set up in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">It was error, therefore, to dismiss the complaint, and the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
