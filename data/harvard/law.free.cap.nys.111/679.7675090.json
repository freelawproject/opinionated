The jury having returned a verdict for the nlaintiff, we must assume the facts to be as testified to by the plaintiff. The defendant is engaged in the occupation of a druggist. The plaintiff informed the defendant\u2019s clerk that he wished to purchase \u201cten cents\u2019 worth of corrosive sublimate to apply to the body to kill lice.\u201d The clerk asked the plaintiff if he should mix it with water or alcohol,- and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>the plaintiff replied that he did not know. The defendant furnished the plaintiff with 10 cents\u2019 worth of corrosive sublimate. The plaintiff applied it to his body, and sustained severe injury as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The plaintiff predicates the charge of negligence upon the claim that, as he asked for corrosive sublimate \u201cto apply to the body to kill lice,\u201d the defendant should have so prepared the corrosive sublimate that it could be applied to the body without injuring it. The plaintiff offered the evidence of a physician to the effect that corrosive sublimate could be so prepared that it could be applied to the body without injurious consequences. The physician also testified that the drug furnished the plaintiff was \u201ca very strong solution,\u201d and that \u201cit was of abnormal strength.\u201d The case at bar is not, as contended by the appellant, a case where a customer ordered a drug and was given the drug he ordered. If it were such a case, we think that there could be no recovery. Here the plaintiff asked for a drug for a particular, specified purpose, and when the defendant sold him a drug for this purpose it thereby impliedly represented the drug which it sold to be suitable for the purpose for which it was sold. The plaintiff used it for the purpose for which the defendant had sold it to him, and thereby sustained injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">We think this case is analogous to the cases where a druggist sells a harmful drug as a harmless drug. In such cases the druggist has been held liable to those who relying upon his label sustain injury from the use of the drug. 14 Cyc. 1085; Thomas v. Winchester, 6 N. Y. 397, 57 Am. Dec. 455. It is true that in the present-case the druggist put no label upon the drug; but in attempting to fill the plaintiff\u2019s order the defendant, by the actions of its agent, declared the drug to be fit for the purpose for which he sold it, just as clearly as if he had labeled it as fit for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
