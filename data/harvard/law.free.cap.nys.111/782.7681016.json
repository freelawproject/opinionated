Then the plaintiff tendered the $32.50, but the defendant refused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>money, and-also said he would not deliver the chattels unless paid an additional $63, the sum of two bills assigned him by another liveryman ($54.50) and by a veterinary ($8.50). This action, to recover the chattels, was begun and the chattels were taken by- the marshal the next day. The defendant interposed a \u201ccounterclaim\u201d for the items mentioned above and $3.25 besides, for board from August 31st to the date of the replevin. On the trial, September 19th, all this was conceded by stipulation, and the case thereon submitted, with \u201cno dispute as to the amount in question, with the exception of $3.25,\u201d which item, however, proved itself from the plaintiff\u2019s papers as part of the sum ($35.75) due for keep, and for which the defendant had a lien under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Although in this action for the recovery of the chattels the defendant might properly set up in defense his justifiable claim for the sum due him as liveryman bailee, he might not interpose as a counterclaim another cause of action on contract. Still there would have been little chance for cavil had a judgment been rendered for the defendant for the sum of $98.75, the amount of the counterclaim factitiously interposed, and possession of the chattels been awarded to the plaintiff, conditioned upon satisfaction of the lien, and otherwise recovery to the defendant of their possession and right of detention until the collection or payment otherwise of the sum awarded to him for his special property in the chattels. Instead, the judgment was wholly against the defendant. Possession of the chattels was awarded the plaintiff absolutely, and costs besides. This was erroneous. The chattels could not be lifted without lifting the lien. In fact, the marshal might have refused to take the chattels, had the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit candidly set forth the liveryman\u2019s lien. Crocker on Sheriffs, 467. Under the present law, passed since the cases upon which the plaintiff relies, a person keeping a livery stable has a lien, dependent upon possession, upon each animal boarded and vehicle kept, for the sum due him for care and keep, and may detain the animal, vehicle, and harness accordingly until such sum is paid. Lien Law, Laws 1897, p. 533, c. 418, \u00a7 74. Demanding more than the amount of his lien did not vitiate the lien, although it might affect the necessity of a tender. The judgment should be reversed, with costs to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Between the taking and the trial, namely, on the 11th of September, the plaintiff deposited in court $32.50, the amount of the August bill, \u201csubject to the acceptance of the same by this defendant in full satisfaction of the lien claimed on the chattels.\u201d That deposit was insufficient to satisfy the defendant\u2019s enforceable lien for $35.75. Coupled, as it was, with a condition that it was subject to acceptance in full satisfaction of the lien, \u201cthe tender was defective. It was clearly a tender to be accepted as the whole balance due, which is held bad by all the books. * * * It is not of the nature of a tender to make conditions, terms, or qualifications, but simply to pay the sum tendered as for an admitted debt. Interlarding any other object will always defeat the effect of the act as a tender.\u201d Wood v. Hitchcock, 20 Wend. 47. Subsequent to his recovery of judgment, and thus getting the chattels, the plaintiff moved for a return to him of the $32.50, which he called \u201ctendered in court.\u201d Of that deposit, not being a proper tender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>and not accepted by the defendant, the clerk was merely a stakeholder, and not within the purview of the justice's jurisdiction in this action. The Municipal Court act makes no provision for appealing from such an order. Therefore the appeal here therefrom should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Judgment awarding possession of the chattels is reversed, with costs to the defendant, and the complaint dismissed. Appeal from the order denying the motion that the clerk return the deposit is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">GIRDERSEEEVE, P. J., concurs.
