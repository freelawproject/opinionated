On February 28th, following, the debtor executed a chattel mortgage in the sum of $1,100 to one Peter George, and then, declaring his inability to pay the fine imposed, was committed to the county jail. Thereafter he moved, even a second time, for his discharge under section 2286 of the Code of Civil Procedure, upon his own uncorroborated affidavit, uncorroborated even by a conclusory affidavit of his attorney, that he is unable to pay the amount of his fine, and was discharged; the court in a memorandum saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">\u201cA judgment debtor who has languished 65 days In jail has been sufficiently punished for his failure to obey the mandate of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">But \u201cthere is no inherent power in the court to release a defendant merely as a matter of grace or mercy\u201d (Moore v. McMahon, 20 Hun, 44, 45), and what is disclosed by the record and by the uncorroborated affidavit of the debtor was insufficient to justify his discharge under the Code (Matter of Steinert, 29 Hun, 301; Matter of Collins, 39 Misc. Rep. 753, 80 N. Y. Supp. 1119).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">The order should therefore be reversed, and the debtor should be reimprisoned, unless he gives a sufficient bond to pay within 10 days after, service of a copy of this order, with notice of entry thereof. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
