'</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b707-13\">Where a chattel mortgage provided for the rendition to a judgment debtor of any surplus arising upon the sale of the mortgaged property, the fact that the chattel mortgage was past due did not make the mortgagee the sole and unconditional owner of the property; but the judgment debtor had what might be called a leviable interest subject to the mortgage, which he was bound to surrender on demand of the judgment creditor\u2019s receiver made pursuant to an order of court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b707-14\">Appeal from City Court of New York, Special Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b707-15\">Supplementary proceeding by Octavia A.

Thereafter the receiver moved to punish him for contempt, but his motion was improperly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-20\">The record discloses no claim to exemption of the property at the time of the demand, or even upon the hearing to punish for contempt. This was necessary, as the property in question was not absolutely, but only qualifiedly, exempt. Wilcox v. Howe, 59 Hun, 268, 12 N. Y. Supp. 783. At that hearing the debtor deposed a disclaimer of ownership, and was corroborated by the exhibition of a chattel mortgage that had been filed against the property in question on or about the 3-lth of October, 1907. The affidavit of the mortgagee disclosed that the mortgage was past due; but that did not make him the sole, absolute* and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>unconditional' owner, for the mortgage' provides for the rendition of any surplus arising upon the sale to the debtor herein, who, therefore, may be said to have had a leviable interest, subject to the claim of said mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
