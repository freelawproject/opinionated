The trial court was of opinion that interest \u25a0 could not be allowed to him on these advancements, because he took title in his own name and appropriated the rents to himself. Ordinarily this would he the rule, but under the peculiar circumstances of this case we think interest should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">It is quite apparent that the plaintiffs would have lost the property at the foreclosure sale, and would have realized no surplus, had not the defendant advanced his own money and purchased the property. He made the mistake of taking the title in his own name, possibly to protect the money he had advanced; but he now makes no claim to it, and is ready to transfer it to his wards. We think an allowance of interest at the rate of 4 per cent, on the moneys advanced would be just and equitable. There is no reason why the surplus moneys on hand should not be immediately applied toward liquidation of defendant\u2019s claim. The provision of the judgment charging defendant with the legal rate of interest on rents received by him was proper, and is not appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The interlocutory judgment should be modified, by providing that defendant be allowed interest at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum on the moneys advanced by him, and by also providing that the surplus moneys be immediately applied toward liquidation of defendant\u2019s claim, and, as so modified, the judgment is affirmed, with disbursements only to appellant, to be deducted from his indebtedness for rents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
