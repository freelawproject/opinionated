Upon the trial the plaintiff succeeded, and judgment was entered ordering the removal of the obstructions and incumbrances, and perpetually enjoining the defendants from thereafter obstructing or incumbering it. Subsequently, upon plaintiff\u2019s motion, an order was granted at Special Term appointing a referee to hear and determine the damages sustained by the plaintiff and fix the amount thereof, and providing \u201cthat upon the coming in of said report judgment be entered by the clerk of Kings county m favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for the amount so reported, with the plaintiff\u2019s disbursements in connection with said reference.\u201d The referee found in favor of the plaintiff for nominal damages only, whereupon plaintiff served notice electing to end the reference, and moved at Special Term for the appointment of a new referee, on the grounds, first, of certain alleged misconduct and negligence, and, second, because the report of the referee contained no findings of fact or conclusions of law. The learned justice presiding at Special Term, speaking upon the subject upon which the first ground of plaintiff\u2019s motion is based, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">\u201cIt seems to me to have been unduly exaggerated, and affords no reason for just criticism of any one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">The acts complained of were done with the knowledge and acquiescence of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. We are unanimously of the opinion that the conclusion of the Special Term upon this branch of the motion was correct. We are unable, however, to agree that plaintiff had the right to have the facts found by the referee separately stated. This appeal is from the order granting plaintiff\u2019s motion because of the failure of the referee to separately state the facts found. The Code of Civil Procedure (section 1022) provides that the report of the referee upon the trial of the \u201cwhole issues of fact\u201d must separately state the facts found and conclusions of law. The question presented, therefore, is': Were the whole issues of fact in the action tried by the referee?</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">The issues in the action have been tried, and the judgment entered thereon affirmed on appeal, long before the appointment of the referee to determine the amount of plaintiff\u2019s damages. The reference was only an incident to the proceedings, and not the \u201ctrial of the whole issues of fact.\u201d There is no provision of law requiring a referee appointed to determine the amount of damages to separately state the facts found.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">It follows that the order was improperly made, and it must be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
