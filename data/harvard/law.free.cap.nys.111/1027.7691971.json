Such a motion is addressed to the discretion of the court, anti ordinarily we should not be disposed to review the exercise by the Special Term of its discretion in such a matter. The circumstances described by the papers are, however, unusual. The action is for goods sold and delivered between September 1, 1907, and December 1, 1907. The answer contains a denial of the allegations respecting sale, delivery, and nonpayment. Then follows what the pleader evidently considered a defense, but which is manifestly insufficient in law. There is also a counterclaim for damages for the alleged imperfection of the goods sold by plaintiff to defendant within the dates mentioned in the complaint ; the damages claimed amounting to more than three times the price for which the goods were sold. To this counterclaim the plaintiff has replied with a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-11\">The defendant makes no effort to show that he has in fact any defense to the action, or any ground for the claim embraced in his counterclaim. On the other hand, the plaintiff exhibits numerous letters from defendant acknowledging the indebtedness, giving excuses for nonpayment, and begging for time. In none of these letters is there a hint or suggestion of any such claim in behalf of defendant against plaintiff as is set up in the answer. These letters, coupled with the complete omission of the defendant to sustain his denials and allegations, compel the conclusion that the answer was interposed solely for the purpose of delay. The excuse for suffering the default is also unsatisfactory. The cause was moved onto the short calendar, and the order so placing it, together with a notice to produce certain papers on the trial, was served on plaintiff\u2019s attorney on May 16, 1906. The cause was reached for trial on May 19, 1908, and an inquest taken. The attorney seems to have taken no steps to ascertain when the cause would appear on the calendar, or to have an appearance on the part ,of defendant when it did so appear. The whole history of the case suggests merely an effort to stave off judgment as long as possible, of which effort the suffering of a default was probably a part; the defendant hoping that his default would be excused upon terms involving the payment of only a moderate amount of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to open the default denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
