One of the defendant\u2019s by-laws, prepared by a committee of which the plaintiff was a member, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-3\">\u201cSick benefit is payable only then when the elected physician of the lodge and the sick committee reports a member sick and unable to work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The plaintiff does not assert that he was not bound by said by-law, and it is undisputed that the physician of the lodge refused to make the required certificate, but certified to the contrary. Something is said respecting an appeal to the Grand Lodge, and a decision by that body; but there is no proper proof of such a decision, or of any law of the order respecting its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.
