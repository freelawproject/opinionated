There was a clear conflict of evidence as to whether the car had stopped or not when the plaintiff stepped off, and we are of the opinion that the weight of evidence is not against the conclusion reached by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">The only other suggestion for a reversal of this judgment is the alleged error of the trial court in excluding evidence. Defendant\u2019s witness had testified to the effect that the plaintiff was drunk, or appeared to be drunk, at the time of the accident, and that he stepped off the car in spite of the motorman\u2019s warning not to do so. The witness was then asked as to whether he had seen the plaintiff drunk on other occasions, and this was, on objection, excluded. We are entirely clear that evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s habits of life was not admissible to prove that he was drunk at the time this accident' occurred, and no case to whitih our attention is called gives any color to such a contention. There are cases in which such evidence might be admissible, but they are not cases of this character.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
