The car, as he saw, was coming very fast.. He thought he would get across\u2014thought to get out of the road; but it hit him. It came too quick, though he hurried as fast as he could. Neglecting the testimony of the defendants\u2019 witness in contradiction, these are. the facts as the plaintiff says for himself. Upon these facts he should not keep his recovery. \u201cWithout any lengthy discussion of the principles applicable to these facts, we think it is clear that the plaintiff did not exercise ordinary prudence. The mere statement of his conduct impresses the mind at once that, in utter disregard of all precautions, he placed himself in front of defendants\u2019 car. The car had only a comparatively few feet to go to cross the line of plaintiff\u2019s course when the latter left the curb. When he saw it, it was proceeding at a considerably more rapid pace than he was. By the time he had proceeded from the curb to the track the car had so covered the distance that it was practically upon him as he stepped upon the track. If he had exercised the slightest heed by either looking or listening, he would have detected its presence in such proximity as to disclose at once the foolhardiness of stepping upon the track in front of it. It is true that the defendant\u2019s emp\u00edoy\u00e9s were under the obligation to manage the car with care and prudence; but this obligation of. care was not confined to them. It also rested upon the plaintiff, and their negligence, if they were guilty of it, did not relieve him from the consequences of his own fault.\u201d Lofsten v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 184 N. Y. 148, 150, 76 N. E. 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Moreover, it was error to charge in this case that it was the duty of the motorman to give warning in approaching the crossing and to slow down. The plaintiff was aware of the approach of the car (Huber v. Nassau Electric R. Co., <em>22 </em>App. Div. 426, 48 N. Y. Supp. 38), and the peril was apparent (Stabenau v. Atlantic Ave. R. Co., 155 N. Y. 511, 50 N. E. 277, 63 Am. St. Rep. 698). The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">GILDERSLEEVE, P. J., concurs. SEABURY, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
