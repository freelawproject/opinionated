The assessment in 1900 of the tax for nonpayment of which the sale was made was void. The land was of a nonresident. The statute required that nonresident lands should be set down and assessed in a separate part of the assessment roll. Tax Law, Laws 1896, p. 807, c. 908, \u00a7 29. There being a dispute on the argument before us whether this had been done, it was agreed that the roll should be submitted to us. That has been done, and resident and nonresident lands are not separately set down and assessed in the roll, but promiscuously. The land was therefore never assessed, from which it follows that there was no jurisdiction to sell. The county treasurer\u2019s power of sale, both by the express words and the scheme of the statute, is restricted to lands assessed as nonresident. He could not by selling other lands bring them under the said statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>(Sanders v. Saxton, 89 App. Div. 421, 73 N. Y.

All concur; MILLER, J., on the ground that the defect in the tax proceedings was jurisdictional, and that the five-year statute of limitations (Tax Law, Laws 1896, p. 841, e. 908, \u00a7 132) is applicable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
