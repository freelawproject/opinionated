The answer alleges that the note was given for an illegal consideration and that the note was void as being contrary to public policy. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and from the judgment entered upon this dismissal the plaintiff appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-16\">The facts of the case are undisputed. Prior to the marriage of the defendant\u2019s daughter to Albert Leib, the defendant promised 'to pay Leib $3,000 upon consideration that Leib should marry his daughter. Leib and the defendant\u2019s daughter were married, and the defendant paid Leib $1,900 and delivered to him the note now in suit. The court below, in dismissing the complaint, evidently adopted the theory of the counsel for the defendant that the consideration for the note was against public policy and that the note was void. It is now too well settled to warrant extended discussion that our law regards marriage as a valid consideration for a contract. Wright v. Wright, 54 N. Y. 437; Peck v. Vandemark, 99 N. Y. 30, 1 N. E. 41; In the Matter of Baker, 83 App. Div. 530, 82 N. Y. Supp. 390. In Chichester\u2019s Ex\u2019x v. Vass\u2019 Adm\u2019r, 1 Munf. (Va.) 98, 4 Am.

Such contracts are, of course, invalid, and have frequently been so declared. Duval v. Wellman, 124 N. Y. 156, 26 N. E. 343; 9 Cyc. 518. The contract made in the present case is of an entirely different character.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
