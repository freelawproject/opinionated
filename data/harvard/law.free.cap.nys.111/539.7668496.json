The recovery is for $50 on the theory that the carriage was sold for $500, but there is no proof of the price it was sold for. The testimony for the plaintiff is filled with hearsay and conclusions, but they have to be disregarded. Only probative evidence counts. Again, it is doubtful if there is any proof that the carriage sold was that of the defendant. It apparently was not at the place where it is proved that the defendant\u2019s was.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-20\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur, except HOOKER, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
