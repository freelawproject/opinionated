The trial judge granted a new trial which resulted in a jury verdict in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-17\">The instant appeal presented the critical issue as to whether reversible error was committed in granting a new trial; specifically, whether the trial judge abused his legal discretion in granting a new trial in that it was not \u201cexercised in accordance with ascertainable legal standards\u201d and was a usurpation of the function of the jury: Lind v. Schenley Industries, Inc., 278 F.2d 79 (3 Cir.,1960), cert. den. 364 U.S. 835, 81 S.Ct. 58, 5 L.Ed.2d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-21\">Plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a conductor on one of its passenger trains. He was injured when, in the course of his employment, he tried to close a railroad coach door which stuck because of a defective mechanism \u2014 a gripping device used to retain tension on the hand brake of the coach which is called a \u201cdog\u201d. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendant had failed to provide him with a safe place to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-22\">At the trial under review the existence of the defective mechanism was not disputed by the defendant. No evidence was adduced by the plaintiff as to when or how the defect came into being. The trial judge instructed the jury that the defendant could not be found negligent unless it knew or should have known of the defective condition of the mechanism prior to the happening of the accident. Under the circumstances stated the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant must be regarded as a factual finding that the defendant had constructive notice of the existence of the defective condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-23\">The trial judge set aside the jury\u2019s verdict because or his conclusion that the evidence failed to establish defendant\u2019s \u201cknowledge\u201d of the defective mechanism \u201cnor anything from which such knowledge could be inferred\u201d and that \u201cin the absence of proof of either actual or constructive notice, plaintiff has failed to establish his case and a new trial must be granted.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-24\">We are of the opinion that the trial judge erred in not giving effect to the inference of negligence warranted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number><em>res ispa loquitur </em>situation in the instant case, and as a consequence he usurped the fact-finding function of the jury when he granted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The inference of negligence permissible under the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine was certainly sufficient \u201cto justify with reason\u201d the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant was negligent. Rogers v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., 352 U.S. 500, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 493 (1957). The vitality of Rogers has just been reaffirmed \u2014 Basham v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 372 U.S. 699, 83 S.Ct. 965, 10 L.Ed.2d 80 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">That a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>situation existed here was established by the undisputed evidence that the defendant had exclusive control of the railroad coach and its appurtenant mechanisms; that one of these mechanisms, \u201cthe dog\u201d, was defective and its condition was the precipitating cause of the accident which resulted in whatever injury was sustained by the plaintiff; that the accident was such as in the ordinary course of things would not have happened if the defendant had used proper care with respect to the \u201cdog\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">In Jesionowski v. Boston <em>&amp; </em>Maine Railroad, 329 U.S. 452, 67 S.Ct. 401, 91 L.Ed. 416 (1947), where the Supreme Court, in specific terms, first made the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>as stated in Sweeney v. Erving, 228 U.S. 233, 33 S.Ct. 416, 57 L.Ed. 815 (1913), applicable to Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act cases, it was said at page 456 of 329 U.S., at page 403 of 67 S.Ct., 91 L.Ed. 416:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-8\">\u201cIn San Juan Light [&amp; Transit] Co. v. Requena, 224 U.S. 89, 98-99 [32 S.Ct. 399, 56 L.Ed. 680], this Court said: \u2018when a thing which causes injury, without fault of the injured person, is shown to be under the exclusive control of the defendant, and the injury is such as in the ordinary course of things does not occur if the one having such control uses proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of an explanation, that the injury arose from the defendant\u2019s want of care.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-Wq\">and at page 457 of 329 U.S., at page 404 of 67 S.Ct., 91 L.Ed. 416:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-13\">\u201cA conceptualistic interpretation of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>has never been used by this Court to reduce the jury\u2019s power to draw inferences from facts. Such an interpretation unduly narrows the doctrine as this Court has applied it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-14\">\u201cThis Court said, in Sweeney v. Erving, 228 U.S. 233, 240 [33 S.Ct. 416, 57 L.Ed. 815] [1913], a decision which cut through the mass of verbiage built up around the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>that <em>\u2018res ipsa loquitur </em>means that the <em>facts of the occurrence warrant the inference of negligence, </em>not that they compel such an inference; that <em>they furnish circumstantial evidence of negligence where direct evidence of it may be lacking, </em>but it is evidence to be weighed, not necessarily to be accepted as sufficient; that they call for explanation or rebuttal, not necessarily that they require it; <em>that they make a case to be decided by the jury, </em>not that they forestall the verdict.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis supplied)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Here the defendant had exclusive control of the railroad coach and its appurtenant mechanisms; the accident was such as in the ordinary course of things would not have occurred if the defendant had used proper care with respect to the mechanism which precipitated the plaintiff's injury, and as a consequence it afforded reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose from the defendant\u2019s want of care. San Juan Light &amp; Transit Company v. Requena, 224 U.S. 89, 32 S.Ct. 399, 56 L.Ed. 680 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">As earlier stated, the defendant did not dispute the existence of the defective mechanism. Its defense testimony was <em>limited </em>to that of its physician who testified in substance that the plaintiff did not suffer any injuries. In short, there was no attempt by the defendant railroad to make \u201cexplanation or rebuttal\u201d of the evidence with respect to the defective mechanism under its exclusive control as it was required to do under Jesionowski v. Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">This Court has applied the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>in FELA cases time and again. We did so in Wiles v. New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad Company, 283 F.2d 328 (3 Cir., 1960), cert. den. 364 U.S. 900, 81 S.Ct. 232, 5 L.Ed.2d 193 where a defective jack used to raise a railroad hopper car slipped and threw its operator some 15 feet. Speaking for the Court, Chief Judge Biggs there said (283 F.2d pp. 330-331):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-6\">\u201cIt is clear that under the circumstances of this case Wiles ordinarily would be entitled to the inference of negligence afforded by the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine since the jack and its internal mechanism were under the Railroad\u2019s exclusive control and the accident was not one which would ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">In Forsman v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 280 F.2d 315 (3 Cir., 1960) and Weigand v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 267 F.2d 281 (3 Cir., 1959), where Judge McLaughlin spoke for the Court, we held that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>applied. In both cases a railroad employee was injured when ground on railroad property suddenly gave way. In Forsman it was said (280 F.2d pp. 317-318):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-9\">\u201cAt the close of the whole case there was a true res ipsa loquitur jury question presented as to the defendant railroad. The proofs indicated that the unusual accident involved would not have ordinarily occurred in the absence of negligence, that it took place on premises exclusively controlled by defendant and that plaintiff was blameless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">In Weigand, where the plaintiff, an employee of the defendant railroad, was injured when ground between intervening railroad tracks \u201csuddenly gave way\u201d it was said (267 F.2d p. 282):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-11\">\u201cWithout detailing them at length here, the facts embraced within them a res ipsa loquitur situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">Again, in Sweeting v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 142 F.2d 611 (3 Cir., 1944), we held that the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine was applicable where a railroad employee was electrically shocked to death in a locomotive cab. Speaking for the Court Judge McLaughlin there said (142 F.2d p. 613):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-13\">\u201cIf Sweeting was shocked within the cab, such accident, ordinarily speaking, would not have happened if those having the control of the locomotive and of the cab, used proper care and warrants the inference of negligence; <em>in other words, res ipsa loquitur\u201d, </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">In Lukon v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 131 F.2d 327 (3 Cir., 1942) we held the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine applicable whether the evidence was to the effect that a railroad section hand was found dead with a fractured skull alongside tracks over which a locomotive had just passed; that coal in the tender of the locomotive was not trimmed; that lumps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>of coal were found lying about the head of the section hand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The facts in the instant case are singularly analogous to the situation in Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co. v. O\u2019Neill, 211 F.2d 190 (6 Cir., 1954) where a railroad employee was injured when one side of a heavy steel ash pan which he was installing fell against him as a result of the breaking of one of two bolts holding a chain used in lifting the pan by hook and jack. There was no direct evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant railroad; there was no evidence as to what caused the bolt to break or that it was defective. Judgment on a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff was reversed and a new trial ordered, on the theory that there was \u201cno evidence of any kind in what way it [the bolt] was defective, or that it was not a hidden defect, or that the appellant [railroad] knew or should have known that it was defective.\u201d The Supreme Court reversed in a per curiam opinion sub nom, O\u2019Neill v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., 348 U.S. 956, 75 S.Ct. 447, 99 L.Ed. 747 (1955), with directions to reinstate the judgment in favor of the plaintiff entered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">And too see Shenker v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, 374 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1667, 10 L.Ed.2d 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">There remains this to be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">The mere circumstance that the plaintiff in the instant case failed to receive the benefit of a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine instruction to the jury with respect to the permissible inference of negligence warranted by the facts as established by the undisputed proof of the existence of the defective mechanism cannot operate to deprive him of the fruits of a jury finding of defendant\u2019s negligence sans such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Nor is the inexplicable failure of the plaintiff to <em>assert in terms, </em>here and below, his right to the benefit of the application of the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine,, of any consequence inasmuch as the facts which established a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>situation were presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">\u201cRes ipsa loquitur was in the case from the moment the complaint was filed under the general allegation of negligence\u201d as was said in Weigand v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, supra. Further, here, \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Pre-Trial Statement\u201d specifically averred that \u201cThe defendant was negligent in permitting a broken dog to be on this ear when it knew or should have known of the existence of the dog and failed to make proper repairs to it\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cAnswer to Interrogatories\u201d alleged the negligent existence of the \u201cbroken dog\u201d as the cause of his injuries; plaintiff\u2019s Deposition, long prior to the trial, described in detail the nature of the defective mechanism as he obseiwed it after the accident; and finally, the District Judge who presided at the \u201cPre-Trial Conference\u201d noted that the-plaintiff\u2019s case was based on the allegation that defendant was negligent intermitting a broken dog on the car\u201d and' in failing \u201cto make proper repairs\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-14\">The <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>doctrine is-simply a rule of evidence and like any other rule of evidence it is brought into-play where the situation presented makes, it applicable. It does not have to be pleaded in the complaint or \u201cnoticed\u201d by specific designation to the adverse party at pre-trial or at trial, since it is neither a cause of action nor a ground for recovery, nor an \u201cissue\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-15\">In Jesionowski v. Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, supra, 329 U.S. at page 454, 67 S.Ct. at page 402, 91 L.Ed. 416, the Supreme Court described the res ipsa loquitur doctrine as a <em>\u201ctrial rule </em>under which negligence may be inferred from unusual happenings growing out of condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>tions under a defendant\u2019s control.\u201d (emphasis supplied) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">In Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 46, pp. 48-49, 68 S.Ct. 391, 392-393, 92 L.Ed. 468 (1948) the doctrine was referred to as a \u201crule\u201d with the further statement that \u201cThe <em>rule </em>deals only with permissible inferences from unexplained events.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">On the score of the application- of the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine in the instant case the following statement by Judge Magruder in United States v. Hull, 195 F.2d 64, 66 (1 Cir., 1952) may well be quoted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-6\">\u201cThe use of the Latin phrase <em>\u2018res ipsa </em>loquitur\u2019 in this connection may be unfortunate, as suggesting that some exotic doctrine is involved. It is nothing more than a case of circumstantial evidence, where plaintiff has proved enough \u2018to get to the jury\u2019, and where the inference of negligence, though not necessarily a required one, is a permissible one on the balance of probabilities. See Prosser on Torts \u00a7 43 (1941); Sweeney v. Erving, 1913, 228 U.S. 233, 238-240, 33 S.Ct. 416, 57 L.Ed. 815.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">Significantly pertinent here is the following statement, in relevant part, in Jesionowski, 329 U.S. at page 458, 67 S.Ct. at page 404, 91 L.Ed. 416:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-18\">\u201cIt would run counter to common everyday experience to say that * * the jury was without authority to infer that either the negligent operation of the train or the negligent maintenance of the instrumentalities * * * was the cause of the derailment. It was uncontroverted that the railroad had exclusive control of both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-19\">For the reasons stated the Judgment of the District Court entered in favor of defendant on June 27, 1961, pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdict at the second trial will be vacated; the Order of the District Court, dated May 1, 1961, granting defendant\u2019s Motion for a New Trial will be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to reinstate the Judgment of the District Court entered April 27, 1961, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the sum of $11,750 with costs, pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdict on April 21, 1961.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-18\">. 85 Stat. 65, as amended, <em>45 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 51 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b906-25\">. 193 F.Supp. <em>767, </em>769 (W.D.Pa.1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b907-9\">.

In such cases it is said, <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>\u2014 the thing speaks for itself; that is to say, <em>if there is nothing to explain or rebut the inference that arises from the way in which the thing happened, it may </em>fairly he found to have been occasioned by negligence.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b909-10\">.

It suggests no decisions with controlling facts comparable to the unique situation admittedly permeating the whole litigation before us. It calls for vacation of the judgment entered after the second trial as to which it states that the only issue there concerned was that of damages. Actually, that trial properly resulted in a general verdict in favor of the defendant. The opinion\u2019s next stop is to reverse the order following the first trial which granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. It then directs that the verdict and the judgment for the plaintiff be reinstated. In so doing, the opinion nimbly passes over the glaring fact that the doctrine or res ipsa loquitur upon which the reversal is entirely based was never presented, expressly or impliedly, in the pleadings, pretrial, trial, post trial or on appeal; was indeed disclaimed by plaintiff-appellee at the re-arguments of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">There was no contention ever in this suit that plaintiff could not have asserted a res ipsa loquitur theory in connection with his action but we are dealing with a condition not a theory. And the unescapable condition here is that res ipsa loquitur was not, and down to this moment is not, any part of plaintiff\u2019s evidential proof or any part of this cause from its inception to the current opinion of this court. The majority grudgingly concedes that it was never before the jury but nevertheless announces the amazing interpretation of the verdict as based upon res ipsa loquitur \u201csans such an instruction\u201d. The majority refuses to face up to the record which plainly reveals the uncontradicted true trial situation detailed by the plaintiff to the court, jury and defense. The nub of it was that plaintiff undertook to show actual or constructive notice of the broken dog in the defendant and asserted that he had done so by evidence that the dog was broken at the time of the accident. That was not invocation of res ipsa loquitur, namely, that control of the dog by the defendant warranted an inference of negligence. And there was no misapprehension of the trial issue by the parties or the judge. No one concerned, including the plaintiff, had the slightest thought that the whole schema of the plaintiff would be eliminated from the case and that there would be substituted in its stead a new ground, formulated by this court following the third appellate argument. In reliance upon that new ground two verdicts and judgments in favor of the defendant are to be set aside and plaintiff\u2019s judgment, into which res ipsa loquitur never entered, is to be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">The hard effort to obtain the above named result refuses to be concerned with the palpable injustice of the decision. It refuses to follow a fundamental concept of the doctrine it calls upon. If there had ever been an inkling that res ipsa loquitur would be urged, the defense would have been specifically entitled as of right to affirmatively offer evidence to overcome inferences that the dog broke because it was defective, or lack of due care by the railroad, etc. That line of proof would stem directly from an issue of res ipsa loquitur being raised. In those circumstances, the question of whether the defense proof had overcome the res ipsa inference would be properly for the jury. But none of those elements was involved in the first trial or the second either for that matter. The defendant had no opportunity or cause to refute a non-existent charge which had not been made or even hinted at and of which the court and jury had no knowledge. It cannot be overemphasized that the referred to non-existent charge is the proposition at this time injected into the litigation by the majority opinion viz. that negligence in the defendant could be inferred from its control of the broken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>dog, to which must be joined its unmentioned but indispensable corollary, that the inference could be overcome if defendant\u2019s explanation, if in evidence, was accepted as satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">It follows that the defendant has been deprived of its right to appear and defend itself in the after suit conceived by this court. A judgment is being entered on a view of the cause which never existed until the majority opinion. The sole excuse offered on behalf of that decision is that it all comes down to this \u2014 the field of our action is limited to either reinstatement of the judgment entered upon the jury\u2019s verdict at the first trial or the affirmance of the judgment in favor of the defendant entered pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdict at the second trial. The majority is of course proceeding in the utmost good faith but, even assuming the dilemma posed to be accurate, that alone is too precarious a foundation for, what seems to me, the grievous wrong being inflicted upon the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">GANEY, Circuit Judge, joins in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
