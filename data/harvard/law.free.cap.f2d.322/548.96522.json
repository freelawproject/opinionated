Representations made as to the nature of the business they intended to conduct, the credit rating of Willis and character references given made it possible for them to obtain a line of credit with Cerullo\u2019s Electric Store, a wholesale house in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, dealing in electrical appliances. On the basis of the credit extended, Willis and Karesky obtained merchandise from Cerullo\u2019s of a wholesale value of $13,919 over a period of a few weeks. Checks tendered in payment which were returned because of insufficient funds and the dishonor of trade acceptances caused Cerullo\u2019s to discontinue credit during November of 1956. Of the sum total of $13,919 owing, only $1,150 was paid, consisting of $500 in cash to cover a check in that amount returned because of insufficient funds and $650 in money orders to induce continuance of the line of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-18\">Shortly after discontinuance of the line of credit, it came to the attention of Cerullo\u2019s that the store opened by Willis and Karesky had been closed and padlocked and that custody of the merchandise found there was in the landlord. Inventory of this remaining merchandise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>established a wholesale value of $5,991.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">There was evidence of sale and delivery by Sandy\u2019s Discount House of electrical appliances obtained from Cerullo\u2019s Electric Store to Sport Appliance Stores, located in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and to Arlmont Pharmacy, located in Belmont, Massachusetts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The amount charged to Sport Appliance Stores for merchandise delivered, as shown on the invoices from Sandy\u2019s Discount House, was $1,898.84. There was testimony that there was a mark-down on the merchandise of ten to fifteen per cent below the wholesale level. The amount charged to Arlmont Pharmacy, as shown on invoices of Sandy\u2019s Discount House, for merchandise delivered there was $1,170.73. There was no testimony with respect to any mark-down of price from wholesale level on this merchandise, and it would appear from the invoices that it was charged to Arlmont Pharmacy on the basis of cost to Sandy\u2019s Discount House, which would be the wholesale price. Leonard Cerullo, president of Cerullo\u2019s Electric Store, testified that the mark-up from wholesale price for retail sales ranged from fourteen to thirty-six per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Considering this evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, wholesale value of merchandise shipped to Sport Appliance Stores would be $2,233.92 and, by applying a thirty-six per cent mark-up for retail price, the retail value would be $3,038.14. As shown by the invoices, the wholesale value of the merchandise shipped to Arlmont Pharmacy was $1,170.73, and, applying the same thirty-six per cent mark-up from wholesale, the maximum retail value of the merchandise would be $1,592.19. Based on these computations, which find support in the evidence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the sum total of retail value of the merchandise shipped by Sandy\u2019s Discount House in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, to Sport Appliance Stores and Arlmont Pharmacy in Massachusetts would not exceed $4,630.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">The only other proof upon which the Government relied to establish that the merchandise shipped in interstate commerce had a value of $5,000 or more is contained in Exhibits G-22 and G-26, introduced in evidence on the testimony of Special Agent Houlihan of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">G-22, which was prepared by him prior to trial on the basis of investigation conducted, lists items of merchandise furnished to Sandy\u2019s Discount House by Cerullo\u2019s which were sold by Sandy\u2019s Discount House to Sport Appliance Stores and Arlmont Pharmacy. The Exhibit purports to show, under a column captioned \u201cTotal Retail Price,\u201d that the retail price value of the merchandise furnished to Sport Appliance Stores amounted to $5,329.84, and that the total retail price value of merchandise furnished to Arlmont Pharmacy amounted to $1,844. Parenthetically, it may be noted that the arithmetical computation of these totals, as they appear on this Exhibit, is not correct. Correct addition of the items of retail price of Sport Appliance Stores merchandise shows a total amount of $3,885.15 and of the Arlmont Pharmacy items, a total of $1,734.95. Accordingly, on correct computation of the items of retail price shown on this Exhibit, the total of retail value of the merchandise shipped to both stores would be $5,620.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">Exhibit G \u2014 26 in evidence was prepared during the course of trial by Agent Houlihan, with the assistance of Agent Boylan, also of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who did not testify. It lists the items of merchandise sold to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Sport Appliance Stores and Arlmont Pharmacy, as shown on the invoices of Sandy\u2019s Discount House, which were introduced in evidence. It also contains a column captioned \u201cList\u201d in which Agent Houlihan set forth list retail prices of the various items of merchandise which, added together, show total retail value of $5,315.58.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">These Exhibits, G \u2014 22 and G-26, were admitted in evidence over objection of counsel for Willis. The ground of the objection was that they contained hearsay and that the opinion of value of the merchandise stated therein did not constitute competent proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Summaries of entries in books and records made and kept in the regular course of business are admissible in evidence to aid the jury when prepared by a person shown to be competent to summarize such information and the books and records from which the same was obtained are available to the adverse party for purposes of cross-examination of the witness through whom the summary is offered. The practice of admitting such summaries in evidence is confined generally to situations where the books and records constituting the primary proofs are voluminous and the product of technical skill in the professional fields of bookkeeping and accounting. See 8 Wig-more, Evidence, \u00a7 1230 (3rd ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">It has also been held uniformly that summaries supported by primary evidence in the record are likewise admissible. United States v. Johnson, 319 U.S. 503, 63 S.Ct. 1233, 87 L.Ed. 1546 (1942); United States v. Augustine, 189 F.2d 587 (3rd Cir. 1951); Papadakis v. United States, 208 F.2d 945 (9th Cir. 1953); United States v. Bernard, 287 F.2d 715 (7th Cir. 1961). But where access to the primary sources from which a summary is prepared is not available to an adverse party for the purpose of cross-examination to test the accuracy of the summarized information, or where the summary, in the nature of secondary evidence, is not derived from other competent supporting proofs in the case, the admission thereof may, in particular circumstances, constitute prejudicial error. United States v. Ward, 169 F.2d 460 (3rd Cir. 1948); United States v. Michener, 152 F.2d 880 (3rd Cir. 1945). In the case of United States v. Ward, supra, it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZKD\">\u201c* * * [W] hile it can scarcely be gainsaid that voluminous records may be summarized, or that an expert may interpret and explain certain- evidence in the case and on the basis of such evidence perform tasks beyond the training and experience of the layman juror, it is nevertheless axiomatic that the \u2018expert\u2019 may not go so far as to usurp the exclusive function of the jury to weigh the evidence and determine credibility. Nor may expertness be the medium for injecting into the record material and information not a part of the expert\u2019s qualifications and otherwise inadmissible through his lips. Apropos is the statement we made in United States v. Michener, 3 Cir., 1945, 152 F.2d 880, 883: \u2018The admission into the evidence of the auditors\u2019 conclusions and opinions as distinguished from mere statements of fact summarizing what was observed by them in the records was erroneous. * * * \u2019 And it was in aggravation of the error for Johnson to base his determination of the value of the evidence in the case upon information which had been collected, and which could have been directly submitted to the jury for its appraisal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Agent Houlihan admitted that he was not qualified as an expert to furnish an opinion as to the value of any of the items of merchandise in question and that such information as to value that he included in Exhibits G-22 and G-26 was obtained from Leonard Cerullo and other persons or sources at Cerullo\u2019s Electric Store.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">Leonard Cerullo, in his testimony, merely identified the retail prices set forth in Exhibit G-22 as the prices obtained by Agent Houlihan from Cerullo\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>at the time the Exhibit was prepared. A careful reading of his testimony clearly demonstrates that it could not be considered as an expression of qualified expert opinion verifying the retail price values contained in Exhibit G-22. There was no other testimony which would serve as competent proof of value to support the statement thereof by Agent Houlihan in Exhibit G \u2014 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Even assuming that Agent Houlihan was qualified by his accounting experience to summarize the pertinent records at Cerullo\u2019s, there was no evidence as to the particular records setting forth retail prices which he used, the identity of personnel (other than Leonard Cerullo) from whom he obtained further information in reaching his conclusion, or any evidence of the fact that such records as he did consult were records made and kept with respect to the retail price values in the regular course of Cerullo\u2019s wholesale business. In fact, it would appear that retail prices which might have been furnished to him by any personnel or from records at Cerullo\u2019s were nothing more than retail prices suggested by the manufacturer of the appliances.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The pertinent testimony with respect to the foregoing is quoted from the record as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">Testimony of Frederick T.

We do not suggest it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">\u201cBy the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">\u201cAnd what is the percentage mark-up ordinarily on this range of products ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">\u201cBy the Witness :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">\u201cIt averages between 14 and around 85 to 36%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-14\">\u201cBy the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-15\">\u201c35 to 36% ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-16\">\"By the Witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-17\">\u201cYes.

The statement of retail price values set forth on Exhibits G-22 and G \u2014 26 were not grounded upon any competent evidence that had been adduced at trial. It was not shown that the suggested retail prices on the invoices of Cerullo\u2019s to Sandy\u2019s Discount House were anything more than prices suggested by the manufacturer. The evidence as to other sources of information which he took into consideration in arriving at his conclusions is clearly of hearsay character.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-26\">We conclude that the trial court erred in admitting Exhibits G-22 and G-26 in evidence for the purpose of establishing the value of the merchandise shipped in interstate commerce. Since the value stated in these Exhibits was the only proof from which the jury could infer that the merchandise in question had a value in the amount of $5,000 or more,, we further conclude that the error committed was prejudicial and that the cause should be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-27\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court will be reversed and the cause remanded to that Court for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-14\">. \u201c * * * \u2018Value\u2019 means the face, par, or market value, whichever is the greatest, and the aggregate value of all goods, wares, and merchandise, securities, and money referred to a single indictment shall constitute the value thereof.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2311.
