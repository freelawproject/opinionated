The indictment referred to \u201cTitle 21 U.S.C. 174 \u2014 conspiracy to violate narcotic laws.\u201d It set forth overt acts pursuant to the conspiracy charged to have been committed on October 22, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-18\">Upon trial Cisneros was found guilty of the offense as charged and he was \u25a0 sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. Thereafter Cisneros sought to have his sentence modified <em>pr </em>corrected by petition filed pursuant to Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The ground assigned for this motion was that the indictment had merely made reference to Title 21 \u00a7 174 and did not refer to that section \u201cas amended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-19\">Prior to the amendment of this section on July 18, 1956, 70 Stat. 570, \u00a7 174 of Title 21, provided for a penalty by imprisonment for a period not exceeding two yea-rs. The 1956 amendment increased the penalty under that section so as to provide for imprisonment from 5 to 20 years. Cisneros contended that not only was the indictment itself fatally defective in not referring to the section \u201cas amended\u201d but that his conviction under this indictment would not authorize the imposition of the sentence which he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-20\">The petition for \u00a7 2255 relief was denied and the appeal before us is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-21\">The appellant\u2019s contentions are wholly without merit. Johnson v. United States, 14 Alaska 380, 206 F.2d 806, 808; Steffler v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 121 F.2d 447; United States v. Poindexter, 6 Cir., 293 F.2d 329, 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-22\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
