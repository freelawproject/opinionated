There were three Counts in the indictment but Count III was dismissed, and the defendant was tried under Counts I and II. Numerous errors are specified but the chief ones relate to the following: (a) the admissibility of prior suspicious conduct as bearing on the state of mind of the defendant; (b) instructions of the court as to the elements of the offense charged; and (c) the instruction of the court to the jury to disregard Count III of the indictment because it had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-21\">We have carefully reviewed the record and considered the numerous errors claimed, including those specifically mentioned above. We conclude that the defendant had a fair trial and that the alleged errors are without substance. Babb v. United States, 5 Cir., 252 F.2d 702; United States v. Ritterman, 273 U.S. 261, 47 S.Ct. 371, 71 L.Ed. 636; Weiss v. United States, 122 F.2d 675 (C.A. 5, 1941), cert. den. 314 U.S. 687, 62 S.Ct. 300, 86 L.Ed. 550; Windisch v.
