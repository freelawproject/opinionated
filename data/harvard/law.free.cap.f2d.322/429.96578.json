Pending appeal on the merits, appellant has moved for summary reversal, and, alternatively, for an injunction <em>pendente lite </em>restraining the publication of the tariff. These motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-25\">The United States Tariff Commission made reports to Congress in November, 1960, and January, 1962, proposing new tariff schedules. These proposed schedules were incorporated in the Tariff Classification Act of 1962. In that Act, Section 101(b) (4), Congress directed the inclusion of only those changes in the proposed schedules <em>\u201cas the Commission decides * </em>* * are necessary to reflect changes in tariff treatment made by statute * * * \u201d before or after the date of enactment of the Tariff Classification Act of 1962. (Emphasis supplied.) In making changes, Congress directed that \u201cthe Commission shall apply the standards it applied in its report of November 15, 1960, referred to above.\u201d Section 101(b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-26\">Appellant relies on Section 2<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of Public Law 86-795, passed September 15, 1960, as requiring a \u201cchange in tariff treatment\u201d for waterproof cotton cloth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>which must be, and is not, reflected in the new tariff schedules soon to be published pursuant to the Act. Appellees deny that Public Law 86-795 provides for a \u201cchange in tariff treatment\u201d and rely, in any event, on the fact that in its November 15, 1960, report to Congress outlining the proposed tariff schedules, the traditional waterproof cloth provision was excluded, with a full explanation as to why. The Commission stated that \u201cthe existing tariff provisions with respect to coated or filled fabrics are fragmentary and poorly arranged,\u201d and that \u201cit does not seem desirable or feasible to establish a classification for fabrics on the basis of water repelling unassociated with a coating or filling concept.\u201d Appellant maintains that Public Law 86-795 requires a separate classification for waterproof cotton cloth.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">This Commission proposal for revised tariff schedules was filed with Congress two months after the passage of Public Law 86-795. These proposed schedules lay before Congress for a year and a half before being enacted into law in the Tariff Classification Act of 1962. They showed Congress that the Commission did not feel that Public Law 86-795 required a separate classification for \u201cwaterproof cloth.\u201d And the explanation filed with the proposed schedules explained to Congress why. Under the circumstances, it must be assumed that Congress, in passing the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, agreed with the position of the Commission as reflected in its November 15, 1960, report.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In view of our disposition of the motions we need not reach other grounds asserted as a basis for denial of the relief sought. The appeal on the merits will be heard in due course, but without prejudice to a motion to expedite the hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-18\">.

Section 2 of Public Law 86-795, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 74 Stat. 1051, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-21\">\u201cIn order to insure a correct interpretation of the provision \u2018waterproof doth\u2019 in paragraph 907, Tariff Act of 1930, it is hereby declared that it was and is the true intent and meaning of paragraph 907 to limit the term, \u2018waterproof\u2019, when applied to cloth, \u2018wholly or in chief value of cotton or other vegetable fiber, whether or not in part of India rubber,\u2019 to cloths of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>kind generally used in the manufacture of articles -which are designed to afford protection against water to the extent expected in raincoats, protective sheeting, dress shields, umbrellas, and similar articles.
