Most of the outlets are \u201cGiant Food\u201d Stores; some are designated \u201cSuper Giant.\u201d A \u201cSuper Giant\u201d combines all of the attributes of a supermarket and department store. It sells food, food products, and non-food products which would normally be found in a large chain grocery; small durable consumer goods, such as housewares and electrical appliances; durable goods; and soft goods, including clothing, drugs and soaps.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-17\">In the conduct of its business, and for the purpose of inducing the public to purchase goods at its stores, Giant regularly advertises in the three major newspapers serving the Washington Metropolitan Area. Typical of the \u201cads\u201d placed by Giant were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-18\">\u201cProctor Steam &amp; Dry Iron #10010 Reg. Price $15.95. Adv. Price $8.47.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-19\">\u201cRegina Twin Brush Waxer #400 Reg. Price $66.00. Adv. Price $35.47.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>\u201cRegina Twin Brush Waxer $35.47-Mfg. List $66.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-4\">\u201cSunbeam Mixmaster $24.88-Manu-facturer List Price $37.95.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">On February 4, 1960, the Commission issued a complaint against Giant based on this type of advertising as used in promoting the sale of small household appliances. The complaint charged that \u201cReg. Price,\u201d and variants thereof, represented that Giant had sold the particular product at such price \u201cin the recent, regular course of its business,\u201d and that such representation was untrue. The complaint also charged that \u201cMfr. List,\u201d and variants thereof, represented that the particular product was \u201cusually and customarily sold at retail\u201d at such price, when in fact the represented price was \u201csubstantially in excess of\u201d the usual and customary retail price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">Hearings were held during 1960-61. Concerning the charge of misuse of \u201cregular price\u201d and similar terms, an employee of Giant admitted that his company\u2019s stores had never sold the items at that price. It appeared, however, that Giant had ceased using the term soon after the Commission began investigating Giant in 1959, in accordance with a directive issued by the company to its employees not to refer to the regular price of a product unless Giant had in the recent past sold the product at that price. Giant does not now contest the finding by the Hearing Examiner, adopted by the Commission, that reference to regular prices was deceptive advertising amounting to unfair competition within the proscription of \u00a7 5 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As to this portion of the order, Giant challenges only the propriety of banning practices which it had stopped and which it had promised the Commission not to reinstitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">As to \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s list price,\u201d and similar terms, Giant had neither ceased their use nor voluntarily consented to do so. The Commission called as its witnesses buyers for The Hecht Company, S. Kann Sons Company, and Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., three of the larger department stores serving the Washington Metropolitan Area. The buyers testified that their stores had never sold at list price the products which Giant advertised with the comparison of its selling price to the list price. Taking just one example, Giant advertised the Sunbeam Hand Mixer, with a list price of $21.00, for $13.97. The highest prices at which the other stores sold the same product at that time were $16.49 (Hecht), $14.97 (S. Kann), and $13.49 (Woodward &amp; Lothrop). Additionally, the Commission produced the testimony of several consumer witnesses, all of whom testified that they understood Giant\u2019s advertising to mean that the manufacturer\u2019s list price was the price they would pay if they purchased the product elsewhere, and that, by buying at Giant, they would realize a \u201csavings\u201d of the difference between list price and Giant\u2019s price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-13\">In rebuttal, Giant showed that the catalogue of the Goodyear Service Stores, which operated several stores in the Metropolitan Area, advertised at least some of the same products at prices the same as the manufacturer\u2019s list prices to which Giant referred in its advertising; that manufacturers advertised their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>products at suggested list prices in Life Magazine, McCalls, Look Magazine, and Consumer Reports Buying Guide; and that several purchases had been made by agents of Giant in stores in the Metropolitan Area at the manufacturer\u2019s list price for the item. On this record the Trial Examiner issued the cease and desist order which, with certain modifications in language by the Commission, is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Giant\u2019s first major contention is that the Commission exceeded its authority by defining \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s list price\u201d as the usual and customary retail price in the trade area where the term is used, and that the term is neither \u201cfalse, misleading, nor deceptive.\u201d We do not understand the Commission to hold that use of the term \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s list price\u201d is unlawful <em>per se; </em>rather, it is unlawful only if it is not the usual and customary retail price in the area. The use of price lists and suggested retail prices is not confined to any one industry. Although not of recent origin, it could be justifiably called a modern phenomenon of large-scale merchandising.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It has been used as a means of effecting unlawful resale price maintenance; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but it has also been justified as a means of enabling consumers to identify products and compare actual retail prices of the same product.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, Giant urges the latter justification in the instant case. A suggested retail price may perhaps serve as an identifying factor for comparison purposes. But, if the \u201c[advertisements * * * are capable of two meanings, one of which is false, [they] are misleading.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 9Thus, if the Commission was correct that Giant\u2019s use of \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s list price\u201d was false and deceptive, then the order must be upheld, even though the term might have performed a different \u2014 and lawful \u2014 function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-17\">There can be no doubt at this late date that advertising which is false or deceptive is within the proscription of \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As noted above, two other courts of appeals have previously upheld Commission orders against the use of \u201cregular price\u201d unless the company had itself sold the product at that price.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, orders have been upheld against manufacturers, prohibiting pre-ticketing of products unless the product is \u201cusually and regularly sold at retail\u201d at the preticketed price in trade areas where the representation is made.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>sion here has determined that the use of the term \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s list price\u201d represents to the public that that was the price at which the product was usually and customarily sold by other stores in the area. This determination was within its power, unless it was \u201carbitrary or clearly wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We cannot say that it was, particularly in view of the consumers\u2019 testimony adduced at the hearing. If a manufacturer can be prevented from placing a deceptive price on its product, we see no reason to permit a retailer to make reference to a deceptive suggested price. It is immaterial that all potential buyers are not included in that class of persons who would be cajoled by Giant\u2019s use of the term. The Act was not intended to protect \u201csophisticates.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Two other contentions of petitioner can be disposed of here. Giant urges that the policy behind the Automobile Information Disclosure Act,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which requires automobile dealers to disclose the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail delivery price to customers, prevents the imposition of a contrary policy where small appliances are involved. We agree with the disposition made of a similar contention by the Fourth Circuit in Baltimore Luggage Co. v. F. T. C., supra, where the court reviewed the legislative history of the Act and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-10\">\u201cIt is quite obvious that the Automobile Information Disclosure Act was enacted in the effort to remedy a situation peculiar to the automobile industry brought about by widespread fraudulent or deceptive practices principally indulged in by retailers. The Act does indicate that preticketing <em>per se </em>is not illegal, but the Commission does not so contend. There is nothing in this Act to indicate that fictitious or deceptive preticketing has Congressional approval.\u201d (296 F.2d at 612.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">Although this holding was in the context of a proceeding directed against a manufacturer for deceptive pre-ticketing, we believe it to be equally relevant in the circumstances of a challenged use by a retailer of deceptive references to manufacturer\u2019s list price. No contention of <em>per se </em>illegality is advanced in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">Nor can we agree with Giant that the Commission is \u201cadministratively estopped\u201d from restricting the deceptive use of \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s list price\u201d' by virtue of a prior decision, In the Matter of Filderman Corporation, F.T.C.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>Docket No. 7572, December 30, 1959. The Commission ordered Filderman to cease advertising prices as \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s list prices\u201d when the advertised prices were actually in excess of the list prices. The order permitted the use of correct list prices, but it cannot be read as authorizing their use in a deceptive or misleading manner, which is what is challenged here. Thus, the factual situation is significantly different. Nor can Giant claim that it relied to its detriment on the action in Filderman, since Giant was using the term in its advertising prior to the Commission\u2019s decision in that case. Finally, an administrative agency is not \u201cbound * * * to deal with all cases at all times as it has dealt with some that seem comparable.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">Thus, if the Commission\u2019s finding that the manufacturer\u2019s list price used by Giant was not the usual and customary retail price in the Washington Metropolitan Area is supported by substantial evidence on the record viewed as a whole, the order must be upheld.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Disposition of this issue also requires consideration of Giant\u2019s contention that it did not receive a fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">The evidence on which the Commission based its finding that the represented price was not the usual and customary retail price consisted of the testimony of the buyers from the large area department stores. It will be recalled that these witnesses testified that their respective stores had never sold the products at list price. Each testified on the basis of notes which had been taken while reviewing their stores\u2019 records. At the close of direct examination of the first witness, counsel for Giant requested that he be allowed to reserve the right to cross-examine until he could make further investigation into the testimony on direct. This request was denied. Counsel then proceeded to cross-examine, and, upon learning that the testimony was from notes taken in connection with an examination of the company records, requested subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>to issue for production of the records themselves. This request was also denied, as were similar requests in the case of each of the buyer-witnesses; and Giant took an interlocutory appeal to the Commission from the denials. When the examiner denied a motion for a continuance pending the outcome of the appeal, Giant\u2019s counsel began presenting its case in defense. Subsequently, before Giant completed its case, the Commission reversed the examiner\u2019s denial of subpoenas, which were then issued to the three stores and the records sought brought before the examiner.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">At this point, upon further hearings, counsel for Giant refused to take the return of the subpoenas and to examine the witnesses on the basis of the records which had been brought in. The reason assigned was that the examiner had previously ruled cross-examination closed, and counsel argued that, if he were to proceed to examine the witnesses, they would be his witnesses and he would be bound by their testimony. The examiner repeatedly assured counsel that examination could proceed without regard to form and that leading questions could be asked. He also stated, as phrased by the Commission, \u201cthat there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>was no basis for counsel\u2019s concern that he would be \u2018bound\u2019 by what the witnesses said if he called them as his own, since the case was being tried not before a jury but before an examiner whose sole interest was in an objective appraisal of the value of their testimony.\u201d Counsel, however, persisted in his refusal to go further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Giant then moved to have the testimony of the buyer-witnesses stricken from the record because of an inadequate opportunity to cross-examine them. This motion was denied, and the hearings ended. The Commission subsequently held that the examiner was correct in denying the motion to strike the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\"> Giant had, of course, the right to cross-examine the witnesses concerning their testimony on direct examination. As indicated, counsel did cross-examine four of the five buyer-witnesses concerning the knowledge of each witness as to the material facts on which the testimony was based, albeit without the benefit of records which might well have proved to be of material aid. There can be no doubt that Giant was entitled to see the relevant records on which the testimony was based; and we can assume that accepted rules of evidence would require their production at a time when cross-examination is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">However, as the Supreme Court has said, \u201c * * * administrative agencies like the Federal Trade Commission have never been restricted by the rigid rules of evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This is not to say that such an agency can ignore <em>all </em>rules, but only that some leeway shall be afforded. It cannot, for example, refuse to permit any cross-examination or unduly limit it.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because the Commission \u201cis, at once, the accuser, the prosecutor, the judge and the jury,\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> it must remain alert to observe accepted standards of fairness. Reviewing courts must, therefore, be alert to ascertain that the true substance of a fair hearing is not denied to a party, bearing in mind that the inordinate delay common in administrative hearings of the sort now before us is a legitimate cause of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">Here, the examiner refused to continue the hearings until the full Commission had an opportunity to act on the appeal. When, however, the subpoenas subsequently issued, he was willing to afford Giant all of the benefits of cross-examination, though hesitating to apply the name. The pertinent records were produced, and counsel was told that he could recall the witnesses, ask leading or any other type of questions, and not be concerned with being \u201cbound\u201d by their testimony. We share the Commission\u2019s bewilderment as to why the examiner \u201cbalked at using the label \u2018cross-examination\u2019 to describe the procedure he was allowing [Giant] to follow, when he was in fact withholding from it none of the substance of the right of cross-examination. But it is far more difficult to see why [Giant] refused to conduct such examination when the opportunity to do so was made available to it in all except name.\u201d Accordingly, Giant\u2019s contention that the buyers\u2019 testimony was not properly a part of the record fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">It appears to be true, as Giant claims, that the testimony in question was the only evidence proffered by the Commission to show that the manufacturer\u2019s list price was not the usual and customary retail price in the area. Had this evidence failed, the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>case would have failed along with it. For the use of manufacturer\u2019s list price is not illegal <em>per se; </em>rather, it is false and deceptive only if the price is not adhered to by area retailers. The latter must be shown by substantial evidence before the use of the term will be illegal.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">Thus, we reach the question of whether there is substantial evidence on the whole record to support the Commission\u2019s finding that Giant\u2019s use of the term was false and deceptive. We hold that there is. It is the function of the 'Commission to pass upon the weight to be accorded to the evidence before it; and to malee the choice, if necessary, between varying inferences which might be drawn therefrom. The possibility of drawing either of two inconsistent inferences from the evidence does not prevent the Commission from drawing one of them.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Courts, however, do not always agree with the Commission that an order is supported by substantial evidence. A ease in point is Rayex Corp. v. F. T. C., supra, recently decided by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where enforcement was denied of an order eharging false and deceptive pre-ticketing by a manufacturer of sunglasses. The evidence adduced by the Commission that the pre-ticketed price was not the \u201cusual and customary\u201d retail price in the area consisted of testimony by a wholesaler that he \u201cestimated\u201d that only :25% of the area sales were at the preticketed price; evidence of only one purchase made at a price below the preticketed price; and an inconclusive statement by the president of Rayex that \u201cwe have labels that say $1.98 and we have labels which sell for $19.95.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">The paucity of the record before the Second Circuit does not resemble the Commission\u2019s case against Giant. Here, there was testimony that three of the larger department store chains serving the Washington Metropolitan Area had not sold the products in question at or above the suggested list price, at least within the preceding two years. This testimony went uncontradicted.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Giant argues, however, that the Commission ignored the evidence that some area stores sold the products at list price. We can neither say that this evidence was ignored, nor that it belies the existence of substantial evidence to support the order. We agree with the statement in Rayex that \u201cone or two isolated sales at less than the preticketed price is as equally probative of a valid \u2018sale\u2019 on the part of the dealer involved as it is of a deceptive practice.\u201d We hold, however, that evidence that the larger area retailers had not sold at the list price is sufficient to show that list price was not the \u201cusual and customary\u201d retail price in the area. The Commission did not have to prove that the products never, at any time or in any store, sold at the list price. See Helbros Watch Co. v. F. T. C., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">Giant also argues that the Commission did not prove that trade had been diverted from its competitors to itself. This is true. But this was not an essential element of the Commission\u2019s case. The complaint charged that Giant\u2019s practices deceived the public, not that it in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>jnred competition. F. T. C. v. Raladam Co., 316 U.S. 149, 62 S.Ct. 966, 86 L.Ed. 1336 (1942); Koch v. F. T. C., 206 F.2d 311 (6th Cir. 1953); Parke, Austin &amp; Lipscomb, Inc. v. F. T. C., 142 F.2d 437 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 323 U.S. 753, 65 S.Ct. 86, 89 L.Ed. 603 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">Giant urges that its advertising was not deceptive because the following legend was carried in small print at the bottom of each advertisement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-5\">\u201cThe manufacturer\u2019s list prices referred to in this advertisement are inserted to assist you <em>in </em>identification of the products and to allow you to compare accurately the selling prices offered here and elsewhere. The use of the term manufacturer\u2019s list or similar terminology in our advertising is not to imply that Giant has ever sold the advertised product at such list prices, or that the products are being offered for sale generally in the area at such list prices. Many reputable national brand manufacturers issue to retailers, from time to time, suggested retail list prices that are intended to afford reasonable profits to all retailers based upon their traditional costs of marketing. Giant\u2019s employment of self-service supermarket techniques enables it ususally to sell below suggested list prices. Consumers, however, have come to recognize most brand merchandise by the list prices, rather than model numbers. Consequently Giant includes these manufacturer\u2019s list prices so that you may make simple, intelligent comparisons between our selling prices and those of others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">The Commission\u2019s consumer witnesses testified either that they would not normally read such an addendum to an advertisement, or that they had read it and were merely confused by it. That the disclaimer might engender confusion appears to us, as it did to the Commission, to be an understatement. The second sentence disavows any representation of the usual retail price of the product. However, the last sentence appears to assert that the prices \u201cof others\u201d are in fact identical with the suggested list prices. Whether a disclaimer which is in small print and set apart from the main body of an advertisement could ever correct what otherwise would be a deceptive practice, we need not decide. We hold that this particular disclaimer only added to the deceptiveness of the term as used by Giant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-11\">Finally, Giant challenges the scope of the order entered against it by the Commission. First, it urges that the order against the use of \u201cregular price\u201d is not in the public interest, both because the term has not been employed since prior to the time the Commission\u2019s complaint was filed, and because Giant has disavowed any intent to renew its use. However, as the Seventh Circuit has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-12\">\u201cVoluntary discontinuance of an unfair trade practice does not necessarily preclude issuance of a cease and desist order. The order to desist from an abandoned unlawful practice is in the nature of a safeguard for the future. Other than the mere discontinuance at an undisclosed time of their practice relating to the guarantee of their merchandise, petitioners have shown no facts before the Commission which would require that this portion of the order be set aside.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-13\">On the record it appears that Giant discontinued its reference to \u201creg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>xilar price\u201d only after it became aware \u25a0that the Commission was investigating its advertising practices. That investigation, moreover, was directed to the totality of an advertising program which was possibly deceptive in its impact upon the customers. The order before us represents the Commission\u2019s effort to deal finally with the program in its entirety. The voluntary abandonment of part of the program under the circumstances shown by the record does not disable the Commission from formulating a rule of conduct for the future as broad as the derelictions of the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">More insistently, Giant advances two reasons why the order as it stands is defectively broad. First, the \u25a0order allegedly proscribes the use of \u25a0truthful information furnished by suppliers. What we have already said disposes of this argument. Use of \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s list price\u201d is prohibited only so long as it is false and deceptive. If prices to which those terms refer are usually and customarily charged in the area, then their use will be \u201ctruthful;\u201d and such use is not forbidden by the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Giant further argues that the order effectively prevents any use of suggested list price, because of the indenniteness of the words \u201cusual and customary,\u201d and the difficulties posed in determining what prices competing retailers charge. Giant urges that the severity of the penalties for any violation of the order <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> requires a more definite guide to future conduct. The Supreme Court recognized the problem in F. T. C. v. Henry Broch &amp; Co., 368 U.S. 360, 367-368, 82 S.Ct. 431, 435, 436, 7 L.Ed.2d 353 (1962) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-7\">\u201cThe severity of possible penalties prescribed * * * for violations of orders which have become final underlines the necessity for fashioning orders which are, at the outset, sufficiently clear and precise to avoid raising serious questions as to their meaning and application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">This Court and other courts of appeals have upheld orders in analogous cases where the words \u201cusual and customary\u201d were used, as here, in relation to prices being charged at retail in a particular trade area.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Giant, in addition to its own sound business judgment in the periodic ascertainment of current retail pricing, is not without recourse to the Commission for advice. We adopt the following statement from the Second Circuit in Vanity Fair Paper Mills, Inc. v. F. T. C., 311 F.2d 480, 488 (1962), which suggests that both Giant and the Commission carry certain responsibilities;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-11\">\u201cThe difficulties respondent foresees in determining whether it is complying with the order seem factitious. The order contains the usual provision for the filing of a report of compliance * * * and it is scarcely likely that if respondent proposes a method of compliance which the Commission accepts, and thereafter follows it, the Commission will subsequently and without notice claim a violation entailing the civil penalties of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 [45(l)]. If at some future time respondent should desire to change to a procedure different from what it originally proposed, it need not proceed at its peril. The Commission\u2019s offices will still be open for discussion, compare F. T. C. v. National Lead Co.
