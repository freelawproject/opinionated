No appeal was taken. Nelson subsequently filed a motion to hold Batson in contempt for violating the injunction. The District Court found no infringement, and dismissed the proceeding. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-31\">Nelson\u2019s patent disclosed an improved \u201cboom boat,\u201d used to move logs in a log pond in lumbering operations. The boat construction claimed by Nelson combines four elements: (1) a hull with a well between bow and stem; (2) an outboard motor in the well with the propeller projecting beneath the hull; (3) a turntable in the well to which the outboard motor is fixed to permit rotation; and (4) a skeg, or enlarged keel, extending from the propeller to the stern.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nelson\u2019s boat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>is steered by turning the outboard motor, the turntable permitting rotation through a full 360 degrees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-34\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>\u201cA boat construction comprising a hull having a bow and a stern, a well in said hull intermediate said bow and said stern, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>an outboard motor including a propeller, said outboard motor being disposed in eaid well and projecting down there-through, with said propeller being disposed beneath said hull, a turntable mounted in said well to facilitate rotation of said outboard motor to position said propeller at the desired angle to the center line of the hull, said well being disposed forwardly of the longitudinal center of said hull, a depending skeg carried by said hull on the underside thereof immediately rearwardly of said propeller and in alignment with the center line of said hull, said skeg extending substantially from said propeller to said stern and cooperating with said propeller to effect maneuvering of said boat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Batson was charged with (1) direct infringement by making, using, and selling a completed boat, and (2) contributory infringement by selling a hull with a well between bow and stern.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">1. Batson\u2019s completed boat has a hull with a well, and a skeg. It does not have an outboard motor affixed to a turntable in the well. Instead, Batson\u2019s boat has an inboard motor mounted on the deck, connected by a drive shaft to a gear housing over the well, which, in turn, is connected to a propeller shaft assembly in the well, the propeller projecting beneath the hull. The propeller shaft assembly rests on bearings in a stationary mounting fixed in the well. Steering is accomplished by turning the propeller shaft assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The general principles to be applied in determining whether Batson\u2019s boat infringes Nelson\u2019s patent are beyond dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\"> The statute requires that the patent application contain specifications which describe the invention in \u201cfull, clear, concise, and exact terms,\u201d and which conclude with \u201cone or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\u201d 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 111, 112. The claims measure the patent monopoly,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and their la\u00f1guage provides the standard against which infringement is initially to be determined.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Where, as here, the invention consists of a combination of old elements, the patent monopoly extends only to the combination claimed as required by the statute, and not to its parts; the patent is infringed only if all of the elements set forth in the claim are found in the accused device.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">These are not arbitrary requirements; they serve important and long recognized public interests. Precise claims are required, \u201cso that the public may know what they are prohibited from doing during the existence of the monopoly, and what they are to have at the end of the term, as a consideration for the grant.\u201d Brooks v. Fiske, 15 How. (56 U.S.) 212, 214-215, 14 L.Ed. 665 (1853). They protect the public as well as other experimenters by making it possible to determine whether the applicant is claiming \u201canything that is in common use, or is already known, and to guard against prejudice or injury from the use of an invention which the party may otherwise innocently suppose not to be patented.\u201d Evans v. Eaton, 7 Wheat. (20 U.S.) 356, 434, 5 L.Ed. 472 (1822). Judicial expansion of the coverage of the patent beyond the words of the claims might confer a greater monopoly than was justified in light of the prior art or than the Commissioner intended to grant, and improperly inhibit experimentation by others.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>To these requirements the doctrine equivalents is a court-created exception\u2014 \u201can anomaly,\u201d logically inconsistent with the provisions of the statute and the public policy they reflect (Royal Typewriter Co. v. Remington Rand, Inc., 168 F.2d 691, 692 (2d Cir. 1948)), but nonetheless necessary to avoid rendering the patent \u201ca hollow and useless thing,\u201d by permitting \u201cthe unscrupulous copyist to make unimportant and insubstantial changes and substitutions in the patent which, though adding nothing, would be enough to take the copied matter outside the claim.\u201d Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Prods. Co., 339 U.S. 605, 607, 70 S.Ct. 854, 94 L.Ed. 1097 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\">The doctrine of equivalents is directed against those who seek to pirate a patented device with impunity by introducing \u201cminor variations to conceal and shelter the piracy.\u201d 339 U.S. at 607, 70 S.Ct. at 856. \u201cThe essence of the doctrine is that one may not practice a fraud on a patent.\u201d By its terms, a patentee may treat as an infringer one who produces a device which, though not within the literal language of the claims of the patent, \u201cperforms substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain the same result\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as the claimed device, for the two devices are then in' reality the same, differing only \u201cin name, form or shape.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 339 U.S. at 608, 70 S.Ct. at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"> Since the purpose of the doctrine of equivalents is to give the inventor an opportunity to secure a just reward for his invention \u2014 an opportunity which he would otherwise be denied because of the failure of the language of his claim to include devices which were in fact the same as his own in function, means, and result \u2014 the degree of protection afforded beyond the language of the claims will vary directly with the value of the inventor\u2019s contribution to the art.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the principle is commonly put, the inventor is entitled to a range of equivalents commensurate with the scope of his invention:, broad if his invention is broad; narrow if his advance is a small one in a crowded field.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">With these principles in mind, we turn' to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">As we have noted, the combination claimed by Nelson\u2019s patent includes \u201can outboard motor * * * disposed in said well,\u201d and \u201ca turntable mounted in said well to facilitate rotation of said outboard motor * * <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>is no outboard motor mounted on a turntable in the well of Batson\u2019s boat, Nelson could prevail only if the inboard motor fixed to the deck of Batson\u2019s boat and the propeller housing assembly journaled in the well were \u201cequivalent,\u201d under the standards we have stated, to the elements of Nelson\u2019s patented combination omitted from Batson\u2019s construction. We agree with the District Court that they were not.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The District Court properly concluded that Nelson\u2019s invention was \u201ca minor improvement in a crowded field,\u201d and that the \u201crange of equivalents\u201d to which he was entitled was \u201cat best * * * narrow.\u201d It appears from the references cited in Nelson\u2019s patent<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that prior to Nelson\u2019s application his \u201cwell\u201d had been disclosed by Dyer, Steele, Edwards, and Wilson, and, in substance, by Sharp; his outboard motor disposed in the well with propeller beneath the hull by Pedranti, Sharp, and Steele; his outboard motor rotatable through 360 degrees for steering purposes by Pedranti and Sharp; and his skeg by Dyer, Sharp, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>and Pridgen.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In these circumstances, to expand Nelson\u2019s patent monopoly appreciably beyond the precise combination of old elements which he claimed would reward him disproportionately, and at the same time unfairly limit those like Batson who had different combinations of the old elements to offer which reflected minor advances of their own.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Batson\u2019s combination of the familiar elements was inferior to Nelson\u2019s in some respects, but superior in others. Nelson\u2019s easy removability for repair or replacement were sacrificed; but there was evidence that Batson attained greater ease in steering, better general balance, and increased buoyancy. Batson\u2019s boat could be steered without moving the motor itself; the motor could be located at a point on deck away from the well to offset the weight of the remaining gear; and the smaller hull opening required to accommodate the propeller shaft assembly alone, and not the motor as well, reduced the loss of buoyancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Batson achieved maneuverability by means which differed significantly from Nelson\u2019s in respects relevant to the usefulness of the two devices for the purpose both were intended to serve. Since this is so, it would be of no consequence that the function performed and result obtained by the two constructions, were in all respects identical.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Considering both boats in relation to' the prior art, the two constructions cannot be regarded as in reality the same, differing only in form. It would exaggerate Nelson\u2019s contribution, and minimize that of Batson, to suggest that Batson\u2019s boat was a fraud upon Nelson\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">Nelson asserts that the \u201cheart\u201d of his invention is the enhanced maneuverability resulting from the relationship between a rotatable propulsion unit and a skeg located as stated in his claim, and that the location of the motor does not affect this relationship. Nelson contends that Batson should not be permitted to appropriate the \u201cheart\u201d of Nelson\u2019s invention simply by altering another, unessential, element. \u201cWe can only answer, \u2018that- there is no legally recognizable or protected \u201cessential\u201d element, \u201cgist\u201d or \u201cheart\u201d of the invention in a combination patent.\u2019 \u201d Entron of Maryland, Inc. v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 295 F.2d 670, 677 (4th Cir. 1961), quoting Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U.S. 336, 345, 81 S.Ct. 599, 5 L.Ed.2d 592 (1961).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>By the clear and unequivocal language of his claim, an outboard motor mounted on a turntable in the well was an element of the combination for which Nelson sought and obtained a patent. He cannot now be heard to say that this element was not in fact part of his invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><em>If </em>the \u201cessence\u201d of Nelson\u2019s invention was indeed the relationship between the rotatable propulsion unit and the skeg, Nelson should have claimed that combination separately. \u201cThe inventor must \u2018inform the public during the life of the patent of the limits of the monopoly asserted, so that it may be known which features may be safely used or manufactured without a license and which may not.\u2019 \u201d General Electric Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304 U.S. 364, 369, 58 S.Ct. 899, 902, 82 L.Ed. 1402 (1938), quoting Permutit Co. v. Graver Corp., 284 U.S. 52, 60, 52 S.Ct. 53, 76 L.Ed. 163 (1931). For \u201cbusinessmen are certainly entitled to know when they are committing an infringement.\u201d Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U.S. 336, 358, 81 S.Ct. 599, 611, 5 L.Ed.2d 592 (1960) (Black, J., concurring) .<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Reading Nelson\u2019s claim, Batson would naturally suppose that an outboard motor on a turnable in the well was an integral part of the patented combination.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Batson was entitled to conduct his own experimentation on the premise that a new combination without these elements would be beyond the reach of Nelson\u2019s monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">From \u201cthe context of the patent, the prior art, and the particular circumstances of the case\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we conclude that Batson\u2019s construction was not the \u201cequivalent\u201d of Nelson\u2019s, and did not infringe the claim of the latter\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">2. Both in the District Court and before us the issue of contributory infringement arising from the sale by Batson of a hull with a well between bow and stern resolved itself into the question of whether the hull was \u201csuitable for substantial noninfringing use.\u201d 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 271(c). Batson contended that the hull could be used in two non-infringing ways: (1) completing it in the fashion of Batson's completed boat; or (2) clamping an outboard motor to the edge of the well. Nelson contended: (1) as a matter of law Batson\u2019s completed boat infringed Nelson\u2019s patent claim; and (2) as a matter of fact clamping an outboard motor to the edge of the well was not a practical use and had not occurred. Since we agree with Batson on the first issue, we do not reach the various procedural and substantive questions which Nelson has raised in connection with the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Affirmed</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-16\">. In the state of this record we assume, as did the District Court, that as to Batson the Nelson patent is valid. See Boyal Typewriter Co. v.

Although the question of validity is not before us, it is appropriate to note that the differences between Nelson\u2019s combination and those of Pedranti, Sharp, and Steele are slight; and that if an outboard motor fixed to the deck connected to a rotatable propeller shaft assembly in a well were indeed equivalent to an outboard motor on a rotatable turntable in a well, it would be difficult to identify the inventive quality of Nelson over either Edwards or Wilson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">. Nelson argues that his patented combination was primary and hence entitled to broad protection because the prior art references reflected boat constructions used as fishing craft, ferries., barges, and for surfing and other purposes, but none for moving and sorting logs, a field in which Nelson\u2019s boat was an innovation. But to extend Nelson\u2019s patent monopoly on this basis would be inconsistent with the settled doctrine that use of an old device for a new and analogous purpose is not invention. 1 Walker, supra \u00a7 43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b183-15\">. 3 Walker, supra \u00a7\u00a7 467, 469.
