Roseborough is in the custody of E. J. Oberhauser, Superintendent of the California Institution for Men, Chino, California. This official, however, was not named or served as a party in this proceeding, the sole respondent being The People of the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">It follows that, assuming Roseborough is entitled to his release, the district court could not have entered a binding order granting such relief. See Bohm v. Alaska, 9 Cir., 320 F.2d 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">For this reason alone, and without reaching any other question, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
