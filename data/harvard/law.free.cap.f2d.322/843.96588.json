However, the real party in interest here (the law firm of McNealy, Merdes &amp; Camarot) claims the stipulations were but \u201cpartially executed,\u201d because that firm did not join with co-counsel (Stuart G. Oles, Esq.) in signing the same on behalf of Pitcher Construction Company, and that said firm is entitled to an attorney\u2019s lien in the sum of $2,156.06, plus a \u201cfuture fee\u201d of $750.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The court below (a) denied the validity of the asserted attorney\u2019s lien, (b) and denied the motion of Pitcher to make the First National Bank of Fairbanks (escrow trustee of the funds which were dealt with in the stipulated settlement) a party. There being no unsettled issues remaining, the district court dismissed each cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">No issue is raised as to the right of appeal. Pitcher Construction Company, a party below, is an appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">There are three questions before us:</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">(1) Did the moving attorneys have a statutory lien under Alaska law (A.S. 34.35.430(a) (3))?</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">(2) If they did not, did they have an equitable lien on the alleged \u201cproceeds\u201d of their efforts?</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">(3) Should the First National Bank of Fairbanks have been made a party defendant so it could qualify as an \u201cadverse party\u201d within the Alaska statute quoted above?</p>\n<p id=\"b890-16\">Alaska Statute 34.35.430(a) (3) reads as follows, in material part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-17\">\u201c(a) An attorney has a lien for his compensation, whether specially agreed upon or implied, as provided in this section. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-18\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-19\">\"(3) third, upon <em>money </em>in the hands of <em>the adverse party </em>in an action or proceeding in which the attorney is employed from the giving of notice of the lien to that party.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-20\">It is mutually conceded that Alaska law governs. In lien foreclosures, federal courts give effect to state law. \u201cFederal courts recognize no common law lien of an attorney, but give effect to the laws of the state in which they are held.\u201d 93 A.L.R. 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-21\">The Pitcher Construction Company, Inc., was the appellant in each of the consolidated cases. The Home Insurance Company was an appellee in each. The United States, obligated to pay someone the moneys on hand in payment for work performed, did, pursuant to a stipulation in which all parties joined, pay them to the First National Bank of Fairbanks, <em>as trustee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-22\">Appellant\u2019s claim that this stipulation was signed as a result of alleged \u201cunlawful coercion of the First National Bank of Fairbanks\u201d may or may not be correct; and appellant may or may not have the right to obtain relief elsewhere<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from any such alleged conduct, but that does not change the capacity of the bank, which accepted moneys in trust as <em>an agent for Pitcher, </em>to an \"adverse party\u201d to Pitcher in the then pending litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-23\">When the First National Bank of Fairbanks received the $144,200.36 in funds due Pitcher from the United States Gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>ernment, it first paid Wright Brothers Construction Company, Inc., a plaintiff in Miller Act proceeding No. F-9-62 against Pitcher, $130,000, and Northern Electric Corporation, a plaintiff in Miller Act proceeding No. F-18-62, $3,891.79; with the balance to be retained by the bank (Tr. pp. 85-89). This supplemented a previous stipulation, executed by all parties, permitting the United States Engineers to pay the funds due on Pitcher\u2019s contract to the bank (Tr. pp. 38-42). Thereafter, by stipulation, lodged but not filed and <em>not </em>signed by the parties, the First National Bank of Fairbanks was authorized to pay all moneys, after the $130,000 was paid to the Wright Brothers, to Alaska State Bank \u201cfor Pitcher\u2019s Loan Account.\u201d (Tr. 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The district court did not pass upon the validity of this purported assignment. (Tr. p. 146.) It does not make the Alaska State Bank an adverse, or any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">As the court below ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-7\">\u201cInasmuch as Pitcher had, by written agreement, constituted the First National Bank of Fairbanks its agent and trustee, the moneys paid \u2022by the United States of America to it on August 30, 1962 did not become moneys in the hands of an adverse party within the meaning of Section 26-8-1-ACLA (1949).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The Home Insurance Company was technically an \u201cadverse party\u201d to the litigation, but had no money in <em>its </em>hands. \u2018The trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-10\">\u201cHome Insurance. Company did its utmost to protect the common interests existing between it and Pitcher Construction Company, pursuant to the terms of the bond and indemnity agreement executed in connection therewith.\u201d (Tr. p. 145.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">That the Home Insurance Company was a large creditor of Pitcher does not mean that in <em>this </em>litigation it was an adverse party holding moneys in its hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">Nor do the definitions of \u201cadverse party\u201d quoted in appellant\u2019s brief and all relating to parties litigant, add anything to its position here.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">We affirm the action of the trial court in holding there was no statutory attorney\u2019s lien created.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-17\">Nor was there any common law lien. The liberal construction required of the attorney\u2019s lien statute by the Alaska Supreme Court in Phillips v. Jones, 355 P.2d 166, cannot authorize the courts to create a right which the statute fails to create. Admitted, there is no Alaska law which supports appellant\u2019s alternative position. We are not disposed to create a nonstatutory lien on the theory the Alaska legislature, in creating a statutory attorney\u2019s lien intended to preserve or create a nonstatutory lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">In passing upon the questions raised, we deem it unnecessary to consider whether any of appealing counsels\u2019 efforts \u201ccreated\u201d the funds on which the lien purportedly attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-19\">Finding no clear error in the trial court\u2019s holding that there exists no common law attorney\u2019s lien in Alaska, and that there had been no compliance by appellant\u2019s counsel with the terms of the Alaska statute recognizing attorney\u2019s liens, we need not reach the two remaining theories urged by appellees to defeat appellant\u2019s claim, and in support of the district court\u2019s rulings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-20\">We affirm. Each party on appeal is to bear their own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-12\">. Appellant urges that \u201cPitcher could sue First National Bank but delay would [have] result[ed] in Pitcher\u2019s money going to [the United States] comptroller [in Washington] and [cause] irreparable harm due to years of ensuing delay.\u201d (Brief, p. 9(d); Tr. p. 138.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-11\">. Namely, that there was a waiver by appellant\u2019s counsel in signing the stipulation, and that their lien rights, if any, are subordinate to prior assignments.
