MILLER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b480-24\">An indictment filed October 3, 1960, charged that the appellant, Leroy Walker, and three others \u2014 James M. Walker, Charlie M. Walker and Joseph E. Quarles \u2014on or about August 13, 1960, robbed a filling station attendant of $333 in money and a change carrier worth $5.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-25\">On November 3, 1960, Quarles, who had then begun serving a ten-year sentence for robbery imposed by a court in Maryland, entered a plea of guilty. Later he became a witness for the Government in the trial of the three Walkers, who had pleaded not guilty. He testified that he and the appellant Leroy committed the armed robbery, which he de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>scribed in detail, and maintained that James M. Walker and Charles M. Walker had no part in it. Other evidence for the prosecution tended to show, however, that all four indictees had participated in the commission of the crime: police officers testified that James and Charlie made self-incriminatory statements to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">After the jury retired to consider of its verdict, the three Walkers, who were on bond, and their counsel left the courtroom. When they returned later in the day, the judge said to them in open court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">\u201cGentlemen, in the Walker Case I received a note from the jury requesting as to whether or not the man who turned state\u2019s evidence, Quarles, had connected James and Charles Walker with the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\u201cI had the Reporter read to me all of Quarles\u2019 testimony and he has not in his testimony connected James and Charles with the crime. And seemingly the only testimony that has had anything to do with them in their connection with it were the admissions alleged by the detectives. I have so notified the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Leroy Walker took no exception and did not in any way indicate objection to the court\u2019s action. Thereafter the jury returned a verdict finding Leroy guilty. It disagreed, however, as to his co-defendants, James and Charlie.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Leroy appeals. He urges, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial judge committed reversible error when, in Leroy\u2019s absence, he answered the jury\u2019s question as to whether Quarles had implicated his co-defendants, James Walker and Charlie Walker. He does not argue or suggest that he was prejudiced thereby, but simply says the error was \u201cso gross that it is not necessary to show that it was prejudicial,\u201d and cites Fina v. United <em>States</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>2in support of that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\"> Criminal Rule 43 requires the presence of the defendant \u201cat every stage of the trial.\u201d This prohibits the judge from communicating with the jury in any way, either before or after it has begun to deliberate, when the defendant is absent. Consequently, the trial judge erred when he answered the jury\u2019s inquiry when the appellant was not present. Rule 43 is a salutary provision which trial judges should scrupulously observe, no matter how remote the possibility of prejudice may seem.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">Such an error does not require reversal, .however, when the record shows with reasonable certainty that it did not prejudice the' defendant\u2019s substantial rights. Speaking of a similar infraction of Rule 43, Judge Learned Hand said: <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-17\">\u201c * * * But, like other rules for the conduct of trials, it is not an end in itself; and, while lapses should be closely scrutinized, when it appears with certainty that no harm has been done, it would be the merest pedantry to insist upon procedural regularity. [Cases cited.] There cannot be the slightest doubt here that the informality\u2014 for, at most, it was no more \u2014 did not prejudice the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-19\">This sensible statement was in obedience to, and was required by, Criminal Rule 52(a): \u201cAny error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-20\">Practically all cases holding that a. violation of Rule 43 is reversible error involved situations where it was decided there was resultant prejudice or a reasonable possibility thereof.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> *To be. sure,, the Fina case, supra, cited by the appellant, held otherwise, but in the later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>case of Jones v. United States<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Tenth Circuit abandoned its Fina ruling that such an incident amounts to an unconstitutional denial of a public trial which requires reversal, even though not prejudicial. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">\u201c <em>-x- </em>* * [W]e can let stand no conviction where the defendant was not present at all stages of the proceedings unless the record completely negatives any reasonable possibility of prejudice arising from such error. Our review of the record here convinces us that there is no reasonable possibility of prejudice to appellant in the [present] case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Many courts, both state and federal, have dealt with the problem presented by a trial judge\u2019s communication with the jury in the defendant\u2019s absence and are substantially in accord. A most succinct and satisfactory statement of the governing principles was made by the Maryland Court of Appeals in La Guardia v. State: <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">\u201c * * * [I]f the record shows affirmatively that the appellant was prejudiced by an improper communication of the judge with the jury, there is reversible error; and also * * * if the record shows error by such communication, but does not show whether or not the error was prejudicial, it is presumed to be prejudicial and requires a reversal. Little v. United States, 10 Cir., 73 F.2d 861, 96 A.L.R. 889; Ah Fook Chang v. United States, 9 Cir., 91 F.2d 805, 810. On the other hand, if the record shows affirmatively that the communication had no \u2018tendency to influence the verdict\u2019 (Duffy v. State, 151 Md. 456, 474, 135 A. 189, 195), the judge\u2019s impropriety in communicating with the jury out of the presence of the defendant does not require a reversal. Dodge v. United States, 2 Cir., 258 F. 300, 7 A.L.R. 1510; Outlaw v. United States, 5 Cir., 81 F.2d 805. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">Federal cases decided since this Maryland decision are to the same effect as those to which it refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">Accordingly we hold that the trial judge\u2019s impropriety in communicating with the jury out of the presence of Leroy Walker does not require reversal if the record affirmatively shows the communication had no tendency to influence the verdict against him. In the language of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s Jones case, supra, we cannot let Leroy\u2019s conviction stand \u201cunless the record completely negatives any reasonable possibility of prejudice\u201d to him arising from the judge\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">The record clearly shows the jury\u2019s question and the judge\u2019s answer had nothing whatever to do with the case against Leroy Walker or with his defense. As the Tenth Circuit said in the Jones case, supra, \u201cAppellant\u2019s presence would have been no aid to his defense and it is apparent that he suffered no prejudice.\u201d This is clear from the trial judge\u2019s statement to counsel in which he described the note he received from the jury and his answer to it \u2014 a statement we have already quoted and which we have no reason to believe is either inaccurate or incomplete. The jury simply wanted to be reminded whether Quarles, who indubitably had implicated Leroy Walker, had connected James and Charlie with the crime. The judge correctly answered that Quarles had not implicated James and Charlie. Thereupon, the jury found Leroy guilty but disagreed as to his co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-16\">Thus, the jury\u2019s question and the judge\u2019s answer did not concern Leroy in any way. The question was not asked as to him<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the answer made no reference to him. He took no exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>to the court\u2019s action when it was explained to him, and would have had no reason to except had he been present. His presence would not have aided his defense. The record conclusively shows he suffered no prejudice. Appellant\u2019s argument that the incident complained of, in which he had not the slightest interest, unconstitutionally deprived him of a public trial is unrealistic in the extreme. It exhalts technicality over practicality, theory over actuality.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The other reasons for reversal relied on by the appellant seem to us to lack substance. His guilt was amply proved and his conviction must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">. 46 F.2d 643 (10th Cir., 1931).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-10\">.

United States, 273 U.S. 583, 47 S.Ct. 478, 71 L.Ed. 787 (1927), a prosecution for conspiracy to violate the Prohibition Act, counsel for Shields and the prosecuting attorney jointly asked the judge in chambers, after the jury retired, to hold the jury in deliberation until it reached a verdict. The jury afterwards sent to the judge in chambers a note saying it found certain defendants guilty and certain others not guilty but was \u201cunable to agree\u201d as to Shields and two others. The judge in chambers then sent the following note to the jury: \u201cThe jury will have to find also whether Shields [and the two others] are guilty or not guilty.\u201d 273 U.S. at 584, 47 S.Ct. 478, 71 L.Ed. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Shields was convicted. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the conviction but the Solicitor General found no \u201csatisfactory ground for opposing the petition for a writ of certiorari ...\u201d 273 U.S. at 587, 47 S.Ct. at 479, 71 L.Ed. 787. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">The Supreme Court said: \u201cThese communications were not made in open court, and neither the petitioner Shields nor his counsel was present, nor were they advised of them. * * * The joint request to the court * * * did not include any agreement that the court should receive a communication from the jury and answer it without giving the defendant and his counsel an opportunity to be present in court to take such action as they might be advised * * *. Counsel, in making it, necessarily assumed, as they had a right to, that any communication from the jury would be made in open court, and that they must necessarily be offered an opportunity to withdraw the request already preferred, or to vary it. * * * \u2018Where a jury has retired to consider of its verdict, and supplementary instructions are required, either because asked for by the jury or for other reasons, they ought to be given either in the presence of counsel or after notice and an opportunity to be present; and written instructions ought not to be sent to the jury without notice to counsel and an opportunity to object.\u2019 If this be true in a civil case, <em>a fortiori </em>is it true in a criminal case. The request made to the court * * * did not justify exception to the rule of orderly conduct of jury trial entitling the defendant, especially in a criminal case, to be present from the time the jury is impaneled until its discharge after rendering the verdict. We reverse the judgment without reference to the other causes of error assigned.\u201d 273 U.S. at 585, 587, 588, 589, 47 S.Ct. at 478, 479, 71 L.Ed. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">The judge\u2019s instruction that the jury find Shields either guilty or not guilty may or may not have been erroneous and prejudicial. The Supreme Court did not consider that question. It reversed the conviction not because of what the judge said but because he said it in a note. The Court did not find that his saying it in a note caused prejudice or might have caused prejudice or might have been thought to have caused prejudice. It seems clear to me that this method of saying what he was asked to say made no difference to the accused. Yet it made all the difference to the Supreme Court. As the Supreme Court reversed the conviction of Shields we should reverse the conviction of Walker, because the judge sent the jury a note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>and \u201cwithout reference to the other causes of error assigned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">I think the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States also requires us to reverse this conviction. The Amendment says: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial * *.\u201d If this constitutional right is denied, a conviction must be reversed whether or not the denial is prejudicial to the accused.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Beyond question it is \u201cthe settled rule of the federal courts that a showing of prejudice is not necessary for reversal of a conviction not had in public proceedings.\u201d Brennan, J., dissenting, in Levine v. United States, 362 U.S. 610, 627n, 80 S.Ct. 1038, 1048, 4 L.Ed.2d 989 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Since a charge to the jury is a necessary part of a criminal trial, if the public is excluded from the court room when a charge is given, the right to a public trial is denied and the conviction must be reversed, irrespective of prejudice. People v. Micalizzi, 223 Mich. 580, 194 N.W. 540 (1923). The Sixth Amendment guarantees, in felony cases at least, the right of the accused to be present at \u201cevery stage of the trial, inclusive of the empaneling of the jury and the reception of the verdict * * * \u201d Diaz v. United States, 223 U.S. 442, 455, 32 S.Ct. 250, 253-254, 56 L.Ed. 500 (1912).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It has been held accordingly that irrespective of prejudice, exclusion of the accused from the court room when a supplemental instruction is given requires reversal. Fina v. United States, 46 F.2d 643, 644 (10th Cir., 1931);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> People v. Beck, 305 Ill. 593, 137 N.E. 454, 456 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-16\"><em>A fortiori </em>a constitutional right is denied if a charge is privately given in a personal visit by the judge to the jury room. Puckett v. Commonwealth, 200 Ky. 509, 255 S.W. 125, 34 A.L.R. 96 (1923).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A private telephone conversation between the judge and the foreman of the jury violates the constitutional right and requires reversal. State v. Ashley, 121 S.C. 15, 113 S.E. 305, 307 (1922); Raab v. State, 62 Okl. Cr. 361, 371, 71 P.2d 773, 778 (1937) (statute). In State v. Wroth, 15 Wash. 621, 47 P. 106, 107 (1896), the judge, learning from a bailiff that the jury wished to see him, went to the open door of the jury room, returned to the court room, and told counsel that the jury had asked him to repeat his charge on reasonable doubt. Without concerning itself with the terms or possible effect of what, if anything, the judge said to the jury in reply, the Supreme Court of Washington held that there was \u201csuch misconduct on the part of the trial judge as requires reversal * * the law does not subject parties litigant to the disadvantage of being required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>to accept the statement of even the judge as to what occurs between himself and the jury at a place where the judge has no right to be, and where litigants cannot be required to attend. It is the lawful right of a party to have his cause tried in open court, with opportunity to be present and heard in .respect to everything transacted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In the present case, the judge communicated with the jury in a private note. This violated the rule of the Shields case, supra, and the constitutional right of the accused to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Appellate courts are directed to disregard errors which do not affect substantial rights. F.R.Crim.P. Rule 52 (a);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111 (1958). \u201cThis applies * * * unless a constitutional right is infringed.\u201d Starr v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 91, 95, 264 F.2d 377, 381 (in banc, 1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 936, 79 S.Ct. 652, 3 L.Ed.2d 639 (1959); Edmonds v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 144, 150, 260 F.2d 474, 480 (1958) (dissenting opinion). Cf. Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 764-765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1247-1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). The \u201csubstantial safeguards to those charged with serious crimes cannot be eradicated under the guise of technical departures from the rules.\u201d Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 763, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 1046-1047, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962); quoting Smith v. United States, 360 U.S. 1, 9, 79 S.Ct. 991, 996-997, 3 L.Ed.2d 1041 (1959). Whatever may be thought of the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, we are not required or permitted to disregard the court\u2019s failure to comply with the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">This court cites United States v. Compagna, 146 F.2d 524, 528 (2d Cir., 1944), cert. denied, 324 U.S. 867, 65 S.Ct. 912, 89 L.Ed. 1422 (1945). In that case the jury sent the judge a written request to have certain testimony read. The judge \u201cstopped in the jury room\u201d and told them this testimony would be read to them after they returned from lunch. It was read to them. In an opinion by Judge Learned Hand the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed convictions, on the ground that \u201cthe informality- \u2014 for, at most, it was no more \u2014did not prejudice the accused.\u201d But neither was it an instruction. And the Court of Appeals did not discuss or even mention the constitutional right of the accused to a public trial. As I have shown, it has been held repeatedly that a constitutional right is denied if a judge gives an instruction privately. New if any courts have consciously held the contrary. The trial court\u2019s \u201cobvious error\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the present case is \u201cso fundamental as necessarily to affect the substantial rights of the defendant regardless of the nature 'or propriety of the instruction given\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and reversal should follow.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\">.
