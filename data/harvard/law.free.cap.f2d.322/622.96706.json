The decree awarded a judgment in the amount of $12,500 to the libelant, Maxwell Shenker.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Shenker is a stevedore timekeeper who was injured on May 28, 1957, while aboard the Lt. Robert Craig, a naval vessel owned and operated by the United States which was moored at the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Asserting jurisdiction under the Public Vessels Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 781-790, he brought suit against the United States, alleging unseaworthiness and negligence. The United States then impleaded as defendant American Stevedores, the stevedoring contractor which employed Shenker, seeking indemnity from it, under the terms of an express contract between the parties, for any recovery which Shenker might have.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">At the close of all the evidence, the district court in an unreported opinion held that the United States was liable to Shenker because of the unseaworthiness of the Lt. Robert Craig, \u201cbut that libelant\u2019s own fault contributed in equal degree to the accident.\u201d Damages of $25,000 were found and a judgment of $12,500 was entered since the court\u2019s finding that libelant\u2019s contributory negligence was 50 per cent responsible for the accident resulted as a matter of law in a reduction by 50 per cent of the total amount of damages to which he would otherwise have been entitled. Ktistakis v. United Cross Navigation Corp., 316 F.2d 869 (2 Cir., 1963) ; Dunbar v. Henry DuBois\u2019 Sons Co., 275 F.2d 304 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 815, 81 S.Ct. 45, 5 L.Ed.2d 46 (1960); Boat Dagny, Inc. v. Todd, 224 F.2d 208 (1 Cir., 1955). Libelant\u2019s claim was disallowed to the extent that it rested upon an allegation that the United States was negligent. Cf. Poignant v. United States, 225 F.2d 595 (2 Cir., 1955). The district court further held that the United States, under the terms of its contract with American Stevedores, was entitled to indemnification from the stevedoring contractor in the amount which it was required to pay to Shenker.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The United States appeals from the judgment in favor of libelant, urging in the alternative that if that judgment is affirmed, the judgment awarding it indemnity against American Stevedores also be affirmed. American Stevedores appeals from the judgment in favor of libelant and from the indemnity judgment in favor of the United States. Shenker, resting upon his judgment, has not appealed ; there is thus no challenge by any party to the district court\u2019s findings that Shenker was contributorily negligent and in a degree that was 50 per cent responsible for causing his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The findings of fact of the district court are amply supported by the record and we sustain them as not clearly erroneous. McAllister v. United States, 348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20 (1954). Briefly stated, they present the following picture of the events leading to the accident in which Shenker was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">On May 28, 1957, Shenker, who was then 62 years old, was performing his duties as timekeeper for American Stevedores at a pier at the Brooklyn Army Terminal. The Lt. Robert Craig had been moored starboard side to the pier since May 22 while longshoremen employed by American Stevedores, working under a governmental contract, discharged and loaded the vessel\u2019s cargo. Shenker worked from an office at the pier. On the day of the accident he had been instructed by his supervisor, one Perrone, who was the head timekeeper, to ascertain when the stevedores who were working aboard the ship would quit work that day. After attempting to obtain the information by telephone and receiving no answer, Shenker decided to go aboard the ship to consult with Domenic Judice, the American Stevedores foreman in charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Shenker boarded the ship shortly before 2 p.m., by means of the starboard accommodation ladder. Once aboard he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>turned right and walked forward along the starboard side of the main deck until he saw Judice walking along the port-side of the main deck. Shenker yelled to Judice in order to attract his attention. When he noticed Shenker, Judice waved and beckoned to him. Judice mounted the No. 2 hatch from its portside and Shenker mounted it from the starboard side. The hatch, a box-like structure measuring 24 feet long and slightly more than 22 feet wide, was raised about 40 inches above the main deck and had been covered with protective tarpaulins and battened down. The two men met at approximately the center of the hatch and engaged in a conversation for a minute or two about whether the stevedores would complete the cargo operations before five o\u2019clock. When the conversation was completed, they proceeded to walk together to the starboard side of the hatch.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Shenker intended to get off the hatch by \u201csquatting down\u201d at the edge of it, placing his hand on the tarpaulin for support, and easing himself down onto, the deck. However, when he and Judice came to within a few feet of the starboard side of the hatch, he unexpectedly stubbed his toe against a piece of dunnage \u2014 a plank of lumber about four feet long, a foot wide, and an inch thick \u2014which had been lying on the hatch but which neither man had seen earlier. Shenker pitched forward and fell to the deck, the board falling with him. He sustained multiple injuries which necessitated a lengthy period of hospitalization and medical care, and was left with a marked limp.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">On cross-examination Shenker was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">\u201cQ. And as you walked \u2014 how far a distance did you walk from where you were standing in the center of the hatch, talking to Mr. Judice? How far did you walk over to the edge of the hatch in distance? A. Maybe ten, twelve feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">\u201cQ. During that ten or twelve feet, did you have occasion once to look down where you were walking and to look ahead of you? A. No, I didn\u2019t. We were looking and talking to each other, looking at each other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">In finding on these facts that Shenker was contributorily negligent, the district court said, \u201cHis very unfamiliarity with the vessel which serves him in his disclaimer of knowledge of routes less perilous than the one he selected, called upon him to exercise a commensurately greater caution * * *. A minimal regard for his own safety demanded that he look about him as he walked in alien surroundings \u2014 not in the unobservant fashion he adopted wherein he was oblivious to lurking danger underfoot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">We deal first with the challenges made by appellants to Shenker\u2019s right to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">Under legal principles now well established, a ship and its owner are liable to indemnify a seaman for injuries caused by the unseaworthiness of the vessel or its appurtenant appliances and equipment. The Osceola, 189 U.S. 158, 23 S.Ct. 483, 47 L.Ed. 760 (1903); Mahnich v. Southern Steamship Co., 321 U.S. 96, 64 S.Ct. 455, 88 L.Ed. 561 (1944). See Note, 76 Harv.L.Rev. 819 (1963). The shipowner\u2019s duty to furnish a seaworthy ship is not a duty to furnish an accident-free ship; \u201cit is a duty only to furnish a vessel and appurtenances reasonably fit for their intended use.\u201d Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, 550, 80 S.Ct. 926, 933, 4 L.Ed.2d 941 (1960); Gutierrez v. Waterman Steamship Corp., 373 U.S. 206, 83 S.Ct. 1185, 10 L.Ed.2d 297 (1963); Massa v. C. A. Venezuelan Navigacion, 298 F.2d 239 (2 Cir., 1962). \u201cThus, the concept of the unseaworthiness of a ship is a relative one, dependent for definition in each instance upon the circumstances in which her fitness is drawn into question.\u201d Mosley v. Cia. Mar. Adra, S.A., 314 F.2d 223, 227 (2 Cir., 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number> The district court found that the Lt. Robert Craig was unseaworthy because of the unaccounted presence on the No. 2 hatch of the plank of lumber over which Shenker tripped. It held that the presence of such \u201ca random object, not serviceable as dunnage for any stevedoring use,\u201d created a \u201cdanger, not integral to the necessary operations of the ship\u201d which in the circumstances rendered the ship less than reasonably fit for its intended use. It has often been held that dangerous and uncertain conditions underfoot may constitute transitory unseaworthiness. See, e. g., Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, 80 S.Ct. 926, 4 L.Ed.2d 941 (1960); Ktistakis v. United Cross Navigation Corp., 316 F.2d 869 (2 Cir., 1963); Pinto v. States Marine Corp., 296 F.2d 1 (2 Cir., 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 843, 82 S.Ct. 874, 7 L.Ed.2d 847 (1962); Blier v. United States Lines Co., 286 F.2d 920 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 836, 82 S.Ct. 32, 7 L.Ed.2d 37 (1961). The district court here found that in walking on the hatch Shenker and Judice were giving it an intended use because they \u201cwere following a customary practice\u201d that was \u201cforeseeable as a likely one by the owner and was consonant with a shipboard procedure recognized as permissible.\u201d The holding that the Lt. Robert Craig was unseaworthy, which in any event appellants do not appear to challenge, was therefore entirely proper. The fact that it may have been the responsibility of American Stevedores to remove all excess dunnage does not, of course, relieve the shipowner of its obligation to provide and maintain a seaworthy vessel. That duty is a nondelegable one. Alaska Steamship Co. v. Petterson, 347 U.S. 396, 74 S.Ct. 601, 98 L.Ed. 798 (1954); Rogers v. United States Lines Co., 347 U.S. 984, 74 S.Ct. 849, 98 L.Ed. 1120 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The primary challenge made by appellants is to the holding of the district court that Shenker was entitled to sue upon the shipowner\u2019s warranty of seaworthiness because his duties as timekeeper came within the scope of traditional seamen\u2019s work. The Supreme Court has held that the shipowner\u2019s duty to furnish and maintain a seaworthy vessel is a duty owed not only to seamen but also to longshoremen and stevedores employed by someone other than the shipowner who are injured in the course of their employment aboard the vessel while \u201cdoing a seaman\u2019s work and incurring a seaman\u2019s hazards.\u201d Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 99, 66 S.Ct. 872, 879-880, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946); Reed v. Steamship Yaka, 373 U.S. 410, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963); Crumady v. The J. H. Fisser, 358 U.S. 423 (1959); Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953). The answer to the question of whether libelant comes within \u201cthat broadened class of workmen to whom the admiralty law has latterly extended the absolute right to a seaworthy ship,\u201d Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 358 U.S. 625, 629, 79 S.Ct. 406, 409, 3 L.Ed.2d 550 (1959), thus depends upon the character of the work he was performing. United N. Y. &amp; N. J. Sandy Hook Pilots Association v. Halecki, 358 U.S. 613, 79 S.Ct. 517, 3 L.Ed.2d 541 (1959) ; Lawlor v. SoconyVacuum Oil Co., 275 F.2d 599 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 363 U.S. 844, 80 S.Ct. 1614, 4 L.Ed.2d 1728 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Shenker testified that his duties as timekeeper included keeping the payroll records of the longshoremen gangs employed by American Stevedores at the work site, compiling a \u201crunning activity\u201d of \u201cwhatever the gangs in the different hatches on the various ships did that particular day \u2014 opening the hatch, rigging, starting, opening the \u2019tween decks or going down to the lower hold, and then starting to load cargo or discharge cargo from the ship,\u201d and obtaining every morning a report of the respective amounts of tonnage of different categories of cargo loaded during the prior day. In order to obtain the information for these records, Shenker usually would go aboard ship, he said, \u201conce in the morning and once in the afternoon.\u201d In addition, he testified that it was neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>sary for him to go aboard ship in order to carry out other miscellaneous duties, such as checking the identification number of a longshoreman who might have checked in with the wrong one, checking the type of cargo that was being loaded in a particular hatch, making a record of the stowage of cargo in the different compartments of a hatch, and cheeking for any damage that might have occurred to cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">On the day on which he was injured, Shenker had been instructed by his superior to ascertain when the stevedores who were working aboard the Lt. Robert Craig would quit work that day. When he was unable to obtain this information by means of telephone calls to the ship, he decided to go aboard to see the foreman in charge in order \u201cto check the time that this gang in hatch No. 1 was going to work, whether they were going to work to finish their work before five o\u2019clock or whether they would go past five o\u2019clock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">On the basis of this testimony, the district court found that the \u201cclerical activities of libelant exposed him in their performance to certain of the hazards which the stevedores encountered in their more laborious output of physical effort\u201d and that he was \u201can integral participant in the maritime activities of the stevedores\u201d because \u201call alike were participating in the common maritime undertaking of moving cargo in and out of the vessel.\u201d These findings and conclusions are amply justified. The keeping of payroll and cargo records plays an important part in the orderly operation of a ship. In carrying out his duty of keeping such records, as well as in carrying out his miscellaneous duties, all of which required, as the district court found, that he be aboard ship frequently, Shenker performed tasks which are a normal and necessary incident to the effective functioning of the ship. Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946); Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953); Ross v. Steamship Zeeland, 240 F.2d 820 (4 Cir., 1957). The district court was therefore correct in holding that he was entitled to the protection afforded by the shipowner\u2019s warranty of seaworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Appellants also contend that it. was error for the district court to exclude from evidence an entry made in the, official log book of the Lt. Robert Craig by one Rosteck, who was third officer on. the ship between the hours of 8 a. m. and. 4 p. m. on the day of libelant\u2019s accident-The proffered entry read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">\u201c1350 \u2014 Max Shenker (American Stev. Timekeeper) tripped over batten on #2 hatch and hurt left leg. Was taken to dispensary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">In appellants\u2019 view, the log entry had a; material bearing on the issue of the cause-of Shenker\u2019s accident because it tended to-establish that he tripped over a batten-rather than a piece of dunnage.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">Rosteck testified that he did not wit- ness the accident and that the information embodied in the entry came to him. \u201cby word of mouth\u201d from \u201cone of the, stevedore\u2019s bosses on the foredeck.\u201d The-entry was therefore hearsay and inadmissible as such, as the district court properly concluded. See McCormick, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 225-27 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">Appellants argue, however, that; the entry should have been admitted into-evidence under the exception to the hearsay rule created by the Federal Business Records Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732, which malees admissible generally any writing-made in the regular course of business: as a memorandum or record of an event. Although this argument is not without: some force, see 5 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 1523 (3rd Ed.1940); United States v. New York Foreign Trade Zone Operators, Inc., 304 F.2d 792 (2 Cir., 1962),. we think on balance that the district, court was correct in rejecting it on the-authority of Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943). In that case the Supreme Court upheld a district court\u2019s refusal to admit into evidence an accident report, offered by the defendant railroad that had been prepared by the engineer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>a train involved in a grade crossing accident. The rationale of Palmer is directly applicable to the present case. Indeed, it seems likely that the statement held inadmissible in Palmer would have been more probative than the log entry excluded in the present case because it was more detailed, and would have been more trustworthy because it was \u201cbased on the reporter\u2019s first-hand knowledge,\u201d McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 287 (1954), rather than upon the conceded second-hand knowledge that Rosteck relied upon. See Central R. Co. of N. J. v. Jules S. Sottnek Co., 258 F.2d 85 (2 Cir., 1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 913, 79 S.Ct. 588, 3 L.Ed.2d 574 (1959). Whatever may be the propriety of using a log entry to prove that an accident actually occurred \u2014 and denial of such an opportunity of proof can hardly be deemed prejudicial to appellants \u2014 the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that under the facts of this case the entry might not be used to prove the details of that accident. Puggioni v. Luekenbach Steamship Co., 286 F.2d 340 (2 Cir., 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Having found no merit in any of the arguments raised in opposition to libel-ant\u2019s right to recover, we affirm the judgment in favor of Shenker on the grounds relied upon by the district court and set out above.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">We turn now to the appeal taken by American Stevedores from that portion of the district court\u2019s opinion granting indemnification to the United States in the amount of Shenker\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The stevedoring operations aboard the Lt. Robert Craig in the course of which libelant was injured were being conducted by American Stevedores under a contract which it had entered into with the United States. The crucial sections of the agreement touching the liability of American Stevedores, as contractor, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">\u201cClause 12. <em>Liability and Insurance. </em>\u201ca. The Contractor ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">\u201c(2) shall be responsible for and shall hold the Government harmless from any and all loss, damage, liability and expense for * * * bodily injury to * * * persons occasioned in whole or in part by the negligence or fault of the Contractor, his officers, agents, or employees in the performance of work under this contract. The general liability and responsibility of the Contractor under this clause are subject only to the following specific limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">\u201cb. The Contractor shall not be responsible to the Government for and does not agree to hold the Government harmless from loss or damage to * * * bodily injury to * * * persons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aok\">\u201c(1) If the unseaworthiness of the vessel * * * furnished by the Government contributed jointly with the fault or negligence of the Contractor in causing such * * * injury * * * and the Contractor, its officers, agents, and employees, by the exercise of due diligence, could not have discovered such unseaworthiness * * * or through the exercise of due diligence could not otherwise have avoided such * * injury * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">The district court held, as a matter of contract interpretation, that the United States was entitled to recovery over from American Stevedores in the amount that it was required to pay to Shenker. It based this result upon two findings of fact which are adequately supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">First, it found, as we have already noted, that Shenker had been contributorily negligent in failing to watch where he was walking. Second, it found that Judice had been negligent in at least an equal degree with Shenker, \u201cfor had Judice been minimally mindful of his footing as he walked beside Shenker on the hatch cover he would surely have seen the scrap dunnage over which Shenker stumbled, in time to warn him or jostle him out of danger.\u201d The ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>feet of these two findings was to render American Stevedores, the employer of Shenker and Judiee, liable to the United States under Clause 12a(2) of the contract, which provides for indemnification of the United States for losses for injuries \u201coccasioned in * * * part by the negligence or fault of the [contractor\u2019s] employees in the performance of work under this contract,\u201d see Lamazza v. United States, 190 F.Supp. 692 (S.D.N.Y.1960), and to render inapplicable the exculpatory provision of Clause 12b (1), since the contractor\u2019s two employees could, in fact, have discovered the unseaworthiness of the vessel or \u201cthrough the exercise of due diligence could * * * otherwise have avoided such * * * injury.\u201d Once these findings of fact were made, the analysis of the district court fully established the obligation of American Stevedores under the express language of the contract to indemnify the United States. Santomarco v. United States, 277 F.2d 255 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, American Stevedores, Inc. v. United States, 364 U.S. 823, 81 S.Ct. 59, 5 L.Ed.2d 52 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The fact that the negligence of Shenker, as the injured employee, was partially responsible for the accident does not preclude the United States from recovery. The language of the contract neither limits to a particular type of employee the negligence upon which indemnification may be based nor excludes the negligence of any particular employee as a factor which may make the indemnification provision operative. To the degree that the recent opinion in Drewery v. Daspit Bros. Marine Divers, Inc., 317 F.2d 425 (5 Cir., 1963), is to the contrary, we agree with the dissenting opinion of Judge Rives. Id. 317 F.2d at 428. But, in any event, there is no difficulty for purposes of establishing indemnity liability in the present case in imputing the negligence of Judiee to his employer, American Stevedores.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The existence of the express warranty makes it unnecessary for us to consider or rely upon principles of implied warranty. D\u2019Agosta v. Royal Netherlands Steamship Co., 301 F.2d 105 (2 Cir., 1962); Dery v. Wyer, 265 F.2d 804 (2 Cir., 1959); cf. Ryan. Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp., 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956); Weyerhaeuser Steamship Co. v. Nacirema Operating Co., 355 U.S. 563, 78 S.Ct. 438, 2 L.Ed.2d 4091 (1958); Damanti v.

This ruling was not improper; expenses such as those here involved are generally recoverable as damages by a shipowner who is awarded indemnity. DeGioia v.

Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, 40, and id. at 43. That, in my view, is the result of holding that a shore-based record keeper, covered by the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950, who stubbed his toe against a plainly visible board, four feet long, a foot wide and an inch thick, can recover $25,000 (reduced to half that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>sum because of his contributory negligence) for unseawbrthiness of the ship against the United States \u2014 which then receives indemnity from the stevedoring company for sending on board a clerk who took such poor care of himself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Shenker spent almost all his time on shore. His duties were, in his own words, to keep \u201ca payroll record of the gangs employed on pier two, Brooklyn Army Terminal\u201d and <em>\u201ca </em>running activity of the different ships that were being loaded or discharged * * * so that the company would know just how much cargo to either load or discharge for the purposes of computation of costs.\u201d It was on the basis of this \u201crunning activity\u201d that the \u201ccompany in the main office would figure their costs and profits.\u201d Occasionally Shenker found it convenient to go on shipboard to get information for his \u201crunning activity\u201d record or other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Thus it was that at 2 P.M. on May 28, 1957, Shenker boarded the Lt. Robert Craig, a naval vessel, \u201cto check the time that this gang in hatch No. 1 was going to work, whether they were going * * to finish their work before five o\u2019clock or whether they would go past five o\u2019clock * * * \u201d, this being important for his closing of the payroll records. The answer reposed in Domenic Judice, the stevedore foreman. To obtain access to Judice, Shenker traversed the well-battened cover of No. 2 hatch. He crossed to the halfway point without incident, obtained the desired information and came back, with Judice accompanying him. It was near the completion of this return journey that, as the judge found, rather contrary to Shenker\u2019s own testimony,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he stubbed his toe against what must have been a plainly visible dunnage board on the hatch cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">There are at least two reasons, either of them sufficient, why Shenker\u2019s recovery against the ship for unseaworthiness ought not be allowed to stand. He was not performing the kind of work for which recovery for unseaworthiness, is allowed, and the Lt. Robert Craig was not unseaworthy. I therefore do not reach the question whether exclusion of' the entry in the log book was reversible-error, or the issues relating to the United States\u2019 recovery of indemnity froim American Stevedores.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">\u201c[T]he norm of the liability [for unseaworthiness] has been historically and still is the case of the seaman under contract with the vessel\u2019s owner.\u201d Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 90, 66 S.Ct. 872, 875, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946). This unusual liability is based upon \u201cthe hazards which maritime service places upon men who perform it,\u2019\u201d id. 328 U.S. at 94, 66 S.Ct. at 877, 90 L.Ed. 1099, or, as recently stated, upon \u201cthe hazards of marine service, the helplessness of the men to ward off the perils of unseaworthiness, the harshness, of forcing them to shoulder their losses alone, and the broad range of the \u2018humanitarian policy\u2019 of the doctrine of seaworthiness * * * \u201d, Reed v. The Yaka, 373 U.S. 410, 413, 83 S.Ct. 1349;. 1352, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963). Since \u201chistorically the work of loading and unloading is the work of the ship\u2019s-service, performed until recent times <em>by </em>members of the crew\u201d, a man engaged! in such service is entitled to the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>of the rule even though he is \u201cemployed and furnished by another.\u201d 328 U.S. at 96, 66 S.Ct. at 878, 90 L.Ed. 1099. This is so although a contrary result would not at all force him to shoulder his loss alone in view of the remedy against his employer which Congress has provided in the Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Although the historicity of the pronouncement in Sieracki that the work of loading and unloading was historically done by the ship\u2019s crew has been seriously challenged, see Tetreault, Seamen, Seaworthiness, and the Rights of Harbor Workers, 39 Corn.L.Q. 381, 413-14 (1954) and Shields and Byrne, Application of the Unseaworthiness Doctrine to Longshoremen, 111 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1137, 1139-47 (1963), that would not avail the shipowner in an inferior federal court in a case directly within that decision. However, the dubious historical basis for thus giving harbor workers the protection of the warranty of seaworthiness (as distinguished from their rights on account of negligence of the shipowner), the present inapplicability to harbor workers of some of the factors which underlay the development of the doctrine as regards \u201cseamen\u201d in the ordinary sense, the frustration of the policy of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act resulting from combining the principle that a stevedore may recover from the ship for defective gear brought on by his employer, Alaska S.S. Co. v. Petterson, 347 U.S. 396, 74 S.Ct. 601, 98 L.Ed. 798 (1954), with the liability of the employer to indemnify the ship for this or other negligent action on its part, Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S.S. Corp., 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956), and the complexities presented in a trial, and particularly in a jury trial, of the typical three party case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> argue against our applying the warranty of seaworthiness to a shore-based office worker unless decisions of the Supreme Court call for that. There is still great wisdom in the admonition of Judge Learned Hand that \u201cwe should hesitate to read the [Sieracki] decision as intended to extend the protection of what amounts to a warranty of seaworthiness to all workmen upon a ship, however casual their presence there, and however much their relation to the employer is unlike the early paternalistic status of master and crew * * * \u201d, and that any such extension \u201cshould await the sanction of the Supreme Court in the exercise of its function of supplying the inadequacies of the past.\u201d Guerrini v. United States, 167 F.2d 352, 354, (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 335 U.S. 843, 69 S.Ct. 65, 93 L.Ed. 393 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">The relevant Supreme Court decisions subsequent to Sieracki tell us only that a carpenter repairing defective loading equipment \u201cso that the loading could go on at once\u201d is assimilated to \u201cthe stevedores then working with him on the ship * * Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 412-413, 74 S.Ct. 202, 206-207, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953), and The Tungus v. Skovgaard, 358 U.S. 588, 595 n. 9, 79 S.Ct. 503, 3 L.Ed.2d 524 (1959), but that a shore-based electrician cleaning the ship\u2019s generators in an engine room is not, United N. Y. &amp; N. J. Sandy Hook Pilots Ass\u2019n v. Halecki, 358 U.S. 613, 79 S.Ct. 517, 3 L.Ed.2d 541 (1959). Insofar as application of the warranty of seaworthiness rests on \u201cthe hazards of marine service\u201d and \u201cthe helplessness of the men to ward off the perils of unseaworthiness,\u201d Shenker\u2019s case is far weaker than Halecki\u2019s, who was spraying the ship\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>engines with a deadly poison; it is almost ludicrous to apply the quoted phrases to a man who spent almost all his time on shore and only needed to look where he was going to keep himself entirely safe on this occasional adventure on shipboard. The Halecki opinion, 358 U.S. at 618, 79 S.Ct. at 519-520, 3 L.Ed.2d 541, also dispels any notion that Shenker is entitled to the benefit of the doctrine on the simple ground that he was a record keeper and ships carry some men who keep records. The records that Shenker was keeping were not the kind of records historically kept by the ship\u2019s crew; rather they were the very kind that would not have been kept if the ship\u2019s crew had carried out their supposed historical function of loading her. Shenker, like Halecki, \u201cwas not doing what any crew member had ever done on this ship or anywhere else in the world so far as we are informed.\u201d Judge Lumbard\u2019s dissenting opinion, 251 F.2d 708, 715 (2 Cir., 1958), quoted with approval, 358 U.S. at 618, 79 S.Ct. at 519-520, 3 L.Ed.2d 541. Hawn\u2019s and Skovgaard\u2019s roles were quite different. If it was traditional for a ship\u2019s crew to load, as we must take it to have been, presumably it was equally traditional for the crew to fix loading equipment that had broken down. But it can scarcely have been traditional for the crew to keep records needed to bill the ship for services of third persons that traditionally were not rendered. Although Shenker\u2019s activities may have been essential to the ship\u2019s being unloaded by a third party, they would not have been required if the ship had unloaded herself; the consideration stressed in Sieracki, \u201cthat the owner should not be free to nullify\u201d his obligation as to seaworthiness \u201cby parcelling out his operations to intermediary employers-whose sole business is to take over portions of the ship\u2019s work,\u201d 328 U.S. at 95, 66 S.Ct. at 877-878, 90 L.Ed. 1099,. scarcely applies to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Even if Shenker were entitled to the benefit of the doctrine of unseaworthiness, I would still reverse on the ground that the judge erred in concluding that the presence of a plainly visible piece of dunnage on the hatch cover rendered the Lt. Robert Craig unseaworthy. We have consistently held that unseaworthiness, like negligence, is a question of law not within the scope of the \u201cunless clearly erroneous\u201d rule or its admiralty equivalent. Krey v. United States, 123 F.2d 1008 (2 Cir., 1941); Van Carpals v. S.S. American Harvester, 297 F.2d 9 (2 Cir., 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 865, 82 S.Ct. 1031, 8 L.Ed.2d 84 (1962);. cf. Romero v.

Robert Craig was not a passenger liner; she was a naval vessel in the course of being loaded. She did not cease to be \u201creasonably suitable for her intended service,\u201d Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, 550, 80 S.Ct. 926, 933, 4 L.Ed.2d 941 (1960), simply because her hatch covers were not so free from every kind of obstruction-as a bowling alley or the floor of an operating room awaiting surgery. Nuzzo v. Rederi, A/S Wallenco, 304 F.2d 506 (2 Cir., 1962). The facts bear no resemblance to the conditions of disarray in De Gioia v. United States Lines Co., 304 F.2d 431, 423 (2 Cir., 1962), or to the \u201caccumulation of oil covered by sawdust\u201d in Ktistakis v.

Perhaps the circle will be completed by the stevedoring company\u2019s recovering from Shenker for breach of his undertaking to keep his eyes open, implicit in his contract of employment.
