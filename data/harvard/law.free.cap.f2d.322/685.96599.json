No facts are in dispute and, on cross motions for summary judgment, the government\u2019s motion was granted dismissing the taxpayer\u2019s claim for refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Aaron Borin, prior to his death on September 12, 1955, operated his meat packing business as a non-incorporated business under the name Borin Packing Company. The assets of the business were the community property of Aaron and his wife Eva. By will, Aaron left his half of the property to be equally divided between Eva and their three children. As \u201cindependent executrix,\u201d she had \u201ccomplete and absolute control and management of [the] business * -\u00bb */&gt; The assets of the business were sold on November 19, 1955, to an outside party. On January 18, 1956, an election was filed by Mrs. Borin as \u201cExecutrix of the Estate of Aaron Borin, Deceased,\u201d to report the 1955 income of Borin Packing Company as a domestic corporation. We find that the election was timely filed, and reverse the judgment entered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">Under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1361(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an election must be made within 60 days after the close of the taxable year of the proprietorship or partnership. It is apparent that the election was timely if the period began to run with the sale of the assets of the business; was not timely if it began to run at the time of Mr. Borin\u2019s death. The question, therefore, boils down to: when did the \u201ctaxable year\u201d end?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">Appellant argues that, by the making of the election, \u00a7 1361(c) <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>becomes applicable. In that event the enterprise is thus considered a corporation and the election was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-16\">The government contends that a sole proprietorship has no existence or \u201ctaxable year\u201d independent of the proprietor and, thus, the \u201ctaxable year\u201d ended with Borin\u2019s death. It argues, further, that even if the election were timely made, no business was then in existence and the election was of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"AWY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>This ease presents a problem not unlike that posed by the question, \u201cwhich came first, the chicken or the egg ?\u201d The statutes in question are the result of an effort by Congress to minimize the effect of tax consequences on the taxpayer\u2019s choice of the form in which to operate small business enterprises. Under given conditions, a corporation may elect to be taxed as a proprietorship,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and vice versa.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In solving the problem arising here from the two postulates: i. e., the election was timely if the \u201ctaxable year\u201d continued until November 19th; and the \u201ctaxable year\u201d continued until November 19th if the election was timely, we must recognize that Congress intended to give the taxpayer the benefit of hindsight in making a choice. The treatment available does not involve an \u201cexemption\u201d to be strictly construed. The clear intent of Congress, in giving the choice to the small businesses which qualify, would be frustrated if the position were taken, as the government suggests all through its argument, that the taxpayer should not be given the benefit of hindsight. The liberal treatment intended is illustrated by a Revenue Ruling allowing partnerships which elect to be taxed as corporations to deduct the costs of meals and lodgings furnished to a partner-employee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In holding that the \u201ctaxable year\u201d ended with Mr. Borin\u2019s death, the court below relied on People\u2019s-Pittsburgh Trust Co. v. United States, 1935, 10 F.Supp. 139, 80 Ct.Cl. 716, for the proposition that the taxable year of a partnership ended with the death of the partner, as to him. Even if the principle announced in People\u2019s-Pittsburgh were still the law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it would not be dispositive here. For, as we have said, the election allowed the taxpayer to treat the business as a corporation, and the sale of the business thus ended the taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">The government\u2019s contention that Sub-chapter R treatment is not to be allowed in the year in which the proprietor or partner dies is not convincing. In an analogous case,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Second Circuit held that Subchapter S treatment can be elected by a corporation about to be liquidated. We agree, and see no reason why Subchapter R treatment may not be allowed a proprietorship or partnership in the year of the proprietor\u2019s or partner\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">The government\u2019s contention that \u201cno business enterprise was owned by Mr. Borin at the time the election was made,\u201d is a <em>non sequitur. </em>The statute does not require that the business be \u201cowned\u201d on the date the election is made, only that it be owned <em>\u201con or after </em>the first day of the * * * taxable year * * * and <em>on or before </em>the date of election.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1361(b). [Emphasis added.] These conditions were met, as were the other requisite conditions. This fact, the government does not challenge. If it should be required that the election be made at the time the business is sold, the sixty-day period given by the statute in which to make the decision would be lost in liquidation situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>We have examined the other objections made by the government and do not find them convincing. For example, the objection that the election notice was not signed by all parties owning an interest in the enterprise, is answered by the fact that Mrs. Borin signed as \u201cIndependent Executrix\u201d and Mr. Borin\u2019s will vested her with the authority so to deal with the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The government argues in the alternative that, if the election is found to be valid and timely, and corporate treatment to be available, certain other tax liabilitis are thus created which the government is entitled to set off against the refund otherwise due. We express no opinion on this contention and leave it for an initial determination by the court below on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case remanded with directions that a judgment be entered for the taxpayer after a determination of tax liabilities, if any, created by the corporate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-10\">. \u201cSec. 1361.
