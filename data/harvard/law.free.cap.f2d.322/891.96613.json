The United States District Court for the Southern District of California awarded a judgment in favor of the taxpayer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the government has appealed therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">Federal Employees\u2019 Distributing Company (appellee herein), a California non-stock membership corporation which issues memberships chiefly to government employees, was engaged in the sale of consumer goods at discounted retail prices to its members and their guests at five locations in Southern California during the period in question. In return for a fee of two dollars, each qualified applicant received a non-assessable and non-transferable life membership certificate entitling him to enter appellee\u2019s premises and make purchases at a discount. The issue before the district court was whether the fees were paid in exchange for \u201cstock\u201d, within the meaning of that term as used in section 1032 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The district court concluded that the membership certificates did represent \u201cstock\u201d for the purpose of section 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">The issue presented in this case is the same as that presented in Affiliated Government Employees\u2019 Distributing Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 9 Cir., 322 F.2d 872. While there are a few factual differences between that case and the instant one,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the differences are not substantial and would not justify different results in the two cases. For the \u25a0 reasons stated in <em>Affiliated, </em>therefore, we conclude that the fees in this case were not paid in exchange for stock and constituted taxable income to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-17\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for entry of judgment in favor of appellant-</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-12\">. See 206 F.Supp. 330 (D.C.Cal.1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b938-13\">. For example, under appellee\u2019s by-laws a member was entitled, upon Ms request, to a refund upon resignation of Ms membership; in the event of a member\u2019s death, a refund was made, upon request of the deceased member\u2019s executor or administrator, to the member\u2019s estate. Prior to November 17, 1956, Affiliated Government Employees\u2019 Distributing Company\u2019s by-laws also provided for a refund of the membersMp fee upon the resignation or death of a member. On and subsequent to that date, however, refunds were left to the discretion of Affiliated\u2019s board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-19\">Another factual difference that was noted is that appellee has paid a federal excise tax on the issuance of its memberships, whereas it would appear that Affiliated has not paid tMs tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
