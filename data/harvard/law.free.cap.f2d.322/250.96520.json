Indeed, when the evidence, most of which is set out in substance in the judge\u2019s findings, is considered, it would be a denial of justice in this case to set aside the decree on the ground that the findings and conclusions were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">In Findley v. Lanassa, 5 Cir., 276 F.2d 907, this court affirmed the judgment of the district court, finding the evidence sufficient to support the payment of, and awarding a maritime lien for, crew\u2019s wages, when the evidence was less explicit and convincing than it is here. I dissented in that case, but I am now of the opinion that my view there was too restrictive and that the majority was correct in holding the evidence sufficient to establish payment for crew\u2019s wages and awarding a lien therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">The facts in this case are stronger and more compelling than they were in the Findley case. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-27\">. Bugg v.
