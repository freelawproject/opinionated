We have jurisdiction under sections 7482 and 7483 of the Internal Revenue Code to review the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-20\">Petitioner operates a group of department stores in the San Francisco Bay area for the exclusive use of its members and guests. The issue before the Tax Court was whether the membership fees paid to petitioner could be considered exempt from taxation either as contributions to capital under section 118 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or as money received in exchange for stock under section 1032 of the Code. Petitioner now concedes that the fees could not be considered contributions to capital, but contends that the Tax Court erred in failing to find that the fees were paid in exchange for stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-21\">The facts are not in dispute and for the purpose of this opinion we will adopt the following findings of the Tax Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACO\">\u201cPetitioner, a so-called nonprofit membership corporation, was organized in 1953 and exists pursuant to the General Non-Profit Corporation Law of the State of California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-22\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-23\">\u201cPetitioner is a retail merchandising corporation which sells a broad line of consumer goods. It does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>sell to the public at large but restricts its sales and the use of its premises and facilities to its members and their guests. Members are admitted to petitioner\u2019s stores only upon presentation of a membership card and upon signing a register. However, guests are admitted when accompanied by members, and may thus make purchases without restriction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-4\">\u201cPrior to July 23, 1956, petitioner had two classes of membership: regular and honorary. Regular memberships were issuable to any active or retired employee of the Federal, state, or local government for an \u2018initiation fee\u2019 of two dollars. Such memberships were for the life of the member and were nontransferable and nonassessable. Honorary memberships required no initiation fee and were issuable to any person at the discretion of petitioner\u2019s board of directors, but not in excess of five per calendar year. On June 30, 1956, petitioner had 77,991 regular members and less than ten honorary members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">\u201cUnder petitioner\u2019s by-laws in effect prior to July 23, 1956, both regular and honorary members possessed the right to vote for its board of directors and on other corporate matters. Any membership could be revoked by two-thirds vote of the board of directors \u2018for cause,\u2019 and the membership fee paid was not refundable. Any member could resign his membership and be refunded his membership fee. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1956, a total of 52 members either resigned or had their membership revoked. All such members (including the revoked memberships, contrary to the bylaws) had their membership fees refunded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-7\">\u201cOn and subsequent to July 23, 1956, when petitioners by-laws were revised, petitioner had three classes of membership: life, associate (Class 1 and Class 2), and honorary. Life memberships were the counterpart of the earlier regular memberships, issuable to any active or retired employee of the Federal, state, or local government for a \u2018consideration\u2019 of two dollars. Associate memberships, Class 1, were issuable to the widows-of government employees, were for life, and cost two dollars; associate memberships, Class 2, were issuable to any person who had served at least six months in the Armed Forces of the United States, were also for life;, and cost three dollars. Honorary memberships were issuable without cost to any person at the discretion of petitioner\u2019s board of directors, but not in excess of fifteen per calendar year. At the dates indicated, the number of members in each class was as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-8\">December 31, 1956 June 30, 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANB\">Life members 90,950 98,107</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avj\">Associate members 10,278 16,322</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ace\">Honorary members Less than 10 Less than 10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-16\">\u201cUnder the revised by-laws, 'pnly life members were entitled to vote and to attend annual or special membership meetings. In the event of petitioner\u2019s liquidation or dissolution or winding up, both life and associate members were to be entitled to a distribution pro rata of any assets remaining to be distributed among or paid over to the members. All classifications of membership were nontransferable and nonassessable. Any membership could be revoked by a two-thirds vote of petitioner\u2019s board of directors \u2018for any cause deemed sufficient\u2019 by the board with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>out refunding any consideration paid. Any member could resign his membership and be refunded his membership fee. In the event of the death of a life or associate member, the consideration paid for his membership was payable to the member\u2019s estate upon request of his executor or administrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-4\">\u201cOn November 17, 1956, petitioner\u2019s by-laws were amended to provide that thereafter all refunding of membership fees, whether based on revocation, resignation, or death of the member, would be within the sole discretion of its board of directors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-5\">\u201cIn the fiscal year ended June 30, 1957, a total of 57 members either resigned or had their membership revoked. All such members (including those whose memberships were revoked, contrary to the bylaws until November 17, 1956) had their membership fees refunded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-6\">\u201cRevocation of membership in petitioner during the taxable years in issue was based on action by the member contrary to the interests of petitioner. Such action included cashing bad checks, shoplifting, and in a single case using the membership privileges for the purpose of obtaining information for use against petitioner in a fair trade pricing dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-7\">\u201cPrior to issuance of memberships to eligible persons, petitioner has at all times since its incorporation filed applications for authorizing permits with the Division of Corporations of the Department of Investments of the State of California and has obtained responsive permits from the Commissioner of Corporations of the State of California authorizing the issuance and sale of such memberships as \u2018securities.\u2019 No memberships have been sold by petitioner except pursuant to authorizing permit of the Commissioner of Corporations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-8\">\u201cEligible persons apply for membership either in person at one of petitioner\u2019s stores or by mail. Each is required to furnish proof of qualification, as well as to fill out and subscribe his or her name to an application card. During the years here in issue the applicaton for life (regular) membership contained the following information about petitioner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-9\">\u201cA.G.E.

width=\"1070\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">During the years in question, petitioner leased the premises in which its business was carried on.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">The Tax Court concluded that the membership fees \u201cwere plainly of a type of receipt that is normally regarded as income\u201d and then considered whether the fees fell within the exclusionary provisions of section 118 of the Code (relating to contributions to capital) or section 1032 (relating to a corporation\u2019s receipt of money or property in exchange for its stock). The Court held that the fees \u201cwere paid predominantly for the privilege of shopping at petitioner\u2019s stores and using its facilities\u201d and as such were not exempt under either statute. As noted earlier, petitioner now concedes that the fees would not be considered contributions to capital, but contends that the Tax Court erred in failing to hold that they were paid in exchange for stock. For the reasons to be discussed hereafter, we agree with the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Section 1032 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-9\">\u201cNo gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation on the receipt of money or other property in exchange for stock (including treasury stock) of such corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-24\">Although none of the prior revenue acts had contained a similar provision, it was clear even before the enactment of section 1032 that no gain or loss was realized by a corporation on the original sale of its stock. Difficulties arose, however, in determining whether gain or loss was realized by a corporation when it disposed of its treasury stock. To clarify the situation, section 1032 was enacted to provide for the non-recognition of gain or loss whenever a corporation receives money or property for its stock. Thus, generally speaking, Congress was only concerned with the problem of taxing gains or losses on treasury stock transactions and did not consider the problems which might arise in defining the term \u201cstock.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-25\">The term \u201cstock\u201d is not in fact specifically defined in the Code. Section 7701 (a) (7) does provide that the term \u201cincludes shares in an association, joint-stock company, or insurance company.\u201d It would appear therefore that Congress chose to accept the ordinary connotations of the term and merely listed certain in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>terests which might not be considered \u201cstock\u201d, as it is normally defined. For the purpose of this opinion, we shall accept the following commonly given definition of stock quoted in petitioner\u2019s brief: \u201c* * * the interest or right</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-4\">which the owner, who is called the \u2018shareholder\u2019 or \u2018stockholder\u2019 has in the management of the corporation, and in its surplus profits, and, on a dissolution in all of its assets remaining after the payments of its debts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The fact that memberships in petitioner may, as a matter of form, fall within the purview of this definition does not, of course, control, since in applying the income tax laws we must regard matters of substance and not mere form.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Analysis of the substance of the relationship between petitioner and its members reveals to us that the fees in the instant case were not received by petitioner in exchange for its stock, but rather were received for the privilege of buying goods at a discount at petitioner\u2019s stores. Although the memberships technically had some of the indicia of stock, <em>i. e., </em>the right to vote for the management and the right to share in the assets upon dissolution of the corporation, these facts must be considered in the following context: a merchant-customer relationship existed between petitioner and its members; the fee paid for the privilege of purchasing at the stores was small; members did not share in profits or potential growth of the corporation during its life; membership was not assignable and terminated at death; memberships were subject to revocation for any cause deemed sufficient; refunds of the fee either upon death or resignation were solely within the discretion of the Board of Directors; and no certificate of membership other than a wallet-sized card was issued. Neither does it appear that a conscientious effort was made to inform the members of their rights to vote and share in the assets of the corporation upon liquidation. The applicants were not told at the time of their applications that they had these rights and the rights were not listed on the membership cards. Even assuming that a substantial number of the members knew of their right to vote, we submit that on the basis of the facts outlined above it could not have been reasonably foreseen that the average member would have any desire to exercise the right; it is also difficult to believe, as stated by the Tax Court, \u201cthat the remote possibility of participating in any * * * distribution upon liquidation was a factor of any consequence in relation to the payment of the comparatively small fees here in issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Further, as noted earlier, the Tax Court emphasized the fact that the fees \u201cwere paid predominantly for the privilege of shopping at petitioner\u2019s stores and using its facilities.\u201d Petitioner contends that motive or intent of the purchaser has no relevance to the determination whether \u201cstock\u201d has been purchased. If no question were raised as to the substance of the interests or rights which allegedly qualified the members as \u201cstockholders,\u201d we would be inclined to agree with petitioner. Here, however, we feel that the issue is whether the members received any interest of substance in the corporation other than the privilege to buy at discount. In resolving this issue, we feel that the Tax Court was justified in considering all of the circumstances surrounding the purchase of memberships, including the motives or purposes of the parties to the transaction. In the instant case, we cannot see how either the management or the applicants could realistically have considered the fees paid to have been \u201cin exchange for stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">We do not hold here that memberships in non-stock corporations cannot fall within the purview of section 1032; nor do we hold that the absence of one or more of the normal indicia of stock considered above would preclude an exclusion under the statute. We merely hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>on the facts of this case that the members received in exchange for their fees nothing of substance other than the privilege of buying goods at a discount, that their fees were thus paid solely for direct benefits to be received from petitioner<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and as such constituted taxable income to petitioner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-10\">.
