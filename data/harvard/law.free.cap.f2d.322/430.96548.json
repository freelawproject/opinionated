He was released on parole on September 4, 1947. Thereafter he was convicted in a state court of Michigan of a criminal offense, and in April 1955, upon completion of the sentence there imposed, he was arrested as a parole violator and returned to the penitentiary to complete his original sentence. A hearing was held July 18, 1955, at which the conviction in Michigan was admitted by appellant, as well as other items of violation of parole. He was not advised of his right to have assistance of counsel at this proceeding, nor was he advised of his right to present voluntary witnesses; and he did not have counsel or witnesses present. On August 23, 1955, his parole was revoked. On May 9, 1961, he was offered a new hearing with the right to retain counsel. This he refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">On May 22, 1961, the present action was filed for mandatory injunction for his release, in which proceeding appellant alleged invalidity of the parole revocation proceedings. In January 1962, he was again offered a hearing with counsel and the right to present witnesses. This, too, he refused. The District Court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">We think this case is governed by Hyser v. Reed, No. 16716,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 115 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 318 F.2d 225, decided April 11, 1963, wherein, in cases similar to the present one, we affirmed the judgments appealed from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-14\">\u201cwithout prejudice to the right of each such appellant to have upon request, the \u2018opportunity to appear\u2019 before the Board pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207. We note that the Board has already tendered such opportunity to each of these appellants. This opportunity to appear shall be for the limited purpose of presenting to the Board reasons why the parole violation charged should not operate as a basis for revoking parole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on Glenn v. Reed, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 85, 289 F.2d 462 (1961), is misplaced. In that case the parolee denied the violation, claiming that \u201cthe Board issued its parole violator\u2019s warrant on the basis of a fabricated charge made by a \u2018jealous woman\u2019 [who subsequently] withdrew her charge.\u201d We ordered appellant\u2019s release because of \u201cthese facts, together with the admittedly invalid hearing.\u201d Id. No such facts are alleged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without prejudice to the right of appellant to have, upon request, the opportunity to appear before the Parole Board pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207. This opportunity to appear shall, as' in Hyser v. Reed, be for the limited purpose of presenting to the Board reasons why the parole violation charged should not operate as a basis for revoking parole.</p>\n<p id=\"AA2\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-10\">. Combined with Hyser were the following cases: Jatoft v. Chappell, No. 16806; Whitting v. Reed, No. 16811; Thompson r. United States Board of Parole, No. 16873; Neiswenter v.
