Fahning v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 299 F.2d 579; Helton v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 338; United States v. Simone, et al., 2 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 480; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Mora v. United States, 5 Cir., 1951, 190 F.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Assuming here that the statement proffered was improper, it is plain to us that the substantial rights of the defendant were not affected. His guilt is clear and error, if any occurred, was harmless. Rule 52(a), F.R.Cr.P., 18 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
