On February 4, 1960, Jones filed a petition in bankruptcy with a schedule of debts listing Household Finance Corporation of Atlanta<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a secured creditor. On June 11, 1960, H.F.C. filed suit in a state court against Jones seeking judgment for $489.08, a debt arising out of a loan. H.F.C. claims that the debt was not discharged in bankruptcy because Jones had made false statements as to his financial liabilities in applying for the loan. Three days later, on June 14, the Referee in Bankruptcy entered the discharge order stating : \u201cIt further appearing that after due notice by mail no objection to the discharge of said bankrupt was filed within the time fixed by the court;\u201d. No appeal from the discharge was taken by H.F.C. Jones thereafter filed a motion in the U. S. District Court seeking an order enjoining H.F.C. from further prosecuting the action in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-19\">.. A temporary restraining order was issued and the matter was referred to the Referee in Bankruptcy, under F.R.Civ.P. 53(c), who acted in the nature of a Special Master, held a hearing and took evidence. At the hearing, Jones and his wife, who was present at the time the loan was made, testified that Jones had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>been instructed by the appellant\u2019s agent to not list all of his outstanding debts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">\u201cQ. Was that a first mortgage loan, Mr. Jones, that you gave Household Finance Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201cQ. Did you tell them at that time that you owed money on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">\u201cQ. Now, this statement of condition that you said earlier \u2014 statement of indebtedness that you said you signed earlier, did this man that waited on you ask you any questions about money that you owed? Just tell the Court in your own words what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">\u201cA. He asked me how much I owed and I told him, well, I\u2019d have to think a bit about it as I didn\u2019t handle the money and that my wife did most of the paying of the bills, that I\u2019d have to think a bit. And I started listing some of it down. It was getting quite late in the day and he said, \u2018Is that all ? \u2019 And I said, \u2018No\u2019, I said, \u2018There\u2019s some more.\u2019 And I was thinking, you know, trying to give an accurate account if I could. And he said, \u2018What else ? \u2019 I said, \u2018Well, doctors and drug stores.\u2019 And he said, \u2018What else ? \u2019 I said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m thinking.\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s enough.\u2019 Said, \u2018Put that down.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-13\">\u201cQ. Did he tell you why he said that was enough ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-14\">\u201cA. He said, \u2018If you put down too many, they won\u2019t make the loan.\u2019 I\u2019d already told him that I had a loan on the furniture and that was what I was putting up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-15\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-16\">\u201cThe Witness: [Mrs. Jones]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-17\">He didn\u2019t know. I paid all the bills. I handled the money. Charles worked and made the money and put it in the bank and I wrote checks and paid the bills. So he was asking me \u2014We were filling out the papers, he was, and he stopped to ask me and we were discussing and he wrote down and the boy looked at the paper and he said, \u2018Is that all you owe?\u2019 And Charles said, \u2018No.\u2019 Said, \u2018We owe other bills.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well that\u2019s enough.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-20\">After the hearing, the Referee rendered a report to which H.F.C. filed objections. The District Court referred the matter back to the Referee as Special Master for clarification and a \u201cSupplementary Report of Special Master\u201d to which objections were made by H.F.C. was submitted to the District Judge. This supplementary report stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-21\">\u201c(15) Your Special Master finds, however, that while the statement was false, THE RESPONDENT, THROUGH ITS EMPLOYEE, DID NOT RELY UPON THAT STATEMENT IN MAKING THE LOAN: further that the \"statement was not given with the intent to deceive within the meaning of Section 17a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act AS AMENDED AND THE CASES CONSTRUING THAT SECTION BEFORE AMENDMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-22\">\u201cAccordingly, it is found that the debt which Respondent seeks to enforce is a dischargeable debt and unenforceable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-23\">The District Judge then entered his order on the 27th day of August 1962, enjoining H.F.C. from further pursuing the matter in state court. On September 19, 1962, H.F.C. filed a notice of appeal to this court styled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-24\">\u201cIn the Matter of Charles B. Jones, Petitioner, vs. Household Finance Corporation of Atlanta, Case No. 37717 In Bankruptcy [Injunction]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWc\">On this appeal it is appropriate to consider. \u00a7 24 sub. a of the Bankruptcy Act, and Rule 11 of this Court. Section 24, sub. a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-25\">\u201cJurisdiction of appellate courts (a) The United States court of appeals, * * * are invested with appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>jurisdiction from the several courts of bankruptcy * * * to review, affirm, revise, or reverse * * * And provided further, That when any order, decree, or judgment involves less than $500, an appeal therefrom may be taken only upon allowance of the appellate court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Subsection (2) of Rule 11 of this court entitled \u201cAppeals in Bankruptcy\u201d is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">\u201c2. When the judgment appealed from involves less than $500, the allowance of the appeal by this court may be obtained as follows: The usual notice of appeal will be given in the lower court and the usual transcript of the record prepared and transmitted to the clerk of this court with evidence of notice to the appellees of the date of transmittal, accompanied with a brief petition for allowance of the appeal. Upon receipt of the transcript the clerk will docket the case and ten days thereafter will present the petition and transcript to the court if in session, and if not in session to a judge thereof, for allowance of the appeal. During the delay of ten days typewritten briefs may be filed in support of or opposition to the allowance. If the court or judge allows the appeal the case will then follow the usual course of appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">No petition for allowance of the appeal has been filed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The Supreme Court in Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Prudence S. Adv. Group, 311 U.S. 579, 61 S.Ct. 331, 85 L.Ed. 364 (1940), in reference to another bankruptcy statute granting discretionary appellate jurisdiction, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">\u201cIn our view, however, Rule 73(a) is not applicable to appeals under \u00a7 250 (see 2 Collier on Bankruptcy (14th ed. p. 918) for they are permissive appeals which may be had not as of right but only in the discretion of the Circuit Court of Appeals. Since \u00a7 250 provides that they may \u2018be taken to and allowed by the circuit court of appeals,\u2019 the proper procedure for taking them is by filing in the Circuit Court of Appeals, within the time prescribed in \u00a7 25(a), applications for leave to appeal, not by filing notices of appeal in the District Court as was done here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">The Second Circuit has dealt with this question on two occasions. The first case, New York Credit Men\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Brown, 2 Cir., 1941, 118 F.2d 6, concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">\u201cOur jurisdiction depends upon how much the order of the district court \u2018involved\u2019; if that was less than $500, it was necessary to obtain leave to appeal under the second proviso of \u00a7 24, sub. a, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47, sub. a, and as no leave was granted we have no jurisdiction, a question we must decide, although the appellee has not raised it. If in that inquiry we are confined to the petition, answer and order of the referee, no leave was necessary; if on the other hand we are free to examine the evidence and the referee\u2019s finding, the order of the district court \u2018involved\u2019 less than $500 as has just appeared. We have been unable to find any decision upon the question under \u00a7 24, sub. a \u2014 or under \u00a7 25, sub. a(3), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47, sub. a or \u00a7 48 sub. a(3), before 1938 \u2014 but during the period when the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court depended upon the amount in dispute it became well settled that the court would look to the record at large. Gray v. Blanchard, 97 U.S. 564, 24 L.Ed. 1108; Tinstman v. First National Bank, 100 U.S. 6, 25 L.Ed. 530; New Orleans Nati[onal] Banking Association v. New Orleans Mut. Insurance Association, 102 U.S. 121, 26 L.Ed. 45; Hilton v. Dickinson, 108 U.S. 165, 174, 2 S.Ct. 424, 27 L.Ed. 688; Jenness v. Citizens\u2019 National Bank of Rome, 110 U.S. 52, 53, 3 S.Ct. 425, 28 L.Ed. 67. We think that that doctrine should be applied to \u00a7 24, sub. a and that in order to determine our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>jurisdiction we must examine the whole record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\u201cAppeal dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In the second case, New York Credit Men\u2019s Adjustment Bureau, Inc. v. David Strauss <em>&amp; </em>Co., 2 Cir., 1961, 296 F.2d 702, the earlier decision was followed and approved :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cWhen less than $500 is at stake, the Court of Appeals may review the district court sitting in bankruptcy only if leave to appeal has been granted by the Court of Appeals. Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 24, sub. a, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47. Since the trustee-appellant has not requested leave to appeal, the appeal must be dismissed, see New York Credit Men\u2019s Ass\u2019n. v. Brown, 118 F.2d 6 (2 Cir.1941), unless there are circumstances which justify our disregard of such irregularity in the interests of substantial justice. See Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Prudence Securities Advisory Group, 311 U.S. 579, 61 S.Ct. 331, 85 L.Ed. 364 (1941).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">\u201cEven were we to treat the filing of the notice of appeal as a request for leave to appeal, see, e. g., State of Calif[ornia] Dept. of Employment v. Fred S. Renauld &amp; Co., 179 F.2d 605, 607-608 (9 Cir.1950), we would be of the view that the question presented is not of sufficient importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">The requirement of \u00a7 24 of the Bankruptcy Act may be waived where a <em>special equity </em>or <em>exceptional circumstances </em>exist. State of California Dept. of Employment v. Fred S. Renauld &amp; Co., 9 Cir., 1950, 179 F.2d 605. Under the facts and in the circumstances of this case we do not find the existence of such special equity or exceptional circumstances. H.F.C. had notice of the bankruptcy and the time set for final discharge, but no objection was made to the action of the Referee. The state court action was filed 3 days before the final discharge was granted. As the facts stand now, the Bankruptcy Court has ruled upon the dischargeability of the debt. A special master was appointed, a hearing was held, objections were rendered to the report of the special master, all of which were considered by the U. S. District Court and the report of the special master was approved. We are not disposed to upset such findings and conclusions, or to authorize pursuit of the matter in the state court. We reach the same conclusion here as was reached in the Strauss case, supra, and we quote from that opinion to express our conclusion :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">\u201cEven were we to treat the filing of the notice of appeal as a request for leave to appeal * * *, we would be of the view that the question presented is not of sufficient importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-20\">.
