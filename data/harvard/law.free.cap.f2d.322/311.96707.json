One-of the three was Smart\u2019s boss, Wayne Kanack. The union was the collective bargaining representative of the company\u2019s empoyees, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-24\">The general counsel for the Board produced testimony that Kanack resented: the removal of his name as a member, because it made him (Kanack) ineligible for participation in the union\u2019s welfare- and pension fund. This was a particularly acute aggravation at that particular-time, because Kanack\u2019s wife was about to have a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-25\">Smart, who had been operating a bucket loader for several days, was, on August 3, 1961, assigned by Kanack to manually dig a ditch. After some conversation, Smart threw a shovelful of dirt in Kanack\u2019s direction which \u201ccame close,\u201d but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>missed Kanack. Kanack then fired Smart for \u201cassault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Was Smart fired because of his \u201cassault\u201d or because Kanack was angry with his loss of pension and welfare status, and wanted an excuse to fire Smart ?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">As is usual in these cases, the facts emphasized by the employer are entirely different than those emphasized on behalf of the union employee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Petitioning Board has reason for such emphasis. It need merely point to evidence supporting the conclusions and order. Bon Hennings Logging Company v. N. L. R. B., 9 Cir. 1962, 308 F.2d 548. Respondent seeks to avoid the rule of that case by suggesting it applies only where the record discloses \u201cthe grossest type of hostile, anti-union conduct on the part of the employer which admittedly preceded the discharge of the employee.\u201d We enunciated no such rule in Bon Hennings Logging Company v. N. L. R. B., supra. Instead we pointed out \u201c[o]ur role in reviewing decisions of the Board is a limited one. We are confined to determinations of whether decisions are supported by substantial evidence <em>in records considered as a whole.\u201d </em>Id. at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Even were the employer\u2019s evidence uncontradicted as to his motive behind any certain action, the Board may, but need not, accept it; nor is it bound thereby. National Labor Relations Board v. Walton Mfg. Co., 369 U.S. 404, 82 S.Ct. 853, 7 L.Ed.2d 829 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">Nor can we accept the respondent\u2019s theory that proof or lack of proof of prior anti-union animus is <em>controlling. </em>Such a rule would automatically always insulate the <em>first </em>unfair labor practice charged against an employer. National Labor Relations Board v. Williams, 4 Cir. 1952, 195 F.2d 669, holds \u201cthe presence of an anti-union attitude and the absence of other valid reasons must necessarily lend strong weight to a finding of discrimination.\u201d This does not mean the presence or absence of such anti-union animus is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">Respondent sets up another straw man in claiming it was prevented \u201cfrom showing a complete lack of anti-union attitude and history on the part of respondent company,\u201d (Respondent\u2019s Brief, p. 13), citing the transcript, p. 115. That reference shows only that the hearing officer refused to permit respondent to prove that issue on cross-examination of petitioner\u2019s witnesses. That this is so is established by lines 16 and 17, where the trial examiner states: \u201cHowever, if in your case you wish to establish that, all right.\u201d Then on the respondent\u2019s case, <em>over objection </em>by general counsel for petitioner, the respondent was permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>introduce into evidence all that it desired to offer on this question of anti-unionism. (Tr. p. 149, 189.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Assuming, as we will here, that such testimony is always admissible under the theory expressed in National Labor Relations Board v. Williams, supra, we still find nothing in the record to support any claim of rejected evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">There is but one question here. Was there substantial evidence in the record, considered as a whole, to fairly support the decision of the Board? Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Bd., 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456. We hold there was; therefore we agree with the Board\u2019s conclusion that M-rak Coal Company, Inc., was guilty of an unfair labor practice proscribed by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The Board\u2019s findings are affirmed. The petition of the Board for enforcement is granted, there being no objection made to the proposed enforcement, once the responsibility is established by proper findings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-15\">. Section 8(a) (1) and (3) of the Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (3)), reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWg\">\u201c8(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIv\">\u201c(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed in section 7 ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Z\"># * * * * \u201c(3) by discrimination in regard to iiire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in. any labor organization * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">. Merely as an example, without placing undue emphasis on the <em>value </em>of the testimony \u2014 (a) Petitioner emphasizes that Smart threw a shovelful of dirt, but that it missed Kanack. Respondent emphasizes that the dirt missed Kanack, hut only because Kanack stepped aside.</p>\n<p id=\"AyL\">(b) Petitioner emphasizes what Kanack said to Lloyd Hill (Tr. pp. 38, 39, 89) ; his threat to get even with Smart (Tr. p. 89) ; and what was said to Ernest Harris (Tr. p. 107). Respondent emphasizes that nothing was said between Kanack and Smart until Smart said: \u201cI\u2019d like to wrap this shovel around your head,\u201d (Tr. p. 164) and does not comment either \u25a0on any remarks Kanack made to others, or what Kanack had allegedly previously said to Smart \u2014 that Kanack had a ditch for Smart to dig \u2014 that he had a lot more of this kind of work for Smart, that the 4' X 4' X 20' or 30' ditch was to be dug by hand \u201cwithin a week.\u201d Respondent makes no mention of Kanack\u2019s alleged statement made to Lloyd Hill, after the office conference, that Smart had discriminated against <em>Mm </em>(Kanack) by taking him off the union check-off list (Tr. pp. 48, 92, 93) ; of Kanack\u2019s crying, throwing his hard hat to the ground, admittedly becoming hysterical, speaking of his wife and baby, and stating he could put Smart hack on the job, but would not do so until he (Kanack) was back on the welfare list (Tr. pp. 49, 93, 94).</p>\n<p id=\"ACS\">(c) Respondent mentions that the excavation started by Smart \u201cwas in fact thereafter finished by fellow employees\u201d (Brief, p. 16; erroneously citing R. 61, lines 12-14). Petitioner emphasizes the excavation was not completed seven months later, at the time of hearing (Tr. pp.17,18).</p>\n<p id=\"A_W\">(d) Several other instances could be cited, if desirable to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
