Economically, they did not make in their pump business a lot of money in 1954, but the commissioner and the Director of Internal Revenue have bunched into 1954 what was really the fruits of an individual business enterprise which began in 1942 and continued into 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">Apparently during the years of the enterprise the Prathers\u2019 net worth was going steadily, slowly and surely upward. But they were showing on their returns comparatively little taxable income from their business. This they accomplished from 1942 to 1953 by reporting on the cash receipts and disbursements method. No suggestion is made of any immorality or wrongfulness in so doing. In 1953, taxpayers switched their accounting from a cash basis to an accrual basis, but on their 1953 return they made adjustments to show their income on the old cash basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">On January 1, 1954, the Prathers on the new accrual basis showed net assets of $303,397.63 and liabilities to others of $100,991.90. For 1954, the return showed net taxable income on an accrual basis of $9,410.52. The director has added over $200,000 of net taxable income to the 1954 return and asserts a deficiency of about $160,000 in taxes. We do not have to go outside of the record to surmise that the director\u2019s (now the commissioner\u2019s) position, if upheld, about ruins the Prathers and takes the fruits of a business they built up for over 13 years. The tax court has upheld the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">We assume that the business started when inventory and receivables were small factors, or that at the outset it may have been that capital represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>in the inventory and receivables was offset by borrowed capital. Anyway, they went on and on reporting on a cash basis, which obviously did not reflect their financial betterment somewhere between 1942 and 1953. For some of the returns for pre-1954 years, there were discussions with field agents about a change from cash to accrual reporting \u2014 but nothing happened. Neither the taxpayers nor the tax gatherer insisted on a change, and it is not clear that either wanted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">In 1954 a new Internal Revenue Code was adopted with the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-6\">\u201c\u00a7 481. Adjustments required by changes in method of accounting</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8G\">\u201c(a) General rule. \u2014 In computing the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income for any taxable year (referred to in this section as the \u2018year of the change\u2019)\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am3\">\u201c(1) if such computation is under a method of accounting different from the method under which the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income for the preceding taxable year was computed, then</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-7\">\u201c(2) there shall be taken into account those adjustments which are determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change in order to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted, <em>except there shall not be taken into account any adjustment in respect of any taxable year to which this section does not apply.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Enacted August 16. 1954.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">In pertinent part, Section 446 (and its predecessor) has provided for a long time as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-9\">\u201cGeneral rule for methods of accounting</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-10\">\u201c(a) General rule. \u2014 Taxable income shall be computed under the method of accounting on the basis of which the taxpayer regularly computes his income in keeping his books.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-11\">\u201c(b) Exceptions. \u2014 If no method of accounting has been regularly used by the taxpayer, or if the method used does not clearly reflect income, the computation of taxable income shall be made under such method as, in the opinion of the Secretary or his delegate, does clearly reflect income. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-13\">\u201c(e) Requirement respecting change of accounting method. \u2014 Except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, a taxpayer who changes the method of accounting on the basis of which he regularly computes his income in keeping his books shall, before computing his taxable income under the new method, secure the consent of the Secretary or his delegate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">If taxpayer could successfully change his accounting and reporting method for the year 1954, Section 481, on August 16, 1954, gave him an escape to avoid the bunching of income in the year in which he made his shift of accounting basis. But Section 446(b) at least presented a problem \u2014 approval of change of method by the \u201cSecretary or his delegate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">Promptly after the August 16, 1954, enactment the commissioner started one of his most successful \u201csit downs\u201d in the history of American tax law. Not approving of Section 481 as enacted, he declined consistently to approve under 446(b) accounting method changes, until after the Congress on September 2, 1958, adopted the Technical Amendments Act, Section 29 of which amended Section 481(a) (2) to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-16\">\u201cSec. 481. Adjustments required by changes in method of accounting \u201c (a) General Rule. \u2014 In computing the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income for any taxable year (referred to in this section as the \u2018year of the change\u2019)\u2014 ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-17\">\u201c(2) there shall be taken into account those adjustments which are determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change in order to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted, except there shall not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>taken into account any adjustment in respect of any taxable year to which this section does not apply unless the adjustment is attributable to a change in the method of accounting initiated by the taxpayer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">With this change, the taxpayers, who already had their 1954 tax case in the tax court, were in real trouble. While the parties disagree as to the effect of non-approval of the change in accounting and repoxhiing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> both would agree that the commissioner has never expressly approved the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Taxpayer\u2019s first point is that Section 481(a) (2) as amended in 1958, \u201cunless the adjustment is attributable to a change in the method of accounting initiated by the taxpayer,\u201d is unconstitutional. This claim was not pleaded before the tax court. It could not have beeix pleaded, of course, before enactment. But there was plenty of time after enactment and before decision to x\u2019aise the point. The tax court apparently received extensive briefs on the constitutionality and heard arguments thereon. In announcing the decision, the tax coui*t held the issue not before it, but said, if it were, the court would decide in favor of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">While we agree that cases should be kept to the basic pleadings, yet the tax court let the parties fight out before it the issue. We thus conclude the issue was before it for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">After study of the question, we hold the statute constitutional. Equitably the terrible penalty of the income bunching here leaves one disturbed, but we cannot yet find unconstitutionality. Of course, the possibilities of the 1954 Section 481, permitting a taxpayer to escape taxes that another just like him had paid, did not present an attractive picture. Thus, the commissioner was able to get the law changed four years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">There seems little doubt that the 1958 amendments to Section 481 searching back to December 31,1953, were intended to reach taxpayers who had done just as the Prathers had done. In our judgment, constitutionality was saved by two provisions inserted into the section giving a ten-year carry forward (Subsection (b) (4) of Section 481 as amended) and an option under Subsection (e) to return to (or recast) the old method of accounting at the election of the taxpayer. The election was to be made within six months. The last day to make the election was March 2, 1959. (There was some delay after enactment on September 2, 1958, before promulgation of the regulation telling taxpayers how to do it, but still there was time.)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">Taxpayers rely greatly on the change of position they took in 1955. In that year they put their pump business into a family corporation. Taxpayers having ceased to do business as individuals, the ten-year foi*ward was of inconsequential value. But still they didn\u2019t elect to return to the cash basis which had obtained through 1954. The reason given is that such a course would have inflicted grave tax consequences on their separate entity, the corporation. What those consequences would be, we are not told. But we. think we know. Anyway, the problems of another entity on its taxes just can\u2019t be borrowed hei*e to knock out the constitutionality of the 1958 changes in Section 481 of the act. We do not believe in their able brief that taxpayers ever quite meet the failure to elect to go back. Albeit, we say they have done as well as they can. It is not asserted that tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>payers were ignorant of the act, but if so that would not be an excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">We cannot say the period for election was unduly short. We assume men have lost fortunes for failure to answer summonses within 20, 30 or 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">One must be sympathetic with the taxpayers here, but even on a \u201cfireside equity\u201d basis it can be said for the government that late in 1954 and early in 1955 it was common knowledge that the commissioner was fighting Section 481 as enacted in 1954 with everything at his command. His announced policy of not approving any changes in accounting methods may have been what prompted taxpayers to \u201cgo it alone\u201d and unilaterally change their accounting and reporting basis. We cannot see that the commissioner\u2019s audit of the 1954 return committed the Congress or bound it not to amend the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">A four-year search back is a long time, but cushioned as we believe it was with two escapes, one of which was clearly open to the taxpayers, we cannot say that we find unconstitutionality \u2014 in view of the very rare decisions of the Supreme Court which have proscribed retroactivity. We have to work within their pronouncements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Taxpayers assert if the 1958 amendment to Section 481 is constitutional, then they are entitled to carry back for two years behind 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">This point one must dig out of Section 481, after the 1959 amendments, in the following parts which are supposed to be pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-10\">\u201c\u00a7 481.

An election under this paragraph shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary or his delegate shall by regulations prescribe. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">Somehow or other there must be a way of writing a tax statute that is not so complex and does not involve subdivision under subdivision under subdivision under subdivision, cross-cutting and counter-marching.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">But pursuant to 481(b) (6) the Treasury promulgated the regulation shown in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Also, taxpayers say they were not required to make the election because they were already in the tax court where, by their presence, the statute of limitations had ceased to run, that the election procedure was provided simply to get waivers of the statute of limitations from taxpayers. No waivers from them were needed and so no waiver and election had to be filed with the director, so the reason runs. But the regulation did require the filing with the director. Even though it might be argued that once one\u2019s case is in the tax court it might be better to have a statute or regulation provide that an election could be filed in the tax court, still the regulation was within lawful bounds of the statute. What the taxpayers at the time thought of the two-year carry back is shown on June 23, 1961, when they attempted in a letter to the commissioner to secure allocation under 481(c) is shown by the following extract of the letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-4\">\u201cSection 481 permitting the allocation of the adjustment so that the increase in tax would not be greater than that which would be due if the added income were taxed one-third in the change year and one-third in the two preceding years, gave no adequate relief for the reason that the accumulation of inventory had been made over a 12 year period in which the business had operated prior to 1954, and the notes and accounts receivable were obligations which had accumulated by gradual growth of the business. The income arising by reason of recognition of said receivables properly would involve adjustments affecting each of the twelve years the returns were filed on the cash basis. The spreading of items accruing over a substantial number of years over a 3-year period only, is manifestly inequitable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">We find no evidence that the taxpayers really ever \u201celected\u201d the two-year carry back until they reached this court, and then they did it in the alternative. If it be silly to require the taxpayer to file the election with the director, nonetheless it was a silly condition that could have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Overall, the trouble with taxpayers\u2019 case is that they had an escape that would have saved them from ruin, the option to jump back to their old cash basis accounting. There was a time limit. They let it go by. Further, it just can\u2019t be accepted as a reason to declare a statute unconstitutional the circumstances that they would not have transferred their business to a corporation had they known about statutory changes to come.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Here, as we have indicated above, the law takes a terrible toll. We have been unable to convince ourselves that we can avoid it.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">The decision of the tax court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-8\">. Perhaps the commissioner was not inclined prior to 1954 to require a change in accounting method because on changes made at his direction the courts were not inclined to let him bunch income in the year of change. See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Mnookin\u2019s Estate, 8 Cir., 184 F.2d 89, and Welp v. United States, 8 Cir., 201 F.2d 128. On the other hand, pre-1954, the majority of decisions, we believe, had held that if the taxpayer initiated the change, income could be bunched in the year of change. See e. g., Advance Truck Co. v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 262 F.2d 388. Prior to 1954 the effects of changing accounting methods seems to have been left to administrative and judicial decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b981-11\">. See Cohan v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 39 F.2d 540, and cases there cited; Nicol v. Ames, 173 U.S. 509, 19 S.Ct. 522, 43 L.Ed. 786; Welch v. Henry, 305 U.S. 134, 59 S.Ct. 121, 83 L.Ed. 87. The court has carefully considered Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U.S. 531, 47 S.Ct. 710, 71 L.Ed. 1184; Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 48 S.Ct. 105, 72 L.Ed. 206; and Untermeyer v. Anderson, 276 U.S. 440, 48 S.Ct. 353, 72 L.Ed. 645. These cases involved retroactivity of taxation of single event occurrences, not retroactive income tax where the concept is \u201cflow\u201d and where the taxpayers had made unauthorized changes in accounting methods. Here the 1954 act gave taxpayers no right to unilaterally make a change and the 1958 act permitted them to have what they had legally on December 31, 1953, a right to the cash accounting basis. The difference is marked. To tax a single event (over which the taxpayer had no control) after it happened is shocking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b983-10\">.
