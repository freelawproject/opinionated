The action was commenced by writ dated 15 April 1963, returnable 29 <em>April </em>1963. An attachment of real estate was made 16 April 1963. The return of service on the writ states it was served on the defendants 17 <em>April </em>1963 by leaving it at their last and usual place of abode, 272 Burlington Avenue, Wilmington, Mass. The plaintiff\u2019s declaration alleged that defendants owed plaintiff $1245.00 plus attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with the note of $249.00, a total due of $1494.00. The defendants failed to appear and were defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">On <em>May </em>9, 1963, plaintiff\u2019s attorney mailed to the clerk of the Fourth District Court, a .copy of a motion to assess attorney\u2019s fees, a copy of which was mailed to defendants at 272 Burlington Avenue, Wilmington, Mass. The date set in the affidavit attached to the motion by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney for the presentation of the motion was 21 <em>May </em>1963. The notice and copy contained were sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>in an envelope containing the return address of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and the letter, was never returned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">On 27 <em>August </em>1963, plaintiff\u2019s attorney received from attorney for defendants a copy of a motion to stay judgment, remove default and <em>to </em>be permitted to appear and file an answer on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">28 <em>August </em>1963, Gregory H. Adamian, Esquire, appeared as counsel for defendant. The docket record does not show it to be a special appearance. On the same date, he filed the motion to stay, remove the default and answer on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">On 26 <em>November </em>1963, the defendants\u2019 motion to stay, remove default and answer to the merits was denied by the court and on 27 <em>December </em>1963, the plaintiff filed a motion for assessment of attorney\u2019s fees. The defendants on 2 <em>January </em>1964, filed a motion to continue the action until further notice be given defendants. This motion set forth that service purported to have been made on the defendants at their last and usual place of abode, 272 Burlington Avenue, Wilmington, Mass., when in fact on the date of service, they resided in Laurel, Maryland, and that the defendants did not receive further notice as required by G. L. ,c. 223, \u00a734-</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion to assess and the defendants\u2019 motion to continue for further motion to the defendants were heard 7 <em>January </em>1964. At these hearings, the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>offered an affidavit of the male defendant which stated defendants left Massachusetts 7 <em>April </em>1963, and established residents at Laurel, Maryland, and that they have no intention of returning to Massachusetts other than an occasional visit. The court denied the defendants\u2019 motion and granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion assessing attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $249.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The defendants claim to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s action in denying this motion to continue and by the court\u2019s action in assessing attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $249.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The defense which is sought to be raised by the defendants\u2019 motion to continue, namely that there was lack of proper service on the defendants is a matter of abatement. The question is one of fact as to whether the place of service was the defendants\u2019 last and usual place of abode. To establish the defense, evidence will be required. The proper method of raising the question is by an answer in abatement. <em>Estey v. Director of the Division of Employment Security, </em>338 Mass. 797, 798; <em>Paraboschi v. Shaw, </em>258 Mass. 531, 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">But whatever the pleading should have been or should not have been, is immaterial. In this case, the first step taken by the defendants\u2019 counsel was to file a motion to remove the defendants\u2019 default. Neither the docket nor the report state that the defendants\u2019 attorney filed <em>a special appearance, </em>and both are silent as to when defendants\u2019 attorney filed his appearance other than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>report state that on 27 <em>August </em>1963, plaintiff\u2019s attorney received from attorney for the defendant a motion to stay judgment and remove a default and permit the defendants to appear and answer <em>\u201con the merits\u201d. </em>On the affidavit attached to this motion, Gregory N. Adamian states that he is attorney for the above-named defendants, being the appellants in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">By submitting this motion, the defendants have submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the court. They have appeared generally and asked the court to exercise jurisdiction over the parties and thereby have waived all questions as to service and have submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the court \u201con the merits\u201d. <em>Gahm v. Wallace, </em>206 Mass. 39, 44, 45; <em>Buckley v. John, </em>314 Mass. 719, 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">To have granted the defendants\u2019 motion under these circumstances would have been unnecessary and would be a cause of groundless delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">There was no error in the denial of the defendants\u2019 motion to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion to allow attorney\u2019s fees was properly allowed. The note which was for $1245.00 called for interest \u201cat the legal rate and attorney\u2019s fees of 20% of the unpaid balance if placed with an attorney for collection\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Although the defendants in the report claimed to be aggrieved by this ruling of the court, the point was not raised or discussed in their brief. The defendants\u2019 attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>made no oral argument. The report fails to show any payments by the defendants on the note, and twenty-percent (20%) of the amount of the note is $249.00. In view of these facts, any objection to this finding was waived by the defendants. But even if the defendant had raised this issue, there was no error on the part of the court in allowing the plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b81-6\">Raymond P.
