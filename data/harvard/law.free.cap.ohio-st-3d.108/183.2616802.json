Rowe Jr., an inmate at Chillicothe Correctional Institution, filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Lawrence County for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee, Lawrence County Common Pleas Court Judge Frank J. McCown, to release him from prison in accordance with a plea agreement that he claimed the state had breached. As required by R.C. 2969.25, he attached an affidavit describing a prior civil action he had filed against a government employee within the previous five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">{\u00b6 2} On July 25, 2005, the court of appeals nevertheless sua sponte dismissed Rowe\u2019s petition for failure to comply with the R.C. 2969.25 affidavit requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">{\u00b6 3} In his appeal as of right, Rowe asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">{\u00b6 4} Dismissal of Rowe\u2019s mandamus petition was warranted because Rowe requested release from prison. Habeas corpus, rather than mandamus, is the proper action to seek this type of relief. <em>State ex rel. Nelson v. Griffin, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 167, 2004-Ohio-4754, 814 N.E.2d 866, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">{\u00b6 5} Moreover, Rowe has or had \u201can adequate legal remedy to rectify any alleged breach of plea agreement by filing a motion with the sentencing court to either withdraw his previous guilty plea pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1 or specifically enforce the agreement.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Seikbert v. Wilkinson </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 489, 491, 633 N.E.2d 1128. Rowe could also have appealed any judgment by Judge McCown denying his motion for judicial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">{\u00b6 6} Finally, insofar as Rowe may have already unsuccessfully invoked some of these alternate remedies, \u201ca writ of mandamus will not lie to relitigate the same issue.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Zimmerman v. Tompkins </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 447, 449, 663 N.E.2d 639.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AdGb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>William E. Rowe, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AIl\">Lynn Alan Grimshaw, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">{\u00b6 7} Based on the foregoing, although the court of appeals erred in relying on R.C. 2969.25 to dismiss Rowe\u2019s petition, its judgment dismissing the petition was appropriate. Cf. <em>State ex rel. McGrath v. Ohio Adult Parole Autk., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 72, 2003-Ohio-5062, 796 N.E.2d 526, \u00b6 8 (\u201cReviewing courts are not authorized to reverse a correct judgment on the basis that some or all of the lower court\u2019s reasons are erroneous\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b272-6\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
