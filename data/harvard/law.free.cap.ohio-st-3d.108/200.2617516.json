We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-18\">{\u00b6 2} Jeffrey L. Dixon hurt his lower back while employed as a delivery driver for self-insured Airborne Express, Inc. It eventually became clear that Dixon could never return to the heavy lifting that his position of employment had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>entailed. Recognizing this, in August 2001, Dixon\u2019s attending physician proposed vocational rehabilitation for Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">{\u00b6 3} Airborne, through its third-party administrator, agreed to Dixon\u2019s participation in vocational-rehabilitation services. Dixon responded on August 31, 2001, with a formal motion requesting approval of a vocational-rehabilitation plan (\u201cVRP\u201d) and compensation payment while he participated. On September 6, 2001, Airborne approved the motion to this extent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c1. The employer authorizes a vocational rehabilitation plan for the claimant to be administered by the State of Ohio RSC (Rehabilitation Services Commission), per the claimant\u2019s request. The case has been referred to the RSC and a vocational plan is being created.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">{\u00b6 5} <em>\u201c2. </em>The employer agrees to pay the claimant Nonworking Wage Loss benefits while he is participating in the Vocational Rehabilitation Plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">{\u00b6 6} Three weeks later, vocational-evaluation specialist William Braunig issued his recommendations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c1. Consider direct placement services. Mr. Dixon would appear to have retained the physical capacities to perform his past work as a manager and mortgage loan collector (as customarily performed). Additionally, he may be capable of performing similar work in collections and bookkeeping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">{\u00b6 8} <em>\u201c2. </em>If direct placement is unsuccessful, consider formal skills training in the business field at the Associate Degree level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c3. Consider assistive technology as needed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">{\u00b6 10} Dixon\u2019s August 2001 motion was heard on April 29, 2002. An Industrial Commission district hearing officer held that Dixon\u2019s motion for authorization of a rehabilitation plan was mooted by Airborne\u2019s prior approval. The district hearing officer ordered the employer to pay living-maintenance compensation \u201conce the claimant enters the approved vocational rehabilitation plan.\u201d The June 21, 2002 order of a staff hearing officer did not change the substance of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">{\u00b6 11} In September 2002 \u2014 without any consultation with Airborne \u2014 Dixon began a four-year degree program at Wright State University. His request for Kving-maintenance benefits under R.C. 4121.63 was denied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-14\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cOn 09/06/2002, the injured worker started a program at Wright State University. The Hearing Officer finds that the program that the injured worker has enrolled in at Wright State University is not a certified vocational rehabilitation plan. There was no documentation that the four years of college at Wright State University were approved as a rehabilitation plan by the self-insured employer. The self-insured employer has stated that they will pay Living Maintenance once a certified vocational rehabilitation plan is in place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201cAt this time, as the injured worker is not in a certified vocational rehabilitation plan, Living Maintenance benefits from 09/06/2002 to 01/13/2003 are denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThis order is based on the lack of documentation showing that the injured worker is enrolled in a certified rehabilitation plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">{\u00b6 15} After exhausting administrative appeals, Dixon petitioned the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for a writ of mandamus, claiming that his entitlement to living-maintenance benefits was res judicata pursuant to the April 29, 2002 and June 21, 2002 orders. The court of appeals disagreed and denied the writ, prompting this appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">{\u00b6 16} Dixon repeats his res judicata argument, asserting that his right to living-maintenance compensation was conclusively decided by the April 29 and June 21, 2002 orders. Because Dixon cannot demonstrate the identity of issues necessary to sustain res judicata, his position fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">{\u00b6 17} Res judicata demands an identity of issues in the proceedings under examination. <em>State ex rel. B.O.C. Group, Gen. Motors Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 199, 569 N.E.2d 496. The April 29, 2002 and June 21, 2002 orders that Dixon relies on stated only that living maintenance was payable subject to Dixon\u2019s participation in an <em>approved </em>VRP. They did not \u2014 as Dixon believes \u2014 declare that <em>any </em>VRP submitted was inherently an approved one, nor will we infer such a meaning. The vocational assessment done shortly after permission to create a VRP was granted recommended direct job placement without further training or, at most, Dixon\u2019s enrollment in an associate\u2019s degree program. Dixon\u2019s enrollment in a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree program is not consistent with that recommendation. The commission did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in concluding that the appropriateness of this program had not been adjudicated by previous commission orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">{\u00b6 18} The commission also did not abuse its discretion in withholding approval of the Wright State University vocational plan, because Dixon had submitted no evidence that it was necessary, despite the earlier vocational-assessment report. The materials subsequently submitted regarding the college program are simply standard forms that, again, do not explain why this particular program was key to successful reintegration into the labor market.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">{\u00b6 19} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b290-12\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Aci\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Weisser &amp; Wolf and Lisa M.
