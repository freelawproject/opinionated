Respondent filed an answer to the complaint, and a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline held a hearing on the complaint in May 2005. With one member dissenting, the panel then prepared written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation, all of which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b477-17\">{\u00b6 3} According to the testimony of Deanna Entinghe, she met respondent in 1999 when she sought his legal advice about a personal-injury matter. She was satisfied with his advice and did not meet with him again about that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-18\">{\u00b6 4} In 2003, Entinghe made another appointment with respondent to discuss a domestic-relations matter. She went to respondent\u2019s law office in Lima at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>appointed time on the morning of July 2, 2003, but discovered when she arrived that the lights were out in the office due to an electrical problem. Respondent, his secretary, and Entinghe bantered for a few minutes about the power outage, and then he asked the secretary to run an errand.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent and Entinghe agreed to discuss her legal problem in the law firm\u2019s reception area, which was well lit by natural light, rather than meeting in respondent\u2019s office, which respondent said was dark. The two of them sat on a couch in the reception area, and Entinghe began to explain that she was seeking a divorce. She described her husband\u2019s drinking problem, and she told respondent that her own health problems had prompted her husband to abuse alcohol. Respondent asked questions about those health problems, and Entinghe explained to him that she had undergone seven or eight experimental operations in which pain pacemakers had been inserted in her body to alleviate back pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 6} During their conversation, Entinghe used her hands to point to various scars on her back from surgical incisions. Then, according to Entinghe, respondent touched the portion of her shirt that was covering her pacemakers. She was shocked and started backing away because she noticed a strange look on respondent\u2019s face that made her uncomfortable. Respondent then put his hands on her breasts for a few seconds and said, \u201cYou have very nice breasts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 7} Entinghe stepped back, feeling sick and disgusted. She headed for the door and recalls that respondent said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you next Tuesday\u201d as she was leaving. Entinghe ran out the door, entered her car, and drove away at high speed. Once home, she telephoned her mother and told her what had just happened. She also told her sister. The following day, she hired another attorney to represent her in her legal separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">{\u00b6 8} In September 2003, Entinghe told both her attorney and her husband about the incident that had occurred in respondent\u2019s office two months earlier. Her attorney and her husband\u2019s attorney urged her to file a grievance against respondent, and she did so in November 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">{\u00b6 9} After the grievance was filed, relator sent a letter of inquiry to respondent, and he provided his reply in a letter dated January 6, 2004. In that letter, respondent stated, \u201cAlthough I barely remember the incident with Mrs. Entinghe, my secretary and I recall that she came in for a short appointment, free consultation, to my office some months ago. She appeared to be very agitated and upset and upon attempting to calm her down, she advised me that she was disabled because of some sort of medical implants which to my shock and surprise she displayed to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">{\u00b6 10} Attorney Geoffrey Stern then sent a letter dated January 9, 2004, to relator on respondent\u2019s behalf. In that letter, attorney Stern stated that Entinghe had displayed her medical implants to respondent. According to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>letter, respondent \u201cdid not ask her to make such a display, nor did he touch her in any manner, including but not limited to her false allegations that he put both hands \u2018on [her] pacemaker in [her] tummy\u2019 and \u2018took ahold of both [her] breasts.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">{\u00b6 11} On June 7, 2004, Stern sent relator a letter prepared by Michael D. Schafer, a clinical psychologist, who began treating respondent after he was hospitalized in February 2004 for acute intoxication and seizures. According to Schafer\u2019s letter, respondent had described to him a long history of alcohol use, including what Schafer cited as the \u201cclassic symptoms of alcohol addiction.\u201d Schafer also stated that respondent had reported experiencing periods of memory impairment known as \u201cblackouts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 12} In a follow-up letter dated July 27, 2004, Dr. Schafer stated that he was providing outpatient therapy to respondent for an alcohol problem, and he explained that respondent had told him that the alleged incident involving Entinghe had occurred at a time when respondent was \u201cactively drinking, including drinking at work, during working hours.\u201d The letter added that respondent recalled drinking on the day of the incident, but had only a \u201csketchy\u201d memory of his meeting with Entinghe. Schafer confirmed this account at his deposition in May 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent disputed this account, however, when he testified at his disciplinary hearing in May 2005. He told the panel that Dr. Schafer must have misinterpreted his remarks during therapy or made up the information in his report, because alcohol played no part in the incident with Entinghe. According to respondent, he never told Dr. Schafer that he had been actively drinking or drinking at work at the time of the incident, or that he had been drinking that day. Respondent also told the panel that he could accurately recall the events of July 2, 2003, and he said that his memory of that day had improved over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">{\u00b6 14} Respondent acknowledged at his disciplinary hearing in May 2005 that he had said, \u2018You have nice breasts\u201d to Entinghe in his office on July 2, 2003. He characterized the remark as one designed to make her feel good. Respondent denied touching Entinghe\u2019s breasts, although he qualified that remark by saying that he could not remember whether he had \u201cbrushed\u201d her breast, adding that he doubted he had \u201ctouched\u201d her breast. He also testified that Entinghe had unbuttoned her blouse, grabbed his hand, and placed it on the lower part of her rib cage.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">{\u00b6 15} This version of events was much more detailed than the explanation in respondent\u2019s January 6, 2004, letter to relator, in which he had written that he could \u201cbarely remember the incident.\u201d And attorney Stern\u2019s letter dated January 9, 2004, on respondent\u2019s behalf had advised relator that respondent had not touched Entinghe \u201cin any manner.\u201d Moreover, when respondent met with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>representatives from relator\u2019s office in May 2004, he never told them that Entinghe had grabbed his hand and had placed it on her pacemakers or her rib cage. His explanation: He did not remember that fact in May 2004, but did remember it at his May 2005 disciplinary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 16} The board found that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(6) (barring conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 17} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the board considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). As aggravating factors, the board found that respondent had displayed a selfish motive by seeking personal gratification during his meeting with Entinghe, had submitted false statements and engaged in deceptive practices during the disciplinary process, and had caused harm to a vulnerable victim. BCGD Proe.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (f), and (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">{\u00b6 18} The board also cited two mitigating factors: the absence of a prior disciplinary record and respondent\u2019s strong character evidence. BCGD Proc. Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (e). Letters submitted to the board on respondent\u2019s behalf described him as a professional of \u201chigh integrity and character\u201d and as someone whose conduct has always been \u201cappropriate in all circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">{\u00b6 19} The panel did not view respondent\u2019s alcohol problem as a mitigating factor, concluding that he had inappropriately tried to use that problem as an excuse for his behavior. According to the panel majority, respondent\u2019s testimony showed that he is not committed to the Alcoholics Anonymous treatment program and participates in it only casually. There is no evidence in the record establishing that respondent has successfully completed an approved alcohol-treatment program, and he in fact left an inpatient treatment program before the program was finished. The record also contains no prognosis from a qualified health-care professional or counselor about the likelihood of respondent\u2019s ability to maintain a competent and professional legal practice. Absent those two elements, the requirements for mitigation under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g) have not been met in this case. In any event, respondent himself testified at his disciplinary hearing that alcohol played no part in the incident with Entinghe (although he had suggested otherwise during the early stages of relator\u2019s investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">{\u00b6 20} Relator recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months, and the panel majority and the full board adopted that recommendation. The dissenting panel member found that the allegations against respondent had not been proven by the requisite clear and convincing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>evidence. The case is now before us on respondent\u2019s objections to the board\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">{\u00b6 21} We have reviewed the board\u2019s report and have also considered the written and oral arguments presented by the parties in response to that report. We accept the board\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusion, although we disagree with the board\u2019s recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b622} Respondent disputes Entinghe\u2019s version of the facts, but the panel members \u2014 who were in the best position to evaluate the differing stories told by respondent and Entinghe \u2014 found his testimony to be \u201cfar less credible\u201d than hers. After hearing and seeing two days of testimony, two of the three panel members found clear and convincing evidence supporting relator\u2019s allegation that respondent had inappropriately touched Entinghe\u2019s breasts, that he had made an inappropriate comment to her, and that he had misrepresented his memory about the incident while citing alcohol use as an excuse for his behavior during relator\u2019s investigation. The evidence in the record supports the panel\u2019s and the board\u2019s findings on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 23} The legal conclusion that this misconduct violated DR 1-102(A)(6) is sound. The physical contact, coupled with the inappropriate remark about Entinghe\u2019s breasts, was unethical and unprofessional. Respondent\u2019s words and actions reflected poorly on the legal profession and represented a betrayal of the trust of a vulnerable client. The panel noted that Entinghe remained under the influence of the emotional trauma nearly two years after the incident had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">{\u00b6 24} A stayed one-year suspension coupled with a two-year probationary period is the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Moore, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 261, 2004-Ohio-734, 804 N.E.2d 423 (imposing a stayed one-year suspension and two years\u2019 probation on an attorney who had made unsolicited and inappropriate sexual comments to a client and had engaged in consensual sexual relations with another client).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">{\u00b6 25} Respondent cited alcohol abuse as a factor in his inability to respond fully to the grievance initially, and perhaps as a factor in the misconduct itself. Yet the panel that observed his testimony discounted alcohol abuse as a cause of the incident and faulted respondent for initially relying on that abuse as an excuse for his actions and for his inability to provide a full and accurate accounting of the incident. We take seriously the panel\u2019s concerns about respondent\u2019s truthfulness surrounding his alcohol use and about the incident itself, but those concerns must be balanced against the multiple letters and testimony in the record attesting to respondent\u2019s truthfulness and good character. We conclude that a stayed suspension and a two-year probationary period will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>protect the public by providing an appropriate avenue for respondent to secure the alcohol-related counseling that he appears to need.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZF\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph M. Caligiuri, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aaq\">Carlile Patchen <em>&amp; </em>Murphy, L.L.P., and H. Ritchey Hollenbaugh; George B. Quatman III, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for one year, with the entire suspension stayed provided that respondent commit no further misconduct during the suspension period. In addition, respondent is placed on probation for a period of two years in accordance with Gov.Bar R. V(9). While on probation, respondent must (1) continue to undergo alcohol-related counseling in a program approved by the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program at respondent\u2019s own expense and (2) attend at least four hours of training annually, at a course or courses approved by relator, on the prevention of sexual harassment. If respondent fails to comply with either of these conditions, the stay will be lifted, and respondent will serve the entire one-year suspension. Relator must appoint one or more monitoring attorneys to track respondent\u2019s compliance with these terms of probation. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b482-7\">Resnick, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b482-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b482-9\">Pfeifer, J., dissents and would suspend respondent from the practice of law for six months.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b482-10\">Moyer, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
