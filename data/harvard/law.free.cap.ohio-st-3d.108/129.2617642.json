Pursuant to Section 15A, Chapter III of the Toledo Charter, an election to fill the vacancy is scheduled for November 8, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">{\u00b6 3} On September 13, relator, Lisa Canales-Flores, submitted a nominating petition to respondent Lucas County Board of Elections to have her name placed on the November 8 ballot as a candidate to fill the council vacancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">{\u00b6 4} On September 19, the board of elections reviewed Canales-Flores\u2019s petition and determined that it contained sufficient valid signatures. The petition papers, however, did not contain properly completed circulator affidavits, as required by Section 14, Chapter III of the Toledo Charter. Although CanalesFlores had circulated all of the petition papers, the notary public that she had used had erroneously completed the circulator statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">{\u00b6 5} At the September 19 board meeting, Canales-Flores submitted an affidavit attesting that all of the signatures appended to the petition papers were made in her presence and that the signatures were the genuine signatures of the persons they purported to be. The board voted to certify Canales-Flores\u2019s nominating petition and place her name on the November 8 ballot for the council seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">{\u00b6 6} On September 21, an elector within District Six filed a protest contesting Canales-Flores\u2019s candidacy. On September 27, the board of elections held a hearing on the protest. Based upon advice from its attorney and the office of the Secretary of State of Ohio, the board voted to decertify Canales-Flores\u2019s candidacy-</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">{\u00b6 7} On September 29, Canales-Flores presented to the elections board a new nominating petition to become a candidate for the vacant council seat. The board refused to accept the new petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">{\u00b6 8} On September 30, Canales-Flores brought this expedited election action for a writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections to place her name on the November 8 election ballot as a candidate for the office of Member of the Toledo City Council, District Six. Canales-Flores also named the board members and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>director as additional respondents. Respondents answered the complaint, and the parties filed evidence and briefs pursuant to the accelerated schedule in S.Ct.Prac.R. X(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">{\u00b6 9} This cause is now before us for a consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">{\u00b6 10} Canales-Flores requests a writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections to place her name on the November 8, 2005 election ballot for the office of Member of Toledo City Council, District Six. In order to be entitled to the requested writ, Canales-Flores must establish a clear legal right to have her name placed on the November 8 election ballot, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of the board of elections to place her name on the ballot, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. State ex <em>rel. Choices for South-Western City Schools v. Anthony, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-5362, 840 N.E.2d 582, \u00b629. Given the proximity of the November 8 election, CanalesFlores has established that she lacks an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Id. at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">{\u00b6 11} For the remaining requirements, \u201c \u2018[i]n extraordinary actions challenging the decision of a board of elections, the applicable standard is whether the board engaged in fraud, corruption, abuse of discretion, or clear disregard of statutes or pertinent law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Stevens v. Geauga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 223, 226, 736 N.E.2d 882, quoting <em>State ex rel. Valore v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 144, 145, 718 N.E.2d 415. Canales-Flores does not allege fraud or corruption, so the dispositive issue is whether respondents abused their discretion or clearly disregarded applicable law by ruling her initial petition invalid and refusing to accept her second petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">First Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">{\u00b6 12} As Canales-Flores concedes, the nominating petition that she submitted to the board of elections on September 13 was invalid because it did not contain a proper circulator affidavit for each of the petition papers. See Section 14, Chapter III of the Toledo Charter (\u201cSignatures to nominating petitions need not be appended to one paper, but to each separate paper there shall be attached an affidavit of the circulator thereof, stating that each signature thereto was made in his or her presence and is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">{\u00b6 13} Canales-Flores contends, however, that when she submitted her affidavit at the September 19 board meeting, this submission cured any defect in the petition. In her affidavit, Canales-Flores specified that she had circulated the petition papers and that all of the petition signatures were made in her presence and were genuine signatures of the persons they purport to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Canales-Flores claims that based on <em>State ex rel Miles v. McSweeney, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 352, 2002-Ohio-4455, 775 N.E.2d 468, her correction of the petition was permissible. In <em>Miles, </em>we granted a writ of mandamus to compel a city clerk to submit a referendum petition to the city council at its next regular meeting. We held that the petitioner did not violate R.C. 3501.38(1), which prohibits \u201calterations, corrections, or additions\u201d to a petition after it is filed, by withdrawing a defective petition, attaching required circulator affidavits, and refiling the amended petition. Id. at \u00b6 24, 775 N.E.2d 468. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Rose v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 229, 736 N.E.2d 886, syllabus (\u201cNeither R.C. 3501.38(1) nor (K) prohibits the withdrawal of previously filed petitions and the submission of either new petitions or the resubmission of combined but unaltered petitions before the filing deadline\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">{\u00b6 15} For the following reasons, Canales-Flores\u2019s reliance on <em>Miles </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">{\u00b6 16} First, after <em>Rose </em>and <em>Miles, </em>the General Assembly enacted Am.Sub.H.B. No. 455, 149 Ohio Laws, Part V, 9083, 9090, which precluded the withdrawal of petitions such as those that had been permitted in those cases. See R.C. 3501.38(I)(2) (\u201cNo petition may be withdrawn after it is filed in a public office\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">{\u00b6 17} Second, Canales-Flores never withdrew her petition. Instead, she attempted to file an affidavit that would be appended to the petition. Even if R.C. 3501.38(I)(2) did not exist or was inapplicable to her petition, Canales-Flores would not have been entitled to the application of the <em>Miles </em>and <em>Rose </em>holdings. See <em>State ex rel. Commt. for the Charter Amendment Petition </em>\u2014 The <em>Millikin </em>Woods <em>Preservation Assn. v. Hamilton </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 508, 510, 757 N.E.2d 294 (\u201cthe committee did not withdraw its initial petition and attempt to resubmit it with additional part-petitions as one instrument here. Therefore, <em>Rose </em>is inapposite and R.C. 3501.38(1) and (K) prohibited the committee from filing additions to the first petition and submitting different parts of the petition at different times\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">{\u00b6 18} Third, Canales-Flores\u2019s submission of a new affidavit violated R.C. 3501.38(K) (\u201cAll separate petition papers shall be filed at the same time, as one instrument\u201d) and Section 14, Chapter III of the Toledo Charter (\u201cto each separate paper there shall be attached an affidavit of the circulator\u201d and \u201c[a]ll separate papers comprising a nominating petition shall be assembled and filed with the election authorities as one instrument * * * \u201d). The affidavit was not filed \u201cat the same time, as one instrument\u201d with the petition filed on September 13, and the affidavit was not attached to each separate petition paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">{\u00b6 19} Therefore, the board of elections neither abused its discretion nor clearly disregarded applicable law by ruling Canales-Flores\u2019s initial petition invalid and voting to decertify her name from the November 8 election ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Second Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">{\u00b6 20} Canales-Flores next asserts that the board of elections abused its discretion and clearly disregarded applicable law by refusing to accept her timely submission of a new nominating petition on September 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">{\u00b6 21} The board\u2019s refusal was based on R.C. 3513.261 and 3513.05. R.C. 3513.261 prohibits a board of elections from accepting a nominating petition of a person seeking to be a candidate for a municipal office if that person has already filed a nominating petition to be a candidate for a municipal office at the same election:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe secretary of state or a <em>board of elections shall not accept for filing a nominating petition of a person seeking to become a candidate if that person, for the same election, has already filed </em>a declaration of candidacy, a declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate, or <em>a nominating petition, </em>or has become a candidate through party nomination at a primary election or by the filling of a vacancy under section 3513.30 or 3513.31 of the Revised Code for any state or county office, if the nominating petition is for a state or county office, or <em>for any municipal </em>or township <em>office, </em>for member of a city, local, or exempted village board of education, or for member of a governing board of an educational service center, <em>if the nominating petition is for a municipal </em>or township <em>office, </em>or for member of a city, local, or exempted village board of education, or for member of a governing board of an educatipnal service center.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. 3513.05 contains a comparable provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">{\u00b6 24} <em>\u201cThe </em>secretary of state or a <em>board of elections shall not accept for filing a declaration of candidacy and petition of a person seeking to become a candidate if that person, for the same election, has already filed a declaration of candidacy </em>or a declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate, or has become a candidate by the filling of a vacancy under section 3513.30 of the Revised Code for any state or county office, if the declaration of candidacy is for a state or county office, or <em>for any municipal </em>or township <em>office, if the declaration of candidacy is for a municipal </em>or township <em>office.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">{\u00b6 25} In construing statutes, \u201cour paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21. \u201cTo discern this intent, we first consider the statutory language, reading words and phrases in context and construing them in accordance with rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>Choices for South-Western City Schools, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-5362, 840 N.E.2d 582, at \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">{\u00b6 26} The plain language of R.C. 3513.261 and 3513.05 prevented the board of elections from accepting Canales-Flores\u2019s second nominating petition for filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>because she had already filed a nominating petition for a municipal office\u2014 Member of Toledo City Council, District Six \u2014 -for the same election. The phrase <em>\u201cany </em>municipal * * * office\u201d is worded broadly enough to encompass a previous nominating petition for the <em>same </em>municipal office. (Emphasis added.) See <em>Weiss v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 15, 17, 734 N.E.2d 775, quoting State <em>ex rel. Purdy v. Clermont Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 338, 340, 673 N.E.2d 1351 (\u201cIn <em>Purdy, </em>we adopted the meaning of the word \u2018any\u2019 as set forth in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1971) 97: \u2018 \u201cAny\u201d means \u201cone or some indiscriminately of whatever kind\u201d \u2019 \u201d). Similarly, Canales-Flores had previously \u201cfiled\u201d a nominating petition. See Garner, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 660, defining \u201cfile\u201d to mean \u201c[t]o deliver a legal document to the court clerk or record custodian for placement into the official record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">{\u00b6 27} Canales-Flores nevertheless contends that based on a rule of liberal construction, we must conclude that the statutes do not bar her second petition. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Altiere v. Trumbull Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 164, 165, 602 N.E.2d 613, quoting <em>State ex rel. Schenck v. Shattuck </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 272, 274, 1 OBR 382, 439 N.E.2d 891 (\u201c \u2018Words limiting the right of a person to hold office are to be given a liberal construction in favor of those seeking to hold office, in order that the public may have the benefit of choice from all those who are in fact and in law qualified\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">{\u00b6 28} Because R.C. 3513.261 and 3513.05 are unambiguous, however, we must apply them rather than construe them. See <em>BedRoc Ltd., L.L.C. v. United States </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 176, 183, 124 S.Ct. 1587, 158 L.Ed.2d 338 (\u201cour inquiry begins with the statutory text, and ends there as well if the text is unambiguous\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Wolfe v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 182, 186, 724 N.E.2d 771 (no need to liberally construe a statute whose meaning is unequivocal and definite). Therefore, no resort to liberal construction or an examination of the legislative history is warranted. See, e.g., <em>L.J. Minor Corp. v. Breitenbach </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 168, 171, 672 N.E.2d 636, quoting <em>Storer Communications, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 193, 194, 525 N.E.2d 466 (\u201c \u2018An unambiguous statute is to be applied, not interpreted\u2019 \u201d); R.C. 1.49.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">{\u00b6 29} Canales-Flores nevertheless relies on language in R.C. 3513.052(G), which specifies that nothing in that statute, R.C. 3513.261, or R.C. 3513.05 prohibits a person from being a candidate for an office if that person timely withdraws as a candidate for any of the offices specified in R.C. 3513.052(A) for which that person first sought to become a candidate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cNothing in this section or section 3513.04, 3513.041, 3513.05, 3513.251, 3513.253, 3513.254, 3513.255, 3513.257, 3513.259, or 3513.261 of the Revised Code prohibits, and the secretary of state or a board of elections shall not disqualify, a person from being a candidate for an office, if that person timely withdraws as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>candidate for any offices specified in division (A) of this section for which that person first sought to become a candidate by filing a declaration of candidacy and petition, a declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate, or a nominating petition, by party nomination in a primary election, or by the filling of a vacancy under section 3513.30 or 3513.31 of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">{\u00b6 31} Under R.C. 3513.052(H)(2), \u201c \u2018Timely withdraws\u2019 means either of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(a) Withdrawing as a candidate before the applicable deadline for filing a declaration of candidacy, declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate, or nominating petition for the subsequent office for which the person is seeking to become a candidate at the same election;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(b) Withdrawing as a candidate before the applicable deadline for the filling of a vacancy under section 3513.30 or 3513.31 of the Revised Code, if the person is seeking to become a candidate for a subsequent office at the same election under either of those sections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 3513.052, however, does not support Canales-Flores\u2019s claim. The statute is expressly directed to forbidding persons to seek <em>multiple offices </em>at the same election. See R.C. 3513.052(A). R.C. 3513.052(G) provides a method for a person to avoid violating the multiple-office-candidacies prohibition of R.C. 3513.052(A) through the mechanism of a timely withdrawal of an initial candidacy for an office at the same election. Neither R.C. 3513.261 nor 3513.05, which by their plain language apply to more situations than does R.C. 3513.052, is limited to this circumstance. If the General Assembly had intended to restrict these statutes to persons seeking more than one office at the same election, it would have done so with appropriate language, as it did in R.C. 3513.052. Cf., e.g., <em>Choices for South-Western City Schools, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-5362, 840 N.E.2d 582, at \u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">{\u00b6 35} In addition, R.C. 3513.052(G) requires a timely withdrawal of a candidacy before a person can avoid being disqualified as a candidate for another office at the same election. Canales-Flores never timely withdrew as a candidate, and R.C. 3513.052(H)(2) does not equate the invalidation of a nominating petition with the timely withdrawal of a candidacy. We will not infer what the General Assembly did not provide. Adopting Canales-Flores\u2019s construction of the pertinent statutes would result \u201c \u2018not [in] a construction of [the] statute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court, so that what was omitted * * * may be included within its scope.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lamie v. United States Trustee </em>(2004), 540 U.S. 526, 538, 124 S.Ct. 1023, 157 L.Ed.2d 1024, quoting <em>Iselin v. United States </em>(1926), 270 U.S. 245, 251, 46 S.Ct. 248, 70 L.Ed. 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>{\u00b6 36} In sum, R.C. 3513.052 does not prevent the application of R.C. 3513.261 and 3513.05 to bar a second nominating petition for the same office at the same election after the first nominating petition has been ruled invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">{\u00b6 37} In effect, Canales-Flores asks this court to add the word \u201cvalid\u201d before \u201cnominating petition\u201d so that R.C. 3513.261 would read, \u201cThe * * * board of elections shall not accept for filing a nominating petition of a person seeking to become a candidate if that person, for the same election, has already filed * * * a <em>valid </em>nominating petition * * * for any municipal * * * office * * *, if the nominating petition is for a municipal * * * office.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This we cannot do. See <em>State ex rel. Lee v. Karnes, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 559, 2004-Ohio-5718, 817 N.E.2d 76, \u00b6 25, quoting <em>State v. Hughes </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 424, 427, 715 N.E.2d 540 (\u201c \u2018In construing a statute, we may not add or delete words\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">{\u00b6 38} Canales-Flores further asserts that these statutes, as construed to prevent her second petition, are unconstitutional if construed to prevent her candidacy. Canales-Flores has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the statutes are unconstitutional. <em>State ex rel. Watson v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 239, 242, 725 N.E.2d 255. R.C. 3513.261 and 3513.05 do not prevent individuals from securing a position on the election ballot, and they present only a minimal requirement on prospective candidates to file a valid nominating petition the first time that they submit it. Cf. <em>Purdy, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 343-344, 673 N.E.2d 1351. The statutes thus require only that petitioners \u201cget it right the first time.\u201d This requirement can hardly be termed a burden. In fact, only seven out of 186 prospective candidates who submitted nominating petitions with the board of elections for the November 8, 2005 election failed \u2014 like Canales-Flores \u2014 to include a valid circulator\u2019s affidavit with their petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">{\u00b6 39} The amended statutory requirements prohibiting withdrawal of a petition after it has been filed and barring a successive nominating petition can be justified by the state\u2019s interests in having orderly elections and avoiding confusion that multiple nominating petitions could cause boards of elections. If CanalesFlores\u2019s construction of these statutes is adopted, a prospective candidate could conceivably file multiple defective petitions tying up an elections board\u2019s scarce resources, but still be permitted to be placed on the ballot as long as one valid petition is filed in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">{\u00b6 40} Canales-Flores\u2019s suggestion that the General Assembly lacked any rationale to depart from the court\u2019s rulings in <em>Rose </em>and <em>Miles </em>is also misplaced. As then Justice Deborah Cook noted in her dissenting opinion in <em>Rose, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 236, 736 N.E.2d 886 (Cook, J., dissenting), permitting a withdrawal of a petition after it has been filed might be considered to \u201cdiminish[ ] the finality that the statutory scheme attaches to <em>filed </em>petitions,\u201d and \u201c[t]his diminished legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>significance seems irreconcilable with provisions of R.C. 3501.38 that emphasize the act of filing as the point at which the rights of petition circulators and signers change.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Although the majority of this court in <em>Rose </em>and <em>Miles </em>held otherwise based upon the language of the statutes in effect at that time, we did not suggest that the General Assembly could not reasonably disagree and determine that a balancing of the various interests favored amending these provisions to prohibit a prospective candidate from withdrawing a petition after it had been filed with a board of elections. See <em>Johnson v. Microsoft Corp., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 278, 2005-Ohio-4985, 834 N.E.2d 791, \u00b6 14 (\u201cThe Ohio General Assembly, and not this court, is the proper body to resolve public policy issues\u201d); <em>State v. Smorgala </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 222, 223, 553 N.E.2d 672 (\u201cthe General Assembly should be the final arbiter of public policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">{\u00b6 41} Canales-Flores finally asserts that the Toledo Charter supersedes the statutes. But the charter specifically incorporates nonconflicting Revised Code provisions like R.C. 3513.261 and 3513.05. Toledo Charter, Section 11, Chapter III (\u201cthe provisions of the general laws of the State shall apply to all such elections except as provision is otherwise made by this Charter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">{\u00b6 42} Therefore, the board of elections neither abused its discretion nor clearly disregarded applicable law by applying R.C. 3513.261 and 3513.05 and refusing to accept Canales-Flores\u2019s second petition for filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">{\u00b6 43} Based on the foregoing, the board of elections acted properly when it ruled Canales-Flores\u2019s first petition invalid and refused to accept her second petition for filing. Therefore, Canales-Flores has not established her entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief. Accordingly, we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b225-11\">Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b225-12\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AbR\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">{\u00b6 44} To deny Lisa Canales-Flores a place on the ballot, assuming that her second nominating petition is complete, is to do worse than elevate form over substance: it is to elevate bureaucracy over democracy. This court is instituting a \u201cget it right the first time or perish\u201d rule that the General Assembly, in my view, did not contemplate.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">{\u00b6 45} This court\u2019s duty is to liberally construe limitations on the right to be an eligible candidate in order to permit electors to choose from all qualified candidates. R.C. 3513.261 touches the gamut of would-be political candidates, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>from Governor to township trustee. While a gubernatorial candidate may have staff and lawyers to monitor his or her nominating petitions for perfection, a normal citizen, someone not of the political class, does not have that same backup. The rule enunciated today may cause people running for Governor or Secretary of State or Supreme Court a sleepless night or two; it might also needlessly knock off the ballot willing people who seek only to serve their communities. The voters, not just the failed would-be candidates, will suffer in those instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">{\u00b6 46} In construing statutes, \u201cour paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21. \u201cTo discern this intent, we first consider the statutory language, reading words and phrases in context and construing them in accordance with rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Choices for South-Western City Schools v. Anthony, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-5362, 840 N.E.2d 582, at \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">{\u00b6 47} The language of R.C. 3513.261 and 3513.05 is unclear about whether the General Assembly intended to preclude a prospective candidate from filing a successive nominating petition if the candidate\u2019s first petition had been ruled invalid. In fact, the preeminent focus of the language appears to prevent a person from becoming a candidate for multiple offices in the same election.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cIf a statute is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention of the legislature, may consider among other matters * * * [t]he legislative history.\u201d R.C. 1.49(C); see, also, <em>State ex rel. Zonders v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 5, 11, 630 N.E.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">{\u00b6 49} The General Assembly added the pertinent language of R.C. 3513.261 and 3513.05 as part of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 445, 149 Ohio Laws, Part V, 9083, which became effective on December 23, 2002. The title to Am.Sub.H.B. No. 445 specifies that two of the purposes of the act were \u201cto specify that no person may seek to be a candidate for two or more specified offices that will be voted on at the same election\u201d and \u201cto require a board of elections or the Secretary of State to reject any declaration of candidacy, declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate, or a nominating petition filed by a person who is a candidate for a specified office at the same election.\u201d Id., 149 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 9084.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">{\u00b6 50} Canales-Flores was not a candidate for any office at the November 8, 2005 election at the time she filed her second petition on September 29. Instead, because the board of elections had invalidated her first petition, she was not a candidate for any office on that date, much less the District Six City Council seat she seeks. Therefore, based on the manifest intent of the General Assembly in enacting the language in question, Canales-Flores was not barred by R.C. 3513.261 and 3513.05 from filing her second petition.</p>\n<judges id=\"b226-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Ax\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Vassar, Dills, Dawson &amp; Bonfiglio and Keith A.
