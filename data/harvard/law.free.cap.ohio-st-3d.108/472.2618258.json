On June 21, 1996, the guarantors executed guarantees and pledged their personal real estate as collateral for a promissory note executed by Tendasoft, Inc., that same day. Two days earlier, Community\u2019s predecessor in interest, Van Wert National Bank, had written a letter to three of the guarantors making certain representations regarding how it would proceed should a default occur:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cAs part of the consideration of renewing the equipment loan and extending the terms and conditions of said loan, Van Wert National Bank hereby acknowledges and agrees, that in the event of default on the note dated June 21, 1996, Van Wert National Bank will make reasonable effort to first liquidate the pledged equipment that was given to secure said loan. In the event there is still a deficiency remaining after the liquidation of said equipment, Van Wert National Bank would then pursue the liquidation of pledged real estate and personal guarantees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">{\u00b6 3} On June 2, 1998, Tendasoft renewed its promissory note, and the guarantors renewed their guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-15\">{\u00b6 4} On February 14, 2002, with Tendasoft allegedly in default on the promissory note, Community filed suit against the guarantors and others to recover the balance due on the note. On March 14, 2002, the guarantors moved to dismiss Community\u2019s complaint because the guarantees at issue had been conditioned on Community\u2019s making reasonable efforts to collect the debt owed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>it by Tendasoft by liquidating the pledged equipment before pursuing the personal guarantees. In an April 29, 2002 entry, the trial court agreed, finding that the guarantors had established, through the June 19, 1996 letter, which the court admitted as parol evidence, that Community was required to exercise a \u201creasonable effort\u201d to first liquidate Tendasoft\u2019s assets before pursuing the guarantors. Community then amended its complaint, adding Tendasoft as a defendant, on May 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 5} On June 24, 2002, Tendasoft filed a motion to stay with the trial court on the basis that it had filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on June 21, 2002, in the United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio, Bankruptcy Division. On June 26, 2002, the trial court ordered a stay on all matters in the case, based upon Tendasoft\u2019s bankruptcy filing. On July 24, 2002, Community moved the trial court for permission to pursue its claims against the guarantors only, arguing that it could use no further \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to pursue collection against Tendasoft once Tendasoft had filed for bankruptcy. On September 18, 2002, Community filed a proof of claim in Tendasoft\u2019s bankruptcy action, asserting a security interest in certain Tendasoft property. On October 1, 2002, the court found that filing to be in furtherance of the requirements to make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to pursue Tendasoft\u2019s assets but denied Community\u2019s motion to pursue the guarantors. The court found that the success or failure of Community\u2019s \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to liquidate the pledged equipment would be unknown until the bankruptcy court ruled on Community\u2019s proof of claim. The court therefore ordered the matter \u201cfurther stayed as to all parties pending the allowance or disallowance of the plaintiffs Proof [of] Claim and approval or disapproval by the bankruptcy court of the liquidation of the pledged equipment to pay the debt owed to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 6} Despite the trial court\u2019s stay, on March 10, 2003, Community filed a notice of appeal to the Third District Court of Appeals. Community alleged that the trial court had erred in (1) finding that the 1996 letter was valid parol evidence and that the letter required Community to pursue the assets of Tendasoft before pursuing the guarantors and (2) finding that Community had not made reasonable efforts to pursue Tendasoft\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 7} On August 20, 2003, the appellate court sua sponte determined that the appeal should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, finding that the trial court\u2019s issuance of a stay was not a final appealable order. The court held that pursuant to R.C. 2505.02, \u201cthe [trial] court\u2019s order staying the action, including the claims against non-bankrupt parties, pending determination of the bankruptcy of another party is not an order denying a provisional remedy and, thus, not a final order subject to appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>{\u00b6 8} The appellate court noted in its decision that it was not persuaded by the conclusion of the Sixth District Court of Appeals decision in <em>Sorg v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(Dec. 17, 1998), Erie App. No. E-98-057, 1998 WL 904945. <em>Sorg </em>held that staying a court action is an ancillary proceeding akin to granting a preliminary injunction under R.C. 2505.02(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 9} On September 2, 2003, Community filed a motion to certify a conflict with the Third District Court of Appeals based upon that court\u2019s disagreement with the Sixth District Court of Appeals decision in <em>Sorg. </em>The court granted the motion to certify a conflict, submitting the following question to this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIs a court\u2019s order staying an action, including the claims against nonbankrupt parties, pending determination of the bankruptcy of another party a final order subject to appeal under R.C. 2505.02[?]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Law and Analysis-</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 11} We answer the question of the court of appeals in the negative. A court\u2019s order staying an action, including the claims against nonbankrupt parties, pending determination of the bankruptcy of another party, is not a final order subject to appeal under R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 2505.02(B) states what actions by trial courts constitute final appealable orders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(B) An order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(2) An order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-13\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(3) An order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-14\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(4) An order that grants or denies a provisional remedy and to which both of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-15\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(a) The order in effect determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy and prevents a judgment in the action in favor of the appealing party with respect to the provisional remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-16\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(b) The appealing party would not be afforded a meaningful or effective remedy by an appeal following final judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties in the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">{\u00b6 20} The issue in this case is whether the trial court\u2019s stay implicates R.C. 2505.02(B)(4), which makes certain provisional remedies final appealable orders. The term \u201cprovisional remedy\u201d is defined in former R.C. 2505.02(A)(3), Am.Sub. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>H.B. No. 349, 147 Ohio laws, Part II, 3277, the version that was in effect in 2002, when the suit was filed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(3) \u2018Provisional remedy\u2019 means a proceeding ancillary to an action, including, but not limited to, a proceeding for a preliminary injunction, attachment, discovery of privileged matter, or suppression of evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 22} This court has opined on the appealability of stays pursuant to earlier versions of R.C. 2505.02. In <em>Stewart v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 124, 543 N.E.2d 1200, and <em>Bellaire City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Paxton </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 65, 13 O.O.3d 58, 391 N.E.2d 1021, this court held that a stay pending arbitration is not final and appealable. However, after those cases were decided, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 2711.02(C), which specifically makes an order \u201cthat grants or denies a stay of a trial of any action pending arbitration\u201d a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 23} Likewise, before the amendment of R.C. 2505.02, this court had held that the granting of a preliminary injunction is an action for injunctive relief and is not a final appealable order. <em>State ex rel. Tollis v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Appeals </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 145, 148, 532 N.E.2d 727. The current R.C. 2505.02(B)(4) changed the law in this regard and makes other provisional remedies reviewable as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 24} The key to our determination is whether a stay should be considered an ancillary proceeding pursuant to former R.C. 2505.02(A)(3), 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3277. \u201cAncillary\u201d is not defined in R.C. 2505.02, but this court has held that as used in former R.C. 2505.02(A)(3), \u201c \u2018[a]n ancillary proceeding is one that is attendant upon or aids another proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Muncie </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 440, 449, 746 N.E.2d 1092, quoting <em>Bishop v. Dresser Industries </em>(1999), 134 Ohio App.3d 321, 324, 730 N.E.2d 1079. Citing <em>Sorg, </em>the <em>Muncie </em>court quoted the Black\u2019s Law Dictionary definition of \u201cancillary\u201d as \u201c \u2018aiding; attendant upon; describing a proceeding attendant upon or which aids another proceeding considered as principal. Auxiliary or subordinate.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 449, 746 N.E.2d 1092, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.1979) 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Muncie, </em>this court found that a forced-medication order that had been issued by the trial court in an effort to restore a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial constituted a final appealable order. <em>Muncie </em>looked at other types of proceedings that this court had found to be ancillary to the main action. The court noted that in <em>Forest City Invest. Co. v. Haas </em>(1924), 110 Ohio St. 188, 192, 143 N.E. 549, the appointment of a receiver was deemed \u201c \u2018ancillary to the main action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Muncie, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 449, 746 N.E.2d 1092. This court wrote that the appointment of a receiver, for instance, \u201caids the principal proceeding \u2014 the underlying litigation \u2014 for the receiver conserves the interests of litigants with respect to property that is in the custody of the court during the course of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>principal litigation.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) Id., citing <em>Forest, </em>110 Ohio St. at 192-193, 143 N.E. 549. This court also noted in <em>Muncie, </em>quoting <em>Lincoln Tavern, Inc. v. Snader </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 61, 68, 59 O.O. 74, 133 N.E.2d 606, that \u201c \u2018an attachment is a provisional remedy; an ancillary proceeding which must be appended to a principal action and whose very validity must necessarily depend upon the validity of the commencement of the principal action.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 26} We agree that the appointment of a receiver, attachment, and a judgment ordering medication constitute ancillary proceedings. They are all separate procedures tied to a main action, acting in furtherance of the main action, but with their own lives. Though owing their existence to the underlying action, they are definable offshoots from the main action. A stay is not an offshoot of the main action; it is the main action postponed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 27} However, <em>Sorg </em>held that \u201ca proceeding to stay a court action as to non-bankrupt parties pending determination of the bankruptcy of a separate party is a \u2018proceeding ancillary to an action\u2019 pursuant to [former] R.C. 2505.02(A)(3). Such a proceeding is akin to a preliminary injunction (a specifically listed \u2018provisional remedy\u2019) in its effect.\u201d <em>Sorg, </em>Erie App. No. E-98-057.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b628} We disagree with Sorg\u2019s characterization of the kinship between a preliminary injunction and a stay. The most obvious difference between a stay and a preliminary injunction is that in seeking a preliminary injunction, the movant seeks an equitable remedy, albeit an impermanent one. Whereas a stay ceases activity on a case, a preliminary injunction proceeding is parallel, expedited, and separate from the main action. A preliminary injunction aids the main action by ensuring that a judgment in the main action will be meaningful. R.C. 2727.02 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA temporary order may be granted restraining an act when it appears by the petition that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded, and such relief, or any part of it, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of such act, the commission or continuance of which, during the litigation, would produce great or irreparable injury to the plaintiff, or when, during the litigation, it appears that the defendant is doing, threatens or is about to do, or is procuring or permitting to be done, such act in violation of the plaintiffs rights respecting the subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1y\">{\u00b6 30} Through a preliminary injunction, a party seeks to restrain certain acts of another party. Civ.R. 65(D). A preliminary-injunction proceeding is a separate matter from the trial on the merits, though \u201cthe court may order the trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing of the application.\u201d Civ.R. 65(B)(2). Since it provides a provisional remedy, no preliminary injunction is operative \u201cuntil the party obtaining it gives a bond executed by sufficient surety * * * to secure to the party enjoined the damages he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>sustain, if it is finally decided that the order of injunction should not have been granted.\u201d Civ.R. 65(C). A preliminary injunction proceeding is a proceeding requiring its own evidence, a proceeding with its own life. Civ.R. 65(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 31} A stay pending determination of the bankruptcy of another party is not a separate proceeding, but a halting of proceedings. It provides no party a remedy, not even a temporary one. It is of a different character from the appointment of a receiver, an attachment, a forced-medication order, or a preliminary injunction. It does not further the main action. We therefore hold that the imposition of a stay pending the determination of the bankruptcy of a party it is not an ancillary proceeding pursuant to former R.C. 2505.02(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 32} Accordingly, we hold that a court\u2019s order staying an action, including the claims against nonbankrupt parties, pending determination of the bankruptcy of another party, is not a final order subject to appeal under former R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">J\u00fadgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b565-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b565-9\">Lundberg Stratton and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b565-10\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Al4\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">{\u00b6 33} I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that a court\u2019s st\u00e1y of an action pending determination of bankruptcy is not a final appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(4). Here, the appellate court held that such an order did not deny a provisional remedy, and the majority agrees, stating that a stay cannot be considered an ancillary proceeding because it is not a proceeding \u201cwith its own life.\u201d To the contrary, the granting of such an order does provide a provisional remedy within the contemplation of R.C. 2505.02(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">{\u00b6 34} The General Assembly expressly defined \u201cprovisional remedy\u201d in R.C. 2505.02(A)(3) as <em>\u201ca proceeding ancillary </em>to an action, including, but <em>not limited to, </em>a proceeding for a preliminary injunction, attachment, discovery of privileged matter, suppression of evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In rejecting the characterization of a stay as similar in effect to a preliminary injunction and thus \u201cancillary,\u201d the majority distinguishes it by stating that a stay \u201cis not an offshoot of the main action\u201d but rather the \u201cmain action postponed\u201d or a mere \u201chalting of proceedings.\u201d A stay, however, need not be considered identical to a preliminary injunction to be considered a provisional remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">{\u00b6 35} We approved the definition of \u201cancillary\u201d used in <em>Sorg v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(Dec. 17, 1998), Erie App. No. E-98-057, 1998 WL 904945, as something \u201c \u2018 \u201cattendant upon or which aids another proceeding considered as principal.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Muncie </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 440, 449, 746 N.E.2d 1092, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>quoting <em>Sorg, </em>*3, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.1979) 78. We have also described a \u201cprovisional remedy\u201d as a \u201cremedy other than a claim for relief.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Butler Cty. Children Servs. Bd. v. Sage </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 23, 25, 764 N.E.2d 1027. Thus, we have held that final appealable orders include forced-medication orders, <em>Muncie, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 449, 746 N.E.2d 1092, and appointments of a receiver. <em>Forest City Invest. Co. v. Haas </em>(1924), 110 Ohio St. 188, 192, 143 N.E. 549. In my view, by filing a motion for stay based on Tendasoft\u2019s bankruptcy, the guarantors also sought a provisional remedy, one that would aid them in the underlying collection case. The trial court\u2019s decision to deny Community First Bank &amp; Trust the opportunity to pursue the nonbankrupt guarantors on their personal guarantees is ancillary to Community\u2019s underlying substantive claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 36} The majority also concludes that the nonbankrupt guarantors did not receive a \u201cremedy.\u201d To the contrary, they have received the benefit of Tendasoft\u2019s filing of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition as of June 26, 2002, when the trial court ordered all matters, including the claims against them as guarantors, stayed. Although denial of the stay would have allowed the action to progress and would have provided the guarantors full remedy on appeal after the continued litigation is completed, the granting of, or refusal to lift, the stay is different. When a stay is granted, the objecting party has no remedy until possibly years later. Litigation is stopped, and when an appeal finally occurs, a holding that the stay should not have been granted or should not have been continued months or years earlier will be, as <em>Sorg </em>noted, \u201ca hollow victory.\u201d <em>Sorg, </em>Erie App. No. E-98-057, 1998 WL 904945, *3. See, also, <em>Cleveland v. Zakaib </em>(Oct. 12, 2000), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 76928, 76929, and 76930, 2000 WL 1513736 (denial of motion for stay is not a final appealable order, as party challenging denial of a stay can obtain a meaningful and effective remedy in an appeal following a final judgment, unlike a party seeking to appeal the granting of a stay). Tendasoft\u2019s bankruptcy may take years to complete, and in the meantime, Community may be harmed by the delay and thus will not have a meaningful or effective remedy if forced to wait to proceed against the guarantors.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 37} R.C. 2505.02(B) states, \u201cAn order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">\u201c{\u00b6 38} * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(4) An order that grants or denies a provisional remedy and to which both of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(a) The order in effect determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy and prevents a judgment in the action in favor of the appealing party with respect to the provisional remedy.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AR4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Faulkner, Garmhausen, Keister &amp; Shenk, James R.

R.C. 2505.02(B)(4)(a). Furthermore, Community does not have a meaningful or effective remedy if it is prohibited from appealing the stay until after the conclusion of Tendasoft\u2019s bankruptcy. R.C. 2505.02(B)(4)(b). I respectfully dissent and would hold that a court\u2019s order staying an action, including the claims against nonbankrupt parties, pending determination of the bankruptcy of another party is a final appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(4). I would reverse the appellate court\u2019s decision and remand the cause to that court for consideration of the substantive assignments of error.</p>\n<judges id=\"b567-6\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
