Wise of Cleveland, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0037837, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1987. On December 22, 2003, relator, Cuyahoga County Bar Association, charged respondent in a two-count complaint with having violated the Code of Professional Responsibility. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause and made findings of misconduct and recommended a sanction, all of which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Findings of Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">{\u00b6 2} The allegations of misconduct arose from respondent\u2019s representation of a mother in a custody dispute over her minor child. The child had been cared for since birth by the father\u2019s sister with help from the father\u2019s parents, and the aunt had asked the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court to award her permanent custody. Respondent\u2019s client and her fiance, the child\u2019s father, also wanted custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">{\u00b6 3} The juvenile court judge gave temporary custody of the child to the aunt for the duration of the permanent-custody case. Later, at a hearing on January 29, 2003, the judge determined that the allegations in the complaint invoked a 90-day processing period that had already been exceeded in the case, a defect that the father raised in a <em>motion to </em>dismiss. The judge granted the father\u2019s motion to dismiss, a ruling that respondent believed operated to immediately return custody of the child to his client, the natural mother. At the conclusion of the proceeding, the judge stated from the bench that she was concerned for the child\u2019s well-being and safety and announced that she was going to immediately ask the Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services to investigate whether being in the custody of her parents would put the child at risk. A case worker began an investigation that afternoon. The next day, January 30, 2003, the agency took the child into protective custody and formally placed the child in the aunt\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">{\u00b6 4} After the January 29 hearing, the events underlying relator\u2019s complaint occurred. Almost immediately after the judge stated her intent to report the child\u2019s case to children services, respondent and the father\u2019s attorney advised their clients that they were free to take custody of the child. Respondent\u2019s client and the father left the courtroom and drove to two different daycare centers at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>which the child had been enrolled. They could not find the child, however, because the child was ill that day and in the care of another relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">{\u00b6 5} Either on the afternoon of January 29 or January 30, respondent learned that his client had been unable to find her child. The client was so distraught that she talked about pursuing kidnapping charges against the aunt. Respondent called the aunt\u2019s employer, the Cleveland Police Department. According to his testimony before the hearing panel, respondent called the police department to see if the aunt was working that day, surmising that she could not have run off with the child if she was on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent called the police department at around 3:30 p.m. on January 30. He spoke to a police sergeant, one of the aunt\u2019s supervisors, and told him that he was representing a client in a custody dispute with the aunt and that his client had been awarded custody but that the child could not be located. He asked the sergeant to call the aunt and ask her to turn over the child. He said that if she did not turn the child over, kidnapping charges might be filed. The sergeant advised respondent that the aunt had not reported for duty that day or the day before, absences that the sergeant understood to be for family medical leave. Respondent replied that the aunt had been in court on January 29, a disclosure that caused the sergeant to question the aunt\u2019s explanation for her absences. Respondent further told the sergeant that he knew \u201cBill Mason,\u201d referring to the Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and would personally go see him in order to get kidnapping charges filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">{\u00b6 7} After speaking with respondent, the sergeant was able to reach the aunt and discuss respondent\u2019s concerns. At respondent\u2019s request, the sergeant called him back and relayed that the aunt had the child. The sergeant also relayed the aunt\u2019s request that respondent communicate with her only through her lawyer. Respondent asked the sergeant whether he knew where the child was. When the sergeant said that he did not, respondent said that he understood that there was a code of silence among police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 8} At the panel hearing, respondent disputed the sergeant\u2019s recollection of their conversation. Respondent testified that he had mentioned the county prosecutor\u2019s name not as a threat, but as a word to the wise that Mason would \u201ceat his own\u201d if he found out that an officer had acted criminally. Respondent claimed that the sergeant had mistaken his remarks for an attempt to apply pressure, when he was merely trying to get information to prevent his client from filing criminal charges against the aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">{\u00b6 9} After calling the police department on January 30, respondent called Douglas Blackburn, the aunt\u2019s attorney. Blackburn testified that when he was told of the possible kidnapping charges, he had explained to respondent that custody remained with the aunt until the juvenile court journalized its entry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>which it had not yet done. Blackburn assured respondent of the child\u2019s whereabouts and promised that the aunt had no intention of running away with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">{\u00b6 10} According to Blackburn, despite being given these assurances, respondent referred during their conversation to his \u201cgood friend Bill Mason\u201d in connection with pressing kidnapping charges. Blackburn also recalled that respondent had threatened to report the hunt\u2019s \u201cmisconduct\u201d to another \u201cfriend,\u201d the city of Cleveland safety director.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 11} Respondent denied having made any threatening remarks to Blackburn and specifically denied having mentioned Mason or the safety director. He suggested that Blackburn was \u201cconfused\u201d about the substance of their conversation because Blackburn had consulted with Ross Paul, the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, and the police sergeant in the course of the disciplinary investigation. Respondent explained that he and Paul had been on unfriendly terms even before Blackburn and Paul filed grievances against him. Respondent believed that Paul still held a grudge, especially since respondent had criticized his performance as guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent acknowledged, however, that he had been \u201cstern\u201d with Blackburn during their telephone conversation. He recalled having- warned Blackburn about the consequences if Blackburn was lying to him in assuring him that his client had not absconded with the child. Respondent testified that he had said, \u201c[I]f I find out later on that that\u2019s not true, that you deceived me and [in] reliance upon your word I passed this information on to my client, I want you to understand something very clearly, you and I will have a serious problem man to man, not you and me and the courts, but you and I personally will have a serious problem on this issue. * * * [D]o you understand me?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">{\u00b6 13} When asked why he had told his client she could get her child immediately after dismissal of the custody complaint, even though the judge said she was going to call children services, respondent testified that he had been uncertain whether the judge would actually follow through. He said that he did not trust the judge\u2019s resolve because during the January 29 hearing, the judge \u201cwas highly agitated,\u201d \u201cwas asking [the parties] what she thought [they] ought to do,\u201d and was \u201cflipflopping back and forth.\u201d According to respondent, the judge also \u201ccouldn\u2019t articulate from the bench what law she was proceeding under,\u201d and she \u201cwent on for 20 minutes about just being overturned in the Court of appeals and how this wasn\u2019t going to happen to her again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">{\u00b6 14} The panel and board found that respondent had resorted to intimidation tactics and suggestions that he would improperly influence public officials and had thereby violated DR 9 \u2014 101(C) (\u201cA lawyer shall not state or imply that he is able to influence improperly or upon irrelevant grounds any tribunal, legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>body, or public official\u201d), 7-102(A)(l) (in representing a client, a lawyer shall not \u201c[f]ile a suit, assert a position, conduct a defense, delay a trial, or take other action on behalf of his client when he knows or when it is obvious that such action would serve merely to harass or maliciously injure another\u201d), and 7-105(A) (\u201cA lawyer shall not present, participate in presenting, or threaten to present criminal charges solely to obtain an advantage in a civil matter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Recommended Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 15} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the panel and board weighed specified mitigating and aggravating factors and other relevant considerations in respondent\u2019s case. See Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). Adopting the panel\u2019s report, the board found in mitigation that respondent had no prior record of professional discipline and that neither dishonesty nor self-interest lay beneath his violations of the cited Disciplinary Rules. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">(\u00b6 16} Against these factors, the board weighed a series of aggravating circumstances. Apparently because the board did not believe respondent\u2019s testimony regarding his telephone conversations with Blackburn and the police sergeant and because respondent had failed to notify the panel that affidavits he had submitted contained incorrect dates, the board found that respondent had submitted false evidence at the hearing. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(f). Second, respondent refused to accept any responsibility for his wrongdoing, insisting that the witnesses were either in a conspiracy against him or were confused. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(g). Third, respondent had an improper motive for calling the aunt\u2019s employer, and his call caused her problems with her employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">{\u00b6 17} Fourth, the board found that respondent had attempted to impede and obstruct the disciplinary process. The board believed that respondent\u2019s motions to disqualify relator\u2019s counsel were \u201can obvious effort to interfere with the orderly commencement of the hearing.\u201d In his written motion to disqualify all three attorneys for relator, respondent argued that one attorney should be disqualified because she and respondent had represented opposing parties in a contentious domestic-relations case. Respondent argued that the other two attorneys should be disqualified because he had included them on his witness list for the hearing before the panel. He claimed that he should be able to cross-examine those attorneys regarding affidavits that they had submitted to the probable-cause panel in response to his reply to the draft complaint. Respondent\u2019s motion was overruled, and, in his motion to reconsider, respondent added a claim that one of the attorneys had attempted to intimidate one of his witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>{\u00b6 18} The board also noted that respondent had notified the panel on December 7, 2004, the day before the two-day hearing was to begin, that he was ill and might not attend the hearing. Respondent did appear at the hearing on December 8, but advised the panel that he would not be available for the second day of the hearing because he was under doctor\u2019s orders to undergo a medical test the next morning. The parties agreed to try to finish the hearing that day. Then, around 9:00 p.m. that night, respondent announced that one of his subpoenaed witnesses had failed to appear and he wanted to call him to appear the next day. When the chairman of the panel reminded respondent that he had said he could not be at the hearing the next day and that that was why they had all stayed late to finish the hearing, respondent said, \u201cActually, I will be here, I was ordered [by my doctor] not to be here today. I disregarded that order. I\u2019ll disregard tomorrow\u2019s order as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 19} The board was also displeased with respondent\u2019s refusal to stipulate to matters at the panel hearing, a strategy that placed even the customarily stipulated authenticity of official records in issue. Respondent subpoenaed the custodians of police, court, and other records for his defense; however, he never called the custodians as witnesses, because he was able to rely on copies of official records submitted by relator as exhibits. Moreover, when faced with a motion to quash his subpoena for the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor, respondent canceled the subpoena, accepting in substitute an affidavit by the prosecutor stating that the prosecutor did not know respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 20} Respondent argued that relator had failed to prove any misconduct and urged dismissal of the complaint. He alternatively insisted that if the panel found any Disciplinary Rule violations, the sanction at most should be a public reprimand. Arguing that respondent had committed serious misconduct and was overly contentious in his defense strategy, relator argued for a one-year suspension of respondent\u2019s license and monitored supervision of his practice upon reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 21} The board and panel agreed that the aggravating circumstances of respondent\u2019s case warranted a more exacting sanction than his misconduct alone would have justified. Adopting the panel\u2019s report, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year with six months of the suspension stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further professional misconduct during the period of his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Review '</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">{\u00b6 22} Respondent filed objections, arguing that the violations of DR 9-101(C), 7-102(A)(l), and 7-105(A) were not proved with clear and convincing evidence. In the alternative, respondent asserts that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction if we do find misconduct. Relator also filed objections, arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>respondent\u2019s misconduct and refusal to duly cooperate in the disciplinary proceedings warrant a one-year actual suspension with a provision for monitoring his practice upon reinstatement. We overrule all the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\n<em>Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 23} Respondent insists that he did not intend to harass the aunt in the underlying custody dispute, that he did not threaten criminal charges against the aunt to gain an advantage in the custody matter, and that he did not mean to imply that he could improperly influence public officials to take action adverse to the aunt. Respondent claims that his intentions were to try to prevent the aunt from being prosecuted for kidnapping and at the same time ensure that no one absconded with the child, whom he believed his client had immediate legal custody of as a result of the juvenile judge\u2019s dismissal. The panel, and later the board, found respondent\u2019s explanation for his actions implausible, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 24} Unless the record weighs heavily against a hearing panel\u2019s findings, we defer to the panel\u2019s credibility determinations, inasmuch as the panel members saw and heard the witnesses firsthand. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Statzer, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 14, 2003-Ohio-6649, 800 N.E.2d 1117, \u00b6 8. Here, we have no trouble seeing why the panel credited relator\u2019s witnesses over respondent\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 25} The panel found credible the testimony of the police sergeant, who had no involvement in the custody proceedings, and of Blackburn, who demonstrated an even-tempered professionalism when faced with respondent\u2019s attacks against him. These witnesses\u2019 similar recollections of their conversations with respondent corroborated the fact that respondent had resorted to the same improper tactics with each of them. Moreover, respondent conceded that he had never really suspected the aunt of kidnapping or believed that criminal charges were warranted. Thus, we agree with the board that respondent\u2019s mentioning that the county prosecutor was his friend in connection with threatening to bring kidnapping charges was intended to intimidate and suggest that he could improperly influence the prosecutor in order to gain cooperation in locating his client\u2019s child. We therefore find that he violated DR 7-105 and 9 \u2014 101(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">{\u00b6 26} We further reject respondent\u2019s claim that he did not telephone the aunt\u2019s employer to harass or maliciously injure the aunt. Respondent recognized that he could not ethically communicate directly with the aunt without her counsel\u2019s permission, see DR 7-104(A)(l), and insists that all he intended to do when he called the aunt\u2019s employer on January 30 was to find out whether she was at work. But respondent did not simply ask whether the aunt was on duty; he held on through several transfers to reach the aunt\u2019s supervisor and proceeded to report the aunt\u2019s personal troubles. Respondent then exacerbated the situation by suggesting that the aunt was involved in a kidnapping. Thus, we defer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the panel\u2019s determination that respondent\u2019s communications with the aunt\u2019s employer violated DR 7-102(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 27} In finding this misconduct, we also reject as completely unfounded respondent\u2019s remaining arguments. He claims that he could not have violated DR 7-105 because the juvenile court judge had dismissed the aunt\u2019s complaint for permanent custody. His argument ignores that DR 7-105 precludes threats of criminal prosecution to gain advantage in a civil <em>matter. </em>This prohibition obviously extends to all civil claims, whether or not they are currently pending in court, and the custody dispute underlying these proceedings had clearly not been resolved. Respondent also argues that he could not have violated DR 9-101(C), because he was not in reality acquainted with the county prosecutor or city safety director. DR 9 \u2014 101(C), however, prohibits a lawyer from <em>implying </em>that he is able to improperly influence a public official.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\n<em>Sanction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b628} When imposing a sanction for attorney misconduct, we consider the duties violated, the actual or potential injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">{\u00b6 29} We find that in violating DR 9 \u2014 101(C), 7-102(A)(l), and 7-105, respondent compromised his duty to promote confidence in the legal system and the legal profession. Second, his misconduct hurt one of the legal system\u2019s most vulnerable victims, a litigant in family court. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Arkow, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 265, 2004-Ohio-6512, 819 N.E.2d 284, \u00b6 23. Third, respondent committed the misconduct, realizing that the aunt was emotionally fragile after having had her complaint for permanent custody dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">{\u00b6 30} Fourth, we agree with the board\u2019s findings of aggravating and mitigating factors, including that respondent failed to cooperate in the disciplinary proceedings. Lawyers are entitled to zealously defend themselves against charges of misconduct; however, they are no less bound by the standards of professionalism in these proceedings than any other. Respondent\u2019s refusal to observe usual customs and courtesies justified the recommendation to enhance the sanction for his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">{\u00b6 31} On the other hand, respondent\u2019s attempts to have counsel disqualified were not totally specious, nor was respondent responsible for every delay. Thus, contrary to relator\u2019s argument, this case is not in the same category as <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Watterson, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 322, 2004-Ohio-4776, 815 N.E.2d 386, a case in which the lawyer (1) requested four extensions to file an answer so that he could obtain counsel and then filed an answer pro se, (2) doggedly asserted a nonexistent conflict to prevent the Stark County Bar Association from prosecut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ing the case against him, and (3) moved this court for removal of the panel chairperson because she had overruled his motion to disqualify. We dismissed Watterson\u2019s motion sua sponte and later cited him for contempt for repeatedly failing to appear for his deposition. See id. at \u00b6 13. Responding to these and many additional efforts to hinder the disciplinary process, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cRespondent persistently missed deadlines and otherwise obstructed the process'in order to defend against the disciplinary charges. He unjustifiably and repeatedly accused various participants in the process of some impropriety. Relator\u2019s counsel aptly described respondent\u2019s behavior as \u2018exasperating.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 33} Finally, none of the cases cited by the parties involves misconduct that precisely resembles respondent\u2019s offenses. The cases involving the most similar misconduct are <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Watson, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 364, 2002-Ohio2222, 768 N.E.2d 617, and <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Cohen </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 100, 712 N.E.2d 118, in which lawyers threatened their clients with criminal charges because the clients had written them bad checks, and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Cicero </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 351, 678 N.E.2d 517, in which a defense lawyer boasted of his having a romantic relationship with a judge and suggested that the judge would rule in his clients\u2019 favor for that reason. Watson was suspended from practicing law for one year because he had also committed a variety of other misconduct and refused to accept responsibility for his actions. Cohen was publicly reprimanded after he conceded his single instance of wrongdoing. Cicero was suspended for one year for engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, a violation of DR 1-102(A)(5), and failing to act with respect toward the courts, a violation of Gov.Bar R. IV(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 34} Respondent did not commit as many Disciplinary Rule violations as Watson did or impugn the integrity of a court, as Cicero did. He did, however, fail to acknowledge his serious misconduct and unnecessarily complicate these proceedings. We therefore find the board\u2019s recommendation appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 35} Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for one year. The last six months of this suspension are stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further Disciplinary Rule violations. If respondent violates the condition of the stay, the stay shall be lifted, and respondent shall serve the entire one-year suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b260-11\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b260-12\">O\u2019Connor, J., dissents and would suspend respondent for one year.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AEd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Ellen S.
