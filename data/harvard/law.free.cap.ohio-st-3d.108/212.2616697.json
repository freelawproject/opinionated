Crase claimed that the Ohio Adult Parole Authority had unlawfully extended his release date from July 2005 to October 2005. The warden moved to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">{\u00b6 3} In August 2005, the court of appeals dismissed Crase\u2019s petition. The court of appeals concluded that Crase\u2019s petition was fatally defective because he did not comply with the R.C. 2725.04(D) requirement to attach commitment papers to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">{\u00b6 4} In his appeal as of right, Crase asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his petition. For the following reasons, we dismiss this appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c '[HJabeas corpus in Ohio is generally appropriate in the criminal context only if the petitioner is entitled to immediate release from prison or some type of physical confinement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Leis, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 309, 2005-Ohio-5125, 835 N.E.2d 5, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>State ex rel. Smirnoff v. Greene </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 165, 167, 702 N.E.2d 423. \u201cIf a habeas corpus petitioner seeking release is subsequently released, the petitioner\u2019s habeas corpus claim is normally rendered moot.\u201d <em>Larsen v. State </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 69, 69-70, 748 N.E.2d 72, citing <em>Pewitt v. Lorain Correctional Inst. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 470, 472, 597 N.E.2d 92. Crase\u2019s appeal is moot because his sentence has now expired and he has been released from prison.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AQU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Gregory Crase, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AUE\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Thelma Thomas Price, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">{\u00b6 6} Moreover, this is not a claim that is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Spencer v.
