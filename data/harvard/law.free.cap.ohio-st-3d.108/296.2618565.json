We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">{\u00b6 2} On October 23, 2003, appellee Gracie Ganu was injured while lifting a patient at an extended-care facility operated by appellant, Willow Brook Christian Communities. A workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed for \u201csprain hip and thigh, left.\u201d Ganu then requested temporary total disability compensation, and Willow Brook responded by continuing wages in lieu of compensation, which is statutorily acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">{\u00b6 3} On December 18, 2003, the Industrial Commission of Ohio ordered that Ganu\u2019s claim be amended to include \u201cleft hip sprain and lumbar sprain.\u201d Approximately one month later, Ganu was examined at Willow Brook\u2019s request by Dr. Christopher Holzaepfel. Dr. Holzaepfel did not accept the allowance of \u201cleft hip sprain\u201d and opined that Ganu did not sustain such an injury as a result of the October 23, 2003 accident. His report also did not refer to the allowed lumbar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>sprain. When asked to list any medical restrictions on Ganu\u2019s ability to work, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cI do not believe that the condition of sprained left hip and thigh should be allowed. Therefore based on this condition, there are no restrictions on Ms. Ganu returning to employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cBased on conditions that are not the subject of this examination[,] I do feel that Ms. Ganu can return to a light duty type of employment that would be mainly desk type of work[,] answering phones, etc. She would be limited to sitting for one hour at a time and also limited to no more than 15 minutes of standing at one time. Clearly, she could not return to her prior position as a nurse\u2019s aide which would require lifting, twisting, squatting, etc. that she is clearly unable to perform at this point. These limitations are not however the result of the allowed conditions of this claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">{\u00b6 6} Dr. Anne Marie Beinecke, Ganu\u2019s attending physician, certified on November 17, 2003, and continued to certify during the relevant periods, that Ganu was unable to return to her former position of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">{\u00b6 7} On February 12, 2004, Willow Brook offered Ganu a light-duty job based on Dr. Holzaepfel\u2019s restrictions. Its proposed \u201cAgreement for Temporary Light Duty Program Classification\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cIn accordance with the restrictions and limitations provided by your treating physician as a result of your work-related injury, we are offering you a position under the Light Duty Program (LDP). Your duties will include those detailed on the attached Job Description. Please be reminded that your physician does not want you to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cLift more than 10 pounds</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cStoop</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cBend</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cStand for a prolonged period of time</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-14\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cSit for a prolonged period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-15\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-16\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThis agreement shall be in effect until such time as the physician feels that you are physically capable of resuming your regular work, and for a period not to exceed 30 days from the date of this agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">{\u00b6 16} The accompanying job description, titled \u201cLPD Job Description and Release,\u201d listed only Ganu\u2019s lifting restriction. It specified her new duties as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-18\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c1) Feed breakfast and lunch in AC dining room</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-19\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c2) Fill out AC dining room meal intake book</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>{\u00b6 19} \u201c3) Stock hall linens cart</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c4) Stuff medical charts with forms</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c5) File lab work</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c6) Check resident Identification Bands to ensure that all residents have one on</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c7) Stock shower rooms</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ali\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c8) Nail care for all residents</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c9) Check sharp containers in men\u2019s room and each shower room</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c10) Tidy wheelchair bay area \u2014 place soiled linens in appropriate bins</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c11) Clean wheelchairs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c12) Clean residents[\u2019] closets</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-13\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c13) Stock resident rooms with personal items.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">{\u00b6 30} Ganu refused to accept this offer, prompting Willow Brook to seek termination of compensation under R.C. 4123.56(A). A commission staff hearing officer found in Willow Brook\u2019s favor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-15\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c[T]he employer submitted a written light duty job offer to the claimant that was to begin on 02/17/2004. The claimant never responded to this job offer. The job offer was based on the work restrictions recommended by an independent physician evaluation performed on 01/14/2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-16\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cAfter reviewing the job offer, its restrictions, and the duties of the job offer, the Staff Hearing Officer finds that this was a good faith job offer within the restrictions recommended by the 01/14/2004 evaluation and claimant\u2019s refusal to accept this job offer bars her entitlement to temporary total benefits from 02/17/2004 forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-17\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cClaimant\u2019s counsel raised concerns that some of the job duties were beyond claimant\u2019s restrictions. However, based on testimony of Ms. Frey, on behalf of the employer, that modification would be made to specify job duties such that all job duties would be in accordance with all restrictions, the Staff Hearing Officer is satisfied that this job offer did comply with the listed restrictions and claimant\u2019s refusal to accept [the] offer precludes temporary total benefits as of 02/17/2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-18\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe claimant stated [that] her physician reviewed the job offer and told her she couldn\u2019t do this job. However, the claimant did not submit documentation of that opinion[;] therefore, there is no independent verification that claimant\u2019s doctor stated this job offer was beyond claimant\u2019s capacity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-19\">{\u00b6 35} Further appeal was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>{\u00b6 36} Ganu filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. The court of appeals, through its magistrate, found that the commission abused its discretion in terminating compensation. It found that Dr. Holzaepfel\u2019s report could not properly form the basis of a good-faith job offer because he did not consider all allowed conditions. It also held that the enumerated job duties did not meet the specificity requirements of <em>State ex rel. Coxson v. Dairy Mart Stores of Ohio, Inc. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 428, 739 N.E.2d 324. Accordingly, the court of appeals issued the writ of mandamus, ordering the commission to vacate its order terminating Ganu\u2019s temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 37} This cause is now before this court on appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 38} R.C. 4123.56(A) and Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32 prohibit the payment of temporary total disability compensation after a claimant has refused a good-faith written offer of suitable employment, i.e., work within claimant\u2019s medical capacities. Ganu did not accept Willow Brook\u2019s light-duty job offer. Thus, the legitimacy of this job offer will determine whether the commission abused its discretion in denying temporary total disability compensation. The court of appeals found that the job offer was unacceptable, and we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 39} Willow Brook\u2019s job offer was based on the report of Dr. Holzaepfel, who examined Ganu on Willow Brook\u2019s behalf. Dr. Holzaepfel did not consider Ganu\u2019s allowed lumbar sprain in addressing her physical restrictions. This omission is fatal pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Richardson v. Quarto Mining Co. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 358, 652 N.E.2d 1027, which declared that a doctor\u2019s report that did not consider all allowed conditions could not support the grant or denial of temporary total disability compensation. It follows, therefore, that such a report cannot support a job offer upon which eligibility for such compensation hinges. A report that cannot directly support compensation denial should not be permitted to do so indirectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 40} Moreover, Dr. Holzaepfel opined that the allowed conditions of \u201csprain left hip and thigh\u201d had never occurred. This, too, is a fatal flaw. Certainly, a physician is not required to affirm the continued existence of an allowed condition that, in the doctor\u2019s opinion, has medically resolved. <em>State ex rel. Domjancic v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 693, 635 N.E.2d 372. A physician, however, must accept that an allowed condition once existed and not disavow its initial allowance as Dr. Holzaepfel did here. <em>State ex rel. Middlesworth v. Regal Ware, Inc. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 214, 754 N.E.2d 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">{\u00b6 41} The court of appeals further found that the job offer did not satisfy the requirements established in <em>Coxson. Coxson </em>held that a written offer of suitable employment must clearly identify the physical demands of the job and, moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>that an offer lacking the requisite clarity could not be rehabilitated by an employer\u2019s verbal assurances that the claimant\u2019s limitations would be honored.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 42} In his report, Dr. Holzaepfel recommended limiting Ganu to essentially desk work with prohibitions on twisting, squatting, stooping, and bending. Lifting was limited to no more than ten pounds. Sitting and standing were restricted to an hour and a quarter hour, respectively. In the \u201cAgreement for Temporary Light Duty Program Classification,\u201d Willow Brook loosely described these latter restrictions as prohibitions against \u201cprolonged\u201d sitting and standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 43} This is problematic under <em>Coxson, </em>where the court was troubled by similarly ambiguous terms in a job offer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c[T]he December letter, in acknowledging Dr. Steele\u2019s prohibition against repetitive bending, stooping and kneeling, defined \u2018repetitive\u2019 as seven to eight times in an \u2018instance\u2019 \u2014 an obviously subjective and highly ambiguous time frame. Thus, what [Dairy Mart] considered to be non-repetitive could easily exceed Dr. Steele\u2019s limitation of six times per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThe problem continues into the May 3, 1994 letter and job description. Its reference to \u2018occasional\u2019 bending and kneeling is, again, too vague, and leaves the door open to duties that exceed Dr. Steele\u2019s restrictions.\u201d Id., 90 Ohio St.3d at 432-433, 739 N.E.2d 324.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">{\u00b6 46} The same problem exists here. Willow Brook\u2019s reference to \u201cprolonged\u201d sitting and standing produces comparable concern that Willow Brook\u2019s subjective definition of \u201cprolonged\u201d may not comport with the actual limitations placed on Ganu.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">{\u00b6 47} The job duties listed on the \u201cLDP Job Description and Release\u201d also invite scrutiny. The duties to be performed by Ganu were varied. Some of them raise questions, particularly the stocking and cleaning responsibilities. Because only the lifting restriction was listed on the form, the prohibitions against stooping, bending, and standing listed on the light-duty agreement and the ban on twisting and squatting made by Dr. Holzaepfel may not have been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">{\u00b6 48} Willow Brook maintains that any doubts about these duties were addressed by it at the hearing. <em>Coxson, </em>however, prohibits verbal qualification, and it is immaterial that the hearing officer was persuaded by Willow Brook\u2019s assurances. The point of <em>Coxson </em>is that a written offer cannot be supplemented by nonwritten promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">{\u00b6 49} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-14\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AgY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Heinzerling &amp; Goodman, L.L.C., and Jonathan H.
