I understand the majority\u2019s reluctance to address this case because, arguably, it does not involve a novel legal issue. The case does involve a young man who lost a leg through no fault of his own and who is unable to get proper compensation \u2022because two courts misapplied the law. Would it have been so hard for us to right an injustice? Apparently so.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 4} I would have reached the merits of the case and reversed the judgment of the court of appeals. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
