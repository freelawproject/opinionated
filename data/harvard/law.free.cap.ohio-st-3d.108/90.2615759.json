The BTA ruled that the R.C. 5739.01(E) resale exception to the sales and use tax therefore did not apply. We affirm the decision of the BTA on those issues, which are the focus of Cousino\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">{\u00b6 3} On the other issue in the case, the Tax Commissioner and the BTA disagreed. The Tax Commissioner found that Cousino was not entitled to a tax exemption under R.C. 5739.02(B)(13), which provides a sales- and use-tax exemption for the sale of any materials or services to construction contractors when those materials or services are to be incorporated into a government-owned building. The BTA reached the opposite conclusion, finding that the exemption did apply and that Cousino therefore did not owe use taxes on its use of the janitorial services that it purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">{\u00b6 4} We reverse the decision of the BTA on this issue without reaching the merits because Cousino did not preserve the issue in its notice of appeal filed with the BTA, and the BTA therefore had no jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">{\u00b6 5} Cousino Construction Company of Perrysburg, Ohio, is a general contractor that helps restore homes, offices, and cars damaged by fires, floods, and other disasters. Subcontractors hired by Cousino typically provide a thorough cleaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>of a damaged site to remove soot, smoke, odors, mold, and water, and then Cousino\u2019s employees reconstruct the site with drywall, paint, floor coverings, and any other materials and services needed to return the structure to its original condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">{\u00b6 6} In 1997, the Tax Commissioner conducted an audit of the purchases reported by Cousino for the period July 1, 1993, through December 31,1996, and concluded that the company owed more than $46,000 in unpaid use taxes, penalties, and interest charges. Cousino paid some of the assessed taxes but objected to others in a petition for reassessment. A hearing was held before the Tax Commissioner in May 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">{\u00b6 7} After that hearing, the Tax Commissioner prepared a written decision in which he rejected the objections raised by Cousino. The Tax Commissioner concluded that Cousino owed use taxes on janitorial services that it had purchased from several subcontractors and found that the resale exception to the use tax did not apply to Cousino because the services provided to Cousino were not resold by it in the form in which they were received, as the resale exception requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b6 8} Cousino appealed to the BTA, which held a hearing on the matter in July 2003. Cousino presented the testimony of two witnesses. The BTA sided with the Tax Commissioner on the question whether Cousino was exempt from use taxes under the R.C. 5739.01(E) resale exception, but agreed with Cousino that the company\u2019s purchases of cleaning services for the restoration of school buildings were exempt from taxation under R.C. 5739.02(B)(13). The latter provision states that some services sold to construction contractors and incorporated into a structure under a contract with a governmental entity are not subject to sales or use taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">{\u00b6 9} The Tax Commissioner appealed from the latter portion of the BTA\u2019s decision, and Cousino cross-appealed from the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">{\u00b6 10} In reviewing a BTA decision, this court looks to see whether that decision was \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 496, 497, 739 N.E.2d 783; R.C. 5717.04. The court \u201cwill not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. But \u201c[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support for these BTA determinations,\u201d this court will affirm them. <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v.

Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 240, 2003-Ohio-5804, 797 N.E.2d 1278, \u00b6 30. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s findings \u201care presumptively valid, absent a demonstration that those findings are clearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d <em>Nusseibeh v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 292, 2003-Ohio-855, 784 N.E.2d 93, \u00b6 10. Any claimed exemption from taxation \u201cmust be strictly construed,\u201d and the taxpayer \u201cmust affirmatively establish his or her right\u201d to the exemption. <em>Campus Bus Serv. v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-1915, 786 N.E.2d 889, \u00b68.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Ohio\u2019s Use Tax</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">{\u00b6 12} Under R.C. 5741.02(A)(1), a tax is levied on \u201cthe storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property or the benefit realized in this state of any service provided.\u201d However, if the acquisition of the tangible personal property or services \u201cwould be a sale not subject to the [sales] tax imposed by sections 5739.01 to 5739.31 of the Revised Code,\u201d then the use tax described in R.C. Chapter 5741 is likewise not imposed. R.C. 5741.02(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">{\u00b6 13} Generally, the purchase of cleaning services is subject to the sales and use tax. See R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(j) (\u201c\u2018Sale\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 include * * * [a]ll transactions by which * * * [b]uilding maintenance and janitorial service is or is to be provided\u201d) and R.C. 5739.02 (the sales tax is \u201clevied on each retail sale made in this state\u201d). The term \u201c[b]uilding maintenance and janitorial service\u201d is defined in R.C. 5739.01(11) as \u201ccleaning the interior or exterior of a building and any tangible personal property located therein or thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Cousino\u2019s Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">{\u00b6 14} Cousino hired subcontractors to clean fire- or flood-damaged buildings during the audit period, and the Tax Commissioner concluded that Cousino\u2019s purchases of those cleaning services were subject to the use tax imposed on building maintenance and janitorial services. Cousino contends instead that the cleaning services it (with the help of subcontractors) provided to the company\u2019s nonprofit customers \u2014 most notably, public school districts and churches \u2014 were not subject to the use tax, because these tax-exempt entities, not Cousino, were the consumers of the services that the Tax Commissioner assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\n<em>Cousino was a Consumer of Cleaning Services</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">{\u00b6 15} First, the Tax Commissioner and the BTA both found that Cousino was eligible for imposition of use taxes on the cleaning services because Cousino was the consumer of those services. That finding is well supported by facts in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Under R.C. 5741.02(B), the consumer who realizes the benefit of a service is liable for the use tax imposed on that service. And \u201cconsumer\u201d is defined in R.C. 5741.01(F) as \u201cany person who has purchased tangible personal property or has been provided a service for storage, use, or other consumption or benefit in this state.\u201d Several terms in that definition are themselves defined as well: \u201cperson\u201d is defined in R.C. 5741.01(A) to include corporations; \u201cpurchase\u201d is defined in R.C. 5741.01(D) as \u201cacquired or received for a consideration\u201d; and \u201cproviding a service\u201d is defined by R.C. 5741.01(M) and R.C. 5739.01(X) as \u201cproviding or furnishing * * * [any taxable service, including building maintenance and janitorial service] for consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">{\u00b6 17} Cousino was the consumer of the cleaning services that were provided to it by the various subcontractors. It benefited from those services because it was able to charge its final customers \u2014 insurance companies and the owners of dirty and damaged buildings who had purchased insurance \u2014 both for those cleaning services and for the materials and skilled labor that Cousino\u2019s own employees provided to those customers when reconstructing and restoring the buildings. The cleaning services that Cousino consumed allowed Cousino to deliver fully cleaned and restored buildings to Cousino\u2019s customers. And as Cousino itself acknowledges, it received the subcontractors\u2019 services in return for a consideration. That is to say, Cousino paid the subcontractors for their work.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">{\u00b6 18} In addition, nothing in the record suggests that Cousino or the companies from which it purchased cleaning services were exempt from sales and use taxes, and there is likewise no indication in the record that the cleaning companies collected <em>sales </em>taxes on the \u201cbuilding maintenance and janitorial services\u201d that they provided to Cousino. R.C. 5739.01(11). Had they done so, Cousino would not be liable for use taxes. See R.C. 5741.02(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">{\u00b6 19} Cousino was, therefore, the consumer of the taxable janitorial services that the cleaning subcontractors provided to it. The fact that Cousino\u2019s customers \u2014 some of which were nonprofit entities \u2014 also benefited from the cleaning services does not change the fact that Cousino was rightly viewed by the Tax Commissioner as the consumer of those services because Cousino realized a benefit from them and paid a consideration for them to the service providers.</p>\n<p id=\"A3b\">\n<em>The Resale Exception Does Not Apply</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">{\u00b6 20} The Tax Commissioner and the BTA both found as well that Cousino did not \u201cresell\u201d the cleaning services in the same form in which they were purchased. That conclusion is also a sound one.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">{\u00b621} R.C. 5739.01(E) excludes from the definition of \u201c[r]etail sale\u201d (and therefore excludes from the R.C. 5739.02 sales tax on retad sales) any sale \u201cin which the purpose of the consumer is to resell the thing transferred or benefit of the service provided, by a person engaging in business, in the form in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>same is, or is to be, received by the person.\u201d In other words, when the purchaser\u2019s intent in buying goods or services is to resell them to yet another purchaser without changing the goods or services in any way, the original purchase is not considered a \u201cretail sale\u201d and is therefore not subject to the sales tax on retail sales. (And under R.C. 5741.02(C)(2), any sale not subject to sales tax is likewise not subject to the use tax.)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">{\u00b6 22} The BTA concluded that the resale exception in R.C. 5739.01(E) does not apply in this case. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination had likewise rejected the application of the resale exception, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe cleaning services were not resold to the petitioner\u2019s [Cousino\u2019s] customers in an unchanged form. Rather, the petitioner received the benefit of the cleaning services and added its project management/general contractor skills to the cleaning services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">{\u00b6 24} That statement by the Tax Commissioner aptly summarizes the facts. According to testimony presented by Cousino to the BTA, the cleaning subcontractors typically billed Cousino for their services, and then those charges were incorporated into the invoices that Cousino would send to its customers (i.e., insurance companies or the property owners whose buildings Cousino had agreed to restore). The cleaning services were consumed \u2014 not resold \u2014 by Cousino. Cousino was not a retail seller of those services. The insurance companies and property owners promised to pay Cousino to provide a restored and rebuilt building, and Cousino in turn hired and paid cleaning subcontractors to, as one of those subcontractors told the BTA, \u201cget[ ] the building prepped for Cousino to rebuild.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">{\u00b6 25} Although this case involves janitorial or cleaning services, a recent case involving employment services is instructive. In <em>Corporate Staffing Resources, Inc. v. Zaino </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 1, 764 N.E.2d 1006, the court held that a provider of employment services was not entitled to the resale exception, because the computer-hardware company that hired the temporary employees from the employment-service provider did not resell those services. The computer-hardware company had purchased \u201ca temporary and flexible work force of sufficient size and expertise,\u201d and the computer company\u2019s customers had in turn paid the computer company to keep the customers\u2019 computers \u201cup and running.\u201d Id. at 3, 764 N.E.2d 1006. The employment services (the temporary workers) were \u201ca means to an end\u201d for the computer company\u2019s customers, rather than an end in themselves. Id. Those services were not, in other words, resold \u201cin the form in which * * * [they had been] received,\u201d as would be required for the R.C. 5739.01(E) resale exception to apply to the initial sale of the employment services. The computer company paid for employment services and used the workers it hired to service computers. The company that had provided the temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>workers and had been paid for that service owed taxes on the money it earned in the transaction. Id. at 5, 764 N.E.2d 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">{\u00b6 26} The same is true in this case. Cousino brought in cleaning-service subcontractors to \u201cdo the cleaning end\u201d of the restoration projects that Cousino performed for its customers and paid those subcontractors for their work, according to the production manager for one of the subcontractors. Cousino, in turn, performed, as a Cousino official who serves as a salesman and estimator explained, \u201cthe overall job,\u201d which he characterized as \u201ca restoration process\u201d involving \u201cconstruction or reconstruction\u201d of damaged buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">{\u00b6 27} Like the computer company in <em>Corporate Staffing Resources, </em>Cousino hired skilled service providers to perform certain jobs and then relied on the efforts of those workers to help Cousino deliver the reconstructed and restored buildings that Cousino\u2019s customers needed. The employment services were not resold by the computer company in <em>Corporate Staffing Resources, </em>and the cleaning services were not resold by Cousino in this case. The companies that did sell \u201c[bjuilding maintenance and janitorial service,\u201d as that term is defined in R.C. 5739.01(11), were the subcontractors hired by Cousino to clean the buildings that Cousino planned to restore. The R.C. 5739.01(E) resale exception does not exempt Cousino from paying use taxes for the cleaning services that it purchased and used, just as that exception did not exempt the computer company in <em>Corporate Staffing Resources </em>from paying use taxes for the employment services that it purchased and used. See, also, <em>Bellemar Parts Industries, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 351, 353, 725 N.E.2d 1132 (rejecting a taxpayer\u2019s effort to rely on the resale exception when the taxpayer \u201creceived the benefit\u201d of services that it purchased and then combined that benefit with the taxpayer\u2019s materials and the work of its own employees \u201cto create the item sold\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">{\u00b6 28} The burden rested on Cousino to prove to the Tax Commissioner and the BTA that the R.C. 5739.01(E) resale exception applied to the janitorial services that Cousino claims to have resold to its customers. Cousino did not meet that burden. Cousino is not in the business of selling or reselling cleaning services and indeed is not even licensed to sell cleaning services under R.C. 5739.17(A)(3), which requires vendors of taxable goods and services to purchase a vendor\u2019s license from the county treasurer. The benefit that Cousino delivered to its customers (reconstructed and restored buildings) was not the same benefit that Cousino purchased in the same form in which Cousino received it from the cleaning subcontractors. The BTA therefore reached the reasonable and lawful conclusion that Cousino had not proven its entitlement to the resale exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">{\u00b6 29} For those reasons, we do not agree with the arguments presented by Cousino in its cross-appeal. Instead, we affirm the decision of the BTA on the issues raised in the cross-appeal because (1) Cousino was the consumer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>cleaning services that it purchased from the subcontractors and (2) Cousino did not resell the benefit of those services in the form in which it was received (as would be required for the R.C. 5739.01(E) exception to apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The Tax Commissioner\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 30} Although the BTA found Cousino ineligible for the R.C. 5739.01(E) resale exception, it concluded that a different provision, R.C. 5739.02(B)(13), nonetheless exempted Cousino from the obligation to pay use taxes on some of the company\u2019s purchases of cleaning services from the subcontractors. Under that latter statutory provision, sales and use taxes do not apply to certain construction-related sales, including the sale of (1) \u201c[bjuilding and construction materials and services sold to construction contractors for incorporation into a structure or improvement to real property under a construction contract with this state or a political subdivision of this state\u201d or (2) building and construction materials and services sold to construction contractors for incorporation into a structure or improvement to real property \u201cthat are accepted for ownership by this state or any of its political subdivisions.\u201d R.C. 5739.02(B)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 31} The Tax Commissioner has appealed the BTA\u2019s decision granting the tax exemption, challenging the decision both on procedural grounds and on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\n<em>Cousino Failed to Cite R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) in its Notice of Appeal to the BTA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">{\u00b6 32} The Tax Commissioner argues first that Cousino did not properly raise an R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) exemption request before the BTA and therefore should not have been given that exemption in that forum. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">{\u00b6 33} The Tax Commissioner\u2019s May 2002 final determination rejected Cousino\u2019s request for an R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) exemption. Cousino then appealed to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 5717.02, which explains the proper procedure for challenging the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determinations, directs any appellant who files a notice of appeal with the BTA to attach a copy of the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination to that notice and to \u201calso specify the errors therein complained of.\u201d When Cousino appealed to the BTA in July 2002, however, Cousino never mentioned R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) in its four-page notice of appeal, despite listing several other statutory provisions in the notice. Cousino also did not cite R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) anywhere in its 12-page posthearing appellant\u2019s brief filed with the BTA in September 2003 or in its six-page reply brief filed with the BTA in November 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">{\u00b6 35} Even so, when the BTA issued its decision in August 2004, the BT\u00c1 found that the omission of R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) from Cousino\u2019s notice of appeal was \u201ca typographical error\u201d on Cousino\u2019s part that the BTA could overlook. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>examination of the notice of appeal leads us to conclude that that finding was an incorrect one.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">{\u00b6 36} This court has held in past cases that an appellant must specify the particular exemption it seeks in its notice of appeal to the BTA in order to preserve the issue for review. See, e.g., <em>Kern v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 347, 349, 650 N.E.2d 428 (appellants\u2019 failure to mention the R.C. 5739.02(B)(14) exemption claim was \u201cfatal\u201d); <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Lindley </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 71, 75, 23 O.O.3d 118, 430 N.E.2d 939 (\u201cUnder R.C. 5717.02, a notice of appeal does not confer jurisdiction upon the Board of Tax Appeals to resolve an issue, unless that issue is clearly specified in the notice of appeal\u201d); <em>Lenart v. Lindley </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 110, 114, 15 O.O.3d 152, 399 N.E.2d 1222 (\u201cR.C. 5717.02 is a jurisdictional enactment and * * * adherence to the conditions and procedure set forth in the statute is essential\u201d); <em>Queen City Valves v. Peck </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 579, 583, 53 O.O. 430, 120 N.E.2d 310, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed.1951) (R.C. 5717.02 requires the appellant to \u201cspecify\u201d any alleged errors, and \u201cspecify\u201d means \u201c \u2018to mention specifically; to state in full and explicit terms; to point out; to tell or state precisely or in detail; to particularize; or to distinguish by words one thing from another\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">{\u00b637} Cousino\u2019s four-page, single-spaced notice of appeal to the BTA was certainly detailed, but it contained no mention of an R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) exemption or any language that might suggest to the reasonable reader that Cousino intended to claim an exemption under that section. Cousino did refer in the notice to the R.C. 5739.01(E) resale exception addressed earlier in this opinion and also referred in three different paragraphs to tax exemptions under R.C. 5739.02(B)(1) (exempting sales to the state and its political subdivisions) and R.C. 5739.02(B)(12) (exempting sales to churches, nonprofit organizations, and other tax-exempt entities). The accompanying text of the notice of appeal surrounding the references to those two exemptions repeatedly mentioned \u201cnon-profit\u201d organizations and \u201cchurches.\u201d Those terms suggest that Cousino intended to claim exemptions under the two statutory provisions that it listed in three places in the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">{\u00b6 38} Significantly, the notice did not refer to any of the terms that are unique to R.C. 5739.02(B)(13), such as \u201c[bjuilding and construction materials and services\u201d or \u201cincorporation\u201d into real estate. While the notice did mention \u201csales to the State or any of its political subdivisions,\u201d that language is a direct quote from R.C. 5739.02(B)(1), one of the two exemption provisions that Cousino cited in the notice of appeal, rather than from R.C. 5739.02(B)(13), which the BTA\u2019s decision addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">{\u00b6 39} The BTA concluded that Cousino\u2019s three references in the notice to R.C. 5739.02(B)(1) were actually typographical errors and that Cousino had intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>to type R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) instead. The text surrounding the three references to R.C. 5739.02(B)(1) in the notice does not support that view, however, and Cousino\u2019s failure to mention R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) in its two posthearing briefs filed with the BTA reinforces our conclusion that Cousino never intended to ask the BTA for an exemption under R.C. 5739.02(B)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">{\u00b6 40} If the omission of any reference in the notice to R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) were truly a typographical error, and if Cousino\u2019s true intent were evident from the text of the notice taken as a whole, then perhaps the \u201ctypographical error\u201d could rightly be overlooked. This omission was not a typographical error, however, and the BTA exceeded its jurisdiction by considering and granting a tax exemption to Cousino based on a statutory provision that is mentioned nowhere in the notice of appeal or in Cousino\u2019s two posthearing briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">{\u00b6 41} For more than 50 years, this court\u2019s decisions interpreting the specificity requirement of R.C. 5717.02 have made clear that a notice of appeal filed with the BTA must explicitly and precisely recite the errors contained in the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination. The notice of appeal that Cousino filed with the BTA did not challenge the Tax Commissioner\u2019s denial of an R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) exemption, and no objective and reasonable reader could honestly say that it did. Though this court is \u201c \u2018not disposed to deny review by a hypertechnical reading of the notice,\u2019 \u201d <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 195, 197, 625 N.E.2d 597, quoting <em>Buckeye Internatl., Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 264, 268, 595 N.E.2d 347, the notice in this case, just like Cousino\u2019s posthearing briefs, provided no indication that Cousino was seeking an R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) exemption before the BTA. Cousino did not satisfy the specificity requirement of R.C. 5717.02 with respect to the R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) tax exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">{\u00b6 42} On the Tax Commissioner\u2019s appeal, then, we must reverse the BTA\u2019s decision granting an R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) exemption to Cousino. The BTA had no jurisdiction to consider that exemption in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">{\u00b6 43} For the reasons stated above, the BTA\u2019s decision is affirmed in part and reversed in part. The BTA correctly determined that (1) Cousino was the consumer of the cleaning services that it purchased and (2) Cousino did not resell those services in the same form in which they were purchased (and therefore was not entitled to a tax exemption under the R.C. 5739.01(E) resale exception). The BTA incorrectly found that Cousino preserved its claim to an R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) exemption in the notice of appeal that Cousino filed with the BTA, and therefore we hold that the BTA had no jurisdiction to address or grant an exemption under that statutory provision.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AYB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Lane Montz, for appellee and cross-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b187-8\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Janyce C. Katz, Assistant Attorney General, for appellant and cross-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">{\u00b6 44} The case is remanded for further proceedings. The BTA did not consider Cousino\u2019s requests for tax exemptions under R.C. 5739.02(B)(1) and 5739.02(B)(12), and the BTA should now consider whether Cousino is entitled to an exemption under either or both of those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Decision affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-6\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
