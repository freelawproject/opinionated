R.C. 4123.56(A). <em>Although </em>one doctor assessed appellant, William E. Sellards Jr., as having reached maximum medical improvement, another physician\u2019s plan for further treatment was approved by the Industrial Commission the same day as the assessment. We must determine whether the opinion regarding maximum medical treatment is invalidated due to the physician\u2019s lack of awareness of the approved plan. We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">{\u00b6 2} Sellards injured his back in an industrial accident in 1998. He was deemed to have reached maximum medical improvement of his back injury in January 2001. In November 2001, he began seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. J. T. Spare, for depression. Dr. Spare prescribed an unspecified antidepressant and initiated \u201csupportive psychotherapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">{\u00b6 3} On July 17, 2002, appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio additionally allowed Sellards\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim for \u201cmajor depressive disorder, single episode.\u201d On October 17, 2002, Dr. Spare submitted a C-9 treatment-plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>application that sought approval, without elaboration, for psychotherapy and \u201cmedication management.\u201d That application was approved by the commission on October 22, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 4} Coincidentally, also on October 22, Sellards was examined by another psychiatrist, Dr. Allen B. Levy, concerning the extent of his psychiatric disability. After examining Sellards and thoroughly reviewing his records (which did not include Dr. Spare\u2019s treatment plan), Dr. Levy concluded that Sellards\u2019s psychiatric condition had reached maximum medical improvement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThere has been some improvement since he began medication treatment and more substantial improvement since he was awarded compensation for temporary total disability. He, nonetheless, continues to experience sufficient depression symptoms to render him disabled, and I believe this disability to be permanent. I believe he has reached MMI [maximum medical improvement]. He is unlikely to show any further improvement in his condition. * * * It is unlikely that he will experience any significant further improvement in his depression so he is at MMI and is permanently disabled. It would be useful for him to continue to receive counseling and medication management at a frequency of once every month for the next three to four months then decrease the frequency of these visits to every couple of months. It is likely that he will need indefinite care from a psychiatrist and therapist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 6} Dr. Spare responded to Dr. Levy\u2019s report on November 26, 2002:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cI have reviewed Dr. Levy\u2019s report and would certainly agree that Mr. Sellards continues to have some residual symptoms which impair his functioning. These tend to vary a bit from week to week and, at times, appear to vary independently of the situation and at times seem to be a pretty direct result of intercurrent stress. Dr. Levy points out that we have not changed treatment in the recent past. Unfortunately, much of this is because the BWC [Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation] or the employer continually impairs the patient\u2019s ability to have his medication paid for. We have been, to some extent, limited on the options available as Mr. Sellards consistently reports that when he takes his prescriptions to the pharmacy, he is told that they are not compensated and therefore he cannot afford to get them filled. As a consequence, we have been using office samples in an attempt to treat him but, unfortunately, many of the things that I would otherwise use are not available in that form. * * * I think with optimizing medication and continued psychotherapy, he can make additional progress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 8} This letter contained the first mention of any problem with payment for medication. On December 23, 2002, Sellards\u2019s counsel phoned the bureau regarding prescription payment. The bureau responded with a letter the next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>day indicating that an error had occurred and, as of that date, had been corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 9} At about the same time, a commission district hearing officer found, based on Dr. Levy\u2019s report, that claimant had reached maximum medical improvement and therefore terminated temporary total disability compensation as of the December 18 hearing date. Sellards appealed and obtained another letter from Dr. Spare. Dated January 7, 2003, the letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cMr. Sellards continues to be symptomatic. * * * The intensity of these experiences seem [sic] to fluctuate, to some extent, and clearly there has been some improvement over baseline. However, the symptoms remain severe to moderately severe * * *. As I had previously noted, the patient persistently reports that attempts to get his prescriptions filled at the pharmacy are frustrated by the pharmacist who claims that these psychiatric items are not compensated. Mr. Sellards\u2019 antidepressant treatment has been, to some extent, limited as we have been providing him with office samples to keep him in treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cI know there has been some attempt to address this issue since his last visit. However, so far as I am aware, the situation has not changed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cIn any case, Mr. Sellards likely would have some opportunity to benefit from alternative medication or augmentation with a mood stabilizer; however, these approaches would require closer monitoring, blood testing and the availability of medication on a continuous basis. Given the uncertainty of the situation, I have been a bit reluctant to proceed with that because there are some risks involved, particularly if the medication cannot be continuously monitored appropriately.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 13} A staff hearing officer affirmed the district hearing officer\u2019s order on February 6, 2003. She reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cAlthough Dr. Levy does indicate that counseling and medication management should continue, he indicates it is unlikely that the claimant will experience any further improvement in his psychological condition despite that treatment. The Staff Hearing Officer further finds that although the psychological condition was not formally recognized in this claim as an allowed condition until July of 2002, the claimant has been receiving regular treatment with Dr. Spare since at least November of 2001. Although the claimanUj'ust recently reported a problem to the BWC in getting his prescriptions filled, it is noted that Dr. Spare has been providing the claimant with free medication samples to treat the allowed psychological condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">{\u00b6 15} The staff hearing officer\u2019s decision prompted a third letter from Dr. Spare on February 17, 2003. The letter reviewed the history of Sellards\u2019s treatment and suggested that Sellards would have been afforded more thorough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>treatment but for a delay in approving the psychiatric condition and getting Sellards\u2019s medications paid. The report, however, was vague about what specifically Dr. Spare would have done differently and what he would now do differently following approval of his treatment plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[H]is treatment was, to some extent, limited by inability to provide intensive treatment and limits on the medications which were available. As I previously commented, we did provide him with office samples of several antidepressants but they were incompletely effective. In such cases, augmentation strategies which involved the prescription of mood stabilizers or small doses of major tranquilizers or more typical antidepressants are often prescribed. Some of these strategies require medication which is not available as samples as well as blood monitoring which is also expensive. As a consequence, our attempts at treatment were limited and Mr. Sellards has not had all of the available aggressive treatments for his depression.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 17} Further appeal and an additional request for reconsideration were denied, generating Sellards\u2019s mandamus petition to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. The court of appeals denied the writ after finding that the commission order was supported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 18} This cause is now before this court on an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 19} The single issue presented is an evidentiary one. Sellards challenges Dr. Levy\u2019s opinion of maximum medical improvement as premature based on Dr. Spare\u2019s contemporaneously approved treatment plan and urges its disqualification. We agree with Sellards and accordingly reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 20} Prior to his examination by Dr. Levy, Sellards struggled to get the treatment recommended by his treating physician, Dr. Spare, who believed that Sellards would benefit from medication and psychotherapy. The commission, in approving that treatment, obviously wanted to give Sellards the opportunity for further treatment. We believe that Sellards merits that opportunity before maximum medical improvement is assessed. Dr. Levy\u2019s opinion was premature based on the commission\u2019s contemporaneous approval of Dr. Spare\u2019s treatment program. Dr. Levy\u2019s opinion could not, therefore, serve as evidence supporting denial of temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">{\u00b6 21} The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-12\">Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b397-13\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, J., dissent.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AoXZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Stewart Jaffy &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., Stewart R.
