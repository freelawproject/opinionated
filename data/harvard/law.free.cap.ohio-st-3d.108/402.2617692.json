Separately, the court found him guilty of the death-penalty specification for a prior attempted-murder conviction and accepted his guilty plea to the charge of having a weapon while under a disability. Barton also appeals from those convictions and from the sentence of capital punishment entered in accordance with the recommendation of the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>{\u00b6 2} On appeal, Barton presents four propositions of law, alleging that the trial court failed to adhere to our dictate in <em>State v. Ashworth </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 706 N.E.2d 1231, regarding his waiver of the presentation of mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his capital-murder trial; that the court erred in failing to order an evaluation of his competency after his waiver of mitigating evidence and his attempted suicide; that the court denied his right to counsel by precluding him from presenting an unsworn statement in a question- and-answer format; and finally, that the state improperly indicted him for having a weapon while under a disability. Upon review, we reject each proposition of law and therefore affirm his convictions. Further, upon reviewing and independently weighing all the facts and other evidence in the record and considering the offense and the offender, we have determined that the aggravating circumstance \u2014 his prior attempted-murder conviction \u2014 outweighs the mitigating factors in this case and that the sentence of death is appropriate. And after conducting a proportionality review of the death penalty in conformity with R.C. 2929.05, we affirm the judgment of the trial court regarding the imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 3} Kimbirli and Rocky Barton had known each other for many years and married on June 23, 2001, during his incarceration for attempted murder in Kentucky. Following his release from prison in 2002, he lived in a Warren County farmhouse on Bellbrook Road owned by his father, Donald, with Kim and Jamie, her 17-year-old daughter from a prior marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 4} Barton and Kimbirli generally had an amicable relationship and planned to renew their wedding vows in May or June 2003. Tiffany, Kim\u2019s 22-year-old daughter from a prior marriage, described Kim\u2019s relationship with Barton as \u201c[sjometimes good, sometimes bad, the highs were very high, the lows were really low.\u201d Julie, Kim\u2019s 27-year-old daughter from a prior relationship, also described Kim and Barton\u2019s relationship as \u201cup and down. * * * [Rjeally good [or] really bad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">{\u00b6 5} Tiffany described Barton as \u201c[v]ery moody, possessive, * * * controlling^] * * * just very manipulative.\u201d Julie also thought Barton could be, at times, \u201cvery jealous, very controlling, very manipulative, always accusing [Kim] of things, causing fights.\u201d Jamie agreed that Barton acted \u201ccontrolling and possessive,\u201d although she felt close to him and described him as the only father figure that she could depend upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">{\u00b6 6} On January 16, 2003, the morning of the murder, Barton awakened Jamie at 7:20 a.m. and told her to get her things together: \u2018You\u2019re going to Tiffs house. The wedding\u2019s off. Your mom\u2019s a psycho bitch.\u201d Barton then drove Jamie to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Tiffany\u2019s home and told Tiffany that her mother \u201chad gone off the deep end and that she was crazy and she was leaving him.\u201d Jamie described Barton as acting \u201c[r]eally strange\u201d and \u201caggravated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 7} Around 7:30 that morning, Kim arrived at Lasik Plus, where she worked as a technical assistant. Karla Reiber and Molly Wolfer, her co-workers, recalled that Barton had called more than six times that morning. He insisted on being placed on hold while Kim tended to patients, often for as long as 10 or 15 minutes, until she became available. Reiber described Barton as \u201cvery angry,\u201d and Wolfer described him as \u201cvery agitated, very angry,\u201d and \u201cvery irate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 8} After speaking with Barton on the phone around 10:30 a.m., Kim related to co-workers that she had heard shots fired. She told others that she had heard a \u201cbang\u201d over the phone. Police later recovered a spent shotgun shell in a bedroom at Barton\u2019s home, which supported her suspicion that Barton had fired a shotgun while talking with her on the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 9} Wolfer described Kim as crying, \u201cvery frantic,\u201d and \u201cvery scared\u201d when she left work around 10:30 a.m. Before leaving, Kim called Tiffany and asked whether she and Jamie could live with her temporarily. Tiffany described her mother as hysterical, frantic, and scared and agreed to have her mother and sister move in with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 10} Barton also talked on the telephone with several others that day. Around 7:45 a.m., he left a message with his employer, saying that he would not be at work that day because of a family emergency. Around 10:45 a.m., he spoke with his supervisor, Carol Williamson, and informed her that Kim had been \u201cacting strange\u201d due to her medication and that Kim intended to leave him.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">{\u00b6 11} Barton also called Randy Hacker, Julie\u2019s former husband, and complained about Kim and Julie. Barton seemed \u201cedgy\u201d and \u201cirritated,\u201d according to Hacker, and left Hacker a message, saying, \u201c[B]efore I go on to my demise, I should call you.\u201d In a later call, Barton informed Hacker that Kim intended to move out and that he would be going back to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">{\u00b6 12} Barton also spoke on the telephone several times that day with Glen Barker, an insurance agent. Barker has a background in counseling, and he offered to serve as a mediator between Barton and Kim. Barton visited Barker at his office around 9:30 a.m. and seemed calm and quiet, but Barton was anxious to speak with his father, who was in Florida. Barker called Kim at work on Barton\u2019s behalf, but Kim would not discuss the matter. Barker testified that Barton adamantly refused to allow Kim to collect her possessions from their house.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">{\u00b6 13} Barton\u2019s father, Donald, talked with Barton and Kim from Florida that morning in an effort to defuse the situation. Donald told Barton not to worry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>because anything that Kim might take from the farmhouse could be replaced, and he informed Kim that she could keep his car, which she currently drove. Larry Barton, Barton\u2019s uncle, also spoke with Barton several times by telephone on the day of the murder, and he offered assistance. Barton told Larry that he thought the police would be called, and he vowed that \u201che wouldn\u2019t go back to jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">{\u00b6 14} Around 11:00 a.m., Kim arrived at Tiffany\u2019s home. Barton called 25 or 30 times; Jamie and Tiffany overheard Barton cursing and yelling on the telephone and described his voice as \u201cscary.\u201d Jamie overheard him tell Kim, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, you f* * *ing bitch,\u201d causing Kim to become \u201creally nervous and scared\u201d while \u201ccrying and shaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 15} Around 3:00 p.m., Kim and Jamie made plans to return to their Bellbrook Road home to retrieve some clothing and personal effects. When Larry arrived at Tiffany\u2019s house, however, he strongly advised Kim not to go home. She agreed to stay away but gave Larry a list of things that she and Jamie wanted him to retrieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">{\u00b6 16} Immediately after Larry left to retrieve the items, Barton called again and persuaded Kim and Jamie to come to Bellbrook Road to obtain their things. When Larry arrived at Bellbrook Road, Barton had locked the gate, something he rarely did. Larry asked Barton to open the gate, but Barton absolutely refused to allow him onto the property. He kept saying, \u201cI\u2019ve lost it.\u201d Barton stood near his own truck behind the locked gate while Larry\u2019s truck remained parked on the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">{\u00b6 17} When Kim and Jamie arrived, however, Barton unlocked the gate and instructed Larry to lock it after they entered because he did not want \u201cthe police * * * coming in.\u201d Then Barton got in his truck, backed up \u201creal fast\u201d into the garage, and closed the garage door. Larry and Kim separately drove onto the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">{\u00b6 18} As Kim got out of the car and turned to shut her door, Barton came out the side door of the garage with a shotgun. As he ran toward Kim, he yelled \u2018You aren\u2019t going anywhere, you f* * *ing bitch,\u201d and he then fired the shotgun while four to six feet from her and struck her in her side. Feeling the impact, Kim fell, but moved toward her daughter, yelling, \u201cOh, Jamie, Oh Jamie.\u201d As Jamie reached for her mother, Barton shot her in the back from a distance of one to two feet. Kim fell to the ground, while Jamie screamed, \u201cMom, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Please stay with me, mommy, please stay with me.\u201d Barton then aimed the gun at Jamie\u2019s head and at Larry. Barton next walked to the side of Larry\u2019s truck and said, \u201cI told you I was insane,\u201d dropped to his knees, and shot himself in the face. Barton then walked into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">{\u00b6 19} Jamie and Larry called 911. Emergency Medical Services (\u201cEMS\u201d) personnel arrived and upon examining Kim found her ashen in color, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>breathing, and with fixed and dilated pupils and no pulse. Following an autopsy, Dr. Karen Powell, a forensic pathologist, determined that Kim had died from \u201cshotgun wounds of the left shoulder and right back regions\u201d that caused injuries to her lungs, heart, and liver.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 20} In response to the emergency call, police arrived and located Barton, alert and cooperative, inside the house. An EMS technician described him as suffering from a gunshot wound with non-life-threatening injuries to his chin, mouth, and nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 21} Upon investigation, police confiscated the murder weapon, a .410 pump-style shotgun, and four spent shotgun shells. Police also recovered six live shotgun shells from Barton at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\n<em>Indictment and Trial Result</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">{\u00b6 22} The grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Barton, charging him in the first count with the aggravated murder of Kimbirli with prior calculation and design, a gun specification, and a death-penalty specification for his prior conviction for attempted murder. The second count charged unlawful possession of a firearm while under a disability from a prior conviction. Barton pleaded guilty to the weapon-under-disability charge, but elected a jury trial on the aggravated-murder charge. The death-penalty specification was separately tried to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">{\u00b6 23} The state\u2019s case-in-chief included the following witnesses: Jamie, Carol Williamson, Peggy Barton, and her husband, Larry Barton. Through cross-examination of these witnesses, defense counsel elicited mitigating evidence about Barton. Williamson, Barton\u2019s supervisor, knew the family socially and testified on cross-examination that Barton and Kim seemed like a happy, affectionate couple, very much in love. She also testified that she never thought that Barton would harm Kim.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">{\u00b6 24} Kim\u2019s daughter, Jamie, testified on direct examination that she had witnessed Barton shoot her mother twice with a shotgun and had watched her die in her arms. She testified on cross-examination that she and Barton had been close and that he had served as her only reliable father figure by helping her secure a car and driver\u2019s license and by insisting that she obtain a good education.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">{\u00b6 25} On direct examination, Barton\u2019s uncle, Larry, stated that he watched Barton shoot Kim twice with the shotgun. Nonetheless, during cross-examination Larry described Kim and Barton as \u201cbest friends\u201d who got along well. According to Larry, Barton worked hard seven days a week. Also, Barton had bought Christmas presents for Larry\u2019s grandchildren, and Larry loved Barton as if he were his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Additionally, on cross-examination, Peggy Barton discussed Barton and Kim\u2019s good relationship and Barton\u2019s friendship with Larry.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 27} Other evidence presented by the state established that on April 9, 1991, Barton pleaded guilty to attempted murder in Madison County, Kentucky. He received a sentence of up to 15 years. In accordance with Barton\u2019s request, the state presented no further details of that conviction at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 28} The jury convicted Barton of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design in addition to the firearm specification, and the trial court found Barton guilty of the death-penalty specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b629} At the start of the penalty phase of the trial, the following colloquy occurred between defense counsel, Barton, and the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cMR. HOWARD [defense counsel]: * * * Since we\u2019re beginning to start the mitigation phase in this case, I want to put on the record that throughout the representation that Mr. Oda and I have undertaken on behalf of Mr. Barton, he has consistently, from day one, * * * insisted that we not call any family members on his behalf as witnesses in mitigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cWe have enlisted, with the court\u2019s approval, a neuropsychologist to examine Mr. Barton for the possibility of offering testimony or mitigation evidence in regard to this case. That was a Jeffrey Smalldon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cDr. Smalldon came down from Columbus on two occasions, spent about five or six hours with Mr. Barton. Mr. Barton basically refused to cooperate with any testing or participate in any testing with Dr. Smalldon and has instructed us not to call Dr. Smalldon as a potential witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cAnd we just wanted to put that on the record and have Mr. Barton acknowledge that for purposes of the record; is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cMR. BARTON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-14\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Mr. Barton, that\u2019s a fair representation of what\u2019s transpired in your case, sir? That\u2019s a fair representation that Mr. Howard has just made for the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-15\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cMR. BARTON: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">{\u00b6 37} Penalty-phase evidence consisted of an unsworn statement made by Barton. The trial court denied Barton\u2019s pretrial motion to use a question-and-answer format to present his unsworn statement. Although denying the request, the trial court declared that Barton \u201cwould have every opportunity to review [the statement] with his counsel, reduce it to writing, and touch all points per the direction and advice of counsel.\u201d Nevertheless, Barton instead made only the following unsworn statement to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>{\u00b6 38} \u201cMR. BARTON: At this time my attorneys advised me to beg for my life. I can\u2019t do that. I strongly believe in the death penalty. And for the ruthless, cold-blooded act that I committed, if I was sitting over there, I\u2019d hold out for the death penalty. * * * I\u2019ve recently done 10 years in prison. Life in prison would be a burden to all the citizens of Ohio. It would be at their cost. I wouldn\u2019t have nothing to worry about. I\u2019d get fed every day, have a roof over my head, free medical, you people pay for it, I\u2019d have a stress-free life. That\u2019s not much of a punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cPunishment would be to wake up every day and have a date with death. That\u2019s the only punishment for this crime. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 40} Following Barton\u2019s unsworn statement, Barton\u2019s counsel strongly urged the jury to impose a life sentence. Defense counsel highlighted the close relationships between Barton and several members of his family, asserted that Kim would not have married Barton if she had not seen some good in him, and argued that Kim had facilitated the offense by returning to her home on the day of her murder. Highlighting Barton\u2019s unsworn statement, Barton\u2019s counsel claimed that Barton wanted to die, and if the jury were to impose death, it would be giving Barton \u201cwhat he wanted on January the sixteenth and what he wants today.\u201d Counsel concluded by arguing for a life sentence without the possibility of parole: \u201cDeath is not a stiff enough sentence for Rocky Barton because it completes the plan * *</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 41} Following the court\u2019s instructions and deliberation, the jury recommended a sentence of death. The trial court sentenced Barton to death on the aggravated murder count together with consecutive terms of three years\u2019 and five years\u2019 imprisonment for the firearm specification and the weapons-under-disability offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">{\u00b6 42} On appeal, Barton now presents four propositions of law for our consideration. Upon careful review, we have concluded they are not well taken, and therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court regarding the criminal convictions. Upon further review, independently weighing all the facts and other evidence in the record and considering the offense and the offender, we have determined that the aggravating circumstance \u2014 Barton\u2019s prior attempted-murder conviction \u2014 outweighs the mitigating factors in this case and that the sentence of death is appropriate. And after conducting proportionality review of the death penalty in conformity with R.C. 2929.05, we affirm the judgment of the trial court regarding the imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">\n<em>Presentation of Mitigating Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">{\u00b6 43} Based on our ruling in <em>State v. Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 56, 706 N.E.2d 1231, Barton argues that the trial court should have inquired whether he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>knowingly and intelligently waived his right to present mitigating evidence before proceeding in the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">{\u00b6 44} The state asserts that this ease does not warrant an <em>Ashworth </em>inquiry because Barton did not waive presentation of all mitigating evidence. Therefore, the issue for our resolution concerns whether <em>Ashworth </em>applies to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 45} Upon review, we have determined that <em>Ashworth </em>is distinguishable on its facts and therefore does not apply. Ashworth pleaded guilty to aggravated murder, together with two death-penalty specifications, merged at sentencing. The court convicted him of aggravated murder and a single death-penalty specification at the conclusion of the guilt phase of trial, and Ashworth waived presentation of all mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of trial. Id. at 61, 65, and 71, 706 N.E.2d 1231. There, we held, \u201cIn a capital case, when a defendant wishes to waive the presentation of' <em>all </em>mitigating evidence, a trial court must conduct an inquiry of the defendant on the record to determine whether the waiver is knowing and voluntary.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 46} And in <em>State v. Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, defense counsel honored the defendant\u2019s request not to call his family members to testify on his behalf during the penalty phase of trial and insisted that defense counsel present only his unsworn statement and the testimony from one witness. Id. at \u00b6 98. There, we held: <em>\u201cAshworth </em>has no applicability here because Monroe did not waive presentation of <em>all </em>mitigating evidence. Given our emphasis in <em>Ashworth </em>on the word \u2018all,\u2019 it is clear that we intended to require an inquiry of a defendant only in those situations where the defendant chooses to present no mitigating evidence whatsoever. Moreover, Monroe\u2019s claim that he essentially presented no mitigating evidence is not borne out by the record. Regardless of how Monroe characterizes it, he did in fact present mitigating evidence.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 74-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">{\u00b6 47} Although <em>Ashworth </em>mandates that the trial court protect the defendant\u2019s rights when the defendant waives all mitigating evidence, a capital defendant generally has the right to control the defense. <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 28-29, 553 N.E.2d 576. A defendant is entitled to \u201cgreat latitude\u201d and may decide what mitigating evidence he wishes to present in the penalty phase. R. C. 2929.04(C); see, also, <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 189, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, citing <em>Lockett v. Ohio </em>(1978), <em>438 U.S. </em>586, 604, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973. Furthermore, this court has long recognized that \u201cthe jury is not restricted to considering mitigating evidence presented in the penalty phase. Rather, the jury is required to consider \u2018any evidence raised at trial that is relevant * * * to any factors in mitigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jordan, </em>101 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Ohio St.3d 216, 2004-Ohio-783, 804 N.E.2d 1, at \u00b6 80, quoting R.C. 2929.03(D)(1). Other capital defendants have chosen to present mitigating evidence only through an unsworn statement asking for the death penalty. See <em>State v. Mink, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 113-114; <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">{\u00b6 48} In this case, we reject Barton\u2019s contention that the facts and circumstances warranted an <em>Ashworth </em>inquiry, because Barton did not waive the presentation of <em>all </em>mitigating evidence. Only waiver of <em>all </em>mitigating evidence triggers the requirement for an <em>Ashworth </em>inquiry. <em>Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 56, 706 N.E.2d 1231, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 49} Here, during the guilt phase of trial, Barton, through counsel, cross-examined several prosecution witnesses' \u2014 Barton's supervisor, his father, his uncle, his uncle\u2019s wife, and his stepdaughter \u2014 and elicited mitigating testimony on his behalf, in contrast with Ashworth, who pleaded guilty. Such factual information concerned Barton\u2019s love of his family \u2014 including Kim \u2014 and his hard-working and nonviolent nature. The testimony also described and characterized his relationships with Jamie and other family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 50} Further distinguishing this case from <em>Ashworth, </em>Barton presented an unsworn statement during the penalty phase of trial in which he told the jury that he \u201cstrongly believe[d]\u201d in the death penalty, that if he were a juror, he would \u201chold out for the death penalty,\u201d and that death is \u201cthe only punishment for this crime.\u201d Barton also explained why he believed the jury should impose the death penalty. Barton\u2019s recognition that this aggravated murder deserved the death penalty reflected his personal acknowledgment of the gravity of his crime. In fact, defense counsel used his statement to strongly urge the jury to impose a life sentence rather than the death sentence that Barton wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 51} Presentation of mitigating evidence during either the guilt phase or the penalty phase of a capital-murder trial relieves the trial court of the duty to conduct an <em>Ashworth </em>inquiry. <em>Ashworth </em>applies only where the record demonstrates a waiver of the presentation of all mitigating evidence in a capital-murder trial. And only a waiver of all mitigating evidence during the guilt phase and the penalty phase of trial triggers the trial court\u2019s duty to inquire as to whether the waiver is knowingly and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">{\u00b6 52} We conclude that the evidence of mitigation presented during the guilt phase of trial as contained in the record, together with Barton\u2019s unsworn statement during the penalty phase of trial and defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, rendered <em>Ashworth </em>inapplicable to this case because Barton did not waive the presentation of all mitigating evidence. Accordingly, this proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\n<em>Competency Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">{\u00b6 53} Next, Barton asserts that the trial court erred in failing to sua sponte order an evaluation of his competency in light of his waiver of mitigation and attempted suicide nine months before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 54} The state counters by arguing that Barton did not waive the presentation of mitigating evidence and did not demonstrate any indicia of incompetence so as to trigger the trial court\u2019s duty to sua sponte order an evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b6 55} We are asked to consider whether Barton\u2019s actions indicated such incompetence that the trial court should have ordered a competency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">{\u00b6 56} R.C. 2945.37(G) creates a rebuttable presumption that a defendant is competent to stand trial. \u201cThis presumption remains valid under R.C. 2945.37(G) unless \u2018after a hearing, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence\u2019 that the defendant is not competent.\u201d <em>State v.

We have further held that the trial court has no duty to question the accused\u2019s competence when \u201c \u2018nobody on the spot thought [the defendant\u2019s] behavior raised any question as to his competence\u2019 \u201d and no evidence of \u201coutrageous, irrational behavior during trial\u201d or complaints about the accused\u2019s lack of cooperation in his defense exists.

In <em>State v. Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, \u00b6 80, we recognized that \u201c[a] court is required to inquire into a capital defendant\u2019s competence <em>only if some reason other than </em>the decision to forgo presentation of mitigation evidence exists that calls into question the defendant\u2019s competence.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>(Emphasis added.) As previously discussed, Barton did not waive the presentation of all mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">{\u00b6 59} Despite his attempted suicide nine months before trial, the record does not contain any specific facts suggesting that Barton lacked competency to stand trial. No evidence in the record indicates that Barton was ever treated or hospitalized for mental disorders or that his friends or family questioned his sanity. Nor did events during the trial indicate any lack of competence. Neither defense counsel nor a retained psychologist who interviewed Barton for several hours raised any issue regarding his competence, and they closely interacted with him and had every opportunity to observe his demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 60} Barton\u2019s decision to limit mitigating evidence and his prior suicide attempt do not constitute sufficient indicia to trigger the trial court\u2019s duty to sua sponte order evaluation of his competence. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\n<em>Unsworn Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">{\u00b6 61} Barton contends that the trial court denied his constitutional right to counsel by overruling the pretrial motion to use a question-and-answer format to present an unsworn statement. See <em>Ferguson v. Georgia </em>(1961), 365 U.S. 570, 596, 81 S.Ct. 756, 5 L.Ed.2d 783. In <em>Ferguson, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the state, \u201cconsistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, could not * * * deny [the defendant] the right to have his counsel question him to elicit his [unsworn] statement.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">{\u00b6 62} The state maintains that Barton has misinterpreted decisions of this court and the United States Supreme Court and asserts that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to present mitigating evidence in this format.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">{\u00b6 63} The issue for our resolution, then, concerns whether the trial court\u2019s decision regarding the format of Barton\u2019s unsworn statement deprived him of his constitutional right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">{\u00b6 64} In <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 103, we squarely addressed this issue and held: \u201c[T]he trial court did not violate [the defendant\u2019s] constitutional rights by denying his request\u201d to use a question-and-answer format in making an unsworn statement. While stating that the trial court has the discretion to allow counsel to ask questions in presenting an unsworn statement, we held that neither R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) nor the Constitution compels such a practice. Id. at \u00b6 103, 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">{\u00b6 65} Furthermore, <em>Ferguson </em>arose in the entirely different context of \u201cthe common-law rule [codified in Georgia] that a person charged with a criminal offense is incompetent to testify under oath in his own behalf at his trial.\u201d Id., 365 U.S. at 570, 81 S.Ct. 756, 5 L.Ed.2d 783. The defendant in <em>Ferguson </em>had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>constitutional right to the assistance of counsel to present his view of events in an unsworn statement because, pursuant to Georgia law, he could not testify at all under oath. Id. at 596, 81 S.Ct. 756, 5 L.Ed.2d 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">{\u00b6 66} In contrast, Barton could have chosen to testify under oath with the assistance of counsel either at the guilt phase or the penalty phase of trial. Thus, <em>Ferguson </em>does not apply to this case. Additionally, we have declined to adopt a constitutional right to a question-and-answer format in other cases. See <em>Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 67} Although rejecting the merits of his position on legal grounds, we also note that Barton failed to preserve the issue for appellate review because he failed to renew his objection to the format of his unsworn statement at trial and neglected to proffer the evidence he wished to present in the question-and-answer format. See <em>Gable v. Gates Mills, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 449, 2004-Ohio-5719, 816 N.E.2d 1049, \u00b6 34; <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 532, 747 N.E.2d 765; Evid.R. 103(A)(2); <em>State v. Mitts </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 223, 227, 690 N.E.2d 522; <em>State v. Gilmore </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 190, 191, 28 OBR 278, 503 N.E.2d 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 68} For the foregoing reasons, this proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\n<em>Indictment for Weapons Under Disability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">{\u00b6 69} In his final proposition, Barton contends that the grand jury did not properly indict him for the offense of having a weapon while under a disability pursuant to R.C. 2923.13(B) because Ohio\u2019s first- and second-degree felonies are not so identified in Kentucky. R.C. 2923.13(B) increases the offense level for committing this crime when the offender was released from prison within five years of the offense. Barton pleaded guilty to R.C. 2923.13(B). According to Barton, his guilty plea does not waive the issue because a jurisdictional defect such as this may be raised at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">{\u00b6 70} The state disputes the merits of his allegation and asserts that Barton\u2019s guilty plea precludes him from attacking the sufficiency of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">{\u00b6 71} The indictment charged that Barton violated R.C. 2923.13(A) because he (1) did \u201cknowingly acquire, have, carry, or use\u201d a firearm on January 16, 2003, in Warren County, Ohio, and (2) did so, having \u201cbeen convicted of [a] felony offense of violence: to wit: Attempted Murder\u201d in Kentucky in June 1991. The indictment also charged the more serious offense of violating R.C. 2923.13(B)\u2014 namely, that Barton had the firearm \u201cwithin five years of the date of [his] release from imprisonment\u201d for attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">{\u00b6 72} Contrary to Barton\u2019s claims, the indictment correctly referred to both R.C. 2923.13(A) and 2923.13(B) because division (A) sets forth the basic offense, and division (B) adds elements of a more serious offense. See R.C. 2923.13(B) and 2923.13(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>{\u00b6 73} Having rejected the merits of this argument, we also agree with the state that Barton waived any deficiency in the indictment by failing to object to the indictment and by pleading guilty to the offense. Crim.R. 12(C)(2) mandates that \u201cDefenses and objections based on defects in the indictment\u201d must generally be raised \u201c[p]rior to\u201d trial, and we have previously held that \u201cfailure to timely object to the allegedly defective indictment constitutes a waiver of the issues involved.\u201d <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 436, 678 N.E.2d 891, citing <em>State v. Joseph </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 450, 455, 653 N.E.2d 285. Crim.R. 11(B)(1) states, \u201cThe plea of guilty is a complete admission of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqDX\">{\u00b6 74} Based on the foregoing analysis, the language of the statute, Barton\u2019s failure to timely object to the indictment, and his plea of guilty, this proposition is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\n<em>Independent Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 75} Pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), the penalty for a conviction of aggravated murder can include death when the evidence reveals a previous conviction \u201cof an offense an essential element of which was the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill another.\u201d The record demonstrates Barton\u2019s prior conviction for attempted murder in Kentucky beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b676} Regarding mitigation, the nature and circumstances-of the instant offense reveal no mitigating features. Evidence demonstrates that Barton planned to kill Kim on the day of the murder. After Barton repeatedly telephoned her that day, Kim and her 17-year-old daughter, Jamie, returned to Barton\u2019s home to retrieve their personal belongings. Upon their arrival, Barton told Larry to close the gate behind Kim\u2019s car to prevent the police from coming onto the property, and he thereafter immediately backed his truck into the garage, retrieved a shotgun, ran toward Kim, and shot her twice, with the fatal shotgun blast discharged into her back while he was less than two feet from her body. Kim died there in the arms of her daughter, Jamie. The nature and circumstances of this offense reveal no mitigating features.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 77} Further, although Barton chose not to present any mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of trial, he did make an unsworn statement to the jury in which he recognized the gravity of his conduct. Beyond that, we know about his history, character, and background from defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses during the state\u2019s case-in-chief. Larry, Donald, Jamie, and Barton\u2019s uncle, father, and stepdaughter testified that they loved and cared for him. The love and support of his family carry mitigating weight. See <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 199. The record also reflects that at the time of the offense, Barton had had gainful employment for about a year and worked hard at his job. We therefore accord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>some mitigating weight to his employment. Cf. <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 194, 631 N.E.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">{\u00b6 78} The record does not contain evidence to support the statutory mitigating factors in R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) through (B)(6). For example, Kim did not induce or facilitate the offense, R.C. 2929.04(B)(1), by returning to her residence to retrieve her clothing, although Barton argued at trial that by doing so, she facilitated her own murder. Nor did Barton act under \u201cduress, coercion, or strong provocation,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(2). No evidence at trial established that Barton suffered from an R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) \u201cmental disease or defect.\u201d Barton, age 46 at the time of the offense, cannot assert that the offense occurred as result of his youth. See R.C. 2929.04(B)(4). Barton has a criminal record, which renders R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) inapplicable. And he cannot claim accomplice status under R.C. 2929.04(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 79} As to \u201cother factors,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), Barton accepted responsibility in his unsworn statement for what he had done. In that statement, he acknowledged that he had committed a \u201cruthless, cold-blooded act\u201d that warranted the death penalty and noted that if he were on the jury, he would hold out for the death penalty. Thus, Barton did not attempt to minimize his conduct or blame others, but acknowledged the severity of what he had done. We recognize that he offered his unsworn statement in mitigation. Cf. <em>State v. Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 56, 72, 706 N.E.2d 1231 (\u201cwillingness to step forward and take responsibility for his actions, without any offer of leniency by the state, indicates a person who is remorseful for the crimes he has committed\u201d). Remorse is a mitigating factor. <em>State v. O\u2019Neal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d-402, 420-421, 721 N.E.2d 73; <em>State v. Mitts </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 223, 236, 690 N.E.2d 522. In accepting responsibility for his conduct, Barton indicated his remorse to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 80} Other than his unsworn statement and the evidence elicited from the cross-examination of his family members during the guilt phase of trial, no evidence of any other mitigating factors exists in the record of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 81} In accordance with our duty pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A) to \u201creview and independently weigh all of the facts and other evidence disclosed in the record in the case and consider the offense and the offender to determine whether the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors in the case, and whether the sentence of death is appropriate,\u201d we have concluded that the aggravating circumstance of Barton\u2019s aggravated murder of Kim with prior calculation and design, together with his prior conviction for attempted murder, outweighs the mitigating factors in this case. We have further concluded that the sentence of death is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 82} We are further required by R.C. 2929.05(A) to consider whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Upon review, we have concluded that the death penalty is not disproportionate in this case when compared with other convictions for aggravated murder involving a previous conviction for attempted murder or purposeful killing. See, e.g., <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 676 N.E.2d 82; <em>State v. Davis </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 44, 584 N.E.2d 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 83} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b504-7\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A5Me\">Resnick, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b504-8\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b504-9\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-17\">.

Ashworth </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 706 N.E.2d 1231, we held, \u201c[W]hen a defendant wished to waive the presentation of <em>all </em>mitigating evidence, a trial court must conduct an inquiry of the defendant on the record to determine whether the waiver is knowing and voluntary.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. Although this court stopped short of requiring a competency hearing in every case in which a defendant chooses to waive mitigation evidence, we did hold, \u201cA trial court should be cognizant of actions on the part of the defendant that would call into question the defendant\u2019s competence.\u201d Id. at 62, 706 N.E.2d 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">{\u00b6 86} Barton told the jury that if given the opportunity, he would vote to impose the death penalty and that the death sentence is \u201cthe only punishment for this crime.\u201d It is difficult to imagine more compelling indicia of incompetence. Yet through inverse logic, the majority holds that by stating to the jurors his feelings on the death penalty and its appropriateness for the crime that he, Barton, committed, he actually did present mitigating evidence. I cannot support this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">{\u00b6 87} The majority cites three cases suggesting that they are analogous and that this court\u2019s disposition of Barton\u2019s argument is in line with precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-15\">{\u00b6 88} In the first case relied upon by the majority, we specifically held that an <em>Ashworth </em>hearing was not required because defendant \u201cMonroe did not waive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>presentation of mitigating evidence. Monroe called a former neighbor to testify in his behalf * * <em>State v. Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, \u00b6 98. The addition of witness testimony to his unsworn statement removes <em>Monroe </em>from the <em>Ashworth </em>requirements. We have never held that a defendant must present all possible mitigation evidence. Here, though, Barton\u2019s sole evidence was his statement requesting the death penalty. There is no other \u201cmitigating\u201d evidence. The facts of Barton are clearly distinguishable from <em>Monroe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 89} The majority cites two other cases in which this court has allowed capital defendants to limit mitigating evidence to an unsworn statement. Yet in both cases, the trial court judge first conducted an in-depth hearing to determine that the defendant was competent to waive mitigation. In <em>State v. Mink, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, the defendant argued that his waiver was entitled to greater scrutiny because he had actively sought the death penalty. Id. at \u00b6 56. In rejecting that argument and affirming his death sentence, we noted that \u201cprior to the penalty phase, the three-judge panel thoroughly questioned Mink before finding that he was competent to waive the presentation of mitigating evidence.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 60. Later, in rejecting his claim that his plea was not voluntarily and knowingly made, we observed, \u201cBefore finding that Mink was competent to waive mitigation and allowing him to waive the presentation of mitigating evidence, the trial court fully questioned Mink about mitigation during the <em>Ashworth </em>hearing.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 90} Similarly, in <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 36, upon a jury verdict of guilty on all counts, the defendant filed a motion requesting that no mitigating evidence be presented other than his own statement. \u201cThe court then ordered [the defendant] examined by psychiatrist Dr. Robert Algaier to determine whether he was competent to waive presentation of mitigation evidence. * * * Dr. Algaier found him capable of \u2018waiving mitigation with full understanding of possible outcome and implications.\u2019 Prior to the mitigation hearing, the trial court tried several times to persuade appellant to change his mind; he declared, T don\u2019t wish my attorneys to say anything.\u2019 Subsequently, appellant presented only a short unsworn statement at the mitigation hearing.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 36-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 91} In both of these cases, this court approved the death sentence after determining that the trial court judge had properly- conducted a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 92} As I stated in my concurrence in <em>Ashworth, </em>\u201cA court must determine that the defendant has the mental capacity to understand the choice between life and death, to make a knowing and intelligent decision not to pursue the presentation of evidence, and to fully comprehend the ramifications of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>decision, and possess the ability to reason logically.\u201d Id., 85 Ohio St.3d at 74, 706 N.E.2d 1231 (Moyer, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 93} I do not know whether Barton was competent to waive the presentation of mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of the trial. I do not know whether he understood the ramifications of his statements to the jury suggesting that he deserved the death penalty. On the record before us, no one can be certain of Barton\u2019s competence when he urged the jury to sentence him to death. At a minimum, the trial court should have followed our precedent and conducted a colloquy with Barton to determine whether he was competent, whether he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to present evidence, and whether he understood the ramifications of his actions. To enable the trial court to make an adequate competency determination and to preserve the record for this court to review, the trial court should conduct a competency evaluation any time a capital defendant wishes to waive the presentation of all mitigation evidence or requests imposition of the death penalty. Such a rule would greatly diminish the appellate review of an issue that should be resolved with certainty at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 94} For the foregoing reasons, Barton\u2019s death sentence should be reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for a competency hearing to determine whether Barton is indeed competent to waive mitigation evidence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-7\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b506-8\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayh\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">{\u00b6 95} The majority so distinguishes <em>State v. Ashworth </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 706 N.E.2d 1231, as to render it meaningless. Its opinion essentially says that any testimony that could possibly be construed as mitigating, even if given during the guilt phase, will be construed as if it had been offered in mitigation by the defendant. The syllabus law declares that any testimony that reflects positively on the defendant \u2014 even a single, stray statement not elicited by counsel \u2014 could be sufficient to deny that defendant an <em>Ashworth </em>hearing. This standard is so restrictive that it ought not to be countenanced. Indeed, Ashworth would not pass this new standard because Ashworth expressed remorse. Id. at 61, 706 N.E.2d 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">{\u00b6 96} In an unsworn statement, Barton told the jury that death is \u201cthe only punishment for this crime.\u201d Our country\u2019s most creative writers of fiction would be hard-pressed to spin Barton\u2019s statement as evidence offered in mitigation. Yet a majority of this court unquestioningly accepts that it was. The majority\u2019s conclusion is in sharp contrast to its analysis in <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 77, in which this court stated that Vrabel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u201cpresented no mitigating evidence,\u201d even though he had offered his unsworn statement.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ay4\">Rachel Hutzel, Warren County Prosecuting Attorney, Andrew L. Sievers, and Derek B. Faulkner, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Abt\">Christopher J. Pagan and Chris McEvilley, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">{\u00b6 97} Finally, I do not believe that the facts of this case justify imposing a sentence of death. The murder that Barton committed was heinous, and his guilt is undeniable, but Barton\u2019s crime is not deathworthy. See Crocker, Concepts of Culpability and Deathworthiness: Differentiating Between Guilt and Punishment in Death Penalty Cases (1997), 66 Fordham L.Rev. 21. This case involves a hotblooded domestic killing. Absent evidence that Barton\u2019s previous attempted murder occurred in similar circumstances \u2014 evidence not present here \u2014 upon independent weighing, I do not believe that the death penalty is appropriate. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
