Effective September 29, 2005, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 66 (\u201cH.B. 66\u201d), the biennial budget bill for 2006-2007, amended R.C. 1901.31(A)(1)(a) by making the Clerk of Courts of the Medina Municipal Court an elected position. Pursuant to this amendment, respondent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Medina County Board of Elections, will conduct a May 2, 2006 primary election and a November 7, 2006 general election for the municipal clerk position. The appointed clerk of courts earns $75,743.02 in salary and benefits. The elected clerk of courts will earn $106,267.85 in salary and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">{\u00b6 3} On February 13, 2006, approximately four and one-half months after the amendment to R.C. 1901.31 became effective, relator, Mark Kuhar, a registered voter and taxpayer in Medina, filed this expedited election action. Kuhar seeks a writ of mandamus \u201cinstructing [the board of elections] not to conduct elections in accordance with [R.C.] 1901.31 as amended by Amended Substitute House Bill 66 because said section was amended in violation of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d On February 24, 2006, the board of elections filed an answer to the complaint. On February 28, 2006, we granted the motion of Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro to intervene as a respondent. The parties filed evidence and briefs pursuant to the schedule delineated for expedited election cases in S.Ct.Prac.R. X(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">{\u00b6 4} This cause is now before us for a decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">{\u00b6 5} Kuhar requests a writ of mandamus to prevent the board of elections from conducting primary and general elections for municipal court clerk based on his claim that H.B. 66 violates the one-subject rule of Section 15(D), Article II of the Ohio Constitution, which provides, \u201cNo bill shall contain more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c \u2018In general, if the allegations of a complaint for a writ of mandamus indicate that the real objects sought are a declaratory judgment and a prohibitory injunction, the complaint does not state a cause of action in mandamus and must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Mackey v. Blackwell, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-4789, 834 N.E.2d 346, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>State ex rel. Grendell v. Davidson </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 629, 634, 716 N.E.2d 704.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">{\u00b6 7} We have applied this general rule in expedited election cases. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. McCord v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 346, 2005-Ohio-4758, 835 N.E.2d 336, \u00b6 24-26. Under this rule, \u201cwe must examine [Kuhar\u2019s] complaint \u2018to see whether it actually seeks to prevent, rather than to compel, official action.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Cunningham v. Amer Cunningham Co., L.P.A. </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 323, 324, 762 N.E.2d 1012, quoting <em>State ex rel. Stamps v. Montgomery Cty. Automatic Data Processing Bd. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 164, 166, 538 N.E.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">{\u00b6 8} In his merit briefs, Kuhar expressly requests (1) that the court \u201cfind that R.C. 1901.31 was amended in violation of the Ohio Constitution\u201d and (2) that the court order the elections board \u201cnot to engage in the illegal elections scheduled for May 2, 2006 and November 7, 2006.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Consequently, after examining Kuhar\u2019s complaint and briefs, we note that he actually seeks (1) a declaratory judgment that H.B. 66 is unconstitutional and (2) a prohibitory injunction preventing the elections board from conducting primary and general elections for municipal court clerk based on H.B. 66. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Youngstown v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 69, 70-71, 647 N.E.2d 769 (\u201cThe essence of relators\u2019 request for mandamus relief is injunctive, <em>i.e., </em>to enjoin respondents from holding any election for city council\u201d for two years).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">{\u00b6 10} Admittedly, we have occasionally permitted mandamus actions to test the constitutionality of legislation in expedited election cases. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Watson v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 239, 242, 725 N.E.2d 255 (\u201cIt is appropriate to consider the merits of Watson\u2019s constitutional claim in this mandamus action because an action for a declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction would not be sufficiently speedy in this expedited election case\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Purdy v. Clermont Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 338, 342, 673 N.E.2d 1351 (\u201cgiven the fact that relators are seeking to have their petitions certified and names placed on the ballots for the upcoming November election, the alternative remedy would not be adequate\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Hinkle v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 145, 147, 580 N.E.2d 767 (mandamus allowed to compel placement of local option questions on election ballot); <em>State ex rel. Brown v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 166, 545 N.E.2d 1256 (mandamus denied to place name of city-council candidate on election ballot).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">{\u00b6 11} But these cases are easily distinguishable because they involved relators seeking to <em>compel </em>the certification of candidates or issues for placement on election ballots \u2014 relief in the nature of a mandatory injunction \u2014 rather than Kuhar\u2019s ill-disguised claim for a prohibitory injunction to <em>prevent </em>the primary and general elections for municipal court clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">{\u00b6 12} Moreover, any possible limited exception to the general rule prohibiting an extraordinary action in mandamus to challenge the constitutionality of legislation is inapplicable because this is not a \u201crare and extraordinary case\u201d in which the challenged statute operates \u201cdirectly and broadly, to divest courts of judicial power.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 504, 715 N.E.2d 1062. The amendment to R.C. 1901.31 challenged by Kuhar involves only one office in one county. Notably, <em>Sheward </em>included a claim for a writ of prohibition to prevent judges from exercising judicial authority; conversely, there is no prohibition claim here, and indeed, there could not be because the board of elections is not exercising any judicial or quasi-judicial authority in conducting the elections specified by the amended legislation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AHR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Marco, Marco &amp; Bailey, Robert B. Campbell, and Steve C. Bailey, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Avyf\">Dean Holman, Medina County Prosecuting Attorney, and William L. Thorne, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AXQ\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Holly J. Hunt and Frank M. Strigari, Assistant Attorneys General, for intervening respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">{\u00b6 13} Therefore, in accordance with the general rule and in the absence of any possible exception that might warrant departure from that rule, we lack jurisdiction over Kuhar\u2019s claim and must dismiss it. <em>Mackey, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-4789, 834 N.E.2d 346, \u00b6 16; <em>McCord, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 346, 2005-Ohio-4758, 835 N.E.2d 336, \u00b6 26. Like the relators\u2019 claim in another expedited election case, <em>Youngstown, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 70-71, 647 N.E.2d 769, Kuhar\u2019s claim is manifestly for a prohibitory injunction to prevent the board of elections from conducting any election for municipal court clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">{\u00b6 14} Based on the foregoing, we dismiss the cause for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Cause dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b606-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b606-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
