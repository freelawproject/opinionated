Millonig </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 403, 704 N.E.2d 568. On December 5, 2005, respondent was suspended for failure to file a certificate of registration and pay the fee required under Gov.Bar R. VI for the 2005-2007 biennium. 107 Ohio St.3d 1431, 2005-Ohio-6408, 838 N.E.2d 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">{\u00b6 3} On April 18, 2005, relator, Disciplinary Counsel, filed a complaint charging respondent with three counts of professional misconduct. Respondent was served with the complaint at his last known address, but did not answer, and relator moved for default under Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F). A master commissioner appointed by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline granted the motion, making findings of fact and conclusions of law, which the board adopted, as well as a recommendation, which the board modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"AMf\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">{\u00b6 4} During 2003 and 2004, respondent acted as an agent for First American Title Insurance Company. In January 2004, respondent was involved in the closing of a mortgage-refinancing transaction as the agent of First American, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>he was to send a $375,203 check to Countrywide Homes to pay off the homeowners\u2019 first mortgage. He failed to send the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 5} Three months later, an officer from First American met with respondent to discuss his failure to pay off the mortgage. Respondent stated that he had sent $75,000 to Countrywide Homes as a partial payment, but acknowledged that he had misappropriated the balance of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b6 6} An audit by First American revealed that respondent had misappropriated more than $214,000 from his escrow account. Most of the misappropriated funds had been withdrawn from respondent\u2019s Interest on Lawyers\u2019 Trust Accounts (\u201cIOLTA\u201d) account and commingled with funds in his own business checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">{\u00b6 7} The board found that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(3) (barring illegal conduct involving moral turpitude), 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), and 9-102(E)(1) (requiring a lawyer to maintain funds of clients or third persons in certain interest-bearing trust accounts).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">{\u00b6 8} On or before September 1, 2003, respondent was required by the Rules for the Government of the Bar of Ohio to file a certificate of registration and pay a biennial registration fee to practice law in Ohio. He failed to do either.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">{\u00b6 9} The board found that respondent had violated Gov.Bar R. VI(1)(A) (requiring a lawyer to timely file a certificate of registration each biennium).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">\n<em>Count III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">{\u00b6 10} Relator sent respondent multiple letters of inquiry during the investigation of the grievance filed by First American. Respondent sent a one-page response to the third letter admitting that the allegations were \u201csubstantially correct,\u201d but did not provide answers to relator\u2019s inquiries and never filed an answer to relator\u2019s complaint or to the motion for default.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">{\u00b6 11} The board found that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(5) (barring conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and 1-102(A)(6) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring a lawyer to cooperate in an investigation of professional misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">{\u00b6 12} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the board considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). The board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>noted one aggravating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a) \u2014 respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary offense \u2014 and found no mitigating factors.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AYq\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Robert R. Berger, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">{\u00b6 13} Relator recommended that respondent be indefinitely suspended, and the master commissioner agreed with that recommendation. The board, however, recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred for his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 14} We agree that respondent violated all of the provisions cited in the board\u2019s report, and we also agree that permanent disbarment is the appropriate sanction. Respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary violation and his failure to cooperate in the investigation of this latest grievance indicate that he holds little respect for his obligations to the legal profession, and his misappropriation of funds demonstrates that he is not fit to practice law. As- we have said, the \u201cpresumptive disciplinary measure for such acts of misappropriation is disbarment.\u201d <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Moushey, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 427, 2004-Ohio-6897, 819 N.E.2d 1112, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 15} Accordingly, respondent is hereby permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b244-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
