Relying on the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information contained in the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), 110 Stat. 1938, the city of Cincinnati and the Health Commissioner and Assistant Health Commissioner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Cincinnati Health Department declined to release copies of the requested citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">{\u00b6 2} Upon careful review of the record and the Ohio Public Records Act and the privacy provisions of HIPAA, we conclude, first, that the requested lead citations and lead-assessment reports do not contain protected health information as defined by federal law, HIPAA, and are, therefore, subject to disclosure; second, that even if we were to determine that those lead citations and risk-assessment reports contained protected health information and even if we were to determine that the Cincinnati Health Department operated as a covered entity as defined by HIPAA, the requested lead-assessment reports would still be subject to disclosure under the \u201crequired by law\u201d exception to the HIPAA privacy rule because the Ohio Public Records Law, R.C. 149.43, requires disclosure of these reports, and federal law, HIPAA, does not supersede state disclosure requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">{\u00b6 3} Accordingly, for the following reasons, we grant the requested writ of mandamus in favor of the Cincinnati Enquirer and order the release of the requested citations related to lead-contaminated properties in Cincinnati.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">{\u00b6 4} The history of this case reflects that on January 16, 2004, Cincinnati Enquirer reporter Sharon Coolidge requested that the Assistant Health Commissioner of the Cincinnati Health Department, Walter Handy, provide \u201ccopies of the 343 lead citations and any others that were issued between 1994 and the present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">{\u00b6 5} The Cincinnati Health Department, citing Section 1320d et seq., Title 42, U.S.Code, the HIPAA Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (Privacy Rule, Part 160, subparts A and B and Part 164, Title 45, C.F.R.) expressed its inability to accommodate the Enquirer\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">{\u00b6 6} Thereafter, on February 11, 2004, the Enquirer filed a mandamus action in the Hamilton County Court of Appeals, seeking to compel the health commissioner and assistant health commissioner to make the requested records available for inspection and copying in accordance with R.C. 149.43, the Ohio Public Records Act. On December 30, 2004, the court of appeals denied the writ, reasoning that although \u201cthe lead-investigation reports are public records generated as a result of the health department\u2019s mission in the community,\u201d appellees had established \u201can exception to disclosure because of the reference to blood test results for children currently residing at particular addresses.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Adcock, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-040064, 2004-Ohio-7130, 2004 WL 3015324, at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">{\u00b6 7} This cause is now before the court upon the Enquirer\u2019s appeal as of right. Before our consideration of the matter, however, we referred this case to mediation. Thereafter, the health department released 170 of the lead citations that had been issued to property owners of other than single-family residences. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>In reliance on HIPAA, however, the health department still maintains its inability to provide access to unredacted copies of the remaining 173 lead citations issued to owners of single-family residential property.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">{\u00b6 8} We begin our review by examining the law with respect to disclosure of public records. The state of Ohio has a long-standing public policy committed to open public records, as expressed in R.C. 149.43, and the Supreme Court of Ohio has consistently enforced that policy in its decisions in connection with requests pursuant to that statute. In <em>State ex rel. Miami Student v. Miami Univ. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 168, 170, 680 N.E.2d 956, we stated, \u201cThe Ohio Public Records Act is intended to be liberally construed \u2018to ensure that governmental records be open and made available to the public * * * subject to only a few very limited and narrow exceptions.\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Williams v. Cleveland </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 544, 549, 597 N.E.2d 147, 151. R.C. 149.43 therefore provides for full access to all public records upon request unless the requested records fall within one of the specific exceptions listed in the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">{\u00b6 9} The Cincinnati Enquirer asserts its entitlement to the lead citations pursuant to R.C. 149.43 on the basis that they constitute public records, not exempt from disclosure, and that HIPAA\u2019s privacy rule does not apply to the citations issued by the Cincinnati Health Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">{\u00b6 10} Contrariwise, respondents contend that HIPAA\u2019s privacy rule permits the health department to withhold the citations from public release because it is a covered entity subject to HIPAA and therefore cannot release records that contain individually identifiable health information.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Public Records v. HIPAA</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">{\u00b6 11} For the first time, we address the conflict-of-laws poser where a state public-records law, here R.C. 149.43, requires disclosure of a public record, while federal law, HIPAA and its privacy rule, specifically prohibits disclosure of protected health information.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">{\u00b6 12} We begin by reviewing R.C. 149.43(B)(1), which specifies: \u201c[A]ll public records shall be promptly prepared and made available for inspection to any person at all reasonable times during regular business hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">{\u00b6 13} In accordance with this mandate, the Enquirer seeks to obtain copies of the lead citations at issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, our first concern is to define the scope of the information the Enquirer seeks from the Cincinnati Health Department. The record here contains Exhibit C, consisting of the notices and a copy of a multipage form utilized by the department to notify property owners of the results of the lead-assessment investigations conducted at various dwelling units throughout the city of Cincinnati. Only one sentence in the 14-page narrative has any reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>medical information or medical conditions. That one sentence contained in the notice to the property owner states in its entirety: \u201cThis unit has been reported to our department as the residence of a child whose blood test indicates an elevated lead level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">{\u00b6 15} Section 160.103, Title 45, C.F.R. defines \u201chealth information\u201d to include information created by a public health authority that relates to the past, present, or future physical condition of an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 16} Further, the lead-citation notices issued by the health department reveal that they are intended to advise the owners of real estate about results of department investigations and to apprise them of violations relating to lead hazards; the report identifies existing and potential lead hazards on the exterior and interior of the property, details the tests performed on the property and the results of those tests, explains the abatement measures required, provides advice about options to correct the problem, and mandates reporting of abatement measures, including the name of the abatement contractor, the abatement method, and the date of expected abatement completion. Nothing contained in these reports identifies by name, age, birth date, social security number, telephone number, family information, photograph, or other identifier any specific individual or details any specific medical examination, assessment, diagnosis, or treatment of any medical condition. There is a mere nondescript reference to \u201ca\u201d child with \u201can\u201d elevated lead level.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 17} Thus, the facts here are in sharp contrast with those in our decision in <em>State ex rel. McCleary v. Roberts </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 365, 725 N.E.2d 1144, for example, where the city database at issue contained specific identifiable information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, family information, photographs, and medical information of children, that we determined was exempt from public disclosure; we held there that the information did not constitute a public record because it did not document the operation of an office. Here, while we concern ourselves with the question of whether the lead citations contain \u201cprotected health information,\u201d and therefore face a different issue from that confronted in <em>McCleary, </em>we nonetheless recognize that none of the specific identifiable information referred to in <em>McCleary </em>is part of the information contained in the lead-citation notices or risk-assessment reports prepared by the health department and requested by the Enquirer in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">{\u00b6 18} The prohibition against disclosure contained in the HIPAA privacy rule refers to the release of otherwise protected health information. It provides: \u201cA covered entity may not use or disclose protected health information, except as permitted or required by this subpart or by subpart C of part 160 of this subchapter.\u201d Section 164.502(a), Title 45, C.F.R. After careful review of the record, we have concluded that the lead-risk-assessment reports and the lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>citations do not contain protected health information and therefore are subject to release, as they are not protected by the HIPAA privacy rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">{\u00b6 19} However, even if the records did contain protected health information, they would still be subject to release in accordance with the \u201crequired by law\u201d exception to HIPAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">{\u00b6 20} HIPAA contains definitions with respect to classification of entities as either performing operations that are covered by its provisions or performing hybrid operations, some of which may not be covered by its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">{\u00b6 21} The Cincinnati Health Department urges in this regard that pursuant to Section 160.103, Title 45, C.F.R., it is a covered entity as defined by HIPAA and as such may not use or disclose protected health information except as provided for in HIPAA. The Enquirer claims, on the other hand, that the Cincinnati Health Department is a \u201chybrid entity\u201d as that term is defined in Section 164.103, Title 45, C.F.R., i.e., an entity whose business actions include both covered and noncovered functions as defined by HIPAA. Section 164.502(a) refers to a \u201ccovered entity\u201d and provides that it \u201cmay not use or disclose protected health information,\u201d except as permitted or required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">{\u00b6 22} This analysis, however, becomes relevant only if we conclude that the health department is a hybrid entity performing a noncovered action. Assuming for the sake of argument that the health department is a covered entity as it claims, the next part of our analysis requires us to review the claim of the director of health that the information contained in the lead-citation notices constitutes \u201cprotected health information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">{\u00b6 23} Specifically, Section 164.514(a), Title 45, C.F.R. provides: \u201cHealth information that does not identify an individual and with respect to which there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual is not individually identifiable health information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">{\u00b6 24} The department contends that the single sentence contained in its notice of citation regarding the residence of a child with an elevated blood lead level constitutes a \u201creasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual\u201d and therefore that the citations are not subject to disclosure. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">{\u00b6 25} A review of HIPAA reveals a \u201crequired by law\u201d exception to the prohibition against disclosure of protected health information. With respect to this position, Section 164.512(a)(1), Title 45, C.F.R. provides, \u201cA covered entity may * * * disclose protected health information to the extent that such * * * disclosure is <em>required by law </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) And the Ohio Public Records Act requires disclosure of records unless the disclosure or release is prohibited by federal law. R.C. 149.43(a)(l)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Hence, we are confronted here with a problem of circular reference because the Ohio Public Records Act requires disclosure of information unless prohibited by federal law, while federal law allows disclosure of protected health information if required by state law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">{\u00b6 27} Our research reveals that at the time of implementing these regulations, the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Secretary, promulgated Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (2000), 65 F.R. 82462, 82667-82668, stating, \u201c[W]fe intend [160.512(a) ] to preserve access to information considered important enough by state or federal authorities to require its disclosure by law\u201d; \u201cwe do not believe that Congress intended to preempt each such law\u201d; and \u201c[t]he rule\u2019s approach is simply intended to avoid any obstruction to the health plan or covered health care provider\u2019s ability to comply with its existing legal obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">{\u00b6 28} Similarly, in reviewing federal Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) requests,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the secretary explains that federal FOIA requests \u201ccome within \u00a7 164.512(a) of the privacy regulation that <em>permits uses or disclosures required by law if the uses or disclosures meet the relevant requirements of the law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 65 F.R. 82462, 82482. By analogy, an entity like the Cincinnati Health Department, faced with an Ohio Public Records Act request, need determine only whether the requested disclosure is required by Ohio law to avoid violating HIPAA\u2019s privacy rule. See, also, Tex.Atty.Gen.Op. 681 (2004) 7, which reached the same conclusion under Texas law; cf. <em>Ohio Legal Rights Serv. v. Buckeye Ranch, Inc. </em>(S.D.Ohio 2005), 365 F.Supp.2d 877, where the court concluded that HIPAA\u2019s \u201crequired by law\u201d exception allowed the Ohio Legal Rights Service to access documents relating to the treatment of a mentally ill child pursuant to Ohio law (R.C. 5123.60) giving the Service \u201cready access\u201d to those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">{\u00b6 29} The Enquirer seeks the lead citations by way of mandamus. This court, in <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Akron, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 399, 2004-Ohio-6557, 819 N.E.2d 1087, \u00b623, stated, \u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to seek compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>court has also explained, in <em>Gilbert v. Summit Cty., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 660, 2004Ohio-7108, 821 N.E.2d 564, \u00b6 7, quoting <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Hamilton Cty. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 374, 376, 662 N.E.2d 334, that the Ohio Public Records Act \u201c \u2018is construed liberally in favor of broad access, and any doubt is resolved in favor of disclosure of public records.\u2019 \u201d Finally, in <em>State ex rel. Fenley v. Ohio Historical Soc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 509, 510, 597 N.E.2d 120, we observed that a writ of mandamus will issue in a public-records case where the relator is \u201centitled to respondents\u2019 performance of a clear legal duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">{\u00b6 30} Because Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act requires that public records be \u201cmade available\u201d and because the information contained in the lead-hazard reports does not constitute \u201chealth information\u201d as defined in HIPAA, and because we have concluded that even if the reports contained protected health information, they would still be subject to disclosure pursuant to the \u201crequired by law\u201d exception to the HIPAA privacy rule, the Cincinnati Health Department and its commissioners have a clear legal duty to make the lead citations available to the Enquirer.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 31} The Enquirer also requests an award of its attorney fees. As the court held in its syllabus in <em>State ex rel. Fox v. Cuyahoga Cty. Hosp. Sys. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 108, 529 N.E.2d 443, \u201cThe award of attorney fees under R.C. 149.43(C) is not mandatory.\u201d We detailed the standard in <em>State ex rel. Wadd v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 50, 54, 689 N.E.2d 25: \u201cIn granting or denying attorney fees under R.C. 149.43(C), courts consider the reasonableness of the government\u2019s failure to comply with the public records request and the degree to which the public will benefit from release of the records in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">{\u00b6 32} As the parties agreed during oral argument, this is a case of first impression involving disclosure pursuant to the public-records act of the lead citations held as records of a municipal health department and the privacy rule of HIPAA pursuant to applicable provisions of federal law. The health department here reasonably relied on HIPAA in professing its inability to release the requested records. As we stated in <em>State ex rel. Olander v. French </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 176, 179, 680 N.E.2d 962, \u201ccourts should not be in the practice of punishing parties for taking a rational stance on an unsettled legal issue.\u201d See, also, <em>Wadd, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 55, 689 N.E.2d 25, in which we also denied a request for attorney fees by a prevailing party in a public-records mandamus action that raised issues of first impression. In accordance with our earlier precedent and our consideration of the issues presented here, we decline to award attorney fees in this case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Axe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Graydon, Head &amp; Ritchey, L.L.P., John C.

Nestor, Office of the Cincinnati City Solicitor, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b614-3\">Attorneys</p>\n<p id=\"A8m\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">{\u00b6 33} Based on the foregoing, we conclude that lead-risk-assessment reports maintained by the Cincinnati Health Department and lead-citation notices issued to property owners of units reported to be the residence of children whose blood-test results indicate elevated lead levels do not contain \u201cprotected health information\u201d as that term is defined by HIPAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 34} Further, even if the requested lead citations and lead-risk-assessment reports did contain \u201cprotected health information\u201d as defined by HIPAA, and even if the Cincinnati Health Department operated as a \u201ccovered entity\u201d pursuant to HIPAA, the citation notices and lead-risk-assessment reports would still be subject to release under the \u201crequired by law\u201d exception to the HIPAA privacy rule because the Ohio Public Records Law requires disclosure of these reports, and HIPAA does not supersede state disclosure requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 35} Finally, a request for attorney fees made by a prevailing party in a public-records mandamus action will be denied where the case presents a matter of first impression because courts should not engage in the practice of punishing a party to a lawsuit for taking a rational position on a justiciable, unsettled legal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 36} Accordingly, the judgment of the appellate court is reversed, the writ of mandamus is granted, the respondents are ordered to release the requested records, and the request for attorney fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b614-9\">Moyer, C.J., Grady, Lundberg Stratton and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b614-10\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b614-11\">Thomas J.
