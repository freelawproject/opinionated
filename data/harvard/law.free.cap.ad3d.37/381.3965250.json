Several of the respondents did not receive the papers by the prescribed time. Therefore, the petitioners failed to comply with the order to show cause <em>(see Matter of McGreevy v Simon, </em>220 AD2d 713 [1995]; <em>Matter of Bell v State Univ. of N.Y. at Stony Brook, </em>185 AD2d 925 [1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">In light of our determination, we need not reach the petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions.
