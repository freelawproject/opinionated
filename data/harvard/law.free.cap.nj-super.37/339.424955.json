J. Super. 596 (Ch. Div. </em>1955). In the course of that opinion (35 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>600) it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">\u201cIt is even more conceivable, having in mind the discrepancy in their ages, that the testator and the scrivener of the will never considered that Albert R. McAllister would predecease said testator, and that they therefore saw no reason to provide for a substitution should such an event occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">This sentence we find to be unnecessary to the decision. In fact the clause in the will appointing Albert R. McAllister executor was made expressly conditional: \u201c(if he be living)/\u2019 and \u201cin the event of his prior decease,\u201d Albert R. McAllister, Jr., was appointed in his stead, all as noticed in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Except in this respect, we are in accord with Judge Haneman\u2019s opinion and affirm the judgment below for the reasons therein expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
