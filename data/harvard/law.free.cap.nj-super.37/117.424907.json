Cottrell, trading as The Cottrell-Anderson Pontiac Co., sold Wayne Blodgett a car pursuant to a conditional sales contract which stated that the sale was made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">\u201cFor a Total Time Price * * * $1644.90</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">Computed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">1.

The car was repossessed by the defendant, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the assignee of the contract, which resold it at a private sale. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>46:32-25 by its terms requires a \u201cpublic auction,\u201d not a private sale, where \u201cat least fifty per cent of the purchase price at the time of retaking\u201d has been paid for the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-24\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim is that because the car was sold at a private sale contrary to the terms of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>46 :32-25, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>defendant became liable under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>46:32-31 for damages and in no event for less than one-fourth of all payments made under the contract. Mr. Blodgett assigned this claim to plaintiff, and plaintiff brought the present action to recover on it. Whether such a claim, created by <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>46:32-32, is assignable, has not been argued, and we therefore do not deal with the point. See <em>Van Pelt v. Schauble, </em>68 <em>N. J. L. </em>638, 640 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1903); <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:25-l; <em>East Orange Lumber Co. v. Feiganspan, </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>410 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1938), affirmed 124 <em>N. J. L. </em>127 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Defendants secured summary judgment below. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The question here is whether Blodgett had paid \u201cfifty per cent of the <em>purchase price\u201d (N. J. 8. A. </em>46 :32-25). The two payments of $55.55, added to the down payment of $645 (the $645 item was in fact an allowance given to Mr. Blodgett on the trade-in of his old car), total $756.10. This is more than 50% of the \u201ccash sale delivered price\u201d of $1,445, but less than 50% of the \u201ctotal time price\u201d of $1,644.90. Which is the \u201cpurchase price\u201d within the intendment of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>46 :32-25 ? Plaintiff\u2019s contention is that the finance charges and cost of insurance are not part of the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">It might be observed, in passing, that if the two payments of $55.55 are each applicable first to finance and insurance charges due at the time of these payments (see <em>Long v. Republic Varnish Enamel, etc., Co., </em>115 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>212, 216 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933) and <em>Morland Mortgage Co. v. Mt. Lebanon Cemetery Ass\u2019n, </em>18 <em>N. J. Super. </em>78, 81 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952)), the balance of those two payments, added to the down payment of $645, may possibly be less than 50% of even the \u201ccash sale delivered price.\u201d It might be noticed, too, that plaintiff wants us to hold that finance and insurance charges are to be excluded from the purchase price; and on the other hand he wants to obtain the benefit of amounts paid on those charges, by having such payments allocated entirely to the cash sale delivered price. However, these points are not raised by counsel, and we do not deal with them since we have no means of knowing from this record what portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>each payment of $55.55 is allocable to such charges, and what portion is allocable to the cash sale delivered price.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">We are satisfied that not infrequently in connection with an installment sale, the word \u201cprice\u201d has reference to the \u201ctime price.\u201d Thus we find it io bo common knowledge that the <em>price </em>of articles bought on the installment plan is more than the price of the same when bought for cash. <em>Lo Bosco v. Resnitzky, </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>495, 496 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1938). We find, too, a statute regulating retail installment contracts, which requires a statement in or accompanying such a contract separately itemizing the \u201ccash price,\u201d the insurance cost to the retailer, the \u201ctime price differential,\u201d etc. V. <em>J. 8. A. </em>17:165-6(&amp;). Two of these ilems are defined in V. <em>J. S. A. </em>17:165-1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">\u201c(f) Cash price means the total amount in dollars at which the seller and buyer agree the seller would transfer unqualified title to the goods, <em>if </em>the transaction were a cash sale instead of <em>a </em>sale under a retail installment contract. [Italics inserted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">\u201c(g) Time price differential means the amount in excess of the cash price of the goods agreed upon by the retail seller and the retail buyer, to be paid by the retail buyer for the privilege of purchasing the goods under the retail installment contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Wo find also a number of authorities in other jurisdictions indicating that the import of the term \u201cpurchase price\u201d on an installment sale is such that it comprises the finance charges. <em>Berman\u2019s Jewelry </em>Store, <em>Inc., v. United States. </em>198 <em>F. 2d </em>675, 677, 33 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1445 <em>(4th Cir., </em>1952); <em>Harper v. Futrell, </em>204 <em>Ark. </em>822, 164 <em>S. W. 2d </em>995, 996, 143 <em>A. L. R. </em>235 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942); <em>Zazzaro v. Colonial Acceptance Corporation, </em>117 <em>Conn. </em>251, 167 <em>A. </em>734 <em>(Sup. Ct. Err. </em>1933); <em>Equitable Credit &amp; Discount Co. v. Geier, </em>342 <em>Pa. </em>445, 21 <em>A. 2d </em>53, 58 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1941); 143 <em>A. L. R. </em>251; <em>cf. </em>91 <em>C. J. S., Usury, </em>\u00a7 18b.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">However, the question whether the time price is to be regarded as the purchase price for all purposes, is of course not before us. Our question is whether it is so to be regarded for the purposes of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46 :32-25. The statute deals with the situation where \u201cthe buj\u2019er has paid at least fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>per cent of the purchase price at the time of retaking.\u201d It would seem fairly clear that the statute has reference here to the price agreed upon by the parties \u2014 the price which the buyer was to pay off on an installment basis. The price agreed upon on the making of this deal \u2014 the price being paid off \u2014 was the time price; the cash sale delivered price was merely stated informationally so as to disclose frankly the extent of the insurance and finance charges. It follows that the statute refers here to the time price. <em>Ellner v. Commercial Credit Corp., </em>136 <em>Misc. </em>398, 240 <em>N. Y. S. </em>832 <em>(City Ct. </em>1930). It may be noted that the <em>Uniform Commercial Code, sec. </em>9-505, applicable in somewhat analogous circumstances, provides for certain relief when <em>\u201c60% </em>of the <em>cash </em>price\u201d has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Since Mr. Blodgett paid less than 50% of the time price, a public auction was not necessary, and plaintiff has no cause of action under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>46:32-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
