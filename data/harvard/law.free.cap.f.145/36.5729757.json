Helmrath. One of the questions involved was whether the importer\u2019s protests answered the requirements of section 14, Customs Administraive Act June 1.0, 1890, c. 407, 26 Stat. 137 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1933], wherein it is provided that the grounds of protest shall be set forth \u201cdistinctly and specifically.\u201d The form of these protests is shown by the following extract from one: \u201cI herwith' protest against the liquidation of my entry of hides and skins, * * * each of which weighs under 12 pounds; and looking to you for the refund of duty on these 99 skins, I remain.\u201d Another question involved was the sufficiency of the evidence introduced in the importer\u2019s behalf. The Board, while expressing a doubt as to the sufficiency of the protests, overruled them on the ground that the evidence did not satisfactorily support the contention made. The circuit court held the protests and the evidence to be sufficient, and sustained the importer's contention, whereupon the United States prosecuted this appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-13\">D. Drank Lloyd, Asst. U. S. Atty.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-14\">Hatch, Keener &amp; Clute (J. Stuart Tompkins, of counsel), for the importer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b48-15\">Before LACOMBE, TOWNSEND, and COXE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b48-16\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"AFr\">The questions in controversy are fully discussed, and are, we think, correctly decided by the Circuit Court. The protest was sufficient, within the decision of U. S. v. Salambier, 170 U. S. 621, 18 Sup. Ct. 771, 42 L. Ed. 1167, and Shaw v. U. S., <em>122 </em>Fed. 443, 58 C. C. A. 425. There can be no question that the collector was sufficiently informed by the protest that the importer claimed free entry for his merchandise as \u201cskins.\u201d On turning to the free list, the collector there found \u201cskins of all kinds\u201d specifically mentioned. He could not have been misled or confused as to.the importer\u2019s position. \u201cHides\u201d are separated from \u201cskins\u201d by weight. If more than 12 pounds in weight, they are known as \u201chides\u201d; if less, they are known as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u201cskins.\u201d The importations in question were handled by weighers who from long experience were able to tell as to the status of most of the skins by handling and examination. In case of doubt as to their being under 12 pounds in weight, the skins were actually weighed, and we are convinced by the proof that no substantial error was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Regarding the protest Exhibit L, Judge Eacombe is of the opinion, assuming that it is correctly stated in the record, that it is too indefinite and uncertain to answer the requirements of the law. In other respects he concurs in the foregoing views.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
