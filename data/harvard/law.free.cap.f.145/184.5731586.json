The only exception upon which this contention is based was reserved under the following circumstances. At the close of the trial the plaintiffs moved that certain evidence he stricken out, which was denied. Thereupon their counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\">\u201cTvow I ask your honor to hold on the cut that as a matter of law it constitutes libel per se upon its face, and the only question for the jury to pass on is the question of damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The request was denied-and exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Manifestly this request contains more than a single proposition. It called upon the court to withdraw from consideration of the jury not only the question as to the character of the publication, hut also as to whether it was directed against plaintiffs, and whether it was justified. Counsel for plaintiffs concedes that the request covers all three propo-. sitions, and the exception to its refusal therefore is unsound. Had the judge charged the request as it was submitted to him it is conceded his doing so would have been reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">It is further contended that the court erred in some instructions as to the degree of care which should be exercised by booking agents and proprietors of plays as to the safety of the place of exhibition. We cannot, however, upon this appeal, inquire into any such questions, because the exceptions relied upon were not taken\u2018until after the jury had retired. Indeed, at the close of the charge, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel said: \u201c1 think your honor has covered our requests, and I have no exceptions.\u2019\u2019 The practice of undertaking to reserve exceptions after the jurv has retired has been condemned bv the Supreme Court in Hickory v. U. S., 151 U. S. 316, 14 Sup. Ct. 334, 38 L. Ed. 170, and by this court in Commercial Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Fulton, 79 Fed. 423, 24 C. C. A. 654. The authority relied upon by plaintiffs in error (Dunlap v. N. R. Co., 130 U. S. 649, 9 Sup. Ct. 647, 32 L. Ed. 1058) is not in point. In that case verdict was directed for the defendant\u2014 practically a nonsuit on all the evidence' \u2014 so that the jury did not retire at all, and an exception reserved before the cause terminated by-discharge of the jury might fairly be considered as being reserved \u201cbefore the jury retired.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Some minor questions are raised as to the admission of testimony, and as to some specific questions to witnesses, but they are of no importance and need not be discussed. The exceptions thereto do not present any error calling for a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
