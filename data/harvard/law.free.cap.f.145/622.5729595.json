A. 5,553, T. D. 24,939, which had affirmed the assessment of duty by the Collector of Customs at the port of New York, on merchandise imported by A. Herzog.-</seealso>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-12\">The opinion of the Board reads in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-13\">HOWELL, General Appraiser. The merchandise in question was returned by the appraiser as \u201clabels -of silk and cotton, .cotton chief value,\u201d and was classified by the collector as dutiable * * * under the provision in Tariff Act July 24, 1897, c. 11, \u00a7 1, Schedule I, par. 320, 30 Stat. 179 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1661], for \u201clabels, for garments or other articles, composed of cotton or other vegetable fiber.\u201d The protestant claims that , the merchandise is properly dutiable * * * under paragraph 322, Schedule I, 30 Stat. 179 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1061], as a manufacture of cotton. * * * It appears from an examination of the samples admitted in evidence that the goods consist of woven strips of colored cotton, about two inches in width, and several yards in length, into which are woven in coarse silk, at intervals varying from 3 to 6 inches, the names of certain shoe companies, together with a word designed to indicate a particular style of shoe, the goods being intended, when properly cut, to be sewn or otherwise attached inside the tops of shoes. It does not clearly appear upon what theory the protestant\u2019s claims are based. The only testimony in the case is that of the importer, who, in addition to proving the samples and admitting that the goods are composed in chief value of cotton, testified that he had handled these goods for two years and that they are sold in the wholesale trade as shoe top facings. If it is contended that these articles have a commercial designation which would exclude them from classification as labels, the evidence is entirely insufficient to sustain such contention. As was said by Judge Lacombe, in charging the jury in Batterson v. Magone (O. O.) 48 Fed. 289: \u201cOf course it is not enough for a party who c-laims that his article is not within the ordinary meaning of the terms of common speech to show that it always has in trade some special name that it. is called by, unless he goes further and shows that in that same trade the general term, which otherwise would cover it, is used exclusively for articles other than the one as to which he claims the special designation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-16\">The burden of proof in such cases is on the importer, and the testimony of a single interested witness is insufficient to establish commercial designation. Neuss v. U. S. (O. C.) 142 Fed. 281. In Re Wolff, G. A. 4.209 (T. D. 20,047), this board, in passing upon woven cotton initials, had the benefit of the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>of manufacturers and dealers in all kinds of labels, and in that case found from the preponderance of the evidence \u201cthat there is no essential difference in the meaning of the term \u2018label\u2019 as used in commerce and in common speech. According to standard lexicographers, the term, so far as it relates to articles of the general character of these in question, includes a slip or tag of paper or other material, bearing the inscription in the form of a word or words, name, monogram, letter, scroll, or trade-mark, indicating the character, origin, owner, or destination of the article to which it is attached.\u201d In our opinion the articles here in question unmistakably belong to that class of goods known as labels; and, as such, being composed in chief value of cotton, are specially provided for in the paragraph in the tariff act under which duty was assessed. The protest is accordingly overruled, and the assessment of duty affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-4\">The foregoing decision was reversed by the circuit court on the ground that the goods were not labels because, not being cut, something more remained to be done to them; also, on the ground that they could not be said to be \u201ccomposed of cotton,\u201d within the meaning of the law, because made in part of silk.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b635-5\">D.
