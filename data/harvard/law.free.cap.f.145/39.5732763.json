The amended bill alleges that (he defendant has delivered to the vendors of the property sold the portion of the securities to which they were entitled. The remaining securities, therefore, are the property of the complainant, and in my opinion are held by the defendant as a mere depositary or bailee, and the complainant has a complete remedy by an action at law to enforce his rights to his property. I concur in the opinion of Judge Hazel that, under the authorities, and particularly under the statute providing that in the federal courts equity has no jurisdiction when there is an adequate remedy at law, this hill cannot be maintained. The demurrer is sustained, and, as the complainant has already once amended the complaint in order to meet the precise objection, I think that dual judgment should be ordered in the defendant\u2019s favor on the demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-15\">Dittenhoefer, Gerber &amp; James (A.
