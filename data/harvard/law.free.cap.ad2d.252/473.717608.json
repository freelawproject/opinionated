The record supports the Supreme Court\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel demonstrated \u201cgood cause\u201d (22 NYCRR 202.48 [b]) for failing to timely submit the judgment for signature within the requisite 60-day period <em>(see generally, Parisi v McElhatton, </em>209 AD2d 495; <em>Linroc Enters, v 1359 Broadway Assocs., </em>184 AD2d 309). Accordingly, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in permitting the plaintiffs to submit a judgment beyond the requisite 60-day period and in denying the defendants\u2019 cross motion to dismiss the action. Mangano, P. J., Miller, Pizzuto and Krausman, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
