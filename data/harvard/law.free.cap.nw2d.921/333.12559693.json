We direct the Clerk to schedule oral argument on the application. MCR 7.305(H)(1). The appellant shall file a supplemental brief within 42 days of the date of this order addressing whether the Court of Appeals erred in concluding: (1) that the preserved error in admitting the rap videos was not outcome determinative; (2) that the unpreserved error in admitting the gang-affiliation testimony was not plain error; and (3) that the erroneously admitted evidence, in conjunction with the prosecutor's argument in closing that this evidence showed the \"mentality\" of defendant and his friends and the \"lifestyle\" they lived, did not constitute impermissible character evidence under MRE 404(a) and\n   <em>\n    People v. Bynum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236802\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/496/610/\">\n    496 Mich. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=852%20N.W.2d%20570\">\n    852 N.W.2d 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In addition to the brief, the appellant shall electronically file an appendix conforming to MCR 7.312(D)(2). In the brief, citations to the record must provide the appendix page numbers as required by MCR 7.312(B)(1).

The appellee shall also electronically file an appendix, or in the alternative, stipulate to the use of the appendix filed by the appellant. A reply, if any, must be filed by the appellant within 14 days of being served with the appellee's brief. The parties should not submit mere restatements of their application papers.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
