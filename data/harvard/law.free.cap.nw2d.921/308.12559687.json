Among other reasons, the Legislature enacted it \"[t]o promote a speedy and efficient system for liquidating a decedent's estate and making distribution to the decedent's successors.\" MCL 700.1201. EPIC grants a decedent's surviving spouse certain rights. For example, the surviving spouse of a decedent who dies intestate-that is, without a will- may still take a share of the decedent's property. MCL 700.2202(1). In fact, even if the decedent dies testate-with a will-a surviving spouse may take a share different from that allocated by the will's plain terms. MCL 700.2202(2). However, not every spouse can rely on these rights. For example, a valid\n   divorce or annulment severs such reliance. MCL 700.2801(1). Alternatively, a spouse living in a bigamous relationship at the time of the decedent's death is also excluded. MCL 700.2801(2)(d). Although EPIC anticipates a number of other circumstances,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   only one is at issue in the instant case: whether the surviving spouse was \"willfully absent\" from the decedent for more than one year before his death and is therefore ineligible under MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) to exercise her rights under EPIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case turns on the meaning of \"willfully absent\" as used in MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ). In the proceeding below, the Court of Appeals concluded that \"willful absence for the purposes of the EPIC is a factual question that may concern more than physical proximity,\" and that a \"trial court should determine whether a spouse is willfully absent ... by considering all the facts and circumstances of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Erwin Estate\n   </em>\n   , unpublished per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued May 10, 2016 (Docket Nos. 323387 and 329264), pp. 2-3. We granted leave to consider two questions, both of first impression: (1) whether the term \"willfully absent\" is defined exclusively by physical separation, or whether it includes consideration of the emotional bonds and connections between spouses; and (2) whether MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) requires proof that a spouse intends to abandon his or her marital rights. For the reasons now discussed, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The decedent, James Erwin, Sr., had six children from a previous marriage when he married appellee Maggie Erwin in 1968. James and Maggie went on to have four children together, bringing James's total number of children to 10. Several years after their wedding, James and Maggie bought a house in Saginaw. However, although remaining in Saginaw, Maggie moved out and established a separate residence in 1976. She subsequently petitioned James for financial assistance, and James consented to a support order that provided\n   assistance for Maggie and for their children. But the two continued to live apart. There is no indication that they ever lived under the same roof again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Decades later, in 2010, James and Maggie joined together as plaintiffs and sued James's employer to reinstate Maggie's health insurance coverage in accordance with his retiree medical benefits. The couple was represented by L. Fallasha Erwin, James's son from his first marriage. During the proceedings, it was stated that Maggie was in poor health and that if she were to die, the loss to James would be irreparable. James made it clear that Maggie was still his wife and that they had an ongoing relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 12, 2012, James died intestate. James and Maggie had never filed for divorce nor had they otherwise formally separated. In the eyes of the law, they very much remained married until the time of James's passing. As testament to this fact, Maggie was listed as James's surviving spouse on his death certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following his death, Maggie and James's children proceeded to sort through his estate informally. Yet all was not well with the related but distinct families that\n   James had fathered. Apparently dissatisfied with the communication and cooperation shown by Maggie and her four children, one of James's children from his first marriage, Beatrice King, represented by her attorney-brother, L. Fallasha Erwin, petitioned the probate court to open formal proceedings and to be appointed as the estate's personal representative. On June 12, 2013, eight months after James's death and with no other interested party objecting, the probate court granted Beatrice's petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The probate court proceedings were contentious from the outset, with allegations of deceit and calls for sanctions. Both sides of James's family were involved and filed motions, only one of which is relevant to the case as it currently comes before us. In 2014, Beatrice asked the probate court to determine whether Maggie was a surviving spouse in accordance with EPIC. Beatrice argued, in part, that Maggie was not a surviving spouse under MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) because she was \"willfully absent\" from James in the years leading up to his death. If proved, because James died intestate, Maggie would not be an heir for the purposes of inheritance. She would not be entitled to a share of James's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 31, 2014, the probate court held a hearing on Beatrice's motion, and on July 17, 2014, it decided that motion in Maggie's favor in a written opinion,\n   ruling that Maggie was James's surviving spouse. Beatrice appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the probate court's ruling. We subsequently granted Beatrice's application for leave to appeal, limited to the two questions described earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We review de novo questions of statutory interpretation.\n   <em>\n    People v.

Accordingly, an individual deserts his or her spouse within the meaning of MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    ii\n   </em>\n   ) if he or she physically leaves the marital home with the intent never to return and the spouse dies more than a year later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    ii\n   </em>\n   ) permits us to draw an important inference. If we interpret the word \"absent\" as used in MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) to refer only to physical absence, there would be an almost complete overlap between MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) and (\n   <em>\n    ii\n   </em>\n   ). That is, an individual who \"deserts\" his or her spouse in\n   the year or more before the spouse's death will always have been \"willfully absent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This would render MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) redundant and counsels against equating the term solely with physical absence.\n   <em>\n    Wickens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1039661\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/465/53/#p60\">\n    465 Mich. at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=631%20N.W.2d%20686\">\n    631 N.W.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, we examine MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   ). A natural reading of that subparagraph indicates that the phrase \"to provide support for the decedent spouse if required to do so by law\" modifies the verbs \"refused\" and \"neglected.\" Therefore, an individual is not a surviving\n   spouse within the meaning of MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   ) if he or she \"[w]illfully neglected ... to provide support for the decedent spouse if required to do so by law,\" or \"refused to provide support for the decedent spouse if required to do so by law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Generally, spousal support is mandated by law only in two situations. The first involves divorce. MCL 552.23. However, divorcees are not surviving spouses for the purposes of EPIC. MCL 700.2801(1). As a result, MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   ) cannot be referring to spousal support following a divorce. See\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Old Republic Ins.

That leaves an action for separate maintenance-the second situation in which spousal support can be mandated-which can be filed by an individual based on the same grounds as an action for divorce, MCL 552.7, but in circumstances in which a divorce is not pursued or cannot be obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As already stated, the word \"willfully\" refers to an intent to do something specific. \"Neglected,\" on the other hand, means to fail to give the proper attention to something, or otherwise to leave it undone; \"refused\" simply means to decline to do something.\n   <em>\n    The American Heritage Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2d ed.);\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (11th ed.).

Both MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    ii\n   </em>\n   ) and (\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   ) describe acts on behalf of a surviving spouse that for all intents and purposes are inconsistent with the very existence of a legal marriage. This is either by a spouse refusing to provide required support or by simply abandoning the other without an intent to return.

Not only is \"[a]n individual who is divorced from the decedent or whose marriage to the decedent has been annulled ... not a surviving spouse\" for purposes of EPIC, MCL 700.2801(1), but\n   also \"[a]n individual who obtains or consents to a final decree or judgment of divorce from the decedent or an annulment of their marriage, which decree or judgment is not recognized as valid in [Michigan]\" is not a surviving spouse,\" MCL 700.2801(2)(a). And this includes \"[a]n individual who, following an invalid decree or judgment of divorce or annulment obtained by the decedent, participates in a marriage ceremony with a third individual.\" MCL 700.2801(2)(b). These provisions all describe a situation in which, in effect, a spouse has initiated conduct that results in the complete dissolution of his or her marriage, either in fact or in practice. In those circumstances, an individual, even if legally a surviving spouse, cannot avail himself or herself of all the statutory rights inherent with that title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Taking all this into consideration, it is clear that the term \"willfully absent\" cannot be defined exclusively by physical separation. Simply put, there must be something more than a mere physical distance. There are, after all, countless situations in which spouses choose to be physically separated but do not want to interrupt or even weaken their marital relationship. Some married couples are separated by occupation-for example, when a spouse intentionally takes a better job in a neighboring region so that he or she may provide more comfortably for their family-while others are separated by civic duty-like when a member of the armed forces is deployed overseas in service to this nation. But these circumstances alone reveal no desire to destroy or undermine the marriage, and a committed spouse should not forfeit his or her inheritance on the basis of the erroneous assumption that a physical distance prevented the continued pursuit of an otherwise loving and supportive relationship. If two married people decide to live apart but maintain an element of\n   emotional support and contact, courts have no business second-guessing that life decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As a result, when MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) is read in this proper context, the following explication becomes\n   clear: willful absence requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances. It presents a factual question for the trial court to answer: whether a spouse's complete absence brought about a practical end to the marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The burden is on the party challenging a legal spouse's status to show that the spouse was in fact \"willfully absent\" for the year or more leading up to the decedent's death.

Although an intentional physical absence is necessary to a finding of willful absence, without additional indicia of a complete absence in terms of emotional support and contact, courts should conclude that the marriage endured and allow the remaining legal spouse to retain his or her \"surviving spouse\" status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The dissent contends that \"absent\" in this context refers only to physical absence. In doing so, it states\n   that the \"critical aspect\" of absence is the lack of physical presence, because a dictionary defines \"absent\" as \"not present\" or \"away.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 324-. Unfortunately, the sum total of the dissent's analysis on this point is a string citation to dictionaries that define absence in terms of physical presence. See\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   at 325 n. 13. We do not disagree that \"absent\" can be understood in physical terms. And we are not surprised to find that multiple dictionaries define absence in this way. The question here is not whether physical absence is a \"critical aspect\" of absence in general-we agree that it is in this case-but whether, in the context of MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ), absence relates solely to physical absence. This is where our disagreement lies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While the dissent apparently agrees that \"absent\" can be defined as either a lack of physical presence or emotional inattentiveness, see\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   at 325, it nonetheless argues that these definitions are mutually exclusive and that therefore it is improper to define \"absent\" to encompass both definitions, see\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   at ---- n. 26 (\"[O]ne definition requires a person to be\n   <em>\n    physically absent\n   </em>\n   , i.e., \"not present; not in company; away,\" while the other, as it pertains to human interaction, requires in its ordinary usage a person to be\n   <em>\n    physically present ....\n   </em>\n   \"). We disagree with the dissent that in order to be \"inattentive\" one must also be \"physically present.\" One who is physically absent can still be \"attentive\" by providing emotional support and communication; conversely, one who is physically absent can also be \"inattentive\" by withholding emotional support and communication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we do not believe\n   that\n   physical distance and inattentiveness are \"logically inconsistent,\"\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   at ---- n. 26, because neither concept is necessarily dependent upon the other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   More fundamentally, the dissent contends that when interpreting a statute, the interpreter must choose the single most appropriate dictionary definition of a term, rather than relying on multiple definitions. See\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   at ----. The dissent also contends that \"[b]y knitting together ... disparate definitions, the majority creates its own definition ... instead of choosing the contextually appropriate meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 325. We disagree. When consulting a dictionary, this Court does not relinquish its duty to exercise its best interpretive judgment. In this way, the dictionary should be seen as a tool to facilitate those judgments, not conclusively\n   resolve linguistic questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is one thing to \"knit together\" disparate and incompatible definitions, as, for example, by concluding that a \"horse\" refers both to the familiar animal and also to a frame or structure on which something is mounted or supported. It is quite another to insist on a single definition when there are multiple choices with slight shades of different meaning, each of which is reasonably understood to apply to a term in a particular context. Unlike the dissent, we believe that \"absent\" is a term broad enough to reasonably encompass both cited definitions and that the overall context and manifest purpose of the statute under inquiry renders both definitions appropriately applicable. These two definitions are not in tension in any way, they are not logically incompatible in any manner, and each describes a subtly different understanding of \"absent\" that is both relevant and necessary to give full and complete meaning to the statute at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"Absent\" in the course of describing a human relationship, particularly that between husband and wife, might fairly describe aspects of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   physical and emotional proximity. The dissent is entitled to\n   yoke itself to a single definition that remains within the boundaries set forth by a single dictionary, but we prefer to rely on the dictionary as a tool for supplying\n   the most reasonable definition of a term in its most relevant context. The Legislature is not confined to a single dictionary definition of a term when enacting a law and neither should this Court be so limited when interpreting that law. The dictionary is but one data point; it guides our analysis, but it does not by itself settle it. The primary obligation of this Court \"is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature\" in light of the language of the statutory provision and the context in which it appears.\n   <em>\n    Lash v.

This definition is consistent with the statutory scheme as a whole, which contemplates that one only loses his or her status as a \"surviving spouse\" if he or she takes action that is akin to a complete repudiation of the marriage. Moreover, this interpretation gives independent meaning to the \"desertion\" and \"willfully absent\" provisions and avoids rendering either provision redundant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In the proceeding below, the Court of Appeals came to a similar conclusion.

James and Maggie were married in 1968. In 1973 they bought a martial home together in Saginaw as tenants by the entireties. Maggie left the marital home in 1975 and took residence at a separate address, but she remained only a few miles away, still in Saginaw. Shortly thereafter, she sought financial support and James agreed to pay. Neither party disagrees that Maggie was physically absent from the martial home in the years that followed, intentionally so, and neither party disputes that James and Maggie Erwin remained legally married until James's death. Maggie is even listed as the surviving spouse on James's death certificate, and she is the named beneficiary of his life insurance policy. Therefore, the question is whether, given the totality of the circumstances, Maggie intended to be physically and emotionally absent from James, resulting in a practical end to their marriage?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Unfortunately for Beatrice, the record in this case is sparse. Before the probate court, Beatrice asserted that Maggie was not a surviving spouse and moved for a declaration of her status as a nonsurviving spouse pursuant to EPIC. But her claim rested solely on the allegation that Maggie and James did not cohabitate for over 36 years, and she provided nothing more in support of her claim than evidence of this fact. Beatrice never argued that Maggie and James had severed all emotional connections or that they did not in some way provide one another with emotional support. And other evidence in the record-specifically that in 2010 James filed a breach of contract action against his employer to ensure that the employer resumed providing medical coverage to Maggie as James's spouse-suggests that James and Maggie remained married up until the time of James's death. At a minimum, this lawsuit indicates that, not long before his death, James felt that losing Maggie would have been an irreparable loss and that in his eyes and hers, they were still husband and wife. As already stated, while physical separation is necessary for a finding that a spouse is not a surviving spouse for the purposes of\n   EPIC, physical separation alone is insufficient. Because Beatrice only provided evidence of physical separation between Maggie and James and did not refute the evidence tending to show the enduring emotional connections between them, her claim necessarily fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On the meager record before it, the probate court understandably ruled that Maggie was the surviving\n   spouse of James for purposes of EPIC. The probate court recognized that the couple had not resided together for many years but found that the couple had chosen a separated lifestyle rather than a complete end to their marriage. In the probate court's eyes, the couple's relationship was ongoing and included contact up until James's death. We find no clear error in this factual determination. The probate court could only rule on the evidence before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the probate court. It observed that Beatrice had argued solely that Maggie and James were physically separated for more than a year and that this evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that Maggie was \"willfully absent.\" We agree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We hold that an individual is not a surviving spouse for the purposes of MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) if he or she intended to be absent from his or her spouse for the year or more leading up to the spouse's death. Absence in this context presents a factual inquiry based on the totality of the circumstances, and courts should evaluate whether complete physical and emotional absence existed, resulting in an end to the marriage for practical purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The burden is on the party challenging\n   an individual's status as a surviving spouse to show that he or she was \"willfully absent,\" physically and emotionally, from the decedent spouse. Because the Court of Appeals in the present case correctly concluded that Maggie was not \"willfully absent\" from James in the years leading up to his death, we affirm. We decline to address the remaining issues presented in the application for leave to appeal because we are not persuaded that they should be reviewed by this Court\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Stephen J.

(concurring in part).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I support the result reached by the majority-the Court of Appeals rightly affirmed\n   the trial court's finding that Maggie was not \"willfully absent\" from James. I also agree with the majority that the term \"willfully absent\" is broad enough to encompass emotional absence. But I write separately because I do not support the majority's proposition that \"intentional physical absence is necessary\" to support a finding that a spouse is \"willfully absent\" under MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at ----.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   This case squarely presents the question whether the term \"willfully absent\" in MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   )\"includes consideration of the emotional bonds and connections between spouses,\"\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at ----, and so it is proper for the majority (and the dissent for that matter) to wrestle with that question. But this case does not present the question whether the term \"willfully\n   absent\" requires physical absence; nor do the facts of this case allow that proposition to be tested since neither party disputes that Maggie was physically absent from James. See\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at ----;\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   at ----. In short, the majority's proposition in no way bears on the outcome of this case, and so I view the proposition as obiter dictum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To be fair, a physical-absence requirement is unlikely to cause mischief-I don't doubt that in a typical case, a finding that a spouse was \"willfully absent\" will be supported by, among other things, record evidence of physical absence. But I would prefer that the majority's proposition become enshrined in law only after we consider a case in which that proposition plays a deciding role.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    For instance, a surviving spouse also does not include \"[a]n individual who is a party to a divorce or annulment proceeding with the decedent at the time of the decedent's death.\" MCL 700.2801(3)(b).

Thus, this case turns on the proper meaning of \"willfully absent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The statute, in relevant part, lists three situations in which a \"surviving spouse\" forfeits his or her entitlement to collect the intestate share:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   An individual who did any of the following for 1 year or more before the death of the deceased person:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) Was willfully absent from the decedent spouse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    ii\n   </em>\n   ) Deserted the decedent spouse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   ) Willfully neglected or refused to provide support for the decedent spouse if required to do so by law.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This provision was first added as part of the Revised Probate Code (RPC), which was enacted in 1978.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   When\n   the RPC was later replaced by EPIC in 2000, the forfeiture provision remained substantively unchanged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The forfeiture provision was included in the RPC as part of a package of changes to the surviving-spouse provisions. In the Probate Code of 1939, a surviving spouse would split the intestate estate with the parents or children of the decedent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   With the passage of the RPC, however, a surviving spouse was permitted to take a much larger share of the estate. Under the RPC, the surviving spouse was permitted to take the first $60,000 and then split the remaining balance of the intestate estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time the Legislature\n   adopted this increased share, it adopted the forfeiture provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To determine the meaning of \"willfully absent,\" we must turn to the dictionary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2d unabridged ed.) defines the adjective \"absent\" as \"not present; not in company; away.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, when a spouse is \"absent\" he or she is \"not present\" or \"away,\" making the critical aspect of \"absent\" the lack of physical presence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As the majority recognizes, the term \"absent\" is also defined as \"heedless; inattentive to persons present or to subjects of conversation in company.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This may be true, but when a word has more than one definition, the context determines the sense in which the Legislature used the word.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Considered properly, the definition on which the majority relies does not fit the context of this provision, which requires a spouse to be \"absent\" for a year or more.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   It would make little sense to say-or think the Legislature was requiring-that a spouse was \"preoccupied\" or \"lost in thought\" for a year or more, much less that the person remained in such a state \"willfully.\" And combining this definition with \"physical absence\" only makes matters worse. Now the spouse must be both physically absent and \"lost in thought\"? In short, the definition of absent on which the majority purports to rely has no workable meaning in the statutory context. Instead, being\n   <em>\n    physically\n   </em>\n   absent is clearly \"the most contextually appropriate\" definition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Furthermore, no matter how hard one looks, it is clear that the definition the majority relies on-\"inattentiveness\"-does not even yield the majority's notion of \"complete ... emotional absence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, this definition of \"absent\" refers to a state of mental distraction, not emotional absence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dictionaries phrase this definition in slightly different ways: \"not attentive; preoccupied; absent-minded,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"inattentive, preoccupied,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"lost in thought: not attentive,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"not attentive; preoccupied; absent-minded,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[a]bsent-minded; paying no attention to, and receiving no impression\n   from, present objects or events.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   But none of these permutations involves an emotional aspect. Indeed, one could be inattentive to many different things-e.g., hygiene, finances, responding promptly-without being emotionally absent. And it would seem that one could be \"emotionally absent\" (as the majority uses that term) without being inattentive in any of these ways, or in general. Despite the majority's attempts to tease a connotation of emotional absence out of \"inattentiveness,\" it is clear that the dictionary definitions simply will not cooperate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Even so, the majority does not cite, and I have been unable to find, a dictionary that combines emotional inattentiveness and physical absence into a single definition, as the majority does here. Instead, as the majority acknowledges,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   these definitions of \"absent\" are listed as separate alternatives: there is no definition that requires both physical and emotional absence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   By knitting together these disparate\n   definitions, the majority creates its own definition,\n   effectively choosing \"all of the above,\" instead of choosing the contextually appropriate meaning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Next, we must consider whether the statute has an intent requirement. As an initial matter, I am in agreement with the majority (and the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    In re Peterson\n   </em>\n   ) when it states that the statute does not require proof of an intent to abandon one's marital rights before an individual can be barred from inheriting under the provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the statute does require\n   that the absence be \"willful.\" In ordinary use, \"willful\" is defined as \"said or done deliberately or intentionally\" or \"following one's own will unreasoningly; obstinate; stubborn.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Linguistically, it\n   does not make much sense to think of a person's absence from their spouse under EPIC in terms of whether the absence was \"deliberate\" or \"intentional.\" No reasonable person would contend that an unintentional or involuntary separation-such as one resulting from a long-term medical condition, or being stranded on a deserted island-was what the Legislature was guarding against when it enacted this provision. To be \"willful,\" then, as that term is commonly understood in the context of human interaction, is to make a decision on one's own, without regard to others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   A decision made with the consent of the other spouse is not a willful decision-that is, it is not a decision made \"following one's own will unreasoningly.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore,\n   by using the phrase \"\n   <em>\n    willfully\n   </em>\n   absent,\" the statute refers to a spouse who is physically absent as a result of a unilateral decision by that spouse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   By contrast, spouses who live apart by mutual choice would be considered surviving spouses under the forfeiture provision because the absent spouse did not make a unilateral decision to be absent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The majority asserts that without an emotional-absence requirement, the \"willfully absent\" provision would be rendered a nullity by the desertion provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although we concede that in many cases there is overlap between these two provisions, that is not always the case. Because \"desertion\" requires that\n   someone have the intent to stay away, not every spouse who is \"willfully absent\" will also be guilty of \"desertion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conversely, while a\n   spouse who has \"deserted\" the other will often be \"willfully absent,\" there may be exceptions. For example, in the divorce context, our Court has recognized that a spouse may be guilty of\n   desertion, not by leaving a spouse, but by mental or physical abuse that drives the other spouse away.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under my reading, then, both statutory provisions-\"willfully absent\" and \"desertion\"-do independent work. For these reasons, I do not agree with the majority's statement that reading \"absent\" as meaning only physically absent renders the provision surplusage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Lastly, instead of looking to the text and dictionary definitions, the majority divines its \"complete\" physical and emotional absence requirement through its interpretation of the statutory context, i.e., other provisions precluding someone from \"surviving spouse\" status. But all the majority really does is import perceived requirements from these other provisions into the definition of \"willfully absent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover,\n   the majority fails entirely to grapple with other surrounding provisions, such as MCL 700.2801(2)(d) (stating that a\n   surviving spouse does not include \"[a]n individual who, at the time of the decedent's death, is living in a bigamous relationship with another individual\"), which target actions that do not necessarily reflect an intent to end the marriage. The majority's attempt to justify its departure from the plain language of MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) based upon the statutory context in which it appears is simply not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In sum, I conclude that the phrase \"willfully absent\" in the forfeiture provision, MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ), refers to a person who is physically absent from the decedent spouse as a result of his or her unilateral decision. I also agree with the majority that the record in this case is sparse and believe that the majority's recitation of the few facts we know is accurate. Therefore, I would remand this case to the trial court so that it may determine in the first instance whether Maggie was physically absent as a result of her unilateral decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Because I believe that the majority's interpretation is not in accordance with a plain-language reading of the statute, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Bridget M. McCormack, Richard H. Bernstein, JJ., agrees.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at ----.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at ---- (emphasis added).
