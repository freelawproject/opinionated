Pursuant to MCR 7.305(H)(1), in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we REVERSE the judgment of the Court of Appeals, VACATE the June 13, 2018 opinion and order of the Genesee Circuit Court, and REMAND this case to the trial court for further consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Although the plaintiff has asserted the defenses of waiver and estoppel, neither defense applies in this case. \"A true waiver is an intentional, voluntary act and cannot arise by implication. It has been defined as the voluntary relinquishment of a known right.\"\n   <em>\n    Landelius v.

There is no dispute that neither defendant knowingly and voluntarily relinquished their respective right to assert intrinsic fraud or fraud on the court. And because the defendants' motion for relief from judgment constitutes a timely challenge to the validity of the paternity judgment in the same civil action under the Revocation of Paternity Act (ROPA), MCL 722.1431\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., collateral estoppel does not apply.

The Genesee Circuit Court is DIRECTED to expedite its consideration and resolution of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
