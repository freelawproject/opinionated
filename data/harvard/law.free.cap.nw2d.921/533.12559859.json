Although the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the trial court failed to state a legitimate basis for permitting plea withdrawal, it erred in remanding the case for sentencing rather than for redetermination\n   of the defendant's motion. The defendant claimed that her attorney told her that, if she changed her mind before sentencing, she could withdraw her plea. If true, that would call into question whether the plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily. We REMAND this case to the Macomb Circuit Court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant's attorney advised her that she would be able to withdraw her guilty plea on her own volition before sentencing, and if so, whether she should be permitted to withdraw her plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
