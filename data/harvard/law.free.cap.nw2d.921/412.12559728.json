Wonda McGath argues the district court erred in distributing the parties' marital property, awarding Kenneth McGath primary residential responsibility of the parties' children, establishing a parenting time schedule, ordering her to pay child support, and denying her request for a free copy of trial transcripts for appeal because she is indigent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   [\u00b62] Wonda McGath has failed to provide a trial transcript of the divorce proceeding for her appeal. A civil litigant is not constitutionally nor statutorily entitled to a free transcript on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Koenig v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Koenig\n   </em>\n   , Wonda McGath is not entitled to a free transcript on appeal. Without a transcript, this record is inadequate to provide for meaningful and intelligent review of her claimed errors. She bears the consequences of her failure to provide a transcript, and we affirm the judgment under\n   <em>\n    Koenig\n   </em>\n   and N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(2), (4), and (7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [\u00b63] Gerald W.
