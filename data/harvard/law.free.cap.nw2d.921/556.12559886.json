The district court dismissed the felony charges on the ground that the two prior domestic-violence-related offenses used to enhance the charges to felonies arose from a single behavioral incident and so could not be treated as separate convictions for enhancement purposes.

He was ultimately charged with threats of violence, fleeing a peace officer in a motor vehicle, and two counts of felony domestic assault. The state used respondent's two prior domestic-violence-related convictions from December 3, 2010, (third-degree assault and violation of a domestic-abuse order for protection) to enhance the domestic-assault charges to felonies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Respondent moved to dismiss the fleeing a peace officer in a motor vehicle\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the two felony domestic-assault charges for lack of probable cause. With respect to the felony domestic-assault charges, respondent argued that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.035\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) prohibited the use of the two prior convictions for enhancement purposes because those convictions originated from the same circumstances and did not involve multiple victims. According to respondent, \"using multiple\n   <em>\n    convictions\n   </em>\n   from the same behavioral incident\" to enhance a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor to a felony violates the principles set out in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.035\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1, prohibiting multiple\n   <em>\n    punishments\n   </em>\n   for conduct constituting more than one offense. (Emphasis added.) Respondent contended that if the state is allowed to use prior convictions arising from the same behavioral incident to enhance the charges of domestic assault to felonies, then he would be subjected to greater punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The state opposed respondent's motion and cited to another felony enhancement\n   statute for support, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169A.09 (2016). The driving-while-impaired (DWI) statute expressly requires that \"[p]rior impaired driving convictions ...\n   <em>\n    must arise out of a separate course of conduct\n   </em>\n   to be considered as multiple qualified prior impaired driving incidents.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169A.09 (emphasis added). The state argued that, unlike the DWI-enhancement statute, nothing in the felony domestic-assault statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.2242\">\n    Minn.

The supreme court concluded that the two separate traffic offenses involved in that case (driving while intoxicated and driving over the center line of a roadway) fell within section 609.035, and therefore, punishment was limited to a single sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348293\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/273/394/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348293\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/273/394/\">\n    at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The problem with respondent's argument and the district court's order is that both attempt to add limitations to the domestic-assault statute that the legislature did not impose. As the state persuasively argues, the legislature has, in other criminal statutes, limited the use of prior convictions for enhancement purposes. For example, the enhancement provision of the DWI statute, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169A.09, expressly limits \"qualified prior impaired driving incidents\" to prior impaired driving-related convictions and losses of license \"aris[ing] out of a separate course of\n   conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike the DWI enhancement provision, no such language exists in the felony domestic-assault statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.2242\">\n    Minn.
