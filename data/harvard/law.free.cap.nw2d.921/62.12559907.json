In 2017, Poole petitioned for a complete discharge from MSOP. At a first-phase hearing on Poole's petition, the Judicial Appeal Panel admitted the testimony and report of its own examiner. At the end of the first-phase hearing, the commissioner of human services moved the panel, under Minn. R. Civ. P. 41.02(b), to dismiss Poole's petition, asserting that\n   Poole failed to make a prima facie case for discharge. The panel granted the commissioner's motion. Poole appeals, arguing that (a) at the first-phase hearing, the panel should not have admitted, and should not have considered, the testimony and report of the panel's examiner; (b) the panel should not have granted the county's motion to dismiss Poole's petition; and (c) the discharge criteria in Minn. Stat. \u00a7 253D.31 (2016) deprive committed persons of due process of law because they allow continued commitment when a person's confinement no longer bears a reasonable relationship to the reason for the commitment. We conclude that the panel erred when it considered the testimony and report of its examiner. We affirm the panel, however, because, even if the testimony and report of the panel's examiner are disregarded, Poole still did not make a prima facie case for discharge, and because Minn. Stat. \u00a7 253D.31 does not unconstitutionally allow continued commitment when a person's confinement no longer bears a reasonable relationship to the reason for the commitment because of alleged unamenability to treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Poole was licensed to practice medicine in 1968. As a result of misconduct in his examinations of certain female patients, a jury convicted Poole of 16 counts of third- and fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. The conduct for which Poole was convicted did not include penile penetration of any victim.\n   <em>\n    State v. Poole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10608245\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/499/31/#p32\">\n    499 N.W.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32-33 (Minn. 1993) (describing Poole's offenses). After Poole served his sentence, he was indeterminately committed to MSOP.\n   <em>\n    In re Poole\n   </em>\n   , No. C4-00-85,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%20781381\">\n    2000 WL 781381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Minn. App. June 20, 2000). In 2009, Poole stopped participating in sex offender treatment in MSOP. In January 2017, Poole petitioned the Special Review Board (SRB) for a transfer to community preparation services, a provisional discharge from MSOP, or a full discharge from MSOP. After a hearing, the SRB issued its findings of fact and recommendation to deny Poole's requests. Poole petitioned for rehearing and reconsideration, and a first-phase hearing on that petition occurred before the appeal panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the start of the first-phase hearing, Poole withdrew all of his requests for relief except his request for a full discharge from MSOP. Additionally, in support of his petition, Poole submitted, and the panel admitted, the report of Dr. Jennifer Jones, among other exhibits. Poole then testified in support of his discharge, asserting that his MSOP polygraph results showed that he was nondeceptive\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , that he would be age 80 in September 2018, and that he has poor balance and uses a cane. Poole also testified that surgery for prostatecancer five years earlier left him with \"a leaky bladder, bladder incontinence, and ... completely sexually impotent[,]\" and that his cancer is currently in remission. Poole noted that he has no history of substance abuse, and asserted that, if released, he could live on his Social Security income with family or friends in Montana or California or Sweden. He further asserted that he has no intention of attempting to regain his license to practice medicine, that he needs neither sex offender treatment nor treatment for a lack of concern for other people, that he \"no longer [has] any interest in sex whatsoever,\" and that he \"absolutely [will] not\" engage in sex offender treatment if he is discharged. Poole admitted that he was removed from sex offender treatment in prison, has not engaged in sex offender treatment outside of prison and MSOP, and has never completed a sex\n   offender treatment program. Further, he denied \"most\" of the allegations that he committed uncharged sex offenses against extended family members, and noted that he has been incarcerated or in MSOP since 1991.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The panel then called the examiner appointed by the panel, Dr. Mary Kenning. During her testimony, her report was admitted. Both her testimony and her report were unfavorable to Poole's requested discharge. At the conclusion of her testimony, the commissioner moved to dismiss Poole's petition for discharge, and, after hearing arguments on the point, the panel took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The panel's resulting March 26, 2018 order recited the procedural and factual history of the matter and detailed the testimony and report of the panel's examiner, as well as the report of Dr. Jones. After describing Poole's testimony, the order analyzed the legal standard for discharge, and ruled that \"[Poole] has failed to establish a prima facie case that he is entitled to a discharge from his civil commitment.\" The panel granted the commissioner's motion to dismiss Poole's petition for discharge, and denied Poole's petition for discharge. Poole appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.

Under that chapter, a committed person\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   seeking discharge or provisional discharge bears the burden of going forward with the evidence, which means presenting a prima facie case with competent evidence to show that the person is entitled to the requested relief.

Stat. \u00a7 253D.28, subd. 2(d) (2016). Regarding petitions for full or partial discharge from MSOP, the supreme court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   When appearing before [the panel], the committed person bears the burden of going forward with the evidence, which means presenting a prima facie case with competent evidence to show that the person is entitled to the requested relief. We have recently described that burden as a burden of production, which requires the committed person to come forward with sufficient, competent evidence that, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. The proceeding in which a committed person produces evidence is commonly referred to as a first-phase hearing. If the committed person satisfies his burden of production, then the party opposing the petition bears the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence that the discharge or provisional discharge should be denied. The proceeding in which the opposing party attempts to prove that the discharge petition should be denied is commonly referred to as a second-phase hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Coker v.

More specifically, the submission of competing facts by an adverse party makes the application of the \"viewed in a light most favorable to the committed person\" standard more difficult to apply. Consequently, the better practice would be to wait until the second-phase hearing before receiving the exhibits, testimony, and other evidence offered by the Commissioner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7061311\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/831/483/#p485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 491 n.9. The supreme court went on to say that \"[w]hile dismissal under Minn. R. Civ.

Therefore, we conclude that a harmless-error analysis applies to a panel's receipt and consideration of evidence that should not be considered in assessing whether, at a first-phase hearing, the committed person made a prima facie case for the relief sought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10606398\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/456/724/#p728\">\n    456 N.W.2d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728 (Minn.

Prima facie case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To support his assertion that he is no longer a danger to the public, Poole offered, and the panel accepted, Dr. Jones's report. Dr. Jones's report is an extensive\n   \"Sexual Violence Risk Assessment.\" The report addresses Poole's history, the results of Dr. Jones's interview of Poole, and Poole's results on various risk assessments. The risk assessments suggest Poole has a limited probability of reoffending. After reciting this background information, the report addresses a possible discharge of Poole, stating (a) \"[Poole] is essentially an untreated sexual offender, as despite incarceration and subsequent commitment for his sexual offending he has minimally participated in treatment[;]\" (b) Poole stopped participating in treatment in March 2009, and \"[i]t does not appear [Poole] has reengaged in treatment since that time, which suggests minimal intervention [in his] cognitive distortions supporting of [his] sexual offending[;]\" (c) Poole's \"ingrained beliefs with respect to sexually problematic behaviors and lack of evidence suggestive of treatment participation and change [make it] reasonable to surmise [that Poole's beliefs] have sustained[;]\" (d) \"[Poole] has not demonstrated clinical progress suggestive of readiness for reduction in supervision or treatment need[;]\" (e) Poole's assertion that his health-apparently referring to his alleged impotence-shows that he is not a danger is unpersuasive because Poole \"did not necessarily require sexual functioning in order to sexually offend[;]\" and (f) Poole \"has remaining treatment needs with respect to his paraphilic disorder and as such remains a danger to the public.\" Dr. Jones's discussion of Poole's request for discharge culminates by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Poole continues to require institutionalization in order to provide for his remaining needs and public protection. His current placement at the MSOP is the most appropriate and\n   <em>\n    he cannot be transferred to a less secure facility while providing the public safety criterion\n   </em>\n   . Mr. Poole does not meet criteria for a transfer, provisional, or full discharge from his commitment at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Despite the fact that Dr. Jones unambiguously states (multiple times) that Poole remains a danger to the public, Poole submitted Dr. Jones's report to support his assertion that he is not a danger to the public. Poole's argument that he made a prima facie case that he is not a danger to the public is supported only by his own interpretation of the results of the risk assessments, which suggest he has a limited probability of reoffending. Because the crux of Poole's claim that he is not a danger to the public is his own otherwise unsupported reading of those assessments and is contrary to his own expert's reading of those assessments, his argument is that his own otherwise-uncorroborated assertions entitle him to a second-phase (evidentiary) hearing. If we accepted this assertion, a first-phase hearing would devolve into committed persons reciting conclusory and formulaic testimony regarding the threshold for obtaining a second-phase hearing-essentially committed persons uttering magic words. Generally, courts have ruled that mere conclusory assertions are insufficient to avoid an adverse ruling.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cole v.

Consistent with these cases, we decline to rule that, by themselves, conclusory assertions by a committed person are sufficient to avoid dismissal of a petition for discharge from MSOP. Here, Poole's own submissions include multiple statements that he remains a danger to the public and these submissions lack evidence, other than Poole's own statements, to the contrary. On this record, even considering the obligation to view the record in the light most favorable to Poole, we decline to rule that Poole's otherwise uncorroborated assertions regarding the risk he poses to the public are sufficient to establish a prima facie case that he is not a danger to the public, especially when those assertions are contrary to those of his own expert. Therefore, we affirm the panel's determination that Poole did not establish a prima facie case on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Under the version of Minn.

The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected an assertion that the Minnesota Civil Commitment and Treatment Act is facially unconstitutional because it deprives patients of substantive due process by allowing patients to be confined even when that confinement no longer bears a reasonable relationship to the purpose of that confinement. In doing so, the court described the statutory process for a patient to seek a discharge or reduction in custody, and then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   We conclude that this extensive process and the protections to persons committed under MCTA are rationally related to the State's legitimate interest of protecting its citizens from sexually dangerous persons or persons who have a sexual psychopathic personality.
