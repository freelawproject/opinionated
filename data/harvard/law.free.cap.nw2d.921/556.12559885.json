We conditionally reinstated Nwaneri on July 21, 2017, subject to the requirement that Nwaneri file proof of his successful completion of the written examination required for admission to the practice of law by the State Board of Law Examiners on the subject of professional responsibility by June 7, 2018.\n   <em>\n    In re Nwaneri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12334300\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/899/185/#p185\">\n    899 N.W.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185-86 (Minn. 2017) (order).

Instead, on May 22, 2018, Nwaneri filed a motion seeking additional time to provide proof of successful completion of the MPRE and a motion for a speedy hearing of his extension motion. We denied the motions and revoked Nwaneri's conditional reinstatement, effective June 17, 2018.\n   <em>\n    In re Nwaneri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12556285\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/912/882/#p883\">\n    912 N.W.2d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 883 (Minn. 2018) (order).
