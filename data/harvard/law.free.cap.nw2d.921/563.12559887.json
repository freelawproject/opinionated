On December 21, 2016, Strobel, who was in custody, appeared before the district court for a rule 5 hearing. The district court ordered unconditional bail in the amount of $200,000. On January 4, 2017, the district court ordered conditional bail in the amount of $100,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 26, 2017, Strobel, who was still in custody, appeared before the district court for an omnibus hearing and demanded a speedy trial. The district court noted that it would have to make room in its trial schedule to accommodate the demand and stated, \"We'll find some way to get it heard before the [speedy-trial deadline of] 60 days expires.\" The district court scheduled the trial for March 20, 2017, within the 60-day timeframe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 20, 2017, Strobel remained in custody, and the state was not prepared for trial. The state requested a continuance for two reasons. First, the state had discovered-that morning-that the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) employee who had tested some of the controlled substances was on vacation. Second, the BCA had not yet tested the remainder of the substances. Strobel objected, but the district court granted the continuance for good cause, noting that the delay was caused by the BCA, and not by the prosecutor. The district court reduced Strobel's conditional bail to zero and released him from custody with instructions to return for trial on April 10, 2017, approximately 75 days after Strobel's demand for a speedy trial. The district court ordered conditions of release. The conditions included GPS monitoring and chemical testing, and they prevented Strobel from leaving the state, challenging extradition on the underlying charges if he left the state, and accessing or using alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Strobel's trial was held on April 11 and 12, 2017. Strobel was present for the first day of trial. On the second day of trial, Strobel went to the courthouse and spoke to his attorneys, but he did not attend his trial that day. The district court issued a warrant for Strobel's arrest, and the trial proceeded in his absence. The jury found Strobel guilty as charged, and the district court entered judgments of conviction. Strobel remained at large for nearly two months. He eventually appeared before the district court for sentencing, and the district court ordered him to serve concurrent prison terms of 115 and 108 months. Strobel appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. Was Strobel's constitutional right to a speedy trial violated?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. Was Strobel's first-degree controlled-substance sentence based on an incorrect criminal-history score?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Strobel contends that his constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated. The United States and Minnesota Constitutions guarantee a criminal defendant the right to a speedy trial. U.S. Const. amend. VI ; Minn. Const. art. I, \u00a7 6. In determining whether a defendant's right to a speedy trial has been violated, Minnesota courts apply the four-factor balancing test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Barker v. Wingo\n   </em>\n   , 407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. at 2192.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The four factors are \"(1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) whether the defendant asserted his or her right to a speedy trial; and (4) whether the delay prejudiced the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nor did the state assert that it had communicated with the BCA witness before trial or otherwise attempted to ensure the availability of its BCA witness and evidence for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This lack of diligence weighs against the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Windish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11597299\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/590/311/#p315\">\n    590 N.W.2d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The state did not produce any evidence of its efforts to ensure [the witness's] appearance.

But the record does not suggest that the state deliberately delayed Strobel's trial. Because the record does not suggest that the state deliberately attempted \"to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 531, 92 S.Ct. at 2192, this factor weighs in favor of finding a speedy-trial violation, but not heavily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Whether Strobel Asserted His Right to a Speedy Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"The defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right ... is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 531-32, 92 S.Ct. at 2192-93.

P. 11.09(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Strobel demanded a speedy trial at his January 26, 2017 omnibus hearing, which was his first opportunity to make such a demand under the rules of criminal procedure. The district court acknowledged Strobel's demand and adjusted its schedule to comply with Minn. R. Crim. P. 11.09(b). The state points out that, despite Strobel's speedy-trial demand, he \"intentionally absented himself from trial,\" thereby delaying the proceedings. The state is only partially correct. Although Strobel absented himself from trial, his absence did not delay the trial. The trial continued, as scheduled, despite Strobel's absence. This factor weighs in favor of finding a speedy-trial violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the Delay Prejudiced Strobel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We next consider the prejudice factor. \"[U]nreasonable delay between formal accusation and trial threatens to produce more than one sort of harm, including oppressive pretrial incarceration, anxiety and concern of the accused, and the possibility that the accused's defense will be impaired by dimming memories and loss of exculpatory evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Doggett v.

(quotation omitted). Strobel claims all three forms of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As to pretrial incarceration, the state notes that Strobel was released from jail on March 20, before the end of the 60-day period for starting a trial under rule 11.09(b). Strobel argues that his conditions of release resulted in substantial restrictions on his liberty, relying on\n   <em>\n    State v. Griffin\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8163060\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/760/336/\">\n    760 N.W.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Minn. App. 2009). In that case, the district court placed the defendant on \"standby status,\" requiring\n   her to be ready to start trial on two hours' notice, which effectively required her to be away from her home in Chicago and limited how far she could travel from the courthouse.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8163060\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/760/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8163060\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/760/336/\">\n    at 338-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Her case remained on standby status \"for at least 58 week days over [a] period of six months,\" and she was only permitted to travel to her home in Chicago for Christmas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8163060\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/760/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8163060\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/760/336/\">\n    at 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court held that although the defendant \"was not incarcerated while awaiting trial ... neither was she at liberty to pursue ordinary life activities,\" and her \"freedom was severely restricted\" by the court-ordered conditions of release.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8163060\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/760/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8163060\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/760/336/\">\n    at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The other conditions-submitting to GPS monitoring, waiving extradition, submitting to chemical testing, and refraining from having access to or using alcohol-did not severely restrict Strobel's freedom or his ability to pursue ordinary life activities. Strobel does not assert that he could not work or see his family or friends as a result of the conditions. And unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   , Strobel was not required to be ready to start his trial on two hours' notice. Moreover, he was subject to the conditions for only three weeks, as opposed to six months. In sum, Strobel's circumstances are not comparable to those of the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   , and the record does not otherwise support a conclusion that the state's delay in bringing Strobel's case to trial resulted in oppressive pretrial incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As to harm stemming from pretrial anxiety and concern, the \"stress, anxiety and inconvenience experienced by anyone who is involved in a trial\" is insufficient to demonstrate prejudice.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Strobel notes that he was unable to visit with his family and significant other while he was incarcerated and that this lack of contact caused him to experience \"significant disruption of his relationships.\" Any defendant who is incarcerated pending trial is likely to experience disrupted relationships as a result of reduced contact with family and friends. Although we do not doubt that Strobel suffered some anxiety during the time it took the state to bring his case to trial, Strobel has not identified any heightened pretrial anxiety or concern that would suggest a constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The third type of prejudice, impairment of the defense, is the most serious and may be either specific or presumptive.\n   <em>\n    Doggett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p654\">\n    505 U.S. at 654-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p654\">\n    112 S.Ct. at 2692-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, Strobel argues that the delay in his trial \"impaired his defense, and thereby prejudiced him\" because if the state had been required to start the trial on the original trial date, \"its case for proving [his] guilt would simply have been less strong.\" Essentially, Strobel argues that he was prejudiced-for the purpose of the fourth prong of a speedy-trial analysis-because the state had additional time\n   to prepare for trial as a result of pretrial delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Strobel's argument is similar to the defendant's speedy-trial argument in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Deliberate delay to obtain a tactical advantage is relevant in a speedy-trial analysis, but it is relevant to the second\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factor, which is the reason for the delay, and not to the fourth factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   , 407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. at 2192 (\"A deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense should be weighted heavily against the government.\"). In our assessment of the second\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factor, we concluded that the state's delay was not intentional. Even if it were intentional, the resulting benefit to the state would not establish the type of defense-impairing prejudice that is necessary to prevail on a speedy-trial claim, that is, \"the inability of [the] defendant adequately to prepare his case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193 ;\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6841923\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/869/1/\">\n    869 N.W.2d at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We therefore hold that the state's additional opportunity to prepare for trial as a result of pretrial delay does not constitute prejudice to the defendant sufficient to support a finding of a speedy-trial violation under the fourth\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factor. In accordance with this holding, we do not consider any benefit that the state may have obtained as a result of the pretrial delay. Instead, we ask whether the delay compromised Strobel's ability to adequately prepare his case. Again, Strobel does not assert that his ability to prepare for trial was in any way harmed as a result of the state's delay in bringing his case to trial, or that he suffered presumptive prejudice from excessive delay. We therefore do not discern a basis to conclude that Strobel suffered from the third, and most serious, type of harm considered under the\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   prejudice factor: impairment of his defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In sum, Strobel did not suffer from oppressive pretrial incarceration, unusual anxiety or concern, or an impaired defense as a result of the pretrial delay in this case. The prejudice factor therefore weighs against finding a speedy-trial violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Balancing of the Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Strobel demanded a speedy trial under the rules of criminal procedure at his first opportunity. The start of Strobel's trial more than 60 days from the date of his demand raises a presumption that a\n   speedy-trial violation occurred. The state is responsible for the delay, which resulted from its apparent failure to make adequate efforts to ensure that its witness and evidence were available for a trial to begin as scheduled within 60 days of Strobel's demand. However, the district court simultaneously released Strobel from custody when granting the state's request for a continuance. We note that the rules do not mandate a defendant's release from custody for failure to comply with a speedy-trial demand under rule 11.09 until 120 days from the date of the demand. Minn. R. Crim. P. 11.09(b) (\"Unless exigent circumstances exist, if trial does not start within 120 days from the date ... the demand is made, the defendant must be released under any nonmonetary conditions the court orders ....\"). Strobel's trial began approximately 15 days after the 60-day period and well within the 120-day period set forth in rule 11.09(b). Most importantly, Strobel has not shown any prejudice resulting from the 15-day delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The supreme court has previously held that even though the first three\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factors weighed in a defendant's favor, the defendant's right to a speedy trial had not been violated because he had not suffered any prejudice as a result of the delay.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Section 609.02 describes criminal offense levels according to the sentences that may be imposed.

Thus, we read the phrase \"may be imposed\" in section 609.02 to plainly mean a sentence that is permitted or authorized by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We now apply the plain language of Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines 2.B.7.a. and section 609.02 to determine whether Strobel's 2012 fifth-degree controlled-substance offense was properly classified as a felony. In doing so, we consider the sentence that \"may be imposed\" under the fifth-degree controlled-substance statute that was in effect when Strobel committed the current, first-degree controlled-substance offense: the 2016 DSRA-amended version of section 152.025. The penalty subdivision of section 152.025 defines certain fifth-degree controlled-substance-possession offenses as gross misdemeanors, depending on the type and amount of controlled substance possessed.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.025\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 4(a). Next, the penalty subdivision authorizes imprisonment \"for not more than five years,\" unless the underlying conduct qualifies as a gross misdemeanor under subdivision 4(a).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.025\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , subd. 4(b). The penalty provision does not specify a punishment for a gross-misdemeanor offense under subdivision 4(a). In such circumstances,\n   \"[I]f the crime is a gross misdemeanor\" the penalty may include \"imprisonment for not more than one year.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.03\">\n    Minn.

In that event, the offense would not be a felony under the definition in section 609.02, which is the basis for offense classification under Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines 2.B.7.a. We therefore hold that a prior fifth-degree controlled-substance-possession offense may not be classified as a felony when calculating a criminal-history score to be used in sentencing a crime that occurred after the effective date of the DSRA amendments to section 152.025, if the prior offense would qualify as a gross misdemeanor under subdivision 4(a) of the DSRA-amended version of section 152.025.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The state suggests a different approach, which would base a prior offense classification on the sentence that was given, instead of the sentence that may be imposed under current law. The state argues that because Strobel \"received a stayed five-year prison sentence for his 2012 fifth-degree controlled substance crime, which 'current Minnesota offense definition' section 609.02 states is a felony,\" his 2012 conviction for fifth-degree controlled-substance crime was properly classified as a felony when calculating his criminal history. As support, the state relies on comment 2.B.701 to the sentencing guidelines, which states, \"The Commission recognized that the classification of criminal conduct as a felony, gross misdemeanor, or petty misdemeanor is determined legally by the\n   <em>\n    sentence given\n   </em>\n   rather than the conviction offense.\" Minn. Sent. Guidelines cmt. 2.B.701 (2016) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The state's reliance on comment 2.B.701 is unavailing because comments to the sentencing guidelines are \"merely advisory, not binding.\"\n   <em>\n    Scovel\n   </em>\n   , 916 N.W.2d at 555. Moreover, comment 2.B.701 must be read in context. For example, Minnesota Statutes section 609.13, subdivision 1(1) (2016) provides: \"Notwithstanding a conviction is for a felony ... the conviction is deemed to be for a misdemeanor or a gross misdemeanor if the sentence imposed is within the limits provided by law for a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor as defined in section 609.02.\" Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines 2.B.1.h. (2016), is in accord, providing: \"Except when a monetary threshold determines the offense classification of the prior offense ..., when a prior felony conviction resulted in a non-felony sentence (misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor), the conviction must be counted in the criminal history score as a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor conviction ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   When comment 2.B.701 is read in that context, it is apparent that the comment's recognition \"that the classification of criminal conduct ... is determined legally by the sentence given rather than the conviction offense\" is simply an acknowledgement of the principles set forth in section 609.13 and Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines 2.B.1.h. Under those principles, if a defendant received a misdemeanor-level sentence on a prior offense, the prior offense is categorized as a misdemeanor when calculating a criminal-history score, even though a felony-level sentence is authorized under current law, except when a monetary threshold determines the offense classification of the prior offense. In sum, the classification of a prior offense is determined under Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines 2.B.7.a., as modified by Minnesota\n   Sentencing Guidelines 2.B.1.h. Comment 2.B.701 does not control the offense classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because the state did not establish that Strobel's 2012 fifth-degree controlled-substance conviction was properly classified as a felony, we reverse the sentence on his first-degree controlled-substance offense and remand with instructions permitting the state to develop the record regarding the type and amount of controlled substance underlying Strobel's 2012 conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The rules of criminal procedure provide that defendants may move the district court at any time to \"correct a sentence not authorized by law.\" Minn. R. Crim. P. 27.03, subd. 9. However, a sentence based on an incorrect criminal-history score is an illegal sentence that may be corrected on direct appeal, regardless of whether the defendant objected to the score at sentencing.\n    <em>\n     State v.

(2016).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Because the district court used the\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    method to calculate Strobel's criminal-history score when sentencing his second-degree controlled-substance offense, the allegedly incorrect criminal-history score used to sentence Strobel's first-degree offense did not impact Strobel's sentence for the second-degree offense.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minn. Sent. Guidelines 2.B.1.e.

As to the second-degree offense, the point accumulation under the\n    <em>\n     Hernandez\n    </em>\n    method offset any erroneous point inclusion stemming from an inaccurate classification of Strobel's 2012 offense. Strobel therefore does not challenge his sentence for the second-degree controlled-substance offense.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Prior to the DSRA, all fifth-degree controlled-substance offenses were punishable as felonies.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.025\">\n     Minn.
