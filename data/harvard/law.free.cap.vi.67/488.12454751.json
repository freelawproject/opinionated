Missing are requests for leave to substitute the personal representative in place of each of the plaintiffs to continue their personal injury actions. However, because Defendants Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corporation (\u201cHOVIC\u201d) and Hess Corporation (\u201cHess\u201d) have not opposed any of the motions, and because the request for leave to substitute is certainly implied by each motion, the Court will construe each motion as including a request for leave to substitute a personal representative on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Also before the Court is a motion filed by one of the personal representatives for permission to exceed the page limits on the supplemental brief she submitted in response to questions the Court raised concerning the procedure by which personal representatives are appointed to continue civil actions on behalf of deceased parties, specifically whether the personal representative must be appointed through formal probate proceedings. Hess and HOVIC filed a notice in response to the personal representative\u2019s supplemental brief to state that they take no position on this issue. They also did not oppose the motion for leave to exceed the page limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">For the reasons stated below, the Court will grant the motion to exceed the pages limits and grant the substitution motions, but only because of an intervening change in the law. The Court will also grant the Personal Representatives leave to amend or supplement the complaints to reflect their status in the case and to assert a wrongful death claim if appropriate. However, the proposed complaints the Personal Representatives submitted must be rejected because wrongful death claims and survival claims cannot be plead in the alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On December 19, 2013, Matthew Augustin, Leslie J. Burton, Gregor Calixte, Joseph President, and Anthony Taylor (and sixty-one others) sued Hess and HO VIC for negligence and demanded damages allegedly from exposure to asbestos during the years they worked at the former oil refinery on St. Croix. Approximately six months later, on May 17, 2014, Patrick Clark, Henry T. Flemming, and Aristede Y. Redo (and fifty-nine others) sued Hess and HOVIC for the same reasons: negligence in allowing them to be exposed to asbestos. The Superior Court opened a master case, captioned <em>In re Asbestos, Catalyst, and Silica Toxic Dust Exposure Litigation, </em>to coordinate pre-trial litigation in the individual cases simultaneously. <em>See generally In re Asbestos, Catalyst, Silica Toxic Dust Exposure Litig., </em>67 V.I. 544 (Super. Ct. 2017). During pre-trial litigation, these eight plaintiffs passed away. Personal representatives were appointed by the Probate Division of the Superior Court. Each filed a motion for leave to file a motion to amend the complaint to continue the lawsuits as survival actions. Each motion, and the proceedings related to that motion, is discussed further below.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">A. <em>Augustin</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Matthew Augustin (\u201cMr. Augustin\u201d) was born on November 5, 1948 on St. Lucia. He passed away on February 27, 2016 on St. Croix. Mr. Augustin\u2019s survivors include his wife, Lirle Augustin, his daughters, Jenyda and Charissa Augustin (\u201cCharissa\u201d) and Cindy Augustin Gray, and his sons, Lawrence, Lance, and Jabari Augustin. On February 7, 2017, Charissa filed a motion in Mr. Augustin\u2019s case for leave to file an amended complaint to substitute herself in place of her father to continue his lawsuit. Charissa did not include a copy of Mr. Augustin\u2019s death certificate with her motion or an affidavit. She did, however, provide a copy of the memorial booklet that she and her family prepared prior to Mr. Augustin\u2019s funeral. Charissa also submitted a proposed amended complaint to her motion. In her motion, she acknowledged that it was premature, because she had not been appointed personal representative or petitioned for appointment as personal representative when the motion was filed. But a week later, on February 15, 2017, Charissa filed a petition, numbered SX-17-MP-002 and assigned to a Superior Court magistrate judge, for appointment as a personal representative. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>petition was not immediately granted, however, because Charissa failed to submit a copy of her father\u2019s death certificate. She later supplemented the petition and on March 20, 2017, the probate court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted it and appointed Charissa as personal representative. On June 7, 2017, Charissa filed an amended motion for leave to amend the complaint in her father\u2019s civil case. To date, a petition to probate Mr. Augustin\u2019s estate has not been filed in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\">B. <em>Burton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Leslie J. Burton (\u201cMr. Burton\u201d) was born on July 28, 1945 on Dominica. He passed away on October 6, 2015 in Decatur, Georgia. Mr. Burton\u2019s survivors include his wife, Catherine Defoe Burton (\u201cMrs. Burton\u201d), his daughters, Delia Burton King (\u201cBurton-King\u201d) and Jessica Burton Cox, and his sons, Leslie D. and Leslie J. Burton, Jr. On September 19, 2016, Burton-King filed a motion in Mr. Burton\u2019s individual case for leave to file an amended complaint. She did not file a motion, however, for leave to substitute herself in place of her father to continue his lawsuit. In support, Burton-King attached a proposed amended complaint and a copy of the petition she filed with the Probate Division on August 17, 2016 for appointment as personal representative. The Clerk\u2019s Office opened the August 17, 2016 petition as a miscellaneous probate matter numbered SX-16-MP-012 and randomly assigned it to a Superior Court magistrate judge. By order dated October 7, 2016 and entered October 11, 2016, the probate court granted Burton-King\u2019s petition and appointed her personal representative of the Estate of Leslie J. Burton.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">However, three months earlier, on July 1, 2016, Mrs. Burton and her children had filed a petition for settlement of Mr. Burton\u2019s estate without administration. Counsel appeared on behalf of the Estate. The Clerk\u2019s Office opened the petition for probate, numbered SX-16-PB-054, and assigned it at random to a Superior Court magistrate judge. That probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>court, not the same who granted Burton-King\u2019s petition, issued a final order of distribution in the <em>In re Estate of Leslie Joshua Burton </em>matter on October 31, 2016, entered November 4, 2016. The Clerk\u2019s Office closed the probate. So far as the Court can tell from its review of the record, the probate proceeding did not reference this case or the miscellaneous probate matter Burton-King filed two weeks before the <em>Estate of Burton </em>was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">C. <em>Calixte</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Gregor Calixte (\u201cMr. Calixte\u201d) was born on May 5 or May 25, 1953<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on St. Lucia. He passed away on August 28, 2014 on St. Croix. Mr. Calixte\u2019s survivors include his wife, Scholastica Francis Calixte (\u201cMrs. Calixte\u201d), his daughters, Dionysia Joseph, Natasha Hurdle, and Latoya and Nasha Calixte, and his sons, Brookerly and Jawade Elibox Calixte. On August 26, 2015, Mrs. Calixte filed a motion in the master case for leave to file an amended complaint to substitute herself in place of her husband to continue his lawsuit. She attached a copy of Mr. Calixte\u2019s death certificate to her motion, a copy of an August 3, 2015 order entered in case number SX-15-MP-010, and a proposed amended complaint. Mrs. Calixte had filed a petition with the Probate Division on July 29, 2015 for appointment as personal representative, which the Clerk\u2019s Office opened as a miscellaneous probate matter and assigned randomly to a Superior Court magistrate judge. The probate court issued the August 3, 2015 Order, granting Mrs. Calixte\u2019s petition and appointing her personal representative of the Estate of Gregor Calixte. To date, a petition to probate Mr. Calixte\u2019s estate has not been filed in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">D. <em>Clarke</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Patrick Clarke (\u201cMr. Clarke\u201d) was born on March 17, 1949 on St. Lucia. He passed away on December 2, 2015 on St. Croix. Mr. Clarke\u2019s survivors include his daughters, Aurea G. and Marlinda Clarke, Armarilis Mitchel, and Cathalina Clarke Baptiste (\u201cClarke-Baptiste\u201d), and his sons, Nicholas Clarke and Zion Markomen (also known as Bennette Bryan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Clarke). On June 2, 2016, Clarke-Baptiste filed a motion in the master case for leave to file an amended complaint to substitute herself in place of her father to continue his lawsuit. She attached to the motion a copy of Mr. Clarke\u2019s death certificate, a copy of a May 19, 2016 order entered in case number SX-16-MP-005, and a proposed amended complaint. Clarke-Baptiste had previously filed a petition with the Probate Division on February 12, 2016, which the Clerk\u2019s Office opened as a miscellaneous probate matter and randomly assigned to a Superior Court magistrate judge. On May 19, 2016, the probate court granted Clarke-Baptiste\u2019s petition and appointed her personal representative of the Estate of Patrick Clarke. To date, a petition to probate Mr. Clarke\u2019s estate has not been filed in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\">E. <em>Flemming</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Henry T. Flemming (\u201cMr. Flemming\u201d) was born on June 2, 1953 on St. Kitts. He passed away on May 31, 2015 on St. Croix. Mr. Flemming\u2019s survivors include his wife, Hyacinth L. Simon Flemming, his sons, Omari and Orson Fleming (\u201cOrson\u201d), and his daughter Orencia Flemming. On October 6, 2015, Orson filed a motion in the master case for leave to file an amended complaint to substitute himself as plaintiff and continue his father\u2019s lawsuit. He attached to the motion a copy of Mr. Flemming\u2019s death certificate, a copy of a September 30, 2015 order entered in case number SX-15-MP-012, and a proposed amended complaint. Orson had previously filed a petition with the Probate Division on September 21, 2015, which the Clerk\u2019s Office opened as a miscellaneous probate matter and randomly assigned to a Superior Court Magistrate judge. On September 30, 2017, the probate court granted Orson\u2019s petition and appointed him as personal representative of the Estate of Henry T. Flemming. To date, a petition to probate Mr. Flemming\u2019s estate has not been filed in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">F. <em>President</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Joseph President (\u201cMr. President\u201d) was born on September 16, 1940 on St. Lucia. He passed away on November 8, 2014 on St. Croix. Mr. President\u2019s survivors include his wife, Winifred D. Ince President, and his sons, Sylvester, Isaac, and Moses President (\u201cMoses\u201d). On October 30, 2015, Moses filed a motion in the master case for leave to file an amended complaint to substitute himself as plaintiff to continue his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>father\u2019s lawsuit. He attached to the motion a copy of Mr. President\u2019s death certificate, a copy of an October 14, 2015 order entered in case number SX-15-MP-13, and a proposed amended complaint. Moses had previously filed a petition with the Probate Division on September 21, 2015, which the Clerk\u2019s Office opened as a miscellaneous probate matter and randomly assigned to a Superior Court magistrate judge. On October 14, 2015, the probate court granted Moses\u2019 petition and appointed him as personal representative of the Estate of Joseph President. To date, a petition to probate Mr. President\u2019s estate has not been filed in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">G. <em>Redo</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Aristide Y. Redo (\u201cMr. Redo\u201d) was born on August 31, 1931 in Trois-Rivi\u00e9res, Guadeloupe, Republic of France. He passed away on August 6, 2014 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Mr. Redo\u2019s survivors include his wife, Mary Redo (\u201cMrs. Redo\u201d), his daughters, Dell, Ella, and Christine Redo, Yvette Rogers, and Carol Doughty, and his sons, Robert and Joel Redo. On July 29, 2016, Mrs. Redo filed a motion in the master case for leave to file an amended complaint to substitute herself as plaintiff to continue her husband\u2019s lawsuit. She attached to the motion a copy of Mr. Redo\u2019s death certificate and a proposed amended complaint. Mrs. Redo admitted that her motion was premature because had not been appointed personal representative. But she explained that she had filed a petition with the Probate Division on June 22, 2016, which the Clerk\u2019s Office opened as a miscellaneous probate matter numbered SX-16-MP-011 and randomly assigned to a Superior Court magistrate judge. By order dated June 22, 2016 and entered June 24, 2016, the probate court granted the petition and appointed Mrs. Redo personal representative of the Estate of Aristide Redo. Mrs. Redo did not supplement or amend her motion after her petition was granted. To date, a petition to probate Mr. Redo\u2019s estate has not been filed in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">H. <em>Taylor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Anthony Taylor (\u201cMr. Taylor\u201d) was born on June 14, 1961 on St. Lucia. He passed away on February 5, 2015 on St. Croix. Mr. Taylor\u2019s survivors include his mother, Mary Taylor, his daughters, Molisa Taylor and Wendy Defoe, and his sons, Ian, Elias, and Johnny Taylor (\u201cJohnny\u201d). On January 22, 2016, Johnny filed a motion in the master case for leave to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>an amended complaint to substitute himself as plaintiff to continue his father\u2019s lawsuit. He attached to the motion a copy of his father\u2019s death certificate, a copy of a January 7, 2016 order entered in case number SX-15-MP-018, and a proposed amended complaint. Johnny had previously filed a petition with the Probate Division on December 23, 2015, which the Clerk\u2019s Office opened as a miscellaneous probate matter and randomly assigned to a Superior Court magistrate judge. On January 7, 2016, the probate court granted Johnny\u2019s petition and appointed him as personal representative of the Estate of Anthony Taylor. To date, a petition to formally probate Mr. Taylor\u2019s estate has not been filed in the Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Because of the number of motions for leave to substitute personal representatives that had been filed and were still pending, and because the Court had at least twice before raised questions about whether an estate must formally exist before a personal representative can be appointed to continue a pending lawsuit, the Court, from the bench during a status conference held in the master case on September 7, 2016, requested supplemental briefing from counsel for the Personal Representatives. The Court reduced that ruling to writing by order issued the same day in the master case, September 7, 2016. The September 7, 2016 Order specifically directed the Personal Representatives</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">to file a brief addressing the concerns raised from the bench regarding the appointment of personal representatives to continue a personal injury claim or to commence a wrongful death action and the existence at law of an estate before a personal representative is granted leave to substitute into an existing action or to bring a survival action or a wrongful death action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">(Order 1, entered Sept. 7, 2016.) The Court then gave the Personal Representatives thirty days to serve and file the supplemental brief and Defendants fourteen days to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Although the September 7, 2016 Order was issued in the master case, one of the Personal Representatives, Mrs. Calixte, filed the supplemental brief in Mr. Calixte\u2019s individual case, on October 7, 2016. She also filed a motion the same day, also in Mr. Calixte\u2019s case, for leave to exceed the page limitations for the brief she submitted. Defendants later filed notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>on November 7, 2016 (also in <em>Calixte) </em>that they had no response to the supplemental brief and did not oppose the motion to exceed the page limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">After the motions for leave to substitute had been filed in each case, as well as the supplemental brief in <em>Calixte, </em>the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands promulgated the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure, which took effect on March 31, 2017. <em>See generally In re Adoption of V.I. Rules of Civ. P., </em>Prom. Order No. 2007-001, 2017 V.I. Supreme LEXIS 22 (V.I. Apr. 3, 2017). Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure 17, which concerns parties and their capacities to sue and be sued, Rule 25, which governs the procedure for substituting parties after death, and Rule 6-1, which governs motion practice, are among the new rules the Supreme Court promulgated.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Before turning to the motions for leave to substitute personal representative, the Court will first address the related motion for leave to exceed the page limits. <em>Cf. Der Weer v. Hess Oil V.I. Corp., </em>64 V.I. 107, 120 (Super. Ct. 2016) (courts generally resolve ancillary motions first because they may affect what arguments are before the court). After addressing the related motion, but before addressing the merits of the substitution motions, the Court will address the concerns previously raised about the appointment of personal representatives and their substitution into pending civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">A. Motion for Leave to Exceed Page Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Contemporaneously with their supplemental brief, the Personal Representatives<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> also filed a motion for leave to exceed the page limits for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>that brief. In support, the Personal Representatives explain that the Court had \u201crequested additional briefing\u201d but \u201cPlaintiffs were unable to condense their brief to comply with the page limits set forth in Local Rule 7.1 (as made applicable to this case in the governing case management orders).\u201d (Pls.\u2019 Mot. for Leave to Exceed Page Limit 1, filed Oct. 7, 2016, <em>Calixte, </em>SX-13-CV-435.) No further explanation or justification was provided, nor was any authority cited other than Local Rule of Civil Procedure 7.1, a rule promulgated by the District Court of the Virgin Islands. Defendants, in their November 7, 2016 notice, expressed no opposition to this motion. Of course, \u201ca \u2018motion is not automatically granted simply because it is unopposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ayala </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>67 V.I. 290, 303 (Super. Ct. 2017) (quoting <em>Alumina Dust Claims, </em>67 V.I. 172, 187 (Super Ct. 2017)). In other words, even though a motion is unopposed, courts must still determine whether to grant it, especially when the decision is within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Cf. Fontanillas-Lopez v. Morell Bauz\u00e1 Cartagena &amp; Dapena, LLC, </em>832 F.3d 50, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2016) (denial of motions for leave to exceed page limits reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\">Section 3(b) of the Case Management Order this Court issued in the master case directs that \u201c[a]ll motion papers shall comply with Local Rules of Civil Procedure 7.1, 12.1, and 56.1 concerning page limits.\u201d Rule 7.1 provides that \u201c[w]ith the exception of exhibits and other supporting documentation, no document filed with the Court shall exceed twenty (20) pages without leave of Court.\u201d (Case Mgmt. Order 4, entered Mar. 19, 2015.) Excluding the affidavits the Personal Representatives attached, and signature blocks for the Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys (which alone takes up two pages), the supplemental brief itself only exceeds the twenty-page limit by four pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">At the time when the Case Management Order was issued, the Superior Court routinely applied through Superior Court Rule 7 many of the rules the District Court of the Virgin Islands promulgated, including Rules 7.1, 12.1, and 56.1. <em>Accord Mitchell </em>v. <em>Gen. Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>67 V.I. 271, 283 (Super. Ct. 2017). The Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands has criticized this uncritical application by the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands of rules promulgated by other courts. <em>See Vanterpool v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Government of the Virgin Islands, </em>63 V.I. 563, 576 (V.I. 2015) (\u201cSuch uncritical application of the rules of another court to a proceeding in the Superior Court is wholly inconsistent with our admonition that \u2018the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the Local Rules of the District Court should represent rules of last resort rather than first resort, and should be invoked only when a thorough review of applicable Virgin Islands statutes, Superior Court rules, and precedents from this Court reveals the absence of any other applicable procedure.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Sweeney v. Ombres, </em>60 V.I. 438, 442 (V.I. 2014)) (brackets omitted)). However, the Supreme Court has not had occasion to address Rule 7.1 specifically, or more generally, what inherent authority courts have to place limits on the number of pages of motion papers. Two Superior Court judges addressed motions for leave to exceed page limit. See <em>Abednego v. St. Croix Alumina, LLC, </em>63 V.I. 153, 184 (Super. Ct. 2015); <em>Jones v. Jerome, </em>62 V.I. 160, 161 n.1 (Super. Ct. 2015). But in each case, the court granted the motion without discussion. Similarly, the District Court of the Virgin Islands has also addressed motions to exceed page limits in <em>Chapin v. Great Southern Wood Preserving, Inc., </em>Civ. No. 2012-77, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60805 (D.V.I. May 9, 2016), but there, only in passing and only in discussing the procedural history to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\"> Thus, no court in the Virgin Islands has addressed why (or even whether) courts can or should impose pages limits on court papers. Other courts have. For example, in <em>Kernan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>108 T.C.M. (CCH) 503 (T.C. 2014), <em>aff\u2019d </em>670 Fed. Appx. 944 (9th Cir. 2016), the United States Tax Court succinctly explained some of the problems with, and the reasons why, courts impose page limits on court papers.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">Judges impose page limits for a reason. They force parties to hone their arguments and to state those arguments succinctly. Page limits cause, or should cause, parties to dispense with arguments of little or no merit in favor of those arguments that have a better chance of carrying the day. They encourage parties to avoid redundancy. And repetition. Parties often are quite creative in their efforts to circumvent page limits. Among the most blatant methods is to put material into an appendix and to not count that appendix as falling within the page limits. Another is to incorporate another document by reference. Less blatant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>but still obvious, are those instances in which parties shrink the margins or the font size so that they can squeeze more text within the page limits that were imposed.... Then there are methods that, while perhaps in technical conformity with our Rules, diminish the quality of a brief.

(CCH) 503 at 9-10 (footnotes and paragraph breaks omitted). This Court agrees with the reasoning and the concerns <em>Kernan </em>expressed and further agrees that parties should limit their arguments and only raise those arguments that carry the most weight. But that\u2019s not always possible to do in twenty pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">As with surresponses and surreplies, which are generally \u201cdisfavored because parties are expected to fully and expeditiously address all matters raised in the original motion in their responses,\u201d courts do grant leave to \u201cfurther respon[d] or reply [when it] will aid the court by addressing relevant issues, including issues that might otherwise be waived if not timely raised.\u201d <em>Der Weer, </em>64 V.I. at 122 (quotation marks and citation omitted). So too with motions to exceed page limits \u2014 if allowing additional pages can help the court to resolve a complicated issue or complex questions of law, then leave to exceed page limits should generally be granted. But requesting leave to exceed the page limits should be the exception, not the norm.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Because of the significance of the issues raised here, and because the appointment of personal representatives was a question of first impression in the Virgin Islands, the Court will grant the motion for leave to exceed the page limits. Again, the Personal Representatives\u2019 brief only exceeded the limit by four pages. But the Court must express concern at what might have become a common practice in the Virgin Islands: filing a motion for leave to do some act and then doing that act simultaneously or shortly after the request is filed without awaiting the court\u2019s ruling. <em>Cf. In re Red Dust Claims, </em>SX-15-CV-620, 2017 V.I. LEXIS 98, at *24 (Super. Ct. July 7, 2017) (\u201c[C]ourts in the Virgin Islands have not yet considered whether a moving party, faced with a pending motion for an extension of time or for leave to act out-of-time, should proceed as if the motion were granted. Courts in other jurisdictions strongly disapprove of the practice. But our courts must ask what is the soundest rule for the Virgin Islands.\u201d (quoting <em>Edwards v. Hess Oil V.I. Corp., </em>SX-15-CV-382, 2017 V.I. LEXIS 94, at *8 n.4 (Super. Ct.

They did explain, however, that it was the Court who asked for briefing on \u201cfive separate, but related questions,\u201d \u201cas to whether court-appointed personal representatives of . . . estates . . . must. .. [first] open[ ] probate [proceedings] in order to pursue claims on behalf of those estates.\u201d (Pls.\u2019 Mot. 1.) Clearly, then, they appreciated \u2014 well in advance of the thirty-day briefing deadline allowed by the September 7, 2016 Order \u2014 that more than twenty pages would be needed to address these issues. They should have immediately requested leave to exceed the page limits, not wait until the same day the brief was filed to make that request, which was the last day that the brief could have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Filing a document at the same time a request related to that document is filed puts courts in the awkward position of having to unring the bell. Here, if the Court were inclined to deny the Personal Representatives\u2019 motion, the Court would have to either reject their supplemental brief \u2014 and since it was filed on the last possible day, <em>sua sponte </em>extend the briefing deadline or else await further motions \u2014 or disregard those pages that exceeded the limit. Neither option is all that palatable. One could make a persuasive argument \u2014 juxtaposing the number of cases pending in the Superior Court and the number of active Superior Court judges and magistrates judges at present, <em>cf. Edwards, </em>2017 V.I. LEXIS 94, at *8 n.4 \u2014 that the better approach is to allow such ancillary requests as motions for more time or for leave to submit additional briefing to be presumed granted if the request is unopposed, subject to the court\u2019s ultimate determination whether good cause was in fact shown. And if not, the filing could be disregarded or even stricken. <em>Cf. Der Weer, </em>64 V.I. at 127 (courts have inherent authority to control record and strike improperly-filed papers). The problem with filing a motion for leave to do some act at the same time the act is done is that it forces the court either to rule on the motion after the fact without awaiting a response from the other parties or to allow the response time (and the reply time) to pass and then grant the motion and allow the (technically already filed) paper to remain on file or deny the motion and send everyone back to \u201csquare one.\u201d But the more basic concern, however, is depriving the court of the ability to manage its docket. \u201cRules of procedure are vitally important in judges\u2019 efforts to manage burgeoning caseloads with some semblance of efficiency.\u201d <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., </em>26 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">Here, at the time when the Personal Representatives filed their motion \u2014 simultaneously with their supplemental brief \u2014 the Superior Court did not have its own rule governing page limits.

Motions for Leave to Amend/Substitute</p>\n<p id=\"ALC\">(1) Death of a Party</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"> Before turning to the Personal Representatives\u2019 motions, the Court must first address the concerns that were raised previously, regarding the procedure for appointing personal representatives. Procedurally-speaking, under Virgin Islands law, \u2018\u201cwhen someone dies two things happen. First, any personal injury claims the person may have had abate unless there is authority extending the life of those claims.\u201d <em>Der Weer </em>v. <em>Hess Oil V.I. Corp., </em>61 V.I. 87, 102 (Super. Ct. 2014). Claims for \u2018\u201cphysical injury to the person or out of a statute imposing liability for such injury shall not abate by reason of the death of the wrongdoer or any other person liable for damages for such injury, nor by reason of the death of the person injured.\u201d 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 77. Also property and contract claims do not abate upon a person\u2019s death. <em>Cf. Der Weer, </em>61 V.I. at 98 (\u201c \u2018At common law, all causes of action for personal torts abated on the death of either the injured party or the tortfeasor. The rule was expressed in the maxim, <em>actio personalis moritur cum persona, </em>i.e., a personal action dies with the person. Other causes of action, principally property and contract claims, did not abate with the death of a party.\u2019 \u201d <em>(quoting Sullivan v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>15 Cal. 4th 288, 63 Cal. Rptr. 2d 74, 935 P.2d 781, 784 (1997), parenthetically)). If a claim has not been filed in court before a person dies, the claim \u2018\u201cmay be commenced by [the decedent\u2019s] personal representatives, after the expiration of the time [limited for commencement] and within one year from . . . death,\u201d 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 37(a). If a claim has been filed and is still pending when a person dies, the claim may \u2018\u201cbe continued by . . . [the decedent\u2019s] personal representatives or successor in interest\u201d \u2018\u201cat any time within two years thereafter, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 78. Claims brought by or continued by a personal representative are often referred to as survival claims or survival actions. But \u2018\u201ca survival claim is not really a claim. It is merely a vehicle for pursuing someone else\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Der Weer, </em>61 V.I. at 103. \u2018\u201cSecond, if a person\u2019s death was caused by or resulted from someone else\u2019s actions or failure to act, then that person\u2019s survivors can only recover if authority creates a cause of action for wrongful death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102. Virgin Islands law gives the survivors of someone whose death occurred wrongfully, the right to sue for wrongful death. <em>See generally </em>5 V.I.C \u00a7 76. In each instance, the survival action is either continued by or brought by, and the wrongful death action is brought by, someone acting in a representative capacity. <em>Cf. </em>5 V.I.C. \u00a7 37(a) (\u201c'[A|n action may be commenced by his personal representatives.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 78 (\u2018\u201cIn case of the death or disability of a party, the court may . . . allow the action to be continued by ... his personal representatives.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 76(d) (\u2018\u201cThe action shall be brought by the decedent\u2019s personal representative, who shall recover for the benefit of the decedent\u2019s survivors and estate all damages.\u201d). This representative capacity was at the heart of the Court\u2019s concern and the reason why the Court requested supplemental briefing</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Virgin Islands law does not define the phrase \u2018\u201cpersonal representative\u201d \u2014 at least not in the context of prosecuting or defending civil actions in court. <em>But cf. </em>15 V.I.C. \u00a7 1-201(35) (\u201c \u2018Personal representative\u2019 includes executory administrator, successor personal representative, special administrator, and persons who perform substantially the same function under the law governing their status.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In fact, \u2018\u201c[t]he Virgin Islands Code does not require that courts appoint personal representatives or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>authorize them to do so. If courts do have the authority to appoint a personal representative, it may be inherent in the authority to supervise probate proceedings.\u201d <em>In re Alumina Dust Claims, </em>67 V.I. 172, 192 n.13 (Super. Ct. 2017). Courts are not left without any guidance, however. Section 4901 of title 5 of the Virgin Islands Code, which governs the basis exercising personal jurisdiction over persons outside the Territory, defines the term person to \u201cinclude[ ] an individual, his executor, administrator, or other personal representative.\u201d One could interpret from the placement of the terms \u2018\u201cexecutor\u201d and \u2018\u201cadministrator\u201d before the phrase \u2018\u201cpersonal representative\u201d that a personal representative is akin to an executor or an administrator, both of which require appointment by a court. <em>(But cf. </em>Supp. Br. 10-11 (\u201cThe dichotomy is even more clear in \u00a7 4901, which specifically distinguishes between an executor, administrator, or other personal representative, delineating those capacities in the disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 manner and showing that while an \u2018executor\u2019 and an \u2018administrator\u2019 are species of personal representative, they are not the only way the term is used.\u201d).) Additional support for viewing the terms synonymously can be found in the Probate Code, specifically section 601 of title 15 of the Virgin Islands Code, which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-3\">causes of action by one person against another, whether arising on contract or otherwise, survive to the personal representatives of the former and against the personal representatives of the latter. When the cause of action survives, as herein provided, the executors or administrators may maintain an action thereon against the party against whom the cause of action accrued, or, after his death, against his personal representatives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Here too \u201cexecutor\u201d and \u201cadministrator\u201d appear to be used interchangeably with \u201cpersonal representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">If the phrase \u201cpersonal representative\u201d does not include \u201cexecutor\u201d and \u201cadministrator,\u201d meaning these terms of art are not synonymous, then section 601, which directs that the executor or administrator must continue the action after death, directly conflicts with sections 78 of title 5, which directs that the personal representative continues the action after death. <em>Compare </em>15 V.I.C. \u00a7 601 (\u201cWhen the cause of action survives, as herein provided, the executors or administrators may maintain an action thereon against the party against whom the cause of action accrued, or, after his death, against his personal representatives.\u201d), <em>with </em>5 V.I.C. \u00a7 78 (\u201cIn case of the death or disability of a party, the court may . . . allow the action to be continued by ... his personal representatives.\u201d). But if executors and administrators are simply two types, or species as the Personal Representatives put it, of personal representatives \u2014 just as magistrates, judges, and justices are all types of judicial officers \u2014 then there is no conflict. A personal representative would include both an executor and an administrator. That would also mean that a personal representative must be either an executor or an administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The Personal Representatives argue that section 601</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">merely provides that, in the event that probate has been opened, and an executor or administrator has been appointed, that person may also pursue the survival claims available to a personal representative. Thus, Title 15 V.I.C. \u00a7 601 shows us that requiring probate to be opened is the exception, not the rule, for bringing a survival and/or wrongful death action via a personal representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">(Supp. Br. 9.) But they claim that \u201cpersons who are appointed through [m]is-cellaneous [probate] actions as \u2018personal representatives\u2019 are no less fiduciaries than are executors or those receiving Letters Testamentary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12 (citing 15 V.I.C. \u00a7 1-201(15)) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The Personal Representatives correctly stated the Court\u2019s overall concern, namely \u201cwhether an estate exists without the opening of probate. The Court expressed concern that, if an estate does not yet exist until probate is opened, then there would be no viable entity to assert and recover claims, nor would there be any estate client to whom undersigned counsel are answerable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-13. The Personal Representatives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>attempt to assuage the Court\u2019s concerns by pointing to the \u201cenacted and then repealed Uniform Probate Code of the Virgin Islands,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 13, the fact that \u201cVirgin Islands courts, both territorial and federal, have allowed personal representatives to bring survival actions without opening probate,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 14 (citations omitted), then to \u201cpersuasive authority from other jurisdictions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, and finally public policy, <em>see id. </em>at 21-22. Notwithstanding their thorough review, the concerns still remain, in large part because the Personal Representatives\u2019 analysis was, understandably, driven by the result they seek: not being required to open an estate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">To be clear, the Court\u2019s concern was not whether an estate must be opened <em>before </em>a wrongful death action can be filed. None of the cases in this litigation were commenced as wrongful death actions. Further, this Court previously held that wrongful death claims do not belong to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>decedent or her or his estate, but to the persons left behind, the survivors. <em>See Der Weer, </em>61 V.I. at 110 (\u201cBecause wrongful death actions and survival actions redress different wrongs, they benefit different parties.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>see also id. </em>at 111 (\u201cDamages a deceased person may have suffered from a personal injury are recovered in a survival action and are completely separate from, and even unrelated to, the damages of his survivors for wrongful death.\u201d). \u201cWhile both actions must be brought by a personal representative, and while the same individual could, if granted the representative authority, assert both claims in the same action, the wrongful death action is not the same as the survival action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110. This distinction is central here because, while the wrongful death action may have to \u201cbe brought by the decedent\u2019s personal representative ... for the benefit of the decedent\u2019s survivors and estate,\u201d 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 76(d), the personal representative is not acting as a fiduciary for the estate \u2014 at least not exclusively \u2014 in a wrongful death action, but for the survivors and the estate. By contrast, in a survival action, the only beneficiary is the estate. Here, the representative capacity is quite like the class representative in a class action, a point Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had made. <em>(See </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 21:20-21, Mar. 23, 2016 (\u201c[I]t\u2019s very similar to what happens in a class action, where you have a class representative.\u201d)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">You have an entity that the [cjourt has not yet created, yet that entity has interests that need to be represented in the interim until it is created. So there \u2014 courts recognize the existence of a putative class, that is a class that may exist, and the individuals in that putative class have rights that need to be protected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">So courts appoint a class representative to represent the interest of the putative class until the court can determine whether or not the class should be certified and hence come into existence, and I would say that that\u2019s the situation that we have here ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">And I think that\u2019s why that \u2014 that that mechanism exists, is so that you have an individual who can represent the interest of the estate until such time as the estate comes into fruition. Otherwise, you have the tail wagging the dog.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 22:18-23:13.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The crucial difference between wrongful death actions and survival actions is that the putative \u201centities\u201d generally are known in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>wrongful death action. They are the survivors: \u201cthe decedent\u2019s spouse, children, parents, and, when partly or wholly dependent on the decedent for support or services, any blood relatives and adoptive brothers and sisters.\u201d 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 76(b)(1). In this sense, counsel\u2019s analogy would be more apt after a class has been certified and the representative appointed. But in a survival action, who knows who the beneficiaries may be. The wrinkle in the law is that the Virgin Islands Wrongful Death Act defines the \u201cparties\u201d to a wrongful death action to include the survivors and the estate. And it is the estate that is common in both wrongful death actions and survival actions. However, \u201csurvivors,\u201d as defined by the Virgin Islands Wrongful Death Act, are not the parties to a survival action because the claims that survived the claimant\u2019s death belong to him and then to his estate after death. But if the estate does not exist, meaning formal probate proceedings have not been commenced, then the estate of the deceased plaintiff (or a deceased defendant) is like a putative party in the sense used by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">\u201c[CJomplex litigation is aptly called complex for a reason \u2014 sometimes getting to the legal issues requires the use of a scalpel and not an axe.\u201d <em>Daniel v.

The Personal Representatives are correct in one regard: an \u201cestate exists upon the death of the decedent, whether a probate has been opened or not. The opening of probate does not create an estate.\u201d (Supp. Br. 13.) The word \u201cprobate\u201d derives from Latin and means \u201cto prove.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Johnson v.

Judges, like other men, have nothing except words in which to phrase their ideas, and the limitations of language produce much perplexity in the lexicon of the law. This observation finds ready illustration in the differing and sometimes inexact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>meanings given to identical terms in decisions concerned with the probate of wills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><em>Brissie, </em>62 S.E.2d at 333 (citation omitted). If the Court was imprecise earlier, the Court elaborates here, because one of the reservations the Court had concerned potential creditors, particularly if the phrase personal representative was intended to be synonymous with the terms executor or administrator, as well as other heirs of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">If personal representatives are appointed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands through \u201cwhat are essentially <em>ex parte, </em>non-adversarial miscellaneous proceedings that give a semblance of legal status to an estate, but without formally opening an estate or, for example, giving notice to creditors or requiring that the personal representative acting on the estate\u2019s behalf be bonded,\u201d <em>Alumina Dust Claims, </em>67 V.I. at 192 n.13 (citing 15 V.I.C. \u00a7 239(a)), then indeed \u201c[c]oncerns could arise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>First, the judge presiding over the civil action has no assurances that the personal representative appointed by the Probate Court is the proper party. <em>But see </em>V.I. R. Civ. P. 25(a)(1) (\u201cIf a party dies and the claim is not extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper party.\u201d). That is, the judge presiding over the civil action does not determine whether the proposed personal representative is the proper party. Instead, the probate court makes the appointment through an <em>ex parte, </em>non-adversarial, miscellaneous probate proceeding that occurs outside of the civil action. The tail wags the dog here. What else can the judge presiding over the civil action do, other than allow substitution by the person the probate court appointed? If that is correct, it effectively deprives the judge of any discretion to decide whether to allow substitution and who to substitute. <em>Cf. In re Estate of Johnson, </em>2010 WY 63, 231 P.3d 873, 881 (2010) (\u201cThe only test of who is appointed as personal representative, despite the lack of guidance within the wrongful death act, cannot simply be who first gets to the courthouse.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Similarly, regarding creditors, must the personal representative appointed through a miscellaneous probate proceeding give notice to creditors? Virgin Islands law requires that \u201c[e]very executor or administrator shall, immediately after his appointment, publish a notice .... Such notice shall require all persons having claims against the estate to present them, with the proper vouchers, within six months from the date of the notice, to the executor or administrator.\u201d 15 V.I.C. \u00a7 391. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>executors and administrators are a \u201cspecie\u201d of personal representatives, then shouldn\u2019t even the personal representative appointed to take over a pending civil action have to give notice to creditors? Or, does the personal representative only have to commence probate proceedings and formally open an estate once judgment is entered or a settlement reached, assuming money exchanges hands? Or can the personal representative bypass probate entirely? If so, it could mean that Virgin Islands courts are unknowingly complied in helping the heirs avoid the creditors\u2019 claims of the deceased. Assume for argument\u2019s sake that a jury awards Mrs. Calixte or Clarke-Bapl\u00e1ste three million dollars in damages. Assume further that Mr. Calixte or Mr. Clarke, before they died, left a two-thousand-dollar balance due on a credit card or a five-hundred-dollar bill with a local vendor. Mrs. Calixte and Clarke-Baptiste\u2019s response to the Court\u2019s concerns is that, that\u2019s not their concern. They do not have to give notice to creditors at any time, even if after they receive a sizeable settlement, because they do not have to commence formal probate proceedings at any time. Instead, \u201cthe onus is on the <em>creditor </em>to open probate: \u2018All awards for the decedent\u2019s estate are subject to the claims of <em>creditors who have complied with the requirements of probate law </em>concerning claims.\u2019 \u201d (Supp. Br. 7-8 (quoting 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 76(e)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Lastly, if the person appointed personal representative to maintain or commence a survival action does not have to be named in a will or qualified under the law as an administrator, <em>see </em>15 V.I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 235(a), 236, then disputes could arise later over whether that person was in fact the proper party or even a proper party. <em>Cf. </em>V.I. R. Civ. P. 25(a)(1) (\u201c[T]he court may order substitution of <em>the proper party.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Two other Superior Court judges have raised similar concerns. <em>See generally Brown </em>v. <em>Lorillard, Inc., </em>ST-10-CV-692, 2012 V.I. LEXIS 107, at *5-7 (Super. Ct. Mar. 30, 2012) (\u201cWhile this Court cannot disregard the persuasive authority allowing an individual who has not received letters testamentary or letters of administration to represent a yet-to-be probated estate, the Court does question the wisdom of eliminating the initiation of probate proceedings, at least the acquisition of letters testamentary or letters of administration, and only reluctantly follows the holdings cited by Plaintiff. <em>This Court has significant reservations about allowing the substitution to take place. </em>Among those reservations are: (1) it is not clear whether decedent\u2019s son, Christian Brown, is decedent\u2019s only heir at law; (2) it is not clear whether Christian Brown will be able to actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>participate as the legal representative of the estate; (3) it is not clear whether there are any assets other than the \u2018choice in action\u2019 belonging to the estate; (4) if the will is probated, and counsel for Plaintiff becomes the executor, there could be a conflict of interest; (5) it is unclear whether the creditors of the estate are being timely advised of existing or potential assets to satisfy any indebtedness of the estate; and (6) it is unclear whether there exist any other heirs at law who may contest the will. In light of these concerns, although the Court will allow the substitution, the Court will keep a watchful eye on the proceedings, and reserve the right to reverse its decision on substitution should sufficient information surface confirming inequities.\u201d (footnote omitted)); <em>England </em>v. <em>Lorillard, Inc., </em>ST-10-CV-631, 2012 V.I. LEXIS 106, at *3-4 (Super. Ct. Jan. 23, 2012) (\u201cThe Defendants argue that without being appointed executor of Mr. England\u2019s estate, Gerald has no authority to act as a \u2018personal representative or successor in interest.\u2019 The Plaintiff asserts that because a wrongful death claim is a unified claim, it must be brought by the personal representative if only one child wants it. It does not matter whether one of the children disagrees. The Court agrees with the Plaintiff that the Wrongful Death Statute governs a party\u2019s right of action, not procedure, and as such does not prevent the Court from substituting Gerald as the Plaintiff at this time. However, there does appear to be a question as to Gerald\u2019s ability to bring a wrongful death claim without being appointed executor by the probate division. The Defendants represented that they will not contest Gerald\u2019s appointment as executor. As such, in an exercise of caution, the Court will order that the Plaintiff offer Mr. England\u2019s will for probate before requiring that Gerald file an amended complaint.\u201d (quoting 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 78)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, for example, Burton-King petitioned for appointment as personal representative to continue Mr. Burton\u2019s lawsuit, but after the Burtons had petitioned to settle Mr. Burton\u2019s estate without administration. Because the probate court already entered its final adjudication and distributed Mr. Burton\u2019s estate, the Burtons might not be able to seek relief from that final order later, should they be unable to agree among themselves on how to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>distribute whatever damages may be awarded or settlement amounts received from this lawsuit. <em>Cf. In re Estate of Watson, </em>SX-91-PB-126, 2015 V.I. LEXIS 151, at *11-15 (Super. Ct. App. Div. Mar. 19, 2015) (reopening estates governed by same law regarding relief from final judgments).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Another concern, which the Personal Representatives offered up in opposition to a personal representative having to be appointed within a formal probate proceeding, is the costs that would be incurred in such proceedings, particularly for persons, such as Mrs. Calixte, who\u2019s \u201clife is very hard right now\u201d after the death of her husband. (Calixte Affid. \u00b6 6, Ex. B. to Supp. Br.) That is a valid concern, particularly for those persons who do not leave behind a sizeable estate. As the Personal Representatives point out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">[i]n cases where the survivors have limited means, particularly those where the claims are <em>de minimis </em>or involve difficult factual or legal questions, the expense of opening probate would have the practical effect of abating, and perhaps extinguishing, claims upon the demise of the victim, the very harm that Section 77 was intended to prevent. Personal representatives, who are statutorily entitled to bring survival actions, would have to weigh the likelihood of recovery against the cost (in time, money, and effort) of opening a probate. In many instances, this dilemma would result in abandonment of valid claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">Where the only asset of the estate is a claim where the ultimate recovery may be less than the cost of probate, the claimant would have no choice but to allow the action to die with the decedent. Such a chilling effect upon litigation is not only contrary to the very purpose of Section 77, but also goes against the stated public policy of this Territory. Laws that may have a \u201cchilling effect on the ordinary citizens\u2019 willingness to bring a civil dispute to court are disfavored.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">(Supp. Br. 21-22 (quoting <em>Kiwi Constr., LLC v. Pono, </em>ST-2013-CV-011, 2016 V.I. LEXIS 1, at *8 (Super. Ct. Jan. 15, 2016) (ellipsis omitted)).) Admittedly, it would be disconcerting if probating an estate ultimately consumed all of the assets the estate had.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">While courts are sympathetic to the realities and the circumstances of the parties who come before them, courts cannot make decisions based on such sympathies. Moreover, if cost is a concern, then Burton-King should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>have sought appointment within Mr. Burton\u2019s probate case, rather than file another proceeding and thereby incur more cost. Furthermore, the Personal Representatives overlook that the costs associated with probating an estate can be waived. \u201cAny court in the Virgin Islands may authorize the commencement, prosecution, or defense of <em>any action or proceeding, </em>civil or criminal, or appeal therein, without prepayment of fees and costs, or security therefor\u201d so long as the applicant \u201cmakes affidavit that he is unable to pay the fees and costs or to give security therefor.\u201d 4 V.I.C. \u00a7 513(a) (emphasis added). Even the petitioner in a probate proceeding can proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>upon the proper showing. Additionally, courts can \u201cappoint an attorney to represent any person unable to employ counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 513(d). Hence, the Personal Representatives\u2019 concerns about attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 as if hiring an attorney were mandatory in probate proceedings \u2014 are also not persuasive. <em>{Cf </em>Waldman Affid. \u00b6 9 (\u201cBased upon my experience with probate proceedings in St. Croix, the person or entity that petitions to open a probate with administration <em>will incur </em>initial costs as follows: Court Filing Fee for Petition $150.00, Newspaper Publication for Notice to Creditors $311.00; <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees </em>$1,000.00.\u201d (emphasis and semicolons added) (formatting altered), Ex. A to Supp. Br.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">Ultimately, however, the Personal Representatives prevail here because on March 31, 2017, the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands promulgated Rule 17(e) of the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 17(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">In wrongful death suits filed under 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 76 and in survival actions filed under 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 77, the action may be prosecuted in the name of a plaintiff identified in the complaint as acting as a personal representative. The named plaintiff shall serve as personal representative throughout the proceeding unless replaced by order of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The Reporter\u2019s Note<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to Rule 17 further explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">To avoid any <em>unnecessary requirement to open an estate, </em>and to permit swift commencement of proceedings where required for statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>limitations or other purposes, this subpart of the rule provides that an action may be prosecuted in the name of a plaintiff who is identified in the complaint as acting as a personal representative, although court appointment to that position has not at that time been made. The named plaintiff will serve as personal representative throughout the proceeding unless replaced by order of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\"><em>Id. </em>(Rptr.\u2019s Note) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Recently, the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands held that it \u201cdoes not abandon its collective knowledge when it exercises its rulemaking authority, and surely it would not knowingly promulgate any rule it regarded as invalid.\u201d <em>Mills-Williams v. Mapp, </em>67 V.I. 574, 586 n.6 (V.I. 2017) (quotation marks, ellipsis, brackets, and citation omitted). There, the question concerned whether, after the adoption of the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure, complaints, tested by motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim, were subject to the more stringent plausibility standard as adopted by the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands in <em>Bell Atlantic Corporation </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007), and <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009), and followed by the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands in <em>Joseph v. Bureau of Corrections, </em>54 V.I. 644 (V.I. 2011), or the more liberal notice pleading standard, also adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957), but set aside by <em>Twombly. See </em>550 U.S. at 563. After promulgating Virgin Islands Rule of Civil Procedure 8, which includes the following Reporter\u2019s Note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">Language has been included in Rule 8(a) to note that practice in the Virgin Islands continues to adhere to the traditional \u201cnotice\u201d pleading ethos as many states and territories have chosen to do, applying an approach that declines to enter dismissals of cases based on failure to allege specific facts which, if established, plausibly entitle the pleader to relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">V.I. R. Civ. P. 8 (Rptr.\u2019s Note). In <em>Mills-Williams, </em>the Virgin Islands Supreme Court answered whether the Reporter\u2019s Note has the status of law, explaining that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">was certainly aware of its prior precedents applying the plausibility standard, yet nevertheless chose to adopt a rule of civil procedure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>expressly and unambiguously eliminated the plausibility standard, any precedents of this Court construing the former rule must prospectively yield to the plain language of the new rule to the extent the new rule differs from the old rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><em>Mills-Williams, </em>67 V.I. at 586 n.6. <em>See also id. </em>at 585 (\u201cVirgin Islands Rule of Civil Procedure 8 expressly states that the Virgin Islands is a notice pleading jurisdiction, and the Reporter\u2019s Note <em>eliminates any doubt that </em>this language is calculated to apply an approach that <em>declines </em>to enter dismissals of cases based on failure to allege specific facts which, if established, plausibly entitle the pleader to relief. Therefore, going forward, it is clear that the adoption of Rule 8 of the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure supersedes our prior precedents which imposed the <em>Twombly </em>plausibility standard by virtue of the now-amended Superior Court Rule 7, and restores the notice pleading regime that had previously been in effect.\u201d (quotation marks, brackets, citations, and footnote omitted) (first emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">In this instance, there is no prior precedent from the Virgin Islands Supreme Court concerning the appointment of personal representatives to commence or continue survival actions or to commence wrongful death actions because the issue has not been raised on appeal yet. But members of the Virgin Islands Bar did raise concerns to the Supreme Court when the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure were opened for comment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Virgin Islands Supreme Court was aware of these comments. Presumably, like <em>Mills-Williams, </em>the Court nevertheless chose to adopt a rule of civil procedure that expressly and unambiguously eliminated the requirement to open an estate as a prerequisite for bringing or maintaining a wrongful death claim or a survival claim. Whatever concerns this Court may have had are now moot. <em>Cf. Der Weer, </em>60 V.I. 91, 98-99 (Super. Ct. 2014) (\u201cA motion becomes moot when something occurs after a motion is filed that resolves the issues raised in that motion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>(2) Motions for Leave to Substitute</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Turning to the motion for leave to substitute, notwithstanding the concerns raised above, the Court will grant each motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Personal Representatives sought leave to substitute within two years after the date of each respective plaintiffs death. <em>See </em>5 V.I.C. \u00a7 78 (\u201cIn case of the death or disability of a party, the court may at any time within two years thereafter, on motion, allow the action to be continued by or against his personal representatives or successor in interest.\u201d)- The requests were also made on motion, served on Defendants. Defendants did not object to any of the motions when they were filed, nor voiced a concern after the rules changed. Accordingly, the Court will grant each motion by separate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The Court will also construe each motion for leave to amend as including a request for permission to substitute. \u201cOnly the parties to a case may file documents and make requests of the court in that case.\u201d <em>Alumina Dust Claims, </em>67 V.I. at 188 (collecting cases). The Personal Representatives are not parties to any of these cases. Technically, they did not ask to be made parties. Instead, they filed motions to amend complaints that they, themselves, never filed. That is improper. However, Defendants did not object. Moreover, the Personal Representatives\u2019 intent was clearly to substitute into these cases. Rather than elevate form over function here, the Court will construe each motion to amend as a motion for leave to substitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">However, the Court cannot allow the proposed amended complaints the Personal Representatives submitted. Each proposed complaint is captioned \u201csurvival and/or wrongful death complaint.\u201d (Proposed Amend. Compl., Ex. B, Amend. Mot. for Leave to File Amend. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Compl., <em>Augustin v. Hess Oil V.I. Corp., </em>SX-13-CV-427, filed June 7, 2017.) Pleading claims in the alternative is permissible. <em>Cf. </em>V.I. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(3); <em>accord Mitchell, </em>67 V.I. at 286 n.7 (\u201c[A] plaintiff may plead different, even inconsistent, claims in the alternative, and also pursue alternate theories of relief.\u201d)- But survival achon is not an alternative claim to a wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">When Plaintiffs filed their amended complaints, <em>cf. Asbestos, Catalyst &amp; Silica, </em>67 V.I. 544 (rejecting master complaint and ordering each plaintiff to refile individually), they each asserted the same two claims: premises liability/gross negligence (count one) and supplying a chattel dangerous for its intended use (count two). The proposed second amended complaints the Personal Representatives attached to their motions add the word \u2018\u201csurvival\u201d after count one and count two and further add a third count titled: \u201cSURVIVAL and/or WRONGFUL DEATH UNDER 5 VIC 76 and 77.\u201d (Proposed Amend. Compl. 5.) In their supplemental brief, the Personal Representatives offer the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">Recognizing that the wrongful death claim requires proof of causahon that the lung injury was a substantial contributing cause of the death, plaintiffs have pled wrongful death \u201cand/or\u201d survival claims. Plaintiffs have not used the terms \u201cand/or\u201d to indicate that the claims are mutually exclusive . . . but rather to make clear that they still intend to present survival claims in the event they do not prevail on the question of substantially related causation of death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">(Supp. Br. 6 n.5.) This is a misunderstanding of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">A wrongful death claim is not a fallback in the event a survival claim fails. Rather, a wrongful death claim is an entirely separate and independent claim. Again, while a personal representative prosecutes both actions, survival claims and wrongful death claims are not alternative claims for relief. \u201cWrongful death is a new claim \u2014 with its own elements that must be alleged in a complaint and proven at trial \u2014 whereas a survival claim is not really a claim. It is merely a vehicle for pursuing someone else\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Der Weer, </em>64 V.I. at 138 (quotation marks, brackets, and citahon omitted). By survival claim or survival achon, all that is meant is that the claim survives the death of the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Understandably, the two terms get conflated because people hear survival and think survivors. But the survivors\u2019 claim is for wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>death. The survival claim, or survival action, is what the decedent brought or could have brought. If Mr. Augustin or Mr. Redo, for example, had sued someone for trespass or for conversion before they died, then Charissa or Mrs. Redo could continue those claims as the personal representative. In these cases, the survival claims are counts one and two \u2014 the claims these men asserted against Hess and HOVIC before they died. Count three can be a wrongful death claim. But it must be plead as such. Since Hess and HOVIC did not object, the Court will grant the Personal Representatives leave to amend to plead a third count as a wrongful death claim, should they so choose.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">For the reasons stated above, the Court will grant the motion for leave to exceed the page limits, notwithstanding that the motion was filed the same day as the brief and not before. The Court will also construe each motion for leave to file an amended complaint as including a request for permission to substitute a personal representative on behalf of the named plaintiffs and grant the substitutions, notwithstanding the concerns raised in these cases regarding the appointment of a personal representative through a formal probate proceeding. The law has changed since these concerns were first raised. The Court will order the captions amended to reflect that a personal representative on behalf of an estate and possibly the survivors of the deceased is prosecuting each case. The Court will also grant the Personal Representatives leave to supplement the complaints to state claims for wrongful death if appropriate. However, the proposed amended/supplemental complaints submitted in conjunction with the Personal Representatives\u2019 motions must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">An appropriate order follows in each case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-6\"> The Virgin Islands does not have true probate courts yet.

The Virgin Islands Legislature adopted the Uniform Probate Code in 2009, with an effective date of May 1, 2010. <em>See generally Rogers </em>v. <em>Kodran, </em>SX-09-CV-223, 2012 V.I.

While courts should strive to harmonize statutes, here harmony might be discordant for the Personal Representatives because section 1-201(35) defines \u201cpersonal representative\u201d similarly as the Court does, as a catch-all for executors, administrators, and the like.

And the Personal Representatives also ignore <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lorillard. Inc., </em>ST-10-CV-692, 2012 V.I. LEXIS 107 (Super. Ct. Mar. 30, 2012), and <em>England v. Lorillard, Inc., </em>ST-10-CV-631, 2012 V.I. LEXIS 106 (Super. Ct. Jan. 23, 2012), discussed further below. Based on the Personal Representatives\u2019 invitation, the Court has endeavored to explain its concerns, notwithstanding that the law changed recently. <em>Cf. Companion Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>66 V.I. 562, 569 (V.I. 2017) (\u201c[R]ules... have the force of law, and are to be interpreted and construed in the same manner as statutes.\u201d (citations omitted)). <em>But cf.

Pursuant to Rule 1-1, the new rules govern in all civil actions pending as of March 31, 2017, the date the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure took effect unless the judge \u201cmakes an express finding that applying\u201d the new rules \u201cin a particular' previously-pending action would be infeasible or would work an injustice.\u201d V.I. R. Civ. P. 1-1 (c)(2)(B). Because these motions were filed before Rule 25(a) was promulgated, the Court applies the procedure in effect at the time, section 78 of title 5 of the Virgin Islands Code. <em>Accord Edwards, </em>2017 V.I. LEXIS 94, at *5 n.3 (\u201c[R]ather than reaching back in time. Rule 1-1 must require that the rules in effect prior to March 31, 2017 continue to govern motions pending as of that date, but for all motions filed after March 31, 2017, the new rules will apply unless application to the case (not a particular' motion) would be unjust or infeasible.\u201d (citing <em>Webster </em>v. <em>FirstBank P.R., </em>66 V.I. 514, 519 n.3 (V.I. 2017)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
