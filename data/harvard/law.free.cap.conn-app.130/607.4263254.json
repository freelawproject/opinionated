On appeal the defendant claims that (1) his due process right to a fair trial, as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, was violated when the state elicited testimony describing his silence after he had received a <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>warning in violation of <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976), and (2) the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation when it restricted his cross-examination of the state\u2019s key witnesses. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On October 29, 2006, the defendant, Roberto Sanchez, Raul Pagan, Kevin Glenn and another individual, indentified only as \u201cR-Dot,\u201d devised a plan to rob a delivery driver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> R-Dot, using his cell phone, placed an order for two pizzas, buffalo wings and two bottles of soda with Crossroads Pizza and requested that the order be delivered to an abandoned house at 297 Dover Street in Bridgeport. R-Dot informed the person who took his order that he would pay with a one hundred dollar bill and requested that the delivery driver bring sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>change to accommodate his payment. Paulo Carvalho, worked as a delivery driver at Crossroads Pizza and was assigned to deliver R-Dot\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">At approximately 8 p.m., Carvalho arrived at 297 Dover Street with the pizza order. Sanchez and Pagan were waiting for him on the porch, and the defendant, R-Dot and Glenn waited in a dark alley adjacent to the house. Sanchez informed Carvalho that the pizzas were for him but that Carvalho would need to wait to be paid because his mother was upstairs in the bathroom. Carvalho placed the heavy pizzas on the stoop, and then Sanchez pushed him off the stairs. The defendant, R-Dot and Glenn then immediately exited the alley and attacked Carvalho from behind. The defendant, R-Dot, Glenn, Sanchez and Pagan beat Carvalho and dragged him into the alley. During the assault, Glenn took Carvalho\u2019s money and another member of the group took his cell phone. Pagan took the bottles of soda. The defendant, R-Dot, Glenn, Sanchez and Pagan then retreated to Glenn\u2019s basement, where they split the money and ate the food. Carvalho managed to return to Crossroads Pizza where an ambulance was summoned, and the incident was reported to the police. Carvalho was taken to Bridgeport Hospital where he was treated for lacerations to his face, a broken nose, broken ribs and an injury to his knee that required surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">During the subsequent police investigation, Dennis Martinez, a detective with the robbery division of the Bridgeport police department, obtained the cell phone number of Sanchez\u2019 mother.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After Martinez spoke with Sanchez\u2019 father, Sanchez was brought to the police station two days after the robbery and gave a written statement to police. In his statement, Sanchez admitted to participating in the robbery of Carvalho and implicated the defendant, Glenn, R-Dot and Pagan. Six days later, Pagan gave a written statement to the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>admitting his participation in the crime and implicated the same parties. The defendant later was arrested and charged with one count each of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (1), conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-134 (a) (1) and assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (4).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The defendant\u2019s first trial resulted in a verdict of not guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery and a hung jury and mistrial with respect to the remaining two counts. Thereafter, the defendant was again charged with robbery in the first degree and assault in the first degree. The defendant\u2019s second trial resulted in a verdict of guilty on both counts. The court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of seven years incarceration followed by three years of special parole. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The defendant first claims that his due process right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution was violated when the state elicited testimony describing his post-<em>Miranda </em>silence in violation of <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 610.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant calls our attention to four instances in the record where he claims that the state improperly elicited testimony of, or commented on, his failure to reveal his alibi to police. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Because the defendant did not preserve his claims at trial he seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The following additional facts are necessary to resolve this claim. At trial, Martinez testified that he visited the defendant\u2019s home twice during his investigation of the robbery. The first visit ended abruptly when Martinez voiced his suspicion that the defendant was involved in the robbery. After Martinez obtained an arrest warrant for the defendant, he visited the defendant\u2019s home a second time to take him into custody. Martinez further testified that he \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d that he gave the defendant a <em>Miranda </em>warning, although the record is unclear precisely when it was given. Martinez also testified that he did not speak with the defendant again after the two encounters with him at the defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">We set forth the legal principles that guide our analysis and our standard of review. \u201cIn <em>Doyle </em>[v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 610] . . . the United States Supreme Court held that the impeachment of a defendant through evidence of his silence following his arrest and receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings violates due process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>298 Conn. 537, 580, 4 A.3d 1176 (2010). Likewise, our Supreme Court has \u201crecognized that it is also fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process for the state to use evidence of the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence as affirmative proof of guilt . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Id., 581. <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings inform a person of his right to remain silent and assure him, at least implicitly, that his silence will not be used against him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Berube, </em>256 Conn. 742, 752, 775 A.2d 966 (2001). \u201cBecause it is the <em>Miranda </em>warning itself that carries with it the promise of protection . . . the prosecution\u2019s use of silence <em>prior </em>to the receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not violate due process.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 753. Therefore, as a factual predicate to an alleged <em>Doyle </em>violation, the record must demonstrate that the defendant received a <em>Miranda </em>warning prior to the period of silence that was disclosed to the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 531, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986); see also <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir, </em>455 U.S. 603, 605-606, 102 S. Ct. 1309, 71 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1982). The defendant\u2019s claim raises a question of law over which our review is plenary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fluker, </em>123 Conn. App. 355, 363, 1 A.3d 1216, cert. denied, 298 Conn. 931, 5 A.3d 491 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The defendant first calls our attention to testimony that the state elicited from Martinez during direct examination in its case-in-chief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After a review of the record, however, we conclude that Martinez commented only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>on the defendant\u2019s failure to reveal his alibi to police <em>prior to </em>his arrest, and the record lacks any indication that the defendant had received a <em>Miranda </em>warning prior to his arrest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 524-25 (no <em>Doyle </em>violation where record lacks indication that <em>Miranda </em>warning preceded referenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>silence); see also <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir, </em>supra, 455 U.S. 603. Accordingly, this claim fails under <em>Golding's </em>first prong. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Berube, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The defendant next claims that a <em>Doyle </em>violation occurred during the state\u2019s redirect examination of Martinez.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Our review of the record, however, reveals that defense counsel opened the door to this line of questioning during her cross-examination of Martinez.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[A] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>party who delves into a particular subject during the examination of a witness cannot object if the opposing party later questions the witness on the same subject.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 13, 509 A.2d 493 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">During her cross-examination of Martinez, defense counsel elicited testimony that the defendant had cooperated with police during their investigation and his subsequent arrest. Moreover, defense counsel asked Martinez four times whether he had asked the defendant if he had an alibi, thereby creating the impression that the defendant had failed to disclose any alibi during his arrest solely because he was not asked to do so. Thus, defense counsel sought to explain the defendant\u2019s failure to offer an alibi to police during his arrest and implied that his silence was of probative value. The state was therefore permitted to rebut this inference. Several of the United States Courts of Appeals have recognized an exception to <em>Doyle </em>when evidence of the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence is used to impeach testimony pertaining to the defendant\u2019s level of cooperation during arrest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>17 F.3d 935, 941 (7th Cir. 1994); <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>556 F.2d 1242, 1245 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1019, 98 S. Ct. 742, 54 L. Ed. 2d 767 (1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Conlin, </em>551 F.2d 534, 537 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 831, 98 S. Ct. 114, 54 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1977); <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>v. <em>Fairchild, </em>505 F.2d 1378, 1383 (5th Cir. 1975) (\u201c[h]aving . . . raised the question of his cooperation with the law enforcement authorities, [the defendant] opened the door to a full and not just a selective development of that subject\u201d). Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the colloquy identified by the defendant did not contain a violation of <em>Doyle, </em>and, consequently, his claim fails under <em>Golding's </em>third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Finally, we conclude that the prosecutor did not violate <em>Doyle </em>during his cross-examination of the defendant<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or during rebuttal closing argument to the jury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>These claims are controlled by <em>State </em>v. Turner, 252 Conn. 714, 735, 751 A.2d 372 (2000), in which our Supreme Court \u201creject[ed] [the defendant\u2019s] argument that <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 619, blocks the effort by the state to demonstrate that [the defendant\u2019s] alibi was recently fabricated.\u201d As in <em>Turner, </em>the state\u2019s questions on cross-examination and comment during rebuttal closing argument in the present case, which were very similar in substance to those made by the state in <em>Turner, </em>addressed the defendant\u2019s general failure to disclose his alibi to police, not his silence after he had been taken into custody and given a <em>Miranda </em>warning. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>supra, 734 n.20. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claims fail under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The defendant next claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the court improperly restricted the scope of his cross-examination of the state\u2019s two key witnesses in violation of his sixth amendment right to confrontation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our analysis. At the defendant\u2019s second trial, the state filed two motions in limine seeking to preclude the defendant from adducing certain evidence that had been admitted at the defendant\u2019s first trial. After hearing argument from the parties, the court ruled that the defendant was not permitted to present any evidence of: (1) Sanchez\u2019 membership in a gang, which Sanchez had admitted to in his written statement to police, (2) the facts surrounding an attempted robbery of a Chinese food delivery driver that had happened at the same location one week prior to the charged crime, and that Pagan and Sanchez had admitted to committing in their written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>statements to police, (3) Sanchez\u2019 alleged false accusation of the defendant\u2019s brother in a different juvenile matter occurring one month before the charged crime and (4) Sanchez\u2019 juvenile probation status.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The defendant claims that the court violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation by restricting his ability to impeach Sanchez and Pagan by inquiring into these areas. Having failed to advance this sixth amendment argument at trial, the defendant seeks review of his claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right was not violated, and, consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under <em>Golding's </em>third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">We first set forth our standard of review and the legal principles that guide our discussion. \u201cThe sixth amendment to the [United States] constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to confront the witnesses against him. . . . The primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination . . . and an important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 248-49, 630 A.2d 577 (1993), on appeal after remand, 234 Conn. 683, 663 A.2d 339 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1140, 116 S. Ct. 972, 133 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1996). Thus, \u201c[t]he confrontation clause . . . requires that the defendant be accorded some irreducible minimum of cross-examination into matters affecting the reliability and credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>198 Conn. 220, 224, 502 A.2d 400 (1985). \u201c[B]ecause cross-examination is the principal means by which the credibility of witnesses and the truth of their testimony is tested . . . [c]ross-examination concerning motive, interest, bias or prejudice ... is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>229 Conn. 60, 69-70, 640 A.2d 553 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">\u201c[T]he confrontation clause does not [however] suspend the rules of evidence to give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>298 Conn. 1, 9, 1 A.3d 76 (2010). \u201c[T]rial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the [confrontation [c]lause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things . . . prejudice, confusion of the issues ... or interrogation that is . . . only marginally relevant. . . . Thus, the confrontation right is not absolute and is subject to reasonable limitation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 70-71. \u201cAlthough it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine the extent of cross-examination . . . the preclusion of sufficient inquiry into <em>a particular matter tending to show motive, bias and interest </em>may result in a violation of the constitutional requirements of the sixth amendment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">\u201cWe traditionally apply a two part analysis to determine whether a party has been deprived of effective cross-examination. First, we determine whether the defendant received the minimum opportunity for cross-examination of adverse witnesses required by the constitution.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Liborio A., </em>93 Conn. App. 279, 286, 889 A.2d 821 (2006). This constitutional requirement is met if the court allows \u201cthe defendant to expose to the jury facts from which the jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness. ... In determining whether a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination has been unduly restricted, we consider the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>excluded inquiry, whether the field of inquiry was adequately covered by other questions that were allowed, and the overall quality of the cross-examination viewed in relation to the issues actually litigated at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Swinton, </em>268 Conn. 781, 833, 847 A.2d 921 (2004). \u201cWhether limitations on impeachment, including cross-examination, are so severe as to violate the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment is a question of law reviewed de novo.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>72 Conn. App. 831, 837, 806 A.2d 1139, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 924, 814 A.2d 379 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Second, if the constitutional minimum is met, we then consider whether the trial court\u2019s restriction of cross-examination amounted to an abuse of discretion under the rules of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Liborio A., </em>supra, 93 Conn. App. 286. To establish an abuse of discretion, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the restrictions placed on his cross-examination were \u201c \u2018clearly prejudicial,\u2019 \u201d and we apply every reasonable presumption in favor of the court\u2019s ruling. Id., 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">After a thorough examination of the record, we conclude that the court did not violate the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation. The defendant was not unduly restricted in his cross-examination of Pagan and Sanchez for purposes of establishing their motive and interest to testify favorably for the state or their prejudice and bias against the defendant. The defendant first claims that Sanchez\u2019 admitted gang membership was relevant to show that both Sanchez and Pagan had an interest in offering testimony against the defendant in order to protect other gang members who had actually participated in the robbery. As noted by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>court in its ruling, however, there was no evidence from the first trial that the robbery was gang related, nor was there any evidence that Pagan was also in the gang.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cA defendant . . . may introduce only relevant evidence, and, if the proffered evidence is not relevant, its exclusion is proper and the defendant\u2019s right [of confrontation] is not violated.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cerreta, </em>260 Conn. 251, 261, 796 A.2d 1176 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The defendant next asserts that the facts surrounding the attempted robbery of the Chinese food delivery driver that Pagan and Sanchez had admitted to were also relevant to the witnesses\u2019 motive or interest because the jury would be unable to assess the magnitude of the benefit that the witnesses were receiving from the state by not being prosecuted for such a crime without understanding the severity of the crime.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court, however, did allow the defendant to impeach the witnesses for motive by ruling that the defendant could ask Sanchez and Pagan if they had participated in an attempted robbery prior to the crime charged against the defendant and whether the state had prosecuted them for this crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The record reveals that the defendant cross-examined Sanchez on this issue and demonstrated to the jury that Sanchez had participated in an attempted robbery four days prior to the robbery of Carvalho and that the state did not prosecute him for that crime. In addition, Sanchez admitted that some of his testimony at the defendant\u2019s first trial was false and that the state had provided him with immunity from charges of perjury stemming from such untruthful testimony. Finally, Sanchez acknowledged that the robbery of Carvalho was a serious crime, one for which he had been charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>only as a youthful offender and had received a lenient sentence. The defendant did not ask Pagan if he had committed the attempted robbery or if he had been charged for doing so during her cross-examination of him. \u201c[T]he [confrontation [c]lause guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 298 Conn. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The defendant also argues that evidence that Sanchez falsely had accused the defendant\u2019s brother of an unrelated crime one month prior to the robbery in the present case showed that Sanchez was biased toward the defendant\u2019s family. As noted by the court, however, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the accusation made by Sanchez against the defendant\u2019s brother was false. To the extent that this accusation, by virtue of it being made, reveals an identifiable animosity between Sanchez and the defendant\u2019s family and, thus, is probative of a bias or prejudice, the record reveals that the defendant was able to expose any such bias or prejudice to the jury by alternate means. Sanchez testified on cross-examination that the defendant\u2019s mother \u201cthrew [him] out of [her] house.\u201d The defendant\u2019s mother corroborated this fact when she testified that Sanchez was not the defendant\u2019s friend and was not allowed in her house at the time of the robbery. The defendant\u2019s mother similarly testified that Pagan was not allowed in her house at the time of the robbery and that she had banned him from the house. Our Supreme Court has \u201cconsistently held that when an accused has had the opportunity to elicit evidence of bias, not every limitation of the right to cross-examine is of constitutional dimension.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 621-22, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Finally, the defendant claims that when Sanchez gave his written statement to the police implicating himself and the defendant, he was on juvenile probation. Thus, according to the defendant, Sanchez was motivated to become \u201c \u2018locked in\u2019 \u201d to a statement to avoid being charged with a violation of probation. A review of the record, however, reveals that Sanchez gave his written statement to the police, admitting to participating in the assault and robbery of Carvalho and the attempted robbery of another delivery driver, prior to being arrested for any crime. We fail to understand how the avoidance of a violation of juvenile probation charge could serve as motive to admit to two very serious crimes with which a person has not yet been charged with. Accordingly, the court correctly concluded that Sanchez\u2019 status on juvenile probation did not tend to show motive or interest in giving a written statement favorable to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In sum, only Sanchez\u2019 allegedly false accusation of the defendant\u2019s brother was offered to establish the witnesses\u2019 motivation, interest, bias or prejudice, and this precluded field of inquiry was covered adequately by other questions. The record reveals that the defendant engaged in a thorough cross-examination of both Sanchez and Pagan and exposed to the jury the many inconsistencies between their testimony and the substance of their written statements or their testimony at the first trial. The defendant used the prior inconsistent statements of Pagan and Sanchez on multiple occasions and, similarly, refreshed their recollection with the transcripts from the defendant\u2019s first trial and their written statements. The defendant also addressed the fact that Sanchez had not told the truth during the first trial and the state had given him immunity from prosecution for perjury with respect to any contradictory testimony he gave at the second trial. Thus, the defendant had an adequate opportunity \u201cto expose to the jury facts from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>which the jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness [es].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Swinton, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 833. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation was not violated. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under <em>Golding's </em>third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Nor can we conclude that the court abused its discretion in excluding the evidence it did. The defendant has failed to carry his burden and establish that evidence of Sanchez\u2019 admitted gang membership and status on juvenile probation were probative of a material issue at trial. Moreover, the limited probative value of the facts surrounding the attempted robbery<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> was outweighed by the confusing effect the evidence could have on the jury. Finally, the court\u2019s conclusion that inquiry into Sanchez\u2019 alleged false accusation of the defendant\u2019s brother in an unrelated matter would be unduly confusing to the jury was not an abuse of discretion. The court reasoned that the evidence did not bear directly on the case and was of \u201cmarginal relevance.\u201d The court reasoned that the evidence had the potential to confuse the jury because the jury would need to resolve the issue of whether the accusation was false, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>which would require a familiarity with the facts of an unrelated case involving different people that had been dismissed. Moreover, there has been an inadequate showing that this exclusion has been clearly prejudicial to the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Liborio </em>A., supra, 93 Conn. App. 287. The defendant, consistent with his theory at trial that he would not have planned a robbery at his own home with someone who was unwelcome in his home, was able to elicit evidence that Sanchez was banned from the defendant\u2019s home by the defendant\u2019s mother. After a thorough review of the record, we conclude that the court\u2019s granting of the state\u2019s motion in limine did not constitute an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\"> See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478-79, 86 S.

We are not persuaded. We note initially that neither the United States Supreme Court nor the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has addressed this issue. Furthermore, notwithstanding the observation in <em>Angel T., </em>our Supreme Court has stated that Connecticut courts follow \u201cthe general principle that prearrest silence under circumstances where one would naturally be expected to speak may be used either as an admission or for impeachment purposes.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 522; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>206 Conn. 300, 306, 537 A.2d 1021 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>223 Conn. 299, 320, 613 A.2d 242 (1992) (question addressing defendant\u2019s silence \u201cshould not be allowed on retrial unless its context clearly indicates that it refers only to the defendant\u2019s <em>prearrest </em>silence\u201d [emphasis in original]); C.

Moreover, the record does not indicate that the defendant unambiguously invoked his right to remain silent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fluker, </em>supra, 123 Conn. App. 365-67 (analyzing whether defendant had first invoked fifth amendment right to remain silent prior to analyzing whether it was violated). We note, for example, that the defendant testified that when Martinez came to his house, he did not express his desire not to answer any of Martinez\u2019 questions; rather, he told Martinez that he didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>know anything about the robbery. Accordingly, we conclude that the state\u2019s repeated reference to the defendant\u2019s prearrest and <em>pie-Miranda </em>failure to provide police with his alibi was not a violation of the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment right to remain silent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\"> The transcript reveals the following colloquy between the prosecutor and Martinez on redirect examination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: At any time from October 29,2006, to the present date, did you ever obtain information that would have led [you to a conclusion] that the defendant was claiming an alibi?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">\u201c[Martinez]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-12\">\u201c[Martinez]: No one ever contacted us on his behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-13\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: After arresting him, did he say, you know, I have an alibi?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-14\">\u201c[Martinez]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-15\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: I was somewhere else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-16\">\u201c[Martinez]: No, he never stated anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-17\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay.
