On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the Superior Court improperly (1) interpreted General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650 (h) when it affirmed the Probate Court\u2019s appointment of the defendant attorney Robert Mirto as a neutral third party conservator<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) found that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Probate Court\u2019s denial of her application to be appointed conservator on the ground that she had an existing or potential conflict of interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse in part and affirm in part the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The following facts, as found by the court, and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the plaintiffs appeal. In 1998, the plaintiff began assisting Zurolo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>in her financial and health decisions. In 2002, the plaintiff became a cosigner on Zurolo\u2019s bank account and subsequently began signing checks for Zurolo. On February 8, 2007, the plaintiff, by way of affidavit, invoked a springing power of attorney granted to her by Zurolo. On August 30,2007, because Zurolo was exhibiting signs of dementia, the plaintiff applied to the Probate Court for the district of Orange to become conservator of Zurolo and her estate. Although the interested parties involved in the probate trial all agreed that Zurolo would be best served by the appointment of a conservator, the plaintiffs sister, Vanessa Ramadon, and Zurolo\u2019s court-appointed attorney, Theresa Nikols, advocated for having a neutral third party, and not the plaintiff, appointed as conservator.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Over the course of a four day trial, the Probate Court received testimony from nine witnesses regarding Zurolo\u2019s condition, her estate, and the qualifications of the plaintiff to become conservator. The defendant did not testify at the trial nor was there any evidence regarding his potential suitability for appointment. Indeed, his name never arose as a potential conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">On April 8, 2008, the Probate Court, by way of a memorandum of decision, found by clear and convincing evidence that a conservator should be appointed for the person and the estate of Zurolo. The Probate Court, however, denied the plaintiffs application to be appointed, finding that she acted improperly in 2005, when she personally received funds and wrote checks from Zurolo\u2019s bank account payable to herself or to cash. On the basis of this existing or potential conflict of interest, the Probate Court found that the plaintiff was disqualified from being appointed conservator pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>suant to \u00a7 45a-650 (h), as amended by Public Acts 2007, No. 07-116, \u00a7 16 (h) (P.A. 07-116).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the same time the court disqualified the plaintiff, the Probate Court appointed the defendant as conservator of Zurolo and her estate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">On April 28, 2008, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court claiming, inter alia, that the Probate Court improperly denied her application to be her mother\u2019s conservator. The plaintiff also challenged the Probate Court\u2019s appointment of the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On December 23, 2009, the Superior Court, <em>Beilis, J., </em>by way of a memorandum of decision, denied the plaintiffs appeal regarding her disqualification and the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>appointment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That court concluded that the defendant had been appointed properly as conservator pursuant to \u00a7 45a-650 (h), and rejected the plaintiffs claim that the Probate Court had a statutory obligation to conduct a hearing regarding the defendant\u2019s qualifications. The court also found that there was substantial evidence to support the Probate Court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had a conflict of interest and, consequently, the Probate Court properly denied her application to serve as her mother\u2019s conservator.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the appointment of the defendant, as a neutral third party conservator, was based on an incorrect construction of \u00a7 45a-650 (h). As noted, \u00a7 45a-650 (h) provides that, absent a designation of a proposed conservator by the conserved person, the court \u201cmay appoint any qualified person, authorized public official or corporation in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of section 45a-644.\u201d Section 45a-650 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>(h) further states that the court shall consider certain factors \u201c[i]n considering who to appoint as conservator.\u201d In this case, the Probate Court denied the plaintiffs application to be appointed conservator of the person and the estate of her mother, and, instead, without giving the parties notice of its intentions or an opportunity to be heard on the designation of the conservator, appointed the defendant. Although the court, in its memorandum of decision, stated that it had considered the factors enumerated in \u00a7 45a-650 (h), it is undisputed that there was no evidence presented as to those factors as they related to the defendant. The plaintiff contends that this deficiency renders the court\u2019s appointment of the defendant improper. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Because the question of whether \u00a7 45a-650 (h) requires the court to hear evidence before the appointment of a neutral third party conservator presents a question of statutory interpretation, our review is plenary. See <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Firtel, </em>293 Conn. 515, 525, 978 A.2d 487 (2009). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case . . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case. ... In seeking to determine that meaning . . . [General Statutes] \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter .... We recognize that terms in a statute axe to be assigned their ordinary meaning, unless context dictates otherwise . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Leak, </em>297 Conn. 524, 532-33, 998 A.2d 1182 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Faced with this task of statutory interpretation, the initial question we must answer is whether the language of \u00a7 45a-650 (h) clearly and unambiguously provides that the court may appoint a neutral third party conservator without taking evidence of the person\u2019s suitability and qualifications. We believe the silence of the statute in this regard renders the statute ambiguous. It is appropriate, therefore, for us to search the legislative history, as well as to review the entire relevant statutory scheme, in our effort to determine the meaning the legislature intended to give the language of the statute at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Public Act 07-116 made procedural changes to various Probate Court proceedings, including the appointment of conservators. Public Act 07-116 established the requirement that certain probate proceedings, including all applications for conservatorship, be heard on the record. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-645a.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Public Act 07-116, \u00a7 16, now codified as \u00a7 45a-650, pertains specifically to hearings on applications for involuntary representation. It dictates that the rules of evidence apply to all hearings and that all testimony be given under oath or affirmation. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650 (b). It also prescribes the factual findings that the Probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Court is required to make in considering an application for conservatorship and the evidentiary standards by which the court must make its determinations. For instance, \u00a7 45a-650 (a) mandates that the court require clear and convincing evidence that the court has jurisdiction, that the respondent has been given notice and that the respondent has been advised of the right to retain an attorney. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650 (a). Prior to appointing a conservator, P.A. 07-116 requires the court to find by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is incapable of managing his or her affairs or is incapable of caring for himself or herself, or both; see General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650 (f) (1) and (2); and sets forth factors for the court\u2019s consideration in making such a finding. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Although \u00a7 45a-650 (h) sets forth factors for consideration by the court in appointing a conservator, it does not prescribe the evidentiary standard by which the court must examine these factors. In fact, the statute does not specifically require that the court hear evidence pertaining to these factors. Despite the absence of explicit language regarding the evidentiary burden to be applied to these factors, or any requirement of an evidentiary hearing, the language of the statute does not plainly and unambiguously establish that the court need not take evidence in determining whom to appoint as conservator. To the contrary, a reasonable inference from the statute is that the court should base its determination on evidence adduced dming a hearing at which interested parties have the right to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In reaching this conclusion, our analysis is aided by reference to the statutory scheme as a whole. In examining the language of \u00a7 45a-650, in addition to the other provisions enacted under P.A. 07-116, it is apparent that one of the primary goals of P.A. 07-116 was to have probate proceedings recorded in order to promote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>transparency and accountability in probate proceedings, as well as to facilitate the appeals process from those proceedings. This is supported by a review of the legislative history of P.A. 07-116. The legislative history reveals that several legislators recognized the need for accountability in the probate system, and expressed the fact that this bill addressed that need. For instance, Senator Mary Ann Handley commented that the bill provides \u201ca good deal of accountability for the probate judge and the conservators who have been appointed.\u201d 50 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 2007 Sess., p. 3234. Similarly, Representative Gerald M. Fox III remarked that one of the goals of the act was to \u201censure that . . . due process safeguards are in place before a probate court interferes with an individual\u2019s civil rights by forming a conservator.\u201d 50 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16, 2007 Sess., pp. 5150-51. To that end, P.A. 07-116 requires that a record be made of the conservator proceedings. Id., p. 5151. Representative James F. Spallone echoed that sentiment in stating: \u201c[W]hat we\u2019re trying to do here is put in procedural protections to ensure that if a person\u2019s liberty interest is at stake that they will be treated fairly, and that a proper record will be kept so that if an appeal is necessary, we\u2019ll know what happened, and so that the press and public can monitor how the probate system is working with respect to conservatorships.\u201d Id., p. 5155. In the same vein, attorney Deborah Tedford, who had previously testified before the General Assembly on behalf of the Connecticut Bar Association and regularly practices in the Probate Court, expressed the importance of having a record in probate proceedings to provide some accountability in the system and to change the culture in general. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 17, 2007 Sess., pp. 5540-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The judiciary committee also heard testimony from several members of the public regarding their experience with conservators and how P.A. 07-116 would help <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>to eliminate similar problems in the future. The testimony revealed that many of the problems with conservators stemmed from those who did not know the needs or preferences of the conserved persons. Notably, one constituent complained that the Probate Court went against her mother\u2019s wishes to have her appointed as her conservator and, instead, appointed a nonfamily member, to her mother\u2019s detriment. She complained that: \u201cProbate judges have broad discretion for the selection of conservators. These are often patronage appointments which can also lead to conflicts of interest since many judges are part time and appoint those who practice before them and contribute to their elections.\u201d Id., p. 5504. That same constituent praised P.A. 07-116 for providing \u201coversight and accountability of the Probate Courts by requiring recorded hearings and findings . . . .\u201d Id., p. 5505. Royal Stark, a professor and the director of the health law clinic at Quinnipiac Law School, served on the committee charged with drafting the bill. He commented on the need to \u201ctransform the culture of the Probate Courts\u201d; id., p. 5464; and to change \u201cthe culture of informality\u201d in the probate system. Id., p. 5474. Representative Ga\u00f1 K. Hamm also noted the importance of \u201caccountability\u201d in the probate system so that there is \u201csome movement on the culture\u201d and so that the legislators \u201chave some sense that [they\u2019re] not just changing the law, [but] that [they\u2019re] changing the system.\u201d Id., p. 5473.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">From our review of these legislative proceedings, it is clear that the legislature contemplated and intended that P.A. 07-116 would result in substantial changes in the probate system, one of which being that, going forward, certain proceedings, including those involving conservatorships, would be on the record and, thus, more formal, providing accountability, transparency and due process safeguards for those involved. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>requiring a proceeding on the record, it is more reasonable to believe that the legislature also contemplated that the consideration of the factors enumerated in \u00a7 45a-650 (h) would be based upon evidence in the record rather than the alternative; that a judge could select someone arbitrarily without any evidence regarding the factors the statute requires the court to consider and without giving interested parties an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the court\u2019s selection of a conservator.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, it is only through the presentation of evidence that the court may become properly informed as to the proposed conservator\u2019s knowledge of the person\u2019s preferences regarding care and management of his or her affairs or any existing or potential conflicts of interest. Additionally, requiring that there be evidence on the record regarding a potential conservator\u2019s qualifications and suitability is consistent with the legislature\u2019s aim to establish transparency in probate proceedings. Requiring evidence regarding the factors for consideration to be on the record also helps to ensure that a proposed conserved person and other interested parties are afforded due process and that the record is adequate for appellate review by the trial court and this court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Finally, there is an absence in \u00a7 45a-650 (h) of an explicit reference to the requisite evidentiary standard for appointing a conservator, as opposed to other portions of the statute which do set forth an evidentiary standard. Those portions of the statute that set forth a higher burden of proof required for certain considerations cannot fairly be understood to suggest that one area of consideration requires evidence and, by silence regarding the level of proof required, another area of consideration requires no proof at all. Instead, a more sensible understanding of the contrasting sections is that the absence of any specification regarding the burden of proof required for the selection of a qualified conservator means only that the default burden of fair preponderance should be utilized instead of the clear and convincing standard, which must be made explicit if it is to be utilized. See <em>Goldstar Medical Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>288 Conn. 790, 819, 955 A.2d 15 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Here, although the Probate Court indicated that it considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 45a-650 (h) in appointing the defendant, necessarily implying that it found him to be qualified, the record is bereft of any evidence regarding the defendant or his qualifications to be conservator. Additionally, it is clear from the record that the interested parties in this matter did not have the opportunity to weigh in on his selection. Because the record contains no evidence regarding the defendant, any finding regarding the defendant\u2019s qualifications finds no support in the record. The appointment of the defendant was therefore arbitrary and constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The plaintiff also claims that the Probate Court improperly denied her application for conservator on the ground that there was substantial evidence that she had an existing or potential conflict.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review for appeals from a Probate Court. As noted, General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186b provides in relevant part: \u201c[T]he Superior Court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the Court of Probate as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The Superior Court shall affirm the decision of the Court of Probate unless the Superior Court finds that substantial rights of the person appealing have been prejudiced because the findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are ... clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record, or . . . arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. . . .\u201d Given that \u00a7 45a-186b was also a component of the legislature\u2019s probate reform in 2007, there is a lack of appellate jurisprudence regarding its application. See P.A. 07-116. The language of \u00a7 45a-186b, however, is virtually identical to the language used in General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 Q) of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Given the similarity of this statutory language, our application of \u00a7 4-183 (j) is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>As this court has previously noted, the scope of our review regarding an administrative appeal is restricted. A court must \u201cdetermine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or questions of fact. . . . Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency [or court], in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>113 Conn. App. 417, 422-23, 966 A.2d 773 (2009). \u201cThe substantial evidence standard is satisfied if the record provides a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Prioleau </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>116 Conn. App. 776, 781, 977 A.2d 267 (2009). \u201cAs an appellate court, we do not review the evidence to determine whether a conclusion different from the one reached could have been reached. . . . The goal of our analysis is simply to decide whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was reasonable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Zahringer </em>v. <em>Zahringer, </em>124 Conn. App. 672, 679, 6 A.3d 141 (2010). Using this standard as a backdrop, we will give deference to the Probate Court\u2019s determination of the credibility of witnesses and its factual determinations. Cf. <em>Kirei </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>47 Conn. App. 451, 457, 705 A.2d 205 (1998) (credibility of witnesses within province of hearing officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Relying on \u00a7 45a-650 (h), the Probate Court rejected the plaintiffs application, finding that she possessed an existing or potential conflict of interest. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650 (h). Whether a conflict of interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>existed is inherently a factual issue. See <em>Timber Trails Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>99 Conn. App. 768, 775, 916 A.2d 99 (2007). In support of its finding, the Probate Court cited to the plaintiffs testimony coupled with evidence that she received and wrote checks out to herself from Zurolo\u2019s bank account in 2005.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Probate Court also referred to the contentious relationship between the plaintiff and Ramadon as further evidence that the appointment of the plaintiff as conservator would not comport with the statutory requirement of implementing the least restrictive means available.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The plaintiff asserts that the Probate Court\u2019s conclusion regarding her conflict of interest cannot reasonably be drawn from the facts. Specifically, she argues that the Probate Court improperly inferred that the checks that she had written out to herself in 2005 illustrated a misappropriation of her power of attorney because, at the time, she had not invoked that power. Although it does appear that the Probate Court confused the plaintiffs authority in 2005, as a cosigner on Zurolo\u2019s bank account, with her duties under a power of attorney in 2007, we conclude that this miscalculation was harmless error which does not negate the evidentiary basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>for the Probate Court\u2019s finding that the execution of those checks, combined with the plaintiffs testimony, created an inference of impropriety and illustrated an existing or potential conflict of interest. See <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Norwich Savings Society, </em>139 Conn. 346, 350, 93 A.2d 925 (1952) (\u201c[a]n obvious mistake will be disregarded . . . where the court makes it in stating one of its conclusions, where the subordinate facts found accorded with the allegations of the pleadings and supported the judgment\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). All five checks were either made out to the plaintiff or were made out to cash, totaling $38,000.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although the plaintiff testified that the checks were gifts from her mother, she was unable to explain why these gifts did not appear in her mother\u2019s tax returns for 2005, even though she was involved in assisting Zurolo\u2019s attorney in compiling financial and tax information. Additionally, Patricia Morrissey, a registered nurse and one of Zurolo\u2019s health care providers at her assisted living community, testified that the acrimonious relationship between the plaintiff and Ramadon had a detrimental effect on Zurolo\u2019s overall well-being. During Nikols\u2019 closing remarks, she argued that she was not comfortable with either of Zurolo\u2019s daughters being appointed conservator, and that she was especially concerned given that \u201cthere is something or someone stopping people from communicating with [my client].\u201d At the time, the plaintiffs duties as power of attorney had commenced and Ramadon had limited contact with Zurolo. On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the Probate Court\u2019s determination that there was an existing or potential conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>of interest regarding the plaintiffs application to become conservator is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs application was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The judgment is reversed to the extent that it affirms the Probate Court\u2019s decision appointing the defendant as conservator and the case is remanded to the Superior Court with direction to set aside the decision of the Probate Court in that regard and to remand the case to the Probate Court for a hearing on the appointment of a neutral conservator in accordance with this opinion. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In this opinion GRUENDEL, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\"> On April 8, 2008, the Probate Court, <em>Carangelo, J., </em>appointed Mirto to be the conservator of Zurolo and of her estate. Mirto participates in this appeal in his capacity as conservator. Vanessa Ramadon, Zurolo\u2019s other daughter, is also a defendant but has not participated directly in this appeal. For convenience, we shall refer solely to Mirto as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\"> The plaintiff also claims that she should not be personally responsible for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in this action after the defendant\u2019s appointment in April, 2008. Nowhere in the Probate Court\u2019s decision or the memorandum of decision from the Superior Court are there any orders regarding whether the plaintiff should be able to collect from the estate the fees she incurred or may have incurred following the defendant\u2019s appointment. Rather, it appears that the Superior Court actually agreed with the plaintiff regarding her claim that the Probate Court incorrectly determined that her incurrence of fees prior to the defendant\u2019s appointment was improper.

In contradistinction from the majority, I do not believe that the absence of language in \u00a7 45a-650 (h), requiring that a Probate Court receive evidence on the qualifications of a neutral third party conservator, renders the plain language of the statute ambiguous. Accordingly, I dissent from part I of the majority decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1 agree with the facts set forth in the majority\u2019s opinion and will not repeat them in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In addition to the majority\u2019s enunciation of our process of statutory interpretation, I note that \u201c [t]he legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>and consistent body of law .... [T]his tenet of statutory construction . . . requires [this court] to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter. . . .

Partnership </em>v. <em>Coratolo, </em>299 Conn. 819, 828, 14 A.3d 982 (2011). \u201cA statute is ambiguous if, when read in context, it is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d Id., 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">It is against this legal backdrop that I begin by underscoring the plain language of the statute with respect to a Probate Court\u2019s authority to appoint a neutral third party conservator. Section 45a-650 (h) provides in relevant part: \u201c[I]f the court does not appoint the person appointed, designated or nominated by the respondent or conserved person, <em>the court may appoint any qualified person, </em>authorized public official or corporation in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of section 45a-644. <em>In considering who to appoint as conservator, the court shall consider </em>(1) the extent to which a proposed conservator has knowledge of the respondent\u2019s or conserved person\u2019s preferences regarding the care of his or her person or the management of his or her affairs, (2) the ability of the proposed conservator to carry out the duties, responsibilities and powers of a conservator, (3) the cost of the proposed conservator-ship to the estate of the respondent or conserved person, (4) the proposed conservator\u2019s commitment to promoting the respondent\u2019s or conserved person\u2019s welfare and independence, and (5) any existing or potential conflicts of interest of the proposed conservator.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>(Emphasis added.) I construe this language to be plain and unambiguous when read in context with the statute as a whole. It specifies clearly that if the Probate Court does not appoint the person nominated by petition to be conservator, then it may, at its discretion, appoint any qualified person. Prior to any appointment, \u00a7 45a-650 (h) mandates only that the Probate Court \u201cshall consider\u201d the enumerated factors set forth in the statute. In the present case, after disqualifying the plaintiffs petition to be conservator because of a conflict of interest, the Probate Court stated expressly, \u201c[h]aving considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 45a-650 (h) . . . and the evidence obtained through this trial, this court appoints attorney Robert Mirto ... as the conservator of the person of [Rose Zurolo] and as conservator of the estate of [Zurolo].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Within the context of the statute, the court went no further than was expressly provided by the legislature. See <em>Wilton Meadows Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Coratolo, </em>supra, 299 Conn. 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The majority contends, however, that the plain language of \u00a7 45a-650 (h) is rendered ambiguous because there is no guidance in this particular section with respect to whether the court must receive evidence pertaining to the suitability and qualifications in the appointment of a neutral third party conservator. I note, however, that statutory silence does not immediately or necessarily equate to ambiguity. See <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>296 Conn. 594, 605-606, 996 A.2d 729 (2010) (statutory silence regarding additional requirements that managerial employees exercise independent judgment did not render statute ambiguous); <em>Wilton Meadows Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Coratolo, </em>supra, 299 Conn. 829-30 (statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>silence with respect to spousal liability of nursing home expenses not ambiguous).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">I do not agree that the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 45a-650 (h), in conjunction with General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186 (a), will yield absurd and unworkable results or is ambiguous as the majority posits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plain language of \u00a7 45a-650 (h) instructs that a Probate Court must appoint the person nominated by the conserved person, unless the person declines or \u201cthere is substantial evidence to disqualify such person\u201d; however, in order to appoint a conservator subsequent to such a disqualification, the court is obligated only to <em>consider </em>the enumerated factors in the statute. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650 (h). I presume that by using different language to distinguish between disqualifying and appointing a conservator, the legislature intended to continue to allow Probate Courts the discretion to appoint a conservator without a hearing when there is substantial evidence to disqualify a petitioner. See <em>Dias </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>v. <em>Grady, </em>292 Conn. 350, 361, 972 A.2d 715 (2009) (\u201cwhen the legislature uses different language [within a statute], the legislature intends a different meaning\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Consequently, I agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that in circumstances in which the legislature has intended a specific evidentiary standard with respect to conservatorships, it has provided for such a standard expressly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650 (f) (1) (\u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard required to render decision that respondent is incapable of managing own affairs in order to appoint conservator); General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650 (f) (2) (\u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard required to render decision that respondent is incapable of caring for himself or herself); General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650 (a) and (b) (Probate Court must conduct hearing and apply normal rules of evidence for involuntary representation). Given the breadth of substantive reform ushered in by Public Acts 2007, No. 07-116 (P.A. 07-116), the absence of any additional requirements on a probate judge prior to appointing a neutral third party conservator is, in a word, conspicuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u201cWhere a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject . . . is significant to show that a different intention existed. . . . That tenet of statutory construction is well grounded because [t]he General Assembly is always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernando A., </em>294 Conn. 1, 21, 981 A.2d 427 (2009). Certainly, if the legislature had intended to require a hearing or a specific evidentiary standard regarding the appointment of a neutral third party conservator it could have expressly done so, as it has clearly articulated in other subsections of \u00a7 45a-650. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650 (a) and (b), and (f) (1) and (2). Cf. <em>Wilton Meadows Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Coratolo, </em>supra, 299 Conn. 826 (if legislature had intended to extend spousal liability to include nursing home expenses, it could have done so expressly); <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 296 Conn. 605 (if legislature had intended to impose additional statutory requirements regarding duties of managerial employees it could have done so expressly).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">A plain reading of the statute, however, reveals that the legislature has chosen specifically not to mandate such a requirement in circumstances such as these. Moreover, the language contained in the statute, prior to the reforms instituted by P.A. 07-116 regarding a Probate Court\u2019s authority to appoint a conservator in similar situations, is virtually identical to the language of \u00a7 45a-650 (h).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This only serves to buttress the point that the legislature\u2019s omission to require an increased evidentiary standard was purposeful. It is firmly established that \u201c[w]e are not permitted to supply statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>language that the legislature may have chosen to omit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 296 Conn. 605. Nor are we permitted to go any further than the legislature has gone. See <em>Wilton Meadows Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Coratolo, </em>supra, 299 Conn. 826. Despite these precedential prohibitions, I believe that the majority has substituted its understanding of what the statute should have expressed in place of what was a purposeful omission by the legislature by interpreting ambiguity where none exists. Although I am sensitive to what the majority is aspiring to accomplish, the result of that endeavor requires this court to legislate. This we cannot do. See <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 65, 480 A.2d 425 (1984). Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment affirming the Probate Court\u2019s appointment of Mirto as conservator of Zurolo\u2019s person and estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\"> I join the majority\u2019s conclusion that there was sufficient evidence in the record to affirm the Probate Court\u2019s determination that there was either an existing or potential conflict of interest regarding the application of the plaintiff, Jannine Falvey, to become conservator of her mother\u2019s estate. I also agree with the conclusion that the plaintiffs claim pertaining to attorney\u2019s fees is not properly before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\"> I note that neither Zurolo\u2019s court-appointed attorney nor Vanessa Rama-don, the plaintiffs sister, opposed the appointment of Mirto as a neutral third party conservator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\"> When read in context, the plain language of the statute illustrates that the legislature sought purposefully to maintain the Probate Court\u2019s ability to appoint a conservator in circumstances such as these given the adequate statutory protections in place after the conservator is appointed by the court. For example, \u201c[t]he Probate Court is under an affirmative duty to protect the assets of a [conserved person\u2019s] estate. . . . The court, and not the conservator, is primarily entrusted with the care and management of the [conserved person\u2019s] estate, and, in many respects, <em>the conservator is but the agent of the court.\" </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marcus\u2019 Appeal from Probate, </em>199 Conn. 524, 529, 509 A.2d 1 (1986). Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, I believe that there are ample statutory provisions for review of the Probate Court\u2019s appointment of a conservator. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-705a specifically allows a conserved person to appeal the legality of guardianship pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-705a. Additionally, the Probate Court is required to \u201creview each conservatorship not later than one year after the conservatorship was ordered, and not less than every three years after such initial one-year review.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-660 (c). Subsequent to that review, a conserved person may request, and the Probate Court must grant, a hearing to modify the conservatorship under \u00a7 45a-660. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-660 (d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\"> Even if I were to accept the majority\u2019s position, that the absence of an evidentiary requirement requires us to delve into the statutory history of the statute, the previous language of this provision, when juxtaposed with the extensive probate reforms instituted by Public Acts 2007, No. 07-116, illustrate that the legislature intended to maintain that omission purposefully to allow probate judges the discretion to appoint neutral third party conservators. This is because of a Probate Court\u2019s unique position within its community to understand the needs of a conserved person in conjunction with its experience regarding the capabilities of neutral third party conservators to fulfill those needs. See footnote 5 of this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 45a-650 (e) provides in relevant part: \u201c[I]n the absence of any such nomination [of a proposed conservator by the conserved person], the court <em>may appoint any qualified person, </em>authorized public official or corporation in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of section 45a-644.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although P.A. 07-116 subsequently supplemented the criteria that a probate judge shall consider prior to appointing a neutral third party conservator, the revisions made no mention of a requirement for the Probate Court to receive evidence in pertinence to those enumerated factors.
