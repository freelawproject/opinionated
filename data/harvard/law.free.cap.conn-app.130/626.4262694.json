Martocchio, appeals from the judgment of the trial court granting the motion for contempt brought by the defendants Roland Savoir and Tina Savoir<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (grandparents) and ordering that the plaintiff submit to a psychological evaluation. On appeal, the plaintiff claims, inter alia, that the court improperly concluded that he was in contempt of a previous court order and that the court abused its discretion in ordering that he submit to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>psychological evaluation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The following facts, as found by the court, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>and Stephanie A. Savoir (mother) are the parents of a minor child. The parties were not married at the time of the minor child\u2019s birth and the plaintiff was initially unaware that he was the child\u2019s father. Subsequent paternity tests revealed that the plaintiff is the biological father of the minor child. In August, 2006, the child was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. On July 28, 2008, the court, <em>Shluger, J., </em>granted the plaintiff sole custody of the minor child. The court granted the grandparents visitation rights every other weekend and granted the mother visitation rights once a week during the grandparents\u2019 visitation time or at a professional visitation facility. The court ordered that the mother and grandparents shall not interfere with the plaintiffs choice of physician, medication or educational options for the minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In July, 2009, the grandparents brought a motion for contempt, claiming, inter alia, that the plaintiff prevented them from visiting with the minor child in accordance with Judge Shluger\u2019s order. After a hearing, the court, <em>Abery-Wetstone, J., </em>found that the evidence \u201cclearly indicates that there were clear court orders in [effect and] that father unilaterally decided he wasn\u2019t going to follow those court orders and terminated contact between grandparents and grandchild.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court, thereafter, held the plaintiff in contempt. Additionally, the court ordered that the plaintiff undergo a psychological evaluation before filing any other motions, after finding that the plaintiff lacked control in the courtroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>and had an \u201cextreme\u201d attitude toward the care of his son. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We begin by setting forth our well settled standard of review. \u201cOur review of a judgment of contempt is limited. Contempt is a disobedience to the rules and orders of a court which has power to punish for such an offense. . . . Contempt may be civil or criminal in character. ... If the underlying court order was sufficiently clear and unambiguous, we . . . determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in issuing ... a judgment of contempt, which includes a review of the trial court\u2019s determination of whether the violation was wilful or excused by a good faith dispute or misunderstanding. . . . The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. . . . We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. . . . The credibility of witnesses, the findings of fact and the drawing of inferences are all within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>111 Conn. App. 413, 420-21, 959 A.2d 637 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">In the present case, we conclude that the court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous and the court did not abuse its discretion in holding the plaintiff in contempt. There was a clear order of the court granting visitation rights to the grandparents. The plaintiff admitted violating that order by preventing the grandparents from visiting the minor child. The court found that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>was no credible evidence that the grandparents were not properly administering the child\u2019s medications and, as such, there was no good faith justification for the plaintiffs deliberate violation of the court order. Therefore, the court properly held the plaintiff in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Moreover, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by ordering that the plaintiff undergo a psychological evaluation. \u201cThe court\u2019s authority to impose civil contempt penalties arises not from statutory provisions but from the common law. . . . The penalties which may be imposed, therefore, arise from the inherent power of the court to coerce compliance with its orders. In Connecticut, the court has the authority in civil contempt to impose on the contemnor either incarceration or a fine or both.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gil </em>v. <em>Gil, </em>94 Conn. App. 306, 310, 892 A.2d 318 (2006). This court has held that the trial court has the discretion to order a contemnor to submit to a psychological evaluation if it is necessary to enforce a court\u2019s earlier order. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 427 (\u201c[a] trial court has the power even to incarcerate contemnors in civil contempt cases until they purge themselves . . . and we see no reason why it should not be able to order a contemnor to undergo a psychological evaluation if that is necessary to enforce the court\u2019s earlier judgment\u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">We conclude that the court\u2019s order that the plaintiff undergo a psychological evaluation was within its inherent power to ensure compliance with the court\u2019s earlier judgment. The court ordered a psychological evaluation of the plaintiff after observing his behavior at the contempt hearing, which the court found evidenced his inability to control himself. The court also found, based on the plaintiffs testimony, that he had intentionally provided the grandparents with incorrect amounts of the minor child\u2019s prescriptions and supplements, in an attempt to \u201ccatch the grandparents doing something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>wrong.\u201d In light of these facts, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the plaintiff to undergo a psychological evaluation. See <em>Johnson </em>v. Johnson, supra, 111 Conn. App. 426-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-12\"> The defendants Roland Savoir and Tina Savoir are the parents of the named defendant, Stephanie A. Savoir, who is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\"> The plaintiff makes several additional claims. First, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly denied his request for court-appointed counsel during the contempt proceedings. Practice Book \u00a7 25-63 provides that indigent litigants in family civil contempt proceedings have a right to court-appointed counsel when they face the possibility of incarceration. Practice Book \u00a7 25-63 (a) (2), however, provides an exception to this requirement where \u201cthe judicial authority eliminates incarceration as a possible result of the proceeding and makes a statement to that effect on the record.\u201d When denying the plaintiffs request for court-appointed counsel in the present case, the court stated, on the record, that the plaintiff did not face incarceration as a possible result of the proceeding. Thus, we readily conclude that the court did not err in denying the plaintiffs request for court-appointed counsel. Compare <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Emerick, </em>28 Conn. App. 794, 799-800, 613 A.2d 1351 (error for court not to advise party of right to counsel in civil contempt proceeding when court did not state on record that incarceration was not possibility), cert. denied, 224 Conn. 915, 617 A.2d 171 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The plaintiff also claims that the court violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq. The plaintiff did not raise this claim relating to the ADA in the trial court, nor did he inform the court that he had any disability or request accommodations under the ADA during the contempt proceedings. Under these circumstances, we decline to review his claim. See <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>96 Conn. App. 842, 845-46,902 A.2d 666 (2006) (declining to review claim that court failed to provide ADA accommodations during contempt hearing when ADA claim was not raised in trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Finally, although he fails to set forth his claim in the statement of issues, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 63-4 (a) (1), the plaintiff also asserts that the court improperly excluded evidence on hearsay grounds. Although we acknowledge that the plaintiff is a pro se litigant, we decline to review this claim because it is inadequately briefed. \u201cAlthough we are solicitous of the rights of pro se litigants . . . [s]uch a litigant is bound by the same rules . . . and procedure as those qualified to practice law. . . . [W]e are not required to review claims that are inadequately briefed. ... We consistently have held that [ajnalysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Traylor </em>v. <em>State, </em>128 Conn. App. 182, 185 n.2, 15 A.3d 1173 (2011). The plaintiffs claim is limited to amere assertion that the court erred, followed by a quotation from the transcript of the court\u2019s ruling and quotations from two rules of evidence concerning hearsay. The plaintiffs claim is devoid of any analysis at all as to which of the quoted rules of evidence he is claiming apply to the evidence in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>or how the evidence in question falls within those rules. As such, we conclude that the claim has been inadequately briefed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\"> We note that the record does not contain a written memorandum of decision or a signed transcript of Judge Abery-Wetstone\u2019s oral decision, as required by our rules of practice. See Practice Book \u00a7 64-1. The record does, however, include an unsigned transcript which contains a sufficiently detailed and concise statement of the court\u2019s findings. Therefore, we will review the plaintiffs claims. See, e.g., <em>Carrasquillo </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>90 Conn. App. 705, 708 n.2, 880 A.2d 904 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> The remainder of the plaintiffs claims on appeal challenge the grandparents\u2019 rights of visitation with the minor child. The grandparents were granted visitation rights pursuant to Judge Shluger\u2019s 2008 decision, from which the plaintiff did not appeal. The present appeal was taken from Judge Abery-Wetstone\u2019s 2009 judgment of contempt. Thus, we will not address the plaintiffs claim regarding propriety of the 2008judgment granting visitation rights to the grandparents, as those issues are not properly before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
