On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improperly rejected his claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Specifically, he claims that his trial counsel, Donald O\u2019Brien, rendered ineffective assistance because (1) he failed to object on two occasions to testimony offered by the state\u2019s expert witness, a psychiatrist who testified that the victim had been sexually assaulted, and (2) he did not undertake an independent investigation or take photographs of the area of the building where the assault took place. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The petitioner\u2019s conviction was the subject of a direct appeal before this court, <em>State </em>v. Boyd, 89 Conn. App. 1, 872 A.2d 477, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 921, 883 A.2d 1247 (2005), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemah, </em>289 Conn. 411, 432, 957 A.2d 852 (2008). The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of the petitioner\u2019s claims. After a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted of sexual assault in the first degree, kidnapping in the first degree and assault in the third degree, and was sentenced to an effective prison term of eighteen years incarceration, suspended after fourteen years, and twenty-five years of probation. Id., 2, 6-7. All charges resulted from an incident that occurred in the fall of 1999 while the petitioner was an employee of a corporation that provided food services to a boarding school in Connecticut.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id., 4. The petitioner supervised the sixteen year old victim who, in addition to attending classes at the boarding school, worked in the dining hall as a dishwasher. Id. \u201cOn the evening of the assault, the victim was scheduled for a two hour shift. Near the end of her shift, the [petitioner] instructed the victim to go downstairs [to the pot room] to clean large pots and pans. The petitioner grabbed the victim\u2019s aim and escorted her into the elevator leading to the lower level\u201d; id., 4-5; and, after exiting the elevator on the lower level, the petitioner physically and sexually assaulted the victim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id., 5. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>We set forth the appropriate standard of review for a challenge to the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas coipus when certification to appeal is granted. \u201cThe conclusions reached by the trial court in its decision to dismiss [a] habeas petition are matters of law, subject to plenary review. . . . [When] the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, [the reviewing court] must determine whether they are legally and logically correct . . . and whether they find support in the facts that appear in the record. ... To the extent that factual findings are challenged, this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>122 Conn. App. 637, 641, 999 A.2d 840 (2010), cert. denied, 300 Conn. 901, 12 A.3d 574 (2011). \u201c[0]ur review of whether the facts as found by the habeas court constituted a violation of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel is plenary. . . . The habeas judge, as the trier of facts, is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Joseph </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>117 Conn. App. 431, 433, 979 A.2d 568, cert. denied, 294 Conn. 906, 982 A.2d 1080 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We now set forth the principles of law relevant to the petitioner\u2019s claim that O\u2019Brien rendered ineffective assistance. The habeas court determined that the petitioner failed to satisfy the first prong of the two-pronged test set forth in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). \u201cA claim of ineffective assistance of counsel consists of two components: a performance prong and a prejudice prong. To satisfy the performance prong . . . the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>must demonstrate that his attorney\u2019s representation was not reasonably competent or within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law. ... To satisfy the prejudice prong, a claimant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. . . . The claim will succeed only if both prongs are satisfied.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>126 Conn. App. 453, 457, 11 A.3d 730, cert. denied, 300 Conn. 932, 17 A.3d 69 (2011). \u201cUnless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction . . . resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unworkable. . . . Only if the petitioner succeeds in [this] herculean task will he receive a new trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The petitioner first claims that O\u2019Brien rendered ineffective assistance because he failed to object on two occasions to testimony offered by Lucy Puryear, the state\u2019s expert witness. We conclude that the petitioner has failed to overcome the presumption that O\u2019Brien\u2019s trial strategy was reasonable and, thus, has failed to prove that his performance was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the petitioner\u2019s claim. After the assault, the victim returned to her room and showered. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>supra, 89 Conn. App. 5. The day after the assault, \u201cthe victim participated in a school volleyball game. During the game, she fell to the ground, striking her head. Following her fall, the victim was unable to move. An ambulance transported her to a hospital, where she received treatment. Thereafter, she returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>to her parents\u2019 home. The victim had regained movement in her arms while in the hospital, but was unable to move her legs for several days.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">In his direct appeal from his conviction, the petitioner sought review of his claim that the trial court should have, sua sponte, struck certain testimony given by Puryear, apsychiatrist who had treated the victim. \u201cDuring direct examination, Puryear testified in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u2018[The Prosecutor]: All right. When did [the victim] start having problems . . . ?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u2018[The Witness]: [The victim] started having problems after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u2018[The Prosecutor]: October 21, 1999?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u2018[The Witness]: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u2018[The Prosecutor]: And did she have any history of mental problems before the sexual assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">\u2018[The Witness]: No, she didn\u2019t.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">Puryear subsequently stated that the victim\u2019s inability to move following her fall on the volleyball court was \u2018related to the sexual assault the day before . . . .\u2019\u201d Id., 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">Because O\u2019Brien failed to object to the testimony during trial, the petitioner sought this court\u2019s review of his unpreserved evidentiary claim pursuant to Golding<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the plain error doctrine embodied in Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. Id. This court declined to review the unpreserved claim under either doctrine because the claim was evidentiary, not constitutional, in nature and we were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>persuaded that the court\u2019s failure to strike the challenged testimony sua sponte constituted plain error. Id., 19-21. Specifically, we noted that \u201c[although perhaps the court would have been required to strike this portion of Puryear\u2019s testimony after a proper objection, we cannot conclude that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were implicated or that the defendant received a fundamentally unfair trial.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id., 21 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">As we review the petitioner\u2019s claim that O\u2019Brien rendered ineffective assistance under these facts, we are mindful that \u201c[jjudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. ... A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>125 Conn. App. 57, 62, 6 A.3d 213 (2010), cert. denied, 299 Conn. 926, 11 A.3d 150 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u201c[T]he decision of atrial lawyer not to make an objection is a matter of trial tactics, not evidence of incompetency. . . . [Tjhere is a strong presumption that the trial strategy employed by a criminal defendant\u2019s counsel is reasonable and is a result of the exercise of professional judgment . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>109 Conn. App. 758, 768, 953 A.2d 685, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 950, 961 A.2d 417 (2008). It is well established that \u201c[a] reviewing court must view counsel\u2019s conduct with a strong presumption that it falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and that a tactic that appears ineffective in hindsight may have been sound trial strategy at the time.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>120 Conn. App. 412, 417, 991 A.2d 705, cert. denied, 297 Conn. 915, 996 A.2d 279 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In the present appeal, the petitioner argues that, because there was no medical evidence of or eyewitnesses to the assault, the state\u2019s case depended on the credibility of the victim. The petitioner maintains that O\u2019Brien\u2019s failure to object to the challenged statements improperly bolstered the credibility of the victim because, in effect, Puryear testified that the sexual assault, in fact, occurred. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">At trial before the habeas court, O\u2019Brien testified that his strategy was to attack the victim\u2019s credibility and, specifically, to discredit her testimony that the assault had occurred. Regarding the first challenged statement, O\u2019Brien conceded that he could have objected to how the prosecutor phrased the question because the prosecutor failed to say \u201calleged.\u201d Regarding the second statement concerning the events following the volleyball game, he did not think at the time that it touched upon the ultimate issue. Rather, he thought that it reflected the basis of Puryear\u2019s opinion that the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>inability to move her legs for some time after the volleyball game was evidence that she suffered from a conversion disorder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> O\u2019Brien chose to address Puiyear\u2019s testimony on cross-examination rather than to object and draw undue attention to the question and answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The habeas court found that O\u2019Brien successfully \u201cbrought out inconsistencies between what the victim had said to the doctor and statements that she had made to others\u201d and concluded that \u201cthis is a reasonable strategy, albeit unsuccessful in this particular situation.\u201d Similarly, this court noted during the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal from his conviction: \u201c[t]he victim\u2019s testimony at trial contained several inconsistencies relative to her pretrial statements to other witnesses, the police and her medical providers. [This court then enumerated specific examples.] ... As these examples demonstrate, [O\u2019Brien] vigorously cross-examined the state\u2019s witnesses and challenged their credibility before the jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>supra, 89 Conn. App. 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the petitioner has not overcome the strong presumption that O\u2019Brien\u2019s decision to cross-examine Puryear vigorously, rather than to object to the challenged statements, was anything other than a reasonable exercise of his professional judgment under the circumstances. Because the petitioner has failed to prove that O\u2019Brien\u2019s performance was deficient, we do not address whether the petitioner was prejudiced by the claimed deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The petitioner\u2019s second claim is that O\u2019Brien rendered ineffective assistance because he failed to take photographs of the area of the building where the assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>took place and failed to undertake an independent investigation of the area. Instead, the only photographs of the area before the jury were submitted by the state. The petitioner claims that \u201c[t]he lack of clarifying photographs of the entire area prevented the jury from considering in an informed and comprehensive way the level of traffic in the area\u201d in which the assault occurred. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u201c[Although it is incumbent on a trial counsel to conduct a prompt investigation of the case and explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case . . . counsel need not track down each and every lead or personally investigate every evidentiary possibility. ... In a habeas corpus proceeding, the petitioner\u2019s burden of proving that a fundamental unfairness had been done is not met by speculation . . . but by demonstrable realities. . . . One cannot successfully attack, with the advantage of hindsight, atrial counsel\u2019s trial choices and strategies that otherwise constitutionally comport with the standards of competence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, 285 Conn. 556, 583-84, 941 A.2d 248 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The record reveals the following additional facts. Although at trial O\u2019Brien relied on the photographs of the crime scene that were submitted by the state, he supplemented them with additional testimony from the school\u2019s kitchen staff to establish the layout of the dining hall basement, including the pot room. He also presented staff time cards from the date of the assault, which indicated at what time each employee \u201cpunched out\u201d and presumably left the premises, and established that these employees would have passed through the pot room on the way out. This evidence tended to support the defense theory that the assault could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>occurred as the victim alleged, including that the duration of the assault as she reported to one medical professional was impossible, because the evidence tended to show that the area was subject to regular employee traffic on the night of the assault. In his closing argument, O\u2019Brien described the area as \u201cfifteen feet from an elevator where numerous employees are in and out, back and forth, up and down\u201d and reminded the jury that these facts were inconsistent with the duration of the assault that the victim reported to one of the medical professionals who treated her.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The habeas court found that O\u2019Brien was in a \u201cprecarious\u201d and \u201cunenviable\u201d position as to what extent he should develop a trial strategy around the layout of the crime scene because the petitioner vehemently maintained that the victim\u2019s claims were fabricated and that he was not in the pot room that night. Our review of the record reveals that O\u2019Brien presented to the jury other evidence of the layout of the basement, including the pot room, and that he presented evidence concerning employee traffic in the area on the night of the assault. In light of the other evidence he adduced at trial, we cannot conclude that O\u2019Brien\u2019s failure to submit \u201cclarifying\u201d photographs of the crime scene fell below the standard of reasonable competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-5\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual abuse, we decline to identify the victim or others through whom the victim\u2019s identity may be ascertained. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-86e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-6\"> This court concluded on direct appeal that the jury reasonably could have found the following facts about the assault. The petitioner removed the victim\u2019s clothes and his own pants, and forced her to touch his penis. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>supra, 89 Conn. App. 5. He fondled the victim, performed oral sex on her, penetrated her with his finger and ejaculated on her stomach. Id. The petitioner repeatedly slapped the victim when she screamed, and, at two points during the assault, grabbed her hair and slammed her head against the tile floor, causing her to lose consciousness. Id. When the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>recovered consciousness the second time, the petitioner, who had dressed, told her to return upstairs in five minutes and to not tell anyone what had happened. Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b320-13\"> <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), sets forth the familiar four-pronged analysis under which a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error that was not preserved at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b321-6\"> The petitioner alleged in his second amended petition that, by his failure to object at trial, O\u2019Brien\u2019s performance was deficient because he \u201cfailed to preserve this issue for appeal.\u201d The habeas court did not make any findings or rulings concerning this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The petitioner\u2019s brief makes one passing mention of this claimed failure. He otherwise fails to address it independently from his claim that O\u2019Brien\u2019s failure to object to the challenged statements allowed the jury to consider them, and that he was prejudiced by those statements. Insofar as this mention can be read as a separate claim, \u201c[ajssignments of error which are merely mentioned but not briefed beyond a statement of the claim will be deemed abandoned and will not be reviewed by this court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Paoletta </em>v. <em>Anchor Reef Club at Branford, LLC, </em>123 Conn. App. 402, 406, 1 A.3d 1238, cert. denied, 298 Conn. 931, 5 A.3d 491 (2010). Because we conclude that the petitioner has abandoned this claim insofar as it is independent from his first claim, we do not address the related arguments made by the respondent, the commissioner of correction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\"> O\u2019Brien testified as to his understanding of Puryear\u2019s testimony, which was that a conversion disorder or a conversion response happens when a victim converts psychological trauma into physical symptoms and that the victim\u2019s inability to move her legs was such a response.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
