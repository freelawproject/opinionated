Tosado, from the determination of the employment security board of review (board) denying the plaintiff unemployment compensation benefits. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly determined that the board\u2019s factual findings did not support the board\u2019s conclusion that the pla.iutiff was discharged for wilful misconduct. We agree and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">In the related case of <em>Tosado </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>130 Conn. App. 266 22 A.3d 675 (2011), we addressed the claim of error raised by the present appeal. We adopt the reasoning and conclusion of that opinion to resolve the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-10\"> We note that the defendant, The Wellpoint Companies, Inc., filed a separate appeal from the judgment of the trial court.
