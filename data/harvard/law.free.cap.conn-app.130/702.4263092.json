In this case, the mortgage contingency clause required the purchasers to apply for a mortgage commitment \u201cat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>prevailing rate . . . and [to] pursue the same diligently.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The principal issue is whether the purchasers, having learned that they were ineligible for a mortgage at \u201cthe prime rate,\u201d were required to exercise due diligence to pursue alternate mortgage options. The trial court resolved this issue in favor of the vendors. The purchasers have appealed. We affirm the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">On July 10, 2007, the plaintiffs, G. William McCoy and Karen S. McCoy, filed a three count complaint against the defendants, James A. Brown and Nancy F. Brown, in which they alleged that the defendants\u2019 refusal to return a $127,500 deposit toward the purchase of the defendants\u2019 home in Darien constituted a breach of contract, statutory theft and conversion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants filed an answer, special defenses and a counterclaim, in which they alleged breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud. Following a court trial, the court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and on the defendants\u2019 counterclaim for breach of contract. Accordingly, the court awarded the defendants $126,860.94<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The following undisputed facts were found by the court. In January, 2007, G. William McCoy<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> decided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>relocate his family to Darien. McCoy spoke to Christopher Raia, a friend and former neighbor, about the possibility of employment in Raia\u2019s company, Provation, LLC (Provation).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">On May 1, 2007, the parties entered into a contract for the sale of the defendants\u2019 property located at 15 Little Brook Road North in Darien (property) to the plaintiffs for $1,325,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The mortgage contingency clause in the contract provided: \u201cThis contract is conditioned upon Buyer\u2019s seeming a commitment for a first mortgage loan on the Premises from any Bank in minimum limits of $1,020,000.00 amortized over a term of not less than thirty years with interest at the prevailing rate and containing no conditions beyond Buyer\u2019s reasonable ability to satisfy. Buyer agrees to make application forthwith and pursue the same diligently. ... In the event Buyer shall fail to secure said mortgage commitment and has demonstrated due diligence, on or before May 11, 2007, he shall have the option of terminating this Contract and all deposit monies paid hereunder shall forthwith be refunded to the Buyer except the sum of $200.00 for the cost of preparing this contract of sale, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be forever terminated. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The plaintiffs promptly submitted a mortgage application to Astoria Federal Mortgage Corp. (bank). Tim Sickinger, the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage broker, advised them that, unless McCoy had salaried employment, the plaintiffs might have to accept a less favorable, or higher, rate on their mortgage. McCoy insisted that he wanted only the \u201c \u2018best rate.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In the hope of achieving the more favorable, lower interest rate, McCoy asked Raia to hire him as a full-time, salaried employee of Provation. In late April, 2007, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>after Raia agreed to this request, McCoy amended the mortgage application to reflect Raia\u2019s offer of salaried employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">On May 4, 2007, the bank issued a commitment letter to the plaintiffs for a thirty year mortgage at 6.25 percent interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> McCoy found these terms satisfactory. The commitment letter stated that, prior to closing on the loan, the bank would require verbal verification that McCoy had started employment at Provation. However, on May 4 or 5, 2007, Raia informed McCoy that he was no longer willing to employ him on a salaried basis, although he remained interested in working with McCoy, at the same level of compensation, as a consultant or independent contractor. In a letter to McCoy, dated May 14, 2007, Raia withdrew the offer of salaried employment effective May 10, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">On May 11, 2007, without undertaking any further efforts to obtain mortgage financing, the plaintiffs notified the defendants of the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cinability to obtain a mortgage commitment containing \u2018. . . no conditions beyond [the] Buyer\u2019s reasonable ability to satisfy\u2019 \u201d and demanded return of their $127,500 deposit. When the defendants refused to return the deposit, the plaintiffs commenced the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to obtain a mortgage \u201clacked due diligence and were unreasonable.\u201d It observed that the bank never rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage application, which was withdrawn \u201cafter McCoy failed to pursue it further.\u201d It found that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that they could not obtain a mortgage containing conditions appropriate to their circumstances. Accordingly, the court concluded that the defendants\u2019 refusal to return the deposit was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>violation of the mortgage contingency clause in the contract and that they were entitled to retain the deposit as liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiffs claim that the court (1) misconstrued the mortgage contingency clause in the contract and (2) improperly concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to perform their contract obligations to the defendants. We are not persuaded and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first contention is that the court misconstrued the mortgage contingency clause as requiring them to pursue a mortgage \u201cat the prevailing rate\u201d for borrowers in the plaintiffs\u2019 circumstances, rather than for borrowers who seek financing based on full income verification. Under the circumstances of this case, we need not resolve this issue. Neither interpretation supports the plaintiffs\u2019 bald assertion that \u201cprevailing rate\u201d means \u201cprime rate.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> More importantly, neither interpretation supports the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that their withdrawal of their one and only mortgage application satisfied their contractual obligation to exercise due diligence to obtain mortgage financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second contention is that the court improperly concluded that they had breached the contract. Preliminarily, we note that \u201c[w]hether there was a breach of contract is ordinarily a question of fact. . . . We review the corut\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard. . . . The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Neubig </em>v. <em>Luanci Construction, LLC, </em>124 Conn. App. 425, 433, 4 A.3d 1273 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Any mortgage contingency clause implies \u201ca promise that the purchaser will exert reasonable efforts to obtain a mortgage commitment.\u201d <em>Phillipe </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>3 Conn. App. 471, 473, 489 A.2d 1056 (1985); see also <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>58 Conn. App. 330, 335, 753 A.2d 430, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 920, 759 A.2d 1023 (2000). In this case, the mortgage contingency clause expressly required the plaintiffs to exercise due diligence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As in <em>Phillipe, </em>the language of the contract obligated the plaintiffs to use reasonable diligence in their efforts to obtain a mortgage commitment. \u201cReasonableness . . . is an objective standard, involving an analysis of what a person with ordinary prudence would do given the circumstances, without accounting for any particular knowledge or skill. . . . Whether the plaintiffs actions constituted reasonable efforts to satisfy the contractual condition is a factual determination for the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Phillipe </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In this case, the court found that the plaintiffs had \u201cnot exercis[ed] due diligence and reasonable care in [their] decisions regarding the acceptance of a mortgage as required by the broad mortgage contingency clause contained in the contract.\u201d Clearly, McCoy wanted a mortgage with the \u201c \u2018best rate\u2019 \u201d of interest. He knew that he would not qualify for such a rate without salaried employment. The plaintiffs made their offer to purchase the property while McCoy was unemployed. McCoy sought the salaried job offer with Provation in the hope of securing the lower interest rate he desired. As far as the record shows, when the offer of salaried employment was withdrawn, McCoy abandoned all efforts to obtain a mortgage. Indeed, the bank never rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage application, which was withdrawn after McCoy neglected to pursue it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">To counter the adverse inferences that the court drew from this factual record, the plaintiffs rely on <em>Aubin </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>64 Conn. App. 781, 781 A.2d 396 (2001), and <em>Luttinger </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>164 Conn. 45, 316 A.2d 757 (1972). We agree with the court that these cases are distinguishable. In <em>Aubin, </em>contrary to the facts of this case, the plaintiffs mortgage application was denied. <em>Aubin </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 787. In <em>Luttinger, </em>the buyer was offered a mortgage at an interest rate that exceeded the maximum interest rate stated in the mortgage contingency clause. <em>Luttinger </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>supra, 46. The mortgage contingency clause in the present case had no interest rate cap.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, as the court noted, \u201c[i]t was [McCoy] . . . who insisted that he would only accept a preferred mortgage rate, and it was he who should have negotiated a cap on interest rates in the contract of sale.\u201d We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The crucial fact found by the court was that, even if Raia\u2019s withdrawal of the offer of salaried employment at Provation would have disqualified the plaintiffs\u2019 eligibility for a mortgage at a 6.25 percent interest rate, other mortgage options were open to the plaintiffs, which they could have pursued.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> McCoy\u2019s unilateral decision to forgo <em>any </em>inquiry into <em>any </em>financing alternatives amply supports the court\u2019s determination that \u201cMcCoy failed to exercise due diligence and [that he] was unreasonable in his decision not to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>another form of mortgage which may have carried a higher rate of interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the court properly found that the plaintiffs failed to exercise due diligence to secure a mortgage at the prevailing rate after they learned that they were ineligible for financing at their preferred rate. In light of this failure on their part, we agree with the court that the plaintiffs were not entitled to a return of the deposit on their contract for the purchase of the defendants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\">A mortgage contingency clause in a contract implies a promise that the prospective purchaser will exert reasonable efforts to obtain a mortgage commitment. <em>Phillipe </em>v. <em>Thomas, 3 </em>Conn. App. 471, 473, 489 A.2d 1056 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\"> This case was consolidated with an interpleader action filed by Bove &amp; Milici, a Connecticut law firm that represented the defendants, to determine the rights to a fund representing the plaintiffs\u2019 $127,500 deposit that the law firm was holding in escrow. The trial court granted the law firm\u2019s motion for an interlocutory judgment of interpleader, and the law firm deposited the escrow funds with the clerk of the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\"> The sum of $126,860.94 represents liquidated damages awarded to the defendants and was calculated by subtracting $639.06 in disbursements from the original $127,500 deposit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b728-10\"> We refer to G. William McCoy and Karen S. McCoy collectively as the plaintiffs. We refer to G. William McCoy individually as McCoy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\"> The purchase price subsequently was reduced, at the plaintiffs\u2019 request, to $1,275,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\"> At trial, neither of the parties took issue with the fact that the mortgage commitment was issued for $956,250 rather than the $1,020,000 specified in the mortgage contingency clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> As the court observed, \u201c[t]he plaintiff argues in his brief that \u2018prevailing rate\u2019 means \u2018prime rates offered by lending institutions,\u2019 without offering any authority for that proposition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\"> The mortgage contingency clause in the contract of sale required the plaintiffs to make application \u201cforthwith\u201d for a mortgage on the terms stated in the contract and to \u201cpursue the same diligently.\u201d The contract states that the plaintiffs would be entitled to the return of their deposit if they failed to secure a mortgage commitment at the stated terms <em>and </em>if they had \u201cdemonstrated due diligence\u201d in their attempts to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\"> We take judicial notice of the fact that many contracts like that at issue in the present case state a given percentage rate in the mortgage contingency clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b733-9\"> We reject the analogy the plaintiffs attempt to draw between the no-income verification loan that McCoy could have qualified for, based upon his assets, 1099 income and severance pay, and a \u201csubprime\u201d mortgage loan, which refers to higher interest loans issued to borrowers that have low credit ratings. The two are not equivalent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
