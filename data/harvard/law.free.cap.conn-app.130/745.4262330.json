On appeal, the defendant claims: (1) the trial court erred in refusing to give a lesser included offense instruction on criminally negligent homicide, (2) the prosecutor committed numerous acts of prosecutorial impropriety throughout the course of trial, which deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial, and (3) the court improperly instructed the jury on the meaning of reasonable doubt. Although we agree that the prosecutor committed several improprieties during the trial, we, nonetheless, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Some months prior to the incident, the defendant moved to the Waterbury area from Puerto Rico. He worked daily selling heroin behind a three-story apartment building located at 132 Locust Street in Waterbury (building). He did not speak English, and most of his customers were of Puerto Rican descent and spoke Spanish. The heroin selling operation was run by William Ramos, who also was known as \u201cLolay.\u201d Ramos employed approximately five or six young men, including the defendant, who sold heroin to various customers at that location, which Ramos referred to as \u201cthe million dollar block . . . .\u201d During his shift, which usually was from 3 to 10 p.m., the defendant carried a loaded firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">On September 18, 2006, the defendant worked his usual shift and then continued working later into the night. During that time, a woman named \u201cSpicy\u201d was having a party in the building, and people were congregating both inside and outside the building, while loud music played. Ramos, who testified for the state, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>on the second floor of the building overseeing his drug selling operation. At approximately 10:30 p.m., the defendant was sitting on the stairs just above the second floor landing when the victim, Christian Rivera, approached the building on a bicycle. When Rivera approached the stairwell, he had his hands in his pockets, and he was wearing a hooded sweatshirt with the hood up. The defendant descended the stairwell, thinking that Rivera was there to purchase heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">As Rivera approached the landing, the defendant, who could not see Rivera\u2019s face, instructed him in Spanish to remove his hands from his pockets and to take down the hood of his sweatshirt. Rivera did not respond to the defendant\u2019s instructions and continued his approach. Rivera was not acting in an aggressive manner, and Ramos saw nothing in Rivera\u2019s actions that caused him concern. As the defendant and Rivera came into contact with one another, the defendant pushed Rivera and again ordered him to take his hands out of his pockets and to remove his hood. Again, Rivera did not respond to the defendant, kept his hands in his pockets and continued to move forward. The defendant pushed Rivera a second time and felt something hard in Rivera\u2019s pocket. The defendant then brandished a nine millimeter semiautomatic firearm, pulled back the slide and aimed the firearm at Rivera. Ramos yelled at the defendant, asking him what he was doing and why he was pulling out the gun. The defendant fired the weapon approximately eight times at close range, hitting Rivera four times. The defendant stopped firing when Rivera fell to the ground. Three of the four bullets that hit Rivera entered and exited his body; one bullet remained lodged in his pelvis. Rivera died as a result of these gunshot wounds. When the police found Rivera\u2019s body, he had no weapons, money or identification on him. He did, however, have a bottle of Poland Spring water in his pocket. The medical examiner\u2019s office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>determined that Rivera had wounds to his left upper back, his right upper chest, his left ear, his right cheek, the back of his neck, the back of his left thigh, the right side of his forehead, across his right shoulder and behind one of his knees. The bullet wound to the left side of Rivera\u2019s upper back was an entrance wound, with the wound to his right upper chest being the exit wound from that same bullet. These wounds caused significant blood loss. The bullet wound to the back of Rivera\u2019s neck also was an entrance wound. The wound to the back of Rivera\u2019s left thigh was an entrance wound as well; that bullet, however, remained lodged in Rivera\u2019s pelvis. Accordingly, three of the four bullets that struck Rivera, entered from the back of his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Immediately after the shooting, the defendant ran upstairs and gave the firearm to his friend, Angel Garcia, and then left the scene. The defendant removed the red T-shirt he had been wearing and discarded it into some bushes. He later telephoned his friend, Jose Velez, telling Velez that he needed to get away because he had shot someone. Velez, who had planned on going to New York, offered the defendant a ride, which he accepted. During the ride, the defendant told Velez and the other men in the vehicle, Luis Rios and Zachary Gonzalez, that he had shot a man on Locust Street because the man would not respond to his orders. Rios and the defendant stayed at a hotel in New York that night. The next morning, Rios received a telephone call from Velez\u2019 wife or girlfriend, who informed him and the defendant that the police had a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest. On September 20, 2006, at approximately 8:30 p.m., the defendant returned to Waterbury, where he turned himself in at the front desk of the Waterbury police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Thereafter, the defendant was advised, in Spanish, of his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights. He waived his rights to remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>silent and to have an attorney present, and willingly offered to tell his story to Detective George Tirado and Sergeant Michael Slavin. Although Tirado was able to communicate verbally with the defendant in Spanish, he was concerned about his ability to transcribe the defendant\u2019s written statement. Therefore, a state certified high school Spanish teacher, Yesenia Diaz, was called upon to transcribe the defendant\u2019s written statement in Spanish. After Diaz transcribed the statement in Spanish, she read the statement aloud to him and asked him if there was anything that he would like to change. She also had him read aloud some of the statement, just to make sure that he could read. The defendant reviewed the statement, stated that it was fine, affirmed it and signed it. Diaz then translated the statement into English and typed a copy in the English language. In his statement, the defendant admitted to shooting Rivera. The defendant further admitted that he had fired at Rivera because, as Rivera walked toward him, Rivera ignored his commands that Rivera remove his hands from his pockets and take off his hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The defendant was charged with murder. During his trial, the defendant testified and claimed that he had acted in self-defense. The jury, however, found him guilty of murder, and the court accepted the jury\u2019s verdict, rendered a judgment of conviction and sentenced the defendant to a term of fifty years incarceration. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The defendant claims that the court improperly refused to give a lesser included offense instruction on criminally negligent homicide. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argues that there was sufficient evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>to sustain a conviction of criminally negligent homicide inasmuch as the evidence regarding his mental state was sufficiently in dispute, thereby permitting a jury to find him not guilty of the intentional act of murder but instead guilty of criminally negligent homicide. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\u201c[A] claim of instructional error with regard to the lesser included offense . . . requires us, on appeal, to review the facts in the light most favorable to the defendant. . . . Whether one offense is a lesser included offense of another presents a question of law. . . . Accordingly, our review is de novo.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>289 Conn. 742, 758, 961 A.2d 322 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">\u201cThe applicable legal principles are well established. A defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if . . . the following conditions are met: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant [not guilty] of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980).\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 289 Conn. 758-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim implicates all four prongs of Whistnant; accordingly, we address each prong in turn. \u201cUnder the first prong of <em>Whistnant, </em>a defendant is not entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense unless it is requested.\u201d Id., 759. Here, the parties do not dispute that the defendant properly requested such an instruction. The record demonstrates that the defendant submitted a supplemental request to charge, asking the court to instruct on four lesser included offenses: the crime of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) and (3), manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a (a), manslaughter in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1) and criminally negligent homicide. The court gave instructions on two of the lesser included offenses, manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm and manslaughter in the second degree with a firearm. The court declined, in relevant part, to instruct the jury on criminally negligent homicide. This, the defendant argues, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">\u201cUnder the second prong of <em>Whistnant, </em>a defendant is entitled to the requested instruction if it was not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser [offense] .... [T]he relationship between the offenses is determined not by a comparison of statutory elements in the abstract . . . but by reference to the pleadings in the case. The key ordinarily is whether the allegations in the pleading charging the higher offense . . . include all of the elements of the lesser offense. . . . [T]he term offense, as it is used in <em>Whistnant, </em>refers to each distinct method, which may be comprised of different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>elements, by which a crime may be completed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 761. The parties do not dispute that the defendant has met the second prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>It is not possible for the defendant to have committed murder in the manner described in the information without having committed criminally negligent homicide, the distinguishing element between the two offenses being the defendant\u2019s state of mind. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomlin, </em>266 Conn. 608, 630, 835 A.2d 12 (2003) (only element distinguishing murder from criminally negligent homicide is state of mind element).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">With respect to the third and fourth prongs of <em>Whistnant, </em>the defendant argues that they \u201care subject to the same evidentiary analysis and therefore [that] it is appropriate to analyze them simultaneously.\u201d He argues that on the basis of the evidence, the jury reasonably \u201ccould have determined that [the] defendant responded instantaneously to what he believed to be a life-threatening event and [that] he did not perceive the risk of death from his actions.\u201d Accordingly, he argues, the jury could have found him not guilty of murder and guilty of the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Our Supreme Court has instructed that \u201c[d]espite being conceptually distinct parts of the <em>Whistnant </em>formulation, the third and fourth prongs are subject to the same evidentiary analysis . . . [and, therefore, can be analyzed] simultaneously. The third prong of <em>Whistnant </em>requires that there [be] some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense .... The fourth prong requires that the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>defendant [not guilty] of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>[225 Conn. 55, 65-73, 621 A.2d 728 (1993)], we . . . reviewed the standard of evidence required to satisfy the [third and fourth prongs] of the <em>Whistnant </em>test. We . . . held that there must be sufficient evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, to justify a finding of guilt of the lesser offense. . . . Although [we] expressly [reject] the proposition that a defendant is entitled to instructions on lesser included offenses based on merely theoretical or possible scenarios ... we .. . consider the evidence available at trial in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s request. . . . [T]he jury\u2019s role as fact-finder is so central to our jurisprudence that, in close cases, the trial court should generally opt in favor of giving an instruction on a lesser included offense, if it is requested. . . . Otherwise the defendant would lose the right to have the jury pass upon every factual issue fairly presented by the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 289 Conn. 762-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">A review of the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, leads us to the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s request to charge on the lesser offense of criminally negligent homicide was based on theoretical or possible scenarios rather than on a theory having a sufficient basis in the evidence. Cf. id. At trial, the defendant testified that he feared for his life because Rivera was coming toward him and ignoring his demands. He also testified that Rivera demanded money and drugs and that, when the defendant pushed Rivera away, he felt something hard in his pocket and thought it could be a gun. He contends that he reacted in response to these events by shooting Rivera but that he had no intent to kill him; he merely wanted to \u201cstop him.\u201d The defendant asserts that his lack of intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>kill Rivera is demonstrated by the fact that four of the eight gunshots missed Rivera and that, of the four that did hit him, \u201cthree of them were nonfatal wounds and were in parts of his body that were not life-threatening.\u201d We are not persuaded that this testimony was sufficient to warrant a charge on the lesser offense of criminally negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In his September 20, 2006 written statement to the police, the defendant admitted that he intended to shoot Rivera, and the evidence at trial showed that he was standing rather close to Rivera when he began firing at him. Three of the gunshots that hit Rivera entered Rivera\u2019s body from the rear. The medical examiner could not say definitively which of the gunshots that hit Rivera caused his death, but he opined that it likely was either the gunshot that entered his back and went through his heart and lung or the gunshot that entered through his left earlobe and went through his head exiting out of his right cheek. \u201cOne who uses a deadly weapon upon a vital part of another will be deemed to have intended the probable result of that act, and from such a circumstance a proper inference may be drawn in some cases that there was an intent to kill. ... A pistol ... or gun is a deadly weapon per se.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 72. Here, even if the defendant feared for his life, the evidence demonstrated that, inter alia, he intended to shoot Rivera, he discharged eight bullets from his firearm and three of the four bullets that hit Rivera entered his body from the rear, he then handed his gun to a friend and he fled the scene and went to New York. On the basis of the evidence presented, viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s assertions that he was entitled to an instruction on criminally negligent homicide because he did not intend to kill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Rivera is nothing more than an abstract theory or possible scenario of the type discussed and rejected in <em>Rasmussen. </em>After viewing the evidence most favorably to the defendant, we conclude that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a charge that the defendant had acted negligently in causing the death of Rivera.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The defendant next claims that he \u201cwas deprived of a fair trial by the prosecutor\u2019s repeated and deliberate improprieties that occurred throughout the trial.\u201d He argues that the \u201cprosecutor exceeded the bounds of acceptable conduct when he: (1) repeatedly commented on the guilt of [the] defendant and attempted to influence the jury by his persistent use of the terms \u2018victim,\u2019 \u2018murder,\u2019 and \u2018murder weapon\u2019 throughout the trial; (2) argued that to acquit [the] defendant, the jury would have to find that every other witness was wrong in violation of <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, [793 A.2d 226 (2002)]; (3) appealed to the jurors\u2019 passions and emotions; (4) denigrated the integrity of defense counsel in closing argument; and (5) attempted to influence the jurors about the credibility of his witnesses through improper means.\u201d He contends that he is entitled to a new trial. Although we agree that some of the conduct of the prosecutor was improper, we disagree that it deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">After setting forth the applicable standard of review, we will examine each of these allegations of improper conduct. \u201c[I]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether [an impropriety] occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that [impropriety] deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Put differently, [impropriety] is [impropriety], regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that [impropriety] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question ....</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\u201c[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of allegedly] [harmful] prosecutorial [impropriety] is the fairness of the trial, and not the culpability of the prosecutor. . . . The issue is whether the prosecutor\u2019s [actions at trial] so infected [it] with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. ... In determining whether the defendant was denied a fair trial ... we must view the prosecutor\u2019s [actions] in the context of the entire trial. . . . Just as the prosecutor\u2019s remarks must be gauged in the context of the entire trial, once a series of serious improprieties has been identified we must determine whether the totality of the improprieties leads to the conclusion that the defendant was deprived of a fair trial. . . . Thus, the question in the present case is whether the sum total of [the prosecutor\u2019s] improprieties rendered the defendant\u2019s [trial] fundamentally unfair, in violation of his right to due process. . . . The question of whether the defendant has been prejudiced by prosecutorial [impropriety] , therefore, depends on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different absent the sum total of the improprieties. . . . Furthermore, whether a new trial or proceeding is warranted depends, in part, on whether defense counsel has made a timely objection to any of the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">\u201cWe are mindful throughout this inquiry, however, of the unique responsibilities of the prosecutor in our judicial system. . . . [T]he prosecutor is expected to refrain from impugning, directly or through implication, the integrity or institutional role of defense counsel. . . . [I]t is improper for a prosecutor to tell a jury, explicitly or implicitly, that defense counsel is employing standard tactics used in all trials, because such argument relies on facts not in evidence and has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>no bearing on the issue before the jury, namely, the guilt or innocence of the defendant. . . . There is a distinction [however] between argument that disparages the integrity or role of defense counsel and argument that disparages a theory of defense. . . . Moreover, not every use of rhetorical language is improper. . . . There is ample room, in the heat of argument, for the prosecutor to challenge vigorously the arguments made by defense counsel. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">\u201cThe prosecutor may not express his own opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Nor should a prosecutor express his opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the guilt of the defendant. . . . Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony, and are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the prosecutor\u2019s special position. . . . Moreover, because the jury is aware that the prosecutor has prepared and presented the case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence ... it is likely to infer that such matters precipitated the personal opinions. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">\u201c[T]he state may argue [however] that its witnesses testified credibly, if such an argument is based on reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence. . . . Specifically, the state may argue that a witness has no motive to lie.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Outing, </em>298 Conn. 34, 81-83, 3 A.3d 1 (2010), cert. denied, U.S. , 131 S.

Ed. 2d 316 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Whether the Prosecutor Committed Improprieties</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">The defendant first contends that the prosecutor acted improperly when he \u201crepeatedly commented on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>the guilt of [the] defendant and attempted to influence the jury by his persistent use of the terms \u2018victim,\u2019 \u2018murder,\u2019 and \u2018murder weapon\u2019 throughout the trial . . . .\u201d The defendant contends that the prosecutor referred to Rivera as the \u201cvictim\u201d thirty-one times, referred to his death as \u201cmurder\u201d five times, and referred to the firearm as the \u201cmurder weapon\u201d eight times during closing argument. He directs us to similar occurrences during the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of trial witnesses where he alleges that the prosecutor referred to Rivera as the \u201cvictim\u201d twenty-seven times, referred to his death as \u201cmurder\u201d twelve times, and referred to the firearm as the \u201cmurder weapon\u201d six times. We agree that in a case such as this, where the defendant has asserted a self-defense claim, it is improper for the prosecutor repeatedly to use the words victim, murder and minder weapon throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">\u201cThe prosecutor may not express his own opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Nor should a prosecutor express his opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the guilt of the defendant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>286 Conn. 499, 546, 944 A.2d 947, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 916, 129 S. Ct. 271, 172 L. Ed. 2d 200 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">In his presentation of this argument, the defendant cites to several cases in which reviewing courts have held it improper for a trial judge to use the words \u201cvictim\u201d or \u201cmurder\u201d when giving jury instructions. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cortes, </em>276 Conn. 241, 249 n.4, 885 A.2d 153 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>100 Conn. App. 236, 253, 917 A.2d 1051, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 933, 935 A.2d 152 (2007); <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>73 App. Div. 2d 693, 693-94, 423 N.Y.S.2d 229 (1979); <em>People </em>v. <em>Orosco, </em>73 Cal. App. 580, 239 P. 82 (1925). The defendant argues that it equally is wrong for a prosecutor to use such terms in the course of trial and closing argument where there is a claim of self-defense. Citing to <em>Santiago, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>defendant argues that although \u201cit was undisputed that Rivera was shot and killed, the disputed issue was whether [the] defendant committed murder or whether he acted in self-defense, and, as such . . . [i]f his conduct in shooting [Rivera] was justified, [Rivera] was not a victim of any crime at the defendant\u2019s hands.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Essentially, he argues, if the jury credited his self-defense claim, there would have been no victim, no murder and no murder weapon in this case, and the prosecutor\u2019s use of those words, therefore, improperly implied to the jury that he believed the defendant was guilty. Under the circumstances presented here, we agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The state cites, in part, to <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>278 Conn. 354, 897 A.2d 569 (2006), and to <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>107 Conn. App. 685, 946 A.2d 294, cert. denied, 288 Conn. 904, 953 A.2d 650 (2008), and argues that although it is improper for <em>the court </em>to refer to the decedent as \u201cthe victim\u201d; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Cortes, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 249 n.4; it is not improper for <em>the prosecutor </em>to employ such terms during questioning and during closing argument. In <em>Warholic, </em>the defendant claimed that the prosecutor\u2019s two references to the complainant as \u201cthe victim\u201d were improper, especially in light of the fact that the defendant had contested that a crime had occurred. <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>supra, 369. Our Supreme Court, noting a clear distinction between the court\u2019s use of the word \u201cvictim,\u201d which is improper in such circumstances, and the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word, held that the use of this word by the prosecutor was not improper because the jury readily would understand that it \u201creflected the state\u2019s contention that, based on the state\u2019s evidence, the complainant was the victim of the alleged crimes.\u201d Id., 370. We note, however, that in <em>Warholic </em>the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word \u201cvictim\u201d was made during closing argument, after the jury had heard the evidence, and it was an argument based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>84 Conn. App. 767, 776, 854 A.2d 1145 (2004), rev\u2019d, 278 Conn. 354, 897 A.2d 569 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 107 Conn. App. 701-702, the defendant had been charged with two counts of robbery in the second degree and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery in the second degree. The defendant testified during trial, and he asserted that no crime had been committed and that his interactions with the victim were related to a drug deal. In a motion in limine, the defendant requested that the court prohibit the prosecutor from using the word \u201cvictim\u201d to describe the complainant dining questioning of witnesses and closing argument. The court denied the request, and the prosecutor used the word \u201cvictim\u201d a few times during trial. On appeal, the defendant claimed that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word \u201cvictim\u201d to describe the complainant was improper. We explained that there was an evidentiary basis for the jury to conclude that a crime had occurred in the case and, therefore, the use of the word \u201cvictim\u201d was not improper. Id., 703. We further explained: \u201cJurors understand the respective roles of the prosecutor and defense counsel. It should not be assumed that jurors will be unduly influenced by the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word victim. We therefore conclude[d], under the facts of [that] case, that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to [the complainant] as the victim was appropriate, not the expression of a personal opinion, and did not constitute prosecutorial impropriety that denied the defendant a fair trial.\u201d Id. We went onto note, however, that the \u201cprosecutor used the word victim sporadically when questioning two of the state\u2019s seven witnesses . . . [and that] the defendant concede [d] that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word victim when examining the state\u2019s witnesses was not frequent.\u201d Id., 701-702. This court also concluded that the use of the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>victim during closing argument was not likely to confuse the jury because it was based on the evidence and was a proper form of rhetorical argument. Id., 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">We conclude that the present case is distinguishable from both <em>Warholic and Rodriguez. </em>In the present case, the prosecutor repeatedly used the words \u201cmurder\u201d and \u201cmurder weapon\u201d in addition to the word \u201cvictim\u201d throughout the entire trial. In <em>Warholic, </em>our Supreme Court clearly stated that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word \u201cvictim\u201d during closing argument was not improper because the jury would understand that it was based on evidence presented and on the state\u2019s argument that the defendant had committed the crimes charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 370. An important factor in our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Warholic </em>was the fact that the prosecutor used the term \u201cvictim\u201d during the course of closing argument, when the jury would understand that the prosecutor was using the word to argue, on the basis of the evidence that had been presented, that the state had proven its case. See id., 369-70. It was permissible rhetorical argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">In <em>Rodriguez, </em>this court also concluded that the use of the word victim by the prosecutor during closing argument was nothing more than a permissible rhetorical device, based on the state\u2019s view of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 107 Conn. App. 703. In analyzing the use of the word during witness questioning, however, this court concluded that the use was sporadic and, presumably, harmless. Id., 701-702.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">We conclude that <em>Warholic and Rodriguez </em>are distinguishable from the present case. We are persuaded that, in a case where there is a challenge as to whether a crime occurred, the repeated use of the words victim, murder and murder weapon is improper. See <em>People </em>v. Price, 1 Cal. 4th 324, 480, 821 P.2d 610, 3 Cal. Rptr. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>106 (1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 851, 113 S. Ct. 152, 121 L. Ed. 2d 102 (1992); <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>State, </em>600 A.2d 21, 24 (Del. 1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Devey, </em>138 P.3d 90, 95 (Utah App. 2006); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>266 Conn. 440, 473, 832 A.2d 626 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Price, </em>supra, 1 Cal. 4th 324, the defendant was convicted, inter aha, of two counts of first degree murder and was sentenced to death. The defendant argued, among his numerous claims on direct appeal, that the use of the word murder by a witness was improper. Id., 479. Despite the fact that the killing referred to as a \u201cmurder\u201d was not one of the killings for which the defendant was standing trial at that time, the California Supreme Court explained in relevant part: \u201cAlthough it would be improper for a prosecutor to use the term \u2018murder\u2019 in questioning a witness about an unadjudicated killing, a prosecutor is of course free to argue to the jury, after all the evidence had been presented, that it should find that a killing was murder.\u201d Id., 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 600 A.2d 23, the defendant claimed on appeal that the court committed plain error by, inter alia, permitting the prosecutor to use the word victim repeatedly when referring to the complaining witness while conducting his examination of certain law enforcement witnesses. The defendant had been charged, in part, with unlawful sexual intercourse in the first degree, but he claimed that the act had been consensual. Id., 22-23. He asserted for the first time on appeal, that because \u201cconsent was his sole defense, reference to a \u2018victim\u2019 assume [d] that a crime had been committed and the sexual acts were non-consensual. Thus, he argue [d] any reference to the complaining witness as \u2018the victim\u2019 convey[ed] to the jury a conclusion of guilt.\u201d Id., 24. The Supreme Court of Delaware stated: \u201cThe term \u2018victim\u2019 is used appropriately during trial when there is no doubt that a crime was committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>and simply the identity of the perpetrator is in issue. We agree with defendant that the word \u2018victim\u2019 should not be used in a case where the commission of a crime is in dispute.\u201d Id. The court, however, determined that \u201c[t]he trial court, when it allowed the prosecutor to use the word \u2018victim,\u2019 did not commit plain error because the term \u2018victim,\u2019 to law enforcement officers, is a term of art synonymous with \u2018complaining witness.\u2019 Moreover, the term \u2018victim\u2019 is also used in the indictment in this case as it is routinely in criminal charges which are read to the jury. Although the term should be avoided in the questioning of witnesses in situations where consent is an issue, its use in this case, without objection, does not constitute plain error.\u201d Id., 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">After the state filed a motion for clarification or rehearing en banc, the Supreme Court of Delaware, sitting en banc, further explained its decision in an amendment to the original decision; the court explained: \u201cThe [c]ourt\u2019s criticism was directed to a prosecutor\u2019s repeated use of the term [\u2019victim\u2019] in a case where consent was the sole defense, and the principal issue one of credibility, to suggest to the jury, that a crime necessarily had been committed. In this case, if the defense of consent were accepted by the jury, no crime would have been proven and the complaining witness would not be deemed a victim. In such cases it is incompatible with the presumption of innocence for the prosecutor to refer to the complaining witness as the \u2018victim,\u2019 just as it is to refer to the defendant as a \u2018criminal.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>516 Pa. 527, 533 A.2d 994 (1987). In each instance, the use of a particular term assumes the commission of a crime. If there is no dispute that a crime has, in fact, occurred, there is no harm in referring to the existence of a victim. In a narrow range of cases, such as this, such use is clearly unwarranted. It is improper for a prosecutor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>assume as a given, or to suggest to the jury, the existence of that which is in dispute. It is a practice to be avoided, but, as the opinion emphasizes, in the absence of an objection it does not constitute plain error.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 600 A.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Devey, </em>supra, 138 P.3d 95, the defendant had been convicted of multiple sexual abuse crimes committed against his biological daughter. On appeal, the defendant alleged, inter alia, that he was prejudiced by a testifying witness\u2019 reference to the complainant as \u201cthe victim,\u201d which, he argued, deprived him of the presumption of innocence. Id. The court agreed that such references were improper: \u201cWe agree with [the defendant] that in cases such as this\u2014where a defendant claims that the charged crime did not actually occur, and the allegations against that defendant are based almost exclusively on the complaining witness\u2019s testimony\u2014the trial court, the [s]tate, and all witnesses should be prohibited from referring to the complaining witness as \u2018the victim.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">We also are guided by <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 473, a case in which our Supreme Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s repeated reference to the defendant as a \u201ckiller\u201d was improper. The court explained: \u201cIt is no part of a [prosecutor\u2019s] duty, and it is not his right, to stigmatize a defendant. He has a right to argue that the evidence proves the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment, but for the [prosecutor] himself to characterize the defendant as a cold-blooded killer is something quite different. No [defendant] on trial for murder can be officially characterized as a murderer or as a cold-blooded killer, until he is adjudged guilty of murder or pleads guilty to that charge. . . . The prosecutor\u2019s repeated references to the defendant as a killer, therefore, were improper comments on the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 472-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>In the present case, the prosecutor referred to Rivera as \u201cthe victim\u201d approximately twenty-seven times, to the killing as a \u201cmurder\u201d approximately twelve times and to the firearm as the \u201cmurder weapon\u201d approximately six times during the evidentiary phase of the trial, and he similarly used those terms throughout closing argument. We conclude that such repeated references were improper. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 600 A.2d 25; <em>State </em>v. <em>Devey, </em>supra, 138 P.3d 95. When there is no doubt that a homicide<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> occurred and that the defendant was the person who caused it to occur, and the only question for the jury is whether the homicide was justified, the prosecutor\u2019s repeated reference to the \u201cvictim,\u201d the \u201cmurder\u201d and the \u201cmurder weapon\u201d amounts to an opinion on the ultimate issue of the case. We conclude, therefore, that the prosecutor\u2019s repeated use of these words was improper in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The defendant next contends that the prosecutor violated <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 693, when he argued that in order to acquit the defendant, the jury would have to find that every other witness \u201cwas wrong.\u201d He argues that there is \u201cno distinction between a prosecutor using the word \u2018wrong\u2019 or \u2018mistaken\u2019 instead of \u2018lying\u2019\u2014all are equally improper.\u201d The state argues that there is a distinction when such words are used during closing argument. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">In <em>Singh, </em>our Supreme Court explained that it \u201cpreviously ha[d] not had the opportunity to address the well established evidentiary rule that it is improper to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>ask a witness to comment on another witness\u2019 veracity. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>176 F.3d 1214, 1219-20 (9th Cir. 1999); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaines, </em>170 F.3d 72, 81 (1st Cir. 1999); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lin, </em>101 F.3d 760, 769 (D.C. Cir. 1996); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scanio, </em>900 F.2d 485, 493 (2d Cir. 1990); <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>State, </em>632 So. 2d 62, 65-66 (Fla. 1993); <em>People </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>63 Ill. App. 3d 176, 184-85,379 N.E.2d 746 (1978); <em>State v. Manning, 270 </em>Kan. 674, 19 P.3d 84, 103 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>431 Mass. 168, 177, 726 N.E.2d 913 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>111 N.M. 93, 97, 801 P.2d 675 (App. 1990); <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>State, </em>329 S.C. 88, 91, 495 S.E.2d 445 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Emmett, </em>839 P.2d 781, 787 (Utah 1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Casteneda-Perez, </em>61 Wn. App. 354, 362, 810 P.2d 74 (1991). A few of these courts have drawn a distinction between using the words wrong or mistaken rather than lying in questions and closing arguments, concluding that the former terms are not improper because they merely [highlight] the objective conflict without requiring the witness to condemn the prior witness as a purveyor of deliberate falsehood, i.e., a liar. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaind, </em>31 F.3d 73, 77 (2d Cir. 1994); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaines, </em>supra, 82 (use of word wrong proper in present case but court declines to address whether it would be in all instances); but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>supra, 97 (asking if another witness is mistaken is improper because it may amount to simply argument to the jury, in which the prosecutor improperly suggests that the only possible alternatives are that either the defendant or the witness is a liar).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 706-707.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The court further explained: \u201cSeveral reasons underlie the prohibition on such questions. First, it is well established that determinations of credibility are for the jury, and not for witnesses. . . . Consequently, questions that ask a defendant to comment on another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>witness\u2019 veracity invade the province of the jury. . . . Moreover, [a]s a general rule, [such] questions have no probative value and are improper and argumentative because they do nothing to assist the jury in assessing witness credibility in its fact-finding mission and in determining the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">\u201cSecond, questions of this sort also create the risk that the jury may conclude that, in order to acquit the defendant, it must find that the witness has lied. . . . This risk is especially acute when the witness is a government agent in a criminal case. ... A witness\u2019 testimony, however, can be unconvincing or wholly or partially incorrect for a number of reasons without any deliberate misrepresentation being involved . . . such as misrecollection, failure of recollection or other innocent reason. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">\u201cSimilarly, courts have long admonished prosecutors to avoid statements to the effect that if the defendant is innocent, the jury must conclude that witnesses have lied. . . . The reason for this restriction is that [t]his form of argument . . . involves a distortion of the government\u2019s burden of proof. . . . Moreover, like the problem inherent in asking a defendant to comment on the veracity of another witness, such arguments preclude the possibility that the witness\u2019 testimony conflicts with that of the defendant for a reason other than deceit.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 707-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">In the present case, during closing argument the prosecutor told the jury that \u201cin order for you to find the defendant not guilty of the crime of murder, you have to find that everybody is wrong in this case. The police are wrong. The detectives who interviewed him are wrong. The defendant\u2019s own friends and associates are wrong. Ms. Yesenia Diaz is wrong, the interpreter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Right? And almost incredibly, you\u2019ve got find that the defendant\u2019s own statement is wrong, that he was wrong, because he didn\u2019t tell the cops that he acted in self-defense. You can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t do that.\u201d During rebuttal argument, the prosecutor similarly argued: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, in order for you to find the defendant not guilty you have to find that every single person in this case is wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Although the state argues that saying to the jury that all the witnesses are wrong is not the same as saying that the jury would have to find that they all lied, guided by our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Singh, </em>we disagree. In Singh, our Supreme Court very clearly stated that it would not \u201cmake [a] distinction between using the word wrong as opposed to lying. . . . Although questioning whether a witness\u2019 testimony is wrong may, at first blush, seem less egregious, we conclude that it is nonetheless improper because it requires the witness to characterize testimony and may lead to the same problematic results.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 712 n.16. We are not persuaded that this conclusion is any less relevant to closing argument than to witness examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Thus, we conclude that arguments to the jury that it must find that all of the witnesses other than the defendant were wrong in order to conclude that the defendant is not guilty are improper. In this case, because the prosecutor did just that, we conclude that his comments were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor acted improperly during closing argument when he appealed to the jurors\u2019 passions and emotions by injecting allegations that had nothing to do with the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. In particular, the defendant cites to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>following statements made by the prosecutor: \u201cWhen you look at the victim in this photograph\u2014it\u2019s in the indignity of death, isn\u2019t it? Right? But what you see there is a human being. . . . [T]here\u2019s been nothing presented in this case that would justify the defendant taking that nine millimeter pistol and executing him. Nothing. . . . Rivera can\u2019t speak to you today, and he can\u2019t tell you what he saw in the moments before the first bullet tore into his body. He can\u2019t tell you which bullet hit him first.\u201d He also cites to the following statement made by the prosecutor during rebuttal argument: \u201c[W]hen [Rivera] went up the steps on that fatal night, he was alone. He was all alone. The defendant had his crew behind him or his team. And in a few minutes, ladies and gentlemen, [Rivera] won\u2019t be alone anymore because you\u2019re going to get this case.\u201d He further cites to the prosecutor\u2019s direction to the jury to \u201c[l]ook at the evidence in this case. Hold the state to [its burden]. But if you do that, and do your duty as jurors, there\u2019s only one conclusion you can reach . . . murder and that it was not justified.\u201d The state contends that reviewed in the context in which these statements were given, they were not improper. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">It is well established that \u201c[a] prosecutor may not appeal to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors. . . . When the prosecutor appeals to emotions, he invites the jury to decide the case, not according to a rational appraisal of the evidence, but on the basis of powerful and irrelevant factors which are likely to skew that appraisal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) St<em>ate </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Each of the challenged statements, read in the context in which they were given, reveals that the prosecutor told the jury that it must base its verdict on the evidence and that the state bore the burden of proof. The statements also were tied to the evidence and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>reasonable inferences drawn from that evidence. We conclude that the statements were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The defendant next argues that the prosecutor acted improperly by denigrating the integrity of defense counsel during closing argument. In particular, the defendant challenges the following rebuttal statements: \u201cDo you know how the octopus protects itself in the water? It shoots out ink into the water. Do you know what happens when you shoot out the ink? The water gets muddy and the octopus swims away. That\u2019s what [is] being attempted here. Defense counsel wants you to focus on the police. She wants me to say that the police aren\u2019t on trial. Evaluate the police officers\u2019 conduct. You should. Absolutely, you should. But don\u2019t lose sight [of] the fact for one second that the defendant [is] on trial. And every moment that you spend evaluating other people\u2019s conduct is time that you\u2019re not spending evaluating the defendant\u2019s conduct, and that\u2019s called a shotgun approach. You shoot it against the wall and you hope that something will stick.\u201d The defendant argues that several courts from other jurisdictions have held this type of argument improper. The state argues that we previously have held that statements made during closing argument, telling the jury to focus on the evidence and to not be fooled by defense counsel\u2019s arguments, are not improper and that this, essentially, is what the prosecutor did in this case. We agree with the state.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>As stated previously: \u201c [T]he prosecutor is expected to refrain from impugning, directly or through implication, the integrity or institutional role of defense counsel. . . . [I]t is improper for a prosecutor to tell a jury, explicitly or implicitly, that defense counsel is employing standard tactics used in all trials .... There is a distinction [however] between argument that disparages the integrity or role of defense counsel and argument that disparages a theory of defense. . . . Moreover, not every use of rhetorical language is improper. . . . There is ample room, in the heat of argument, for the prosecutor to challenge vigorously the arguments made by defense counsel.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Outing, </em>supra, 298 Conn. 82-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Reviewing the prosecutor\u2019s comments in context, we conclude that the challenged remarks fell within the bounds of proper commentary. The prosecutor asked the jurors to review and evaluate the conduct of the police and of the defendant and to focus on the evidence. Although some of the language employed may have been ill-advised, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s statements did not denigrate the integrity of defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">5</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The defendant also claims that the prosecutor acted improperly by attempting to influence the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of his witnesses and by inserting his personal knowledge into the case. First, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly asked several of the state\u2019s witnesses on direct and redirect examination if they were telling the truth or if they were prepared to tell the truth in an attempt to bolster or rehabilitate the credibility of these witnesses before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>they were impeached. Second, the defendant claims that the prosecutor inserted his own knowledge into the case in an effort to bolster the credibility of Carlos Ayala, a jailhouse informant. We will consider each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">First, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly asked several of the state\u2019s witnesses on direct examination and on redirect examination if they were telling the truth or if they were prepared to tell the truth. This, he argues, was an attempt by the prosecutor to bolster or rehabilitate the credibility of these witnesses before the witnesses were impeached. The state argues that each of the witnesses had testified that they had pending criminal cases and that they did not want to testify in the present case. The questions posed relating to their truthfulness, it argues, merely were attempts to confirm that despite their reluctance to testify, they still were prepared to tell the truth.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that the questions posed on direct examination were improper attempts at bolstering the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">\u201cEvidence that bolsters a witness\u2019 credibility before it has come under attack is prohibited.

Such use does not violate the general rule that accreditation before impeachment is improper. [Id., 431]. In <em>Juan V., </em>in order to lay a foundation for the introduction of a video-tape interview under the [rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986)], the prosecution was allowed to ask victim if she knew she was supposed to tell the truth during the video-taped interview. The court rightly contrasted that proper question with the improper question whether she was in fact telling the truth. Id. at 439-441.\u201d C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, supra, p. 49 (Cum. Sup. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">In this case, the defendant points to three instances during direct examination in which he alleges that the prosecutor improperly attempted to bolster the credibility of three different witnesses and to two instances where he attempted to bolster witnesses\u2019 credibility during redirect examination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our review of these questions leads us to the conclusion that the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>improperly attempted to bolster the credibility of several of the state\u2019s witnesses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Juan V., </em>supra, 109 Conn. App. 439-41; C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, supra, pp. 342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor inserted his own knowledge into the case in an effort to bolster the credibility of Ayala, ajailhouse informant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Specifically, he argues: \u201cInstead of actually questioning Ayala, the prosecutor used his questions as a vehicle to get before the jury facts about his own understanding of what Ayala would receive, thereby demonstrating that Ayala was credible.\u201d The state argues that Ayala already had testified to the fact that he had received no promises in exchange for his testimony and that, therefore, this line of questioning was based on evidence already before the jury and was not an attempt by the prosecutor to insert his own knowledge into the case. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">\u201cA prosecutor . . . may not . . . inject extraneous issues into the case that divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence. ... A prosecutor, in fulfilling his duties, must confine himself to the evidence in the record. ... [A] lawyer shall not . . . [a]ssert his personal knowledge of the facts in issue, except when testifying as a witness. . . . Statements as to facts that have not been proven amount to unsworn testimony, which is not the subject of proper closing argument.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>293 Conn. 781, 809, 981 A.2d 1030 (2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 954, 130 S. Ct. 3386, 177 L. Ed. 2d 306 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Before posing the questions of which the defendant complains; see footnote 6 of this opinion; the prosecutor asked Ayala about all the criminal charges he had pend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>ing, including \u201csome pretty serious charges.\u201d The prosecutor also asked him about his prior convictions and the fact that he was on probation at that time. The prosecutor then asked Ayala to explain how he had come in contact with the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office regarding the defendant\u2019s case. After Ayala explained that he had contacted the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office and had met with a representative from that office, the prosecutor asked him if he or anyone \u201cfrom the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office ever discuss [ed] that [he] would get any benefit from testifying in court today?\u201d Ayala responded: \u201cNo, sir.\u201d The prosecutor then asked: \u201cAll right. What were you told about if you testified? Explain to the jury in your own words:</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">\u201cA. Nothing is promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">\u201cQ. Did I even discuss your cases?</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">\u201cA. No, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Our review of the transcript reveals that the information concerning whether Ayala had been promised any benefit in exchange for his testimony was before the jury before the prosecutor asked the questions that the defendant now claims were improper interjections of personal knowledge. Accordingly, we reject the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">Whether the Improprieties Deprived The Defendant of a Fair Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">Having determined that prosecutorial improprieties were present in the defendant\u2019s case, we now proceed to determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s violations deprived the defendant of a fair trial by analyzing those violations in accordance with the factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). \u201cThese factors include the extent to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>[impropriety] was invited by defense conduct or argument, the severity of the [impropriety], the frequency of the [impropriety], the centrality of the [impropriety] to the critical issues in the case, the strength of the curative measures adopted, and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Outing, </em>supra, 298 Conn. 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Applying the first <em>Williams </em>factor; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540; we conclude that the improprieties were not invited by defense conduct or argument. Considering the second of the <em>Williams </em>factors, the severity of the improprieties; see id.; we conclude that the improprieties were not severe. In this case, the prosecutor repeatedly used the words \u2018victim,\u2019 \u2018murder,\u2019 and \u2018murder weapon\u2019 throughout the trial, he violated <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 693, by arguing that in order to acquit the defendant, the jury would have to find that every other witness \u201cwas wrong\u201d and he improperly attempted to bolster the testimony of several witnesses by asking them if they were telling the truth. Reviewing these improprieties in light of our Supreme Court precedent; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 479; we conclude that they were not severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">In <em>Thompson, </em>our Supreme Court found several instances of improper conduct on the part of the prosecutor, including his repeated references to the defendant as a \u201c \u2018killer\u2019 \u201d; id., 472; his description of the testimony of the defendant\u2019s two principal witnesses as \u201c \u2018reprehensible\u2019 \u201d; id., 461; his statements to the jury that those witnesses were \u201c \u2018lying\u2019 \u201d; id., 467; and that they lacked both \u201c \u2018moral fortitude\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018conscience\u2019 \u201d; id., 461; his statements to the jury that the defendant\u2019s witnesses lived in a \u201c \u2018twisted world\u2019,\u201d were not \u201c \u2018stand-up enough guy[s]\u2019 \u201d and that they had \u201c \u2018reserved a place in hell for themselves\u2019 \u201d; id.; and his argument to the jury that to believe the trial testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, the jury had to believe that the state\u2019s witnesses had lied. Id., 469-70. We conclude that in the present case, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was less severe than that of the prosecutor in <em>Thompson. </em>Accordingly, employing the <em>Thompson </em>standard, as we must, we conclude that the improprieties were not severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Applying the third <em>Williams </em>factor, we consider the frequency of the improprieties. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540. Although we have determined that there were several instances of prosecutorial impropriety in this c\u00e1se, we cannot say that they were frequent. The defendant\u2019s trial lasted nearly two weeks and takes up more than one thousand pages of transcript. The instances of improper prosecutorial conduct were infrequent when compared to the entirety of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">We next consider the fourth <em>Williams </em>factor, the centrality of the improprieties to the critical issues in the case. See id. The defendant argues that \u201cthe prosecutor attempted to obtain a conviction by having the jury consider not the evidence and the charge, but instead, by persistently characterizing [the] defendant\u2019s actions as murder and Rivera as a victim, by bringing in sympathy for Rivera and [by] inflaming the jurors\u2019 passions, by repeatedly emphasizing that his witnesses were credible, by denigrating defense counsel and by arguing that every single witness was lying if [the] defendant was innocent.\u201d The state concedes that \u201cthe alleged improprieties affected the central issue in this case, which was whether the defendant murdered the victim or acted in self-defense, but not significantly so.\u201d We conclude that the improprieties were central to the critical issues of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">We next look to the strength of the curative measures adopted by the court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Conn. 540. In this case, the defendant failed to object to any of the improprieties, or otherwise to call them to the attention of the court, and the court did not adopt, nor have the opportunity to consider whether to adopt, specific curative measures. Our Supreme Court determined in <em>Thompson </em>that defense counsel has a responsibility to call perceived prosecutorial improprieties to the attention of the court: \u201c[T]he defendant, by failing to bring [the instances of impropriety] to the attention of the trial court, bears much of the responsibility for the fact that these claimed improprieties went uncured. We emphasize the responsibility of defense counsel, at the very least, to object to perceived prosecutorial improprieties as they occur at trial, and we continue to adhere to the well established maxim that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument when it was made suggests that defense counsel did not believe that it was unfair in light of the record of the case at the time. . . . Moreover . . . defense counsel may elect not to object to arguments that he or she deems marginally objectionable for tactical reasons, namely, because he or she does not want to draw the jury\u2019s attention to it or because he or she wants to later refute that argument. . . . Accordingly, we emphasize that counsel\u2019s failure to object at trial, while not by itself fatal to a defendant\u2019s claim, frequently will indicate on appellate review that the challenged comments do not rise to the magnitude of constitutional error . . . [that] clearly exists and clearly deprive[s] the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 483-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">We also are mindful of the fact that although the court gave no specific curative instructions, it specifically did instruct the jury during its general instructions: \u201cYou are the sole judges on the facts. It is your duty to find the facts. You are to recollect and weigh the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>and form your own conclusions as to what the ultimate facts are. You may not go outside the evidence introduced in court to find the facts. This means that you may not resort to guesswork, conjecture or suspicion, and you must not be influenced by any personal likes or dislikes, opinions, prejudices or sympathy. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">\u201cIn reaching your verdict, you should consider all the testimony and exhibits received into evidence. Certain things are not evidence, and you may not consider them in deciding what the facts are. These include . . . [arguments and statements by lawyers. ... In deciding what the facts are, you must consider all the evidence. In doing this, you must decide which testimony to believe and which testimony not to believe. You may believe all, none, or any part of a witness\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">\u201cIn this case, as in all criminal prosecutions, the defendant is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The burden to prove the defendant guilty of the crime with which he is charged is upon the state. The defendant does not have to prove his innocence.\u201d The court also gave a thorough instruction on the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">There is no indication that the jury did not follow the instructions of the court. \u201cIn the absence of a showing that the jury failed or declined to follow the court\u2019s instructions, we presume that it heeded them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 485. Accordingly, although the court did not provide specific curative instructions, it did provide general guidance to the jury, which we presume, in the absence of any indication otherwise, that the jury followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">The final <em>Williams </em>factor that we must consider is the strength of the state\u2019s case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>supra, 204 Conn. 540. In this case, the jury had before it evidence that the defendant shot Rivera in front of persons who witnessed the entire incident and that he admitted that when he fired the gun he intended to shoot Rivera. He fired eight gunshots from close range, four of which hit Rivera, with three of the four gunshots entering Rivera\u2019s body from the rear. After the shooting the defendant ran upstairs and gave the firearm to his friend, Garcia, and then left the scene. The defendant removed the red T-shirt he had been wearing and discarded it into some bushes. He later telephoned his friend, Velez, telling Velez that he needed to get away because he had shot someone. Velez, who had planned on going to New York, offered the defendant a ride, which he accepted. During the ride, the defendant told Velez and the other men in the vehicle, Rios and Gonzalez, that he had shot a man on Locust Street because the man would not respond to his orders. He did not remain to help Rivera. His behavior after the shooting is consistent with consciousness of guilt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>104 Conn. App. 69, 85, 931 A.2d 939, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 937, 937 A.2d 695 (2007). Also, in his September 20, 2006 statement to the police, the defendant admitted to shooting Rivera. The defendant further admitted that he had fired at Rivera because, as Rivera walked toward him, Rivera ignored his commands that Rivera remove his hands from his pockets and take off his hood. This evidence leads us to conclude that the state\u2019s case was strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Although we do not condone the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments in this case, on the basis of our assessment of these comments, analyzed in the context of the entire trial, we cannot conclude that the defendant was denied the right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on the meaning of reasonable doubt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>which misled the jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the instruction was constitutionally infirm and, in the alternative, that it was plain error. Specifically, he claims that the following excerpt from the court\u2019s oral charge misled the jury: \u201cThe meaning of reasonable doubt can be arrived at by emphasizing the word reasonable. It is not a surmise, a guess or mere conjecture. It is not a doubt suggested by counsel <em>which is warranted </em>by the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The defendant argues that the import of the court\u2019s instruction was that \u201cdoubts raised by defense counsel even if warranted by the evidence are not reasonable doubts . . . .\u201d Although we agree that the court\u2019s oral reading of this instruction was incorrect, we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">\u201c[A]n erroneous charge is not always harmful. . . . An isolated error in an instruction may be cured by other portions of the charge .... We have often said that the charge should be read as a whole in determining whether it is reasonably possible that an erroneous instruction could have misled a jury concerning the state\u2019s burden of proof. It is well established . . . that individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding them to a proper verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>205 Conn. 352, 356, 533 A.2d 857 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 906, 108 S. Ct. 1079, 99 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The day before giving its final instructions to the jury in this case, the court handed written jury instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>to both defense counsel and the prosecutor. The written instructions provided, in relevant part: \u201cThe meaning of reasonable doubt can be arrived at by emphasizing the word reasonable. It is not a surmise, a guess or mere conjecture. It is not a doubt suggested by counsel which is <em>not </em>warranted by the evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) The next day, as the court prepared to read its instructions to the jury, it asked that the lights of the courtroom be dimmed, and it projected the written instructions onto the wall so that the members of the jury could follow along as the instructions were read out loud. Although the transcript indicates that the court left out the word \u201cnot\u201d from its oral reading of the instructions, the written instructions themselves reveal that the word \u201cnot\u201d was included in the written form of the instructions, which the jury had the opportunity to see as the court was reading them aloud. Additionally, the written form of the instructions, with the correct wording, was given to the jury for its consideration during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims only that the omission of the word \u201cnot\u201d from the court\u2019s oral reading of the instructions rendered the entirety of the instructions on reasonable doubt misleading. On the basis of the record before us, considering the instructions as a whole, as well as the fact that the jury had the correct written instructions available during deliberation and had those same correct written instructions projected on the courtroom wall during the court\u2019s reading of those instructions, we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">In this opinion BISHOP, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\"> See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478-79, 86 S.

I agree with the majority that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>I respectfully write separately because I am not persuaded by the majority\u2019s conclusion that the prosecutor violated <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 793 A.2d 226 (2002), when he argued that in order to find the defendant, Jonathan Albino, not guilty, the jury would have to find that every other witness was \u201cwrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">During the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to the jury, he stated: \u201c[I]n order for you to find the defendant not guilty of the crime of murder, you have to find that everybody is wrong in this case. The police are wrong. The detectives who interviewed him are wrong. The defendant\u2019s own friends and associates are wrong. Ms. Yesenia Diaz is wrong, the interpreter. Right? And almost incredibly, you\u2019ve got to find that the defendant\u2019s own statement is wrong, that he was wrong, because he didn\u2019t tell the cops that he acted in self-defense. You can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">During his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[Y]ou all indicated that you have a strength in judging the credibility of the witnesses. Some of you have indicated that that\u2019s a personal strength of yours. Now is the time. Ms. Yesenia Diaz is a window for you into the interview room. If you find that she\u2019s not credible, then you find the defendant\u2019s version credible, because they\u2019re in complete conflict, aren\u2019t they? They\u2019re in conflict. Ladies and gentlemen, in order for you to find the defendant not guilty you have to find that every single person in this case is wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">In <em>Singh, </em>our Supreme Court held that it is improper to ask a witness to comment on another witness\u2019 veracity, in large part because determining the credibility of witnesses is solely within the province of the jury. As the court concluded in that case, \u201c[tjherefore, we reject the state\u2019s invitation to carve out an exception to the rule that a witness may not be asked to characterize another witness\u2019 testimony as a lie, mistaken or wrong. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Moreover, closing arguments providing, in essence, that in order to find the defendant not guilty, the jury must find that witnesses had lied, are similarly improper.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 712. In its conclusion, the court specifically drew a distinction between the questioning of a witness and statements of counsel during closing argument in the present case. The threat that a jury would be improperly influenced by a prosecutor\u2019s argument is greatly reduced as compared to direct testimony from a witness concerning another witness\u2019 veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In this case, during his closing argument, the prosecutor stated that the jury would have to find several testifying witnesses to be \u201cwrong\u201d in order for the jury to find the defendant not guilty. Essentially, the prosecutor\u2019s statements were intended to convey that the jury was faced with testimony by the defendant that conflicted with the testimony of other witnesses and, in fact, the defendant\u2019s own written statement that was in evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 584, 849 A.2d 626 (2004) (it is not improper for a prosecutor to argue that defendant\u2019s testimony is \u201c \u2018totally unbelievable\u2019 \u201d when \u201cit was a comment on the evidence presented at trial, and it posited a reasonable inference that the jury itself could have drawn without access to the assistant state\u2019s attorney\u2019s personal knowledge of the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">I concur in affirming the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
