The farm was originally owned by Louis Specyalski (Louis) who died intestate in 1962.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Louis\u2019 nine children agreed in writing to convey their interests in the farm to one of their siblings, Valentine Specyalski (Valentine).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Valentine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>now deceased, devised his interest in the farm by his will to the defendant Frank Koba, his nephew. The plaintiffs<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> claim that an oral agreement or understanding existed among Louis\u2019 children that the written agreement really conveyed only a life use, not a fee interest, to Valentine, and that they, as the heirs of Louis\u2019 other children, are the equitable owners of the farm. The plaintiffs commenced this action asking the court to impose a constructive trust in their favor and seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the respective rights of the parties to the farm. The defendant Frank Koba filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the act rendered the plaintiffs\u2019 claimed equitable interests void and that, because their action was wholly premised on the enforceability and validity of those alleged interests, the defendant was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court erred in determining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the application of the act resolved the legal and factual issues in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the act applies and that it renders void any equitable claim to a constructive trust in the farm as alleged by the plaintiffs and negates the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for a declaratory judgment. We, therefore, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The following facts are undisputed. Louis died intestate on December 13, 1962. His heirs were his nine children, all of whom signed an agreement dated October 21,1963 (agreement), giving their respective shares in the farm to Valentine. The agreement provided further that should Valentine wish to sell the property, the remaining children and their survivors retained a right of first refusal. The remaining children also retained the right to recoup any windfall obtained by Valentine should he sell the farm for an amount greater than the appraised value of the farm at the time of the conveyance, which was $10,000.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The agreement was accepted by the Middletown Probate Court and the farm was distributed to Valentine pursuant to the probate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Louis\u2019 estate in November, 1963. All of Louis\u2019 children, the parties to the agreement, are now deceased. Valentine executed a will in October, 2002, and died in August, 2008, leaving the farm to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The plaintifFs allege in their complaint that the interest conveyed to Valentine pursuant to the agreement was only a life estate, not a fee interest, and that the conveyance of the farm to the defendant harmed them. In count one, they allege that they are the equitable owners of the farm and that the court should impose a constructive trust for their benefit. In count two, they seek a declaratory judgment concerning the respective rights of the parties to the farm. Appended to the complaint was a copy of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The defendant filed an answer and alleged ten special defenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the ninth special defense, the defendant alleges: \u201cOn or about November 19, 1963, a certificate from the Middletown Probate Court was filed in the Middletown land records confirming that all of the heirs of [Louis], deceased, had executed a division of the estate of [Louis], and that the property described in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was set over therein to [Valentine]. This certificate constitutes a root of title pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 47-33b. There thus exists an unbroken chain of title in the land described in [the] plaintifFs\u2019 complaint for [forty] years or more, as required by [General Statutes] \u00a7 47-33c.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Any interest claimed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>plaintiffs is void pursuant to the authority of [General Statutes] \u00a7 47-33e.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On March 29, 2010, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on the ground that judgment should enter as a matter of law on his ninth special defense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He argued that \u201c[Valentine] held marketable record title in the farm for more than forty years, and his fee interest is therefore unencumbered by the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged reversionary interest, which was never documented in his chain of title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In support of his motion, the defendant filed his own affidavit and the affidavit of his attorney, to which was attached a number of exhibits. The plaintiffs filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and filed affidavits by four of the plaintiffs. They argued that issues of material fact exist concerning the agreement. They also argued that the act does not apply because they did not seek to \u201cundo the deed\u201d which transferred the property to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Valentine in 1963; rather, they sought to \u201cuphold the part of the understanding and agreement . . . that [Valentine\u2019s] interest was only to be a life use interest, and that after [his] death, the property would be shared by all the family.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In its memorandum of decision, the court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and rendered judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In order to determine whether the court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment we must discuss the application of the act, whether a finding of a constructive trust could override the act in this case and the principles that govern an entitlement to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">We set forth our standard of review. \u201cPractice Book [\u00a7 17-49] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ... As the burden of proof is on the movant, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opponent. . . . When documents submitted in support of a motion for summary judgment fail to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party has no obligation to submit documents establishing the existence of such an issue. . . . Once the moving party has met its burden, however, the opposing party must present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue. ... It is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. Mere assertions of fact . . . are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court under Practice Book \u00a7 [17-45]. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant [a] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bonington </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>297 Conn. 297, 305, 999 A.2d 700 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that summary judgment should not have been rendered because (1) a triable factual dispute exists concerning the agreement and (2) the application of the act does not resolve the legal and factual issues in this case. We reject both of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The plaintiffs first claim that a triable factual dispute exists concerning the agreement. The issue on appeal is whether the trial court properly concluded that no genuine issues of <em>material </em>fact exist. Although there may be facts in dispute as to whether a parol understanding existed among Louis\u2019 children when they executed the agreement, such facts are not material to whether Valentine held marketable record title in fee at the time of his death. We conclude that there are no material facts in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The following additional facts are relevant to the resolution of this claim. The defendant submitted evidence in support of his motion for summary judgment, including true and accurate copies of certain documents from the probate proceedings pertaining to Louis\u2019 estate. These included a document that the Probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Court referred to as the mutual distribution, an allowance of account, ascertainment of heirs and order of distribution, and the probate certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In the agreement, executed October 21, 1963, Louis\u2019 children agreed to give their respective shares in the farm to Valentine, reserving certain limited rights previously enumerated. The mutual distribution, also executed on October 21, 1963, and accepted as part of the Probate Court file, stated in relevant part that Valentine \u201cshall take and have\u201d the farm in addition to his equal share of the cash distributed from the estate. The remaining siblings took their cash share only.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The allowance of account, ascertainment of heirs and order of distribution similarly provides in relevant part: \u201cOrdered . . . that a probate certificate, showing the title of the said [Valentine] to the real property of [Louis] be issued from this [c]ourt to the [l]and [r]ecords of the said [t]own of Middletown . . . .\u201d Finally, the probate certificate, executed by the court on November 6,1963, provides in relevant part: \u201cThat in said [division, styled also a [m]utual [distribution, the real estate of which said deceased died, seized and possessed, the same remaining intact upon the settlement, has been set forth to [Valentine], son of [Louis], such real estate being declared in such division . . . .\u201d The probate certificate was recorded in the Middletown land records on November 19, 1963.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AsA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>We must ascertain in this case what is meant by \u201cmarketable record title\u201d and what are the purposes of the act. \u201c \u2018Marketable record title\u2019 means a title of record which operates to extinguish such interests and claims, existing prior to the effective date of the root of title . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-33b (a). \u201c[T]he ultimate purpose of [the act] is to simplify land title transactions through making it possible to determine marketability by limited title searches over some reasonable period of the immediate past and thus avoid the necessity of examining the record back into distant time for each new transaction. . . . [The act is] designed to decrease the costs of title assurance by limiting the period of time that must be covered by a title search. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u201cPursuant to the act, any person who has an unbroken record chain of title to an interest in land for a period of forty years, plus any additional period of time necessary to trace the title back to the latest connecting title instrument of earlier record<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (which is the root of title<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>under the act) has a marketable record title subject only to those pre-root of title matters that are excepted under the statute or are caused to reappear in the latest forty year record chain of title. . . . The act declares null and void<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> any interest in real property not specifically described in the deed to the property which it purports to affect, unless within a forty year period, a notice specifically reciting the claimed interest is placed on the land records in the affected land\u2019s chain of title.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Sourignamath, </em>90 Conn. App. 388, 394-95, 877 A.2d 891 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The plaintiffs do not dispute that the language in the relevant written documents, including the agreement and the mutual distribution, was sufficient to convey to Valentine a fee interest in the farm. Rather, the plaintiffs claim that a parol agreement existed among Louis\u2019 children that Valentine received only a life estate. The probate certificate, recorded in the land records on November 19, 1963, was necessary to perfect Valentine\u2019s marketable title; <em>Santa Fuel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Varga, </em>77 Conn. App. 474, 487, 823 A.2d 1249, cert. denied, 265 Conn. 907, 831 A.2d 251 (2003); and we treat November 19, 1963, as the effective date of Valentine\u2019s root of title. See footnote 14 of this opinion. The defendant presented uncontroverted evidence that no instrument making any claim against the farm had been recorded in the Middletown land records subsequent to that date, nor had any instrument been recorded that purported to divest Valentine of his fee interest in the farm.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the defendant presented uncontroverted evidence that Valentine had an unbroken record chain of title to his fee interest in the farm for a period of over forty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">On the basis of our review of this evidence, we conclude, as did the trial court, that the defendant carried his burden of demonstrating that no material facts are in dispute concerning whether Valentine had marketable record title in fee when he devised the property to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The plaintiffs claim that the application of the act does not resolve the legal and factual issues in this case. They argue that because they have alleged the existence of a constructive trust, they should be permitted to present evidence to prove that there was an understanding among Louis\u2019 children that, despite the plain language of the documents, Valentine had only a life use of the farm and that, after Valentine\u2019s death, the farm was to be shared by the entire family. The plaintiffs maintain that the imposition of a constructive trust would not violate the act.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">\u201cA constructive trust arises contrary to intention and in invitum, against one who, by fraud, actual or constructive, by duress or abuse of confidence, by commission of wrong, or by any form of unconscionable conduct, artifice, concealment, or questionable means, or who in any way against equity and good conscience, either has obtained or holds the legal right to property which he ought not, in equity and good conscience, hold and enjoy. ... A constructive trust arises . . . when a person who holds title to property is subject to an equitable duty to convey it to another on the ground that he would be unjustly enriched if he were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>permitted to retain it. . . . The issue raised by a claim for a constructive trust is, in essence, whether a party has committed actual or constructive fraud or whether he or she has been unjustly enriched.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stornawaye Properties, Inc. </em>v. O\u2019Brien, 94 Conn. App. 170, 175-76, 891 A.2d 123 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">By the very nature of the claim, evidence to support a claim for a constructive trust of real property often will be at odds with what is recorded in the land records, and often will involve evidence of parol agreements. \u201cAlthough it is well settled that, in general, real property absolutely conveyed cannot be shown to be subject to an express trust created by parol agreement . . . exceptions to this rule have been recognized where an injustice, sufficient to raise an equitable trust, would otherwise result. ... In such cases, a trust does not arise so much by reason of the parol agreement of the parties but by operation of law.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cohen v. Cohen, </em>182 Conn. 193, 202, 438 A.2d 55 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Our appellate courts have upheld the imposition of a constructive trust on a defendant\u2019s interest in real property when, although the written documentation indicated that a defendant held an interest in real property, the facts and circumstances adduced by the evidence presented demonstrated that the defendant was under an equitable duty to relinquish that interest. See id., 197-98 (constructive trust imposed on son\u2019s half interest in property because mother purchased property and paid all expenses and son previously had agreed to reconvey his interest to mother); <em>Schmaling </em>v. <em>Schmaling, </em>48 Conn. App. 1, 4, 17-19, 707 A.2d 339 (constructive trust imposed on son\u2019s interest in parent\u2019s property when interest was conveyed only to secure construction financing), cert. denied, 244 Conn. 929, 711 A.2d 727 (1998); <em>Gulack </em>v. <em>Gulack, </em>30 Conn. App. 305, 313-14, 620 A.2d 181 (1993) (constructive trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>imposed on property in favor of intended beneficiaries when property held by defendant widow, who took title on death of her husband, and husband had held title for beneficiaries\u2019 benefit). In none of those cases did the party claiming ownership raise the act as a special defense; in addition, in each case the interest in the property was challenged long before the expiration of the forty year period prescribed by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The act declares null and void \u201call interests, claims or charges whatsoever, the existence of which depends upon any act, transaction, event or omission that occurred prior to the effective date of the root of title. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-33e. This is true \u201chowever [such claims are] denominated, whether legal or equitable, present or future . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-33e.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">In the present case, we already have concluded that Valentine had an unbroken record chain of title to the farm and that the effective date of Valentine\u2019s root of title is November 19, 1963.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The plaintiffs commenced this suit in 2009, forty-six years after the effective date of Valentine\u2019s root of title. In their complaint, the plaintiffs refer to the alleged parol understanding among Louis\u2019 children as the \u201ccomplete agreement\u201d among them and allege that the \u201ccomplete [October 21,1963] agreement was not revoked, amended or modified by [Louis\u2019 children] on or before November 5,1963, or any date thereafter.\u201d By their pleadings, it is clear that any parol understanding or agreement among Louis\u2019 children concerning whether Valentine received only a life use of the farm <em>arose prior to </em>the effective date of Valentine\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>root of title. Applying the plain language of the act to these facts, the plaintiffs\u2019 equitable claim is null and void. To hold otherwise would undermine the purposes of the act. Because the plaintiffs\u2019 action seeking a constructive trust and declaratory judgment was wholly premised on the enforceability and validity of this equitable claim, the trial court properly concluded that the defendant was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47-33b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) \u2018Marketable record title\u2019 means a title of record which operates to extinguish such interests and claims, existing prior to the effective date of the root of title, as are stated in section 47-33e . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-12\"> Louis owned a parcel of land referred to as Specyalski farm (farm), located at 323 Boston Road in Middletown.

On that page to which each signer affixed his or her signature is the following significant statement: \u201cTo Have and to Hold, to each of the parties hereto, and his or her heirs and assigns forever, the property, real and personal, hereinbefore assigned to said parties respectively, so that neither of us, nor any one claiming under either of us shall hereafter have any claim, right or title, in or to the premises or property or any part hereof hereinbefore assigned to the others, but each of us is from the premises so assigned to the others, forever barred and secluded.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\"> \u201cIt is fundamental jurisprudence that title to real estate vests immediately at death in a deceased\u2019s heirs, or in devisees upon the admission of the will to probate. . . . The recording of a probate certificate of devise or descent is necessary only to perfect marketable title. That certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>furnishes evidence that the heir\u2019s or devisee\u2019s title is no longer in danger of being cut off by a probate sale to pay debts of the estate and also because it furnishes a record of who received the title.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Santa Fuel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Varga, </em>77 Conn. App. 474, 487, 823 A.2d 1249, cert. denied, 265 Conn. 907, 831 A.2d 251 (2003). \u201cSuch a probate certificate is not a muniment of title, however, but merely a guide or pointer for clarification of the record.\u201d <em>Cardillo </em>v. <em>Cardillo, </em>27 Conn. App. 208, 212, 605 A.2d 576 (1992). The act provides that \u201c[t]he effective date of the root of title is the date on which it is recorded . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-33b (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">In the present case, the probate certificate stated that Louis\u2019 heirs \u201cset forth\u201d the farm to Valentine through the mutual distribution, which was \u201cin writing, by them made, executed and acknowledged like deeds of land, which [division . . . becomes a valid distribution of [Louis\u2019] estate.\u201d Although the probate certificate itself is not a muniment of title, it guides the searcher to the probate record through which Valentine received title. We consider the date that the probate certificate was recorded, which is November 19, 1963, to be the effective date of Valentine\u2019s root of title.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b134-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47-33c.

It is immaterial to the analysis under these facts whether November 6,1963, or November 19,1963, is the effective date of Valentine\u2019s root of title because it is clear from the pleadings that the alleged parol understanding or \u201ccomplete agreement\u201d arose <em>prior to </em>the probate proceedings that vested title to the property in Valentine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
