J.</author>\n<p id=\"APg\">The plaintiff, Denis Dallaire, as administrator of the estate of the decedent, Sandra Dallaire, brought this medical malpractice action, alleging that the defendant, Ven C. Hsu, negligently prescribed lethal amounts of opiate medications, resulting in her death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant. On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the court improperly (1) found that the decedent had a significant tolerance to morphine and methadone, and that the standard of care did not require the defendant to consult with the plaintiffs prior health care providers or to obtain her pharmacy records to determine her level of tolerance, (2) found that the plaintiff failed to prove causation and (3) disregarded the opinion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>plaintiffs expert on causation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The court found the following facts. The decedent suffered from Madelung\u2019s disease, a congenital skeletal deformity resulting in years of chronic pain, multiple fractures and surgeries. For at least six years prior to seeing the defendant, the decedent was prescribed a variety of narcotic medications to alleviate her chronic pain. Between 2003 and June 27, 2005, the decedent was treated by Karen Warner, a physician at the Comprehensive Pain &amp; Headache Treatment Centers, LLC (treatment center). Subsequent to the decedent\u2019s discharge from the treatment center, the decedent received prescriptions for opiate medications from a number of unaffiliated physicians. Then, on July 20, 2005, the decedent saw David S. Kloth, a physician at Connecticut Pain Care, P.C. According to Kloth\u2019s records, the decedent informed him that the final prescriptions issued to her on discharge from the treatment center included \u201cOxyContin 80 mg qid, [m]ethadone 80 mg qid, Duragesic 200 meg q 72 hrs, Valium 10 mg qid and Soma qid.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Kloth reduced the decedent\u2019s prescriptions solely to methadone 10 mg q.i.d. On October 13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>2005, Kloth issued the decedent a final prescription for methadone, 10 mg q.i.d. for twenty-eight days.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">On October 27,2005, the decedent saw the defendant, who specializes in pain management. The decedent provided the defendant with the pharmacy records from Warner but not those of Kloth, \u201ceven though she had, that very day, obtained her complete prescription records, including Kloth\u2019s, from Walgreens Pharmacy.\u201d The defendant believed that the decedent was out of medication and that if she did not receive any, she might engage in drug seeking behaviors. The defendant considered this to be an \u201cemergency and urgent.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant prescribed \u201c[m]ethadone, 40 mg 4 pills/day, MS Contin 60 mg 2/day, Xanax 1 mg 3/day.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At approximately 1 a.m., on October 28, 2005, the plaintiff found the decedent nonresponsive, and emergency responders were unable to revive her. The medical examiner listed the cause of the decedent\u2019s death as opiate toxicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Thereafter, the plaintiff commenced this action. The defendant filed a special defense, alleging that the decedent was contributorily negligent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following a trial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the court, it issued a memorandum of decision in favor of the defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">We begin by setting forth the legal principles that guide our analysis. The trial court\u2019s findings of fact are binding on this court \u201cunless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hospital, </em>251 Conn. 790, 828, 742 A.2d 322 (1999). \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schiavone </em>v. <em>Bank of America, N.A., </em>102 Conn. App. 301, 304, 925 A.2d 438 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Conflicting expert testimony \u201cdoes not necessarily equate to insufficient evidence.\u201d <em>Carusillo </em>v. <em>Associated Women\u2019s Health Specialists, P.C., </em>79 Conn. App. 649, 656, 831 A.2d 255 (2003). Where such testimony does conflict, \u201cthe trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony. . . . The credibility and the weight of expert testimony is judged by the same standard, and the trial court is privileged to adopt whatever testimony [it] reasonably believes to be credible. . . . On appeal, we do not retry the facts or pass on the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bay Hill Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>75 Conn. App. 832, 838, 818 A.2d 83 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Finally, to recover in a medical malpractice action, the plaintiff must prove \u201c(1) the requisite standard of care for treatment, (2) a deviation from that standard of care, and (3) a causal connection between the deviation and the claimed injury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>omitted). <em>Goldv. Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>262 Conn. 248, 254-55, 811 A.2d 1266 (2002). Guided by these principles, we address the plaintiffs claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the defendant deviated from the standard of care required by reasonably prudent physicians in the defendant\u2019s position. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-184c (a). Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the court\u2019s finding that the decedent was opiate tolerant was clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Physicians are required to exercise \u201cthe degree of skill, care, and diligence that is customarily demonstrated by physicians in the same line of practice.\u201d <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Tardif, </em>240 Conn. 610, 614, 692 A.2d 1266 (1997). To prove that a physician has breached the standard of care, the plaintiff must produce \u201csome evidence that the conduct of the physician was negligent.\u201d Id. The plaintiff, generally, must present the testimony of expert witnesses to establish the applicable standard of care and the defendant\u2019s failure to conform to this standard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Kunst </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>42 Conn. App. 528, 536, 680 A.2d 339 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">An issue at trial was whether the decedent was opiate tolerant or opiate naive. The court found that the defendant \u201cwould not have prescribed the same dosages to an opiate naive person, because they could be lethal.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The experts first differed with respect to the definitions of the terms \u201copiate naive\u201d and \u201copiate tolerant.\u201d The defendant\u2019s expert, Matthew Kline, a physician, board certified in pain management and anesthesiology, defined an opiate naive patient as someone \u201cwho has never been on a narcotic.\u201d The plaintiffs expert, George Adam, a physician, board certified in psychiatry and neurology, defined an opiate naive patient as \u201csomeone who has not taken opiates, or has taken very low doses,\u201d and an opiate tolerant patient as \u201csomeone whose metabolism has learned to efficiently accommodate and detoxify the body from narcotics.\u201d The plaintiff also offered the testimony of Daniel E. Buffington, a clinical pharmacologist, who defined an opiate naive patient as \u201csomeone who is not acclimated to that product,\u201d and an opiate tolerant patient as one who has had \u201cchronic regular exposure\u201d to the drug. The court adopted Kline\u2019s definition of opiate naive and declined to give weight to the opinions of the plaintiffs experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The experts also differed in applying these terms to the present case. Kline concluded that the decedent had \u201csignificant opiate tolerance\u201d at the time she visited the defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court agreed, finding that the decedent had a long history of taking opiate medications as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>a result of her chronic condition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Adam concluded that the decedent was \u201con the naive side.\u201d Buffington concluded that, because Kloth prescribed lower dosages of methadone than Warner, the decedent was \u201copiate tolerant to methadone\u2014but at a much lower level\u201d than before seeing Kloth. Buffington concluded further that the decedent was opiate naive to morphine. Adam and Buffington both opined that, because the decedent was opiate naive, the standard of care required the defendant to begin treatment with starting doses of methadone and morphine.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The court found that, with respect to the opinions of the plaintiffs experts, their \u201cpremise is faulty\u201d because the decedent was not opiate naive. With respect to Adam, the court found that his experience in practicing pain management was merely incidental to his neurology specialty, and, as such, the court did not give Adam\u2019s opinion weight. With respect to Buffing-ton, the court found that Buffington\u2019s opinion that the decedent was opiate naive to morphine was \u201cnot tenable\u201d in light of the decedent\u2019s medical history and that this conclusion \u201cundermines his credibility.\u201d On the basis of the evidence presented to the court, we conclude that the court was justified in declining to give weight to Adam\u2019s and Buffington\u2019s opinions. See <em>Bay Hill Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 75 Conn. App. 838. Thus, the court\u2019s finding that the decedent was opiate tolerant was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Second, the plaintiff contends that the defendant breached the standard of care by failing to consult with the decedent\u2019s prior health care providers and failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>to obtain her prior pharmacy records to determine her level of tolerance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The court found that the defendant was entitled to assess the decedent\u2019s condition independently, on the basis of Kline\u2019s testimony that \u201c[p]atient history and the forthright nature of a patient is a critical part . . . of treatment.\u201d See <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>90 Conn. App. 804, 812-15, 879 A.2d 516 (2005) (plastic surgeon was not liable for malpractice where jury found that standard of care did not require consultation with patient\u2019s internist or cardiologist before instructing patient to stop taking anticoagulants, which were prescribed by those physicians). The court found that the standard of care, as defined by the plaintiffs experts, reflects a \u201cnarrow textbook approach to the practice of pain management and ignores the role of the patient-physician interaction.\u201d The defendant spoke with the patient, took a detailed history and, on the basis of all the circumstances, prescribed medications accordingly.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-12\"> The defendant is not a board certified physician but has a valid medical license in Connecticut and has practiced as a pain specialist since 1989. The defendant, by holding himself out as a pain specialist, is held to the standard of care of board certified physicians who also practice pain management. See <em>Grondin </em>v. <em>Curi, </em>262 Conn. 637, 650-51, 817 A.2d 61 (2003) (standard of care for specialist); see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-184c (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\"> Because we affirm the court\u2019s finding that the defendant did not breach the standard of care, we need not address the issue of causation. See <em>Kalams </em>v. <em>Giacchetto, </em>268 Conn. 244, 250, 842 A.2d 1100 (2004) (\u201c[t]he jury was not required to reach the issue of causation because ... it first determined that the defendant had not breached the standard of care\u201d). We, therefore, also need not reach the issue of whether the court properly disregarded the opinion on causation given by George Adam, the plaintiffs expert. We note that the court, acting in its role as the trier of fact, found that the plaintiffs expert, Daniel E. Buffington, did not adequately opine that the dosages, if taken as prescribed by the defendant, caused the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\"> \u201cQ.i.d.\u201d is a medical abbreviation for quater in die, or four times a day. See Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary (28th Ed. 2006) p. 1615 (noting that \u201cq\u201d is a medical abbreviation for quodque, or \u201cevery\u201d). Id. Thus, the decedent\u2019s prescription of \u201cDuragesic 200 meg q 72 [hours]\u201d indicates that the decedent was prescribed 200 micrograms of the drug every 72 hours. See id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\"> The plaintiffs expert opined that the decedent\u2019s severe pain did not obviate the defendant\u2019s breach of the standard of care. The defendant\u2019s expert opined that the decedent presented \u201cwith what appeared to be a crisis; that [the defendant] calculated what he believed was an appropriate dose of medication to help treat [the decedent\u2019s] severe pain . . . .\u201d The court agreed with the opinion of the defendant\u2019s expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b626-10\"> MS Contin is a brand of controlled release morphine.

However, our statutes retain the term \u201ccontributory negligence.\u201d See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-114 and 52-572h (b). <em>Utica Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Precision </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>Mechanical Services, Inc., </em>122 Conn.

The plaintiff does not argue that the defendant was grossly negligent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b628-11\"> On cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s expert and the plaintiffs counsel engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-12\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Okay. The dosage that [the defendant] prescribed here, 40 milligrams, six tablets, 240 per day, is that a potentially lethal dosage of methadone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-13\">\u201c[Matthew Kline]: If a narcotic naive patient\u2014as you\u2019re saying, someone that was on no narcotics at all\u2014took a dose of 240 milligrams of methadone, it is most certainly potentially lethal.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\"> At oral argument before this court, the plaintiff argued that the decedent took her medications as prescribed, and that under General Statutes \u00a7 52-114, the decedent is entitled to a presumption that she acted reasonably. Section 52-114 provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]n any action to recover damages for negligently causing the death of a person ... it shall be presumed that such person whose death was caused or who was injured or who suffered property damage was, at the time of the commission of the alleged negligent act or acts, in the exercise of reasonable care. If contributory negligence is relied upon as a defense, it shall be affirmatively pleaded by the defendant or defendants, and the burden of proving such contributory negligence shall rest upon the defendant or defendants.\u201d We affirm the court\u2019s finding that the defendant did not breach the standard of care and, therefore, we need not reach the issue of the decedent\u2019s negligence or the presumption of due care in \u00a7 52-114.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\"> Kline opined at trial that the defendant was presented with an \u201cextremely complicated case, in which a patient who had many, many years of chronic pain, well documented severe pain, had been on . . . very, very large doses of multiple narcotics.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b631-13\"> Buffington opined that the defendant, on the basis of the \u201cseverity and the potential complications from the dosing levels that he was prescribing . . . had the duty to discern the accuracy of that patient history, as a peer-to-peer or vendor-to-vendor, if it\u2019s confirming with the pharmacy as well.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b631-14\"> Kline opined that pain management physicians rely on their experience and intuition \u201cbecause medicine is certainly not an exact science. . . .
