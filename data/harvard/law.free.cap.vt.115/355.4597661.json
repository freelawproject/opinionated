It is an action in contract, brought in Brattleboro Municipal Court to recover the unpaid balance of a conditional sale note for the purchase price of an automobile and for certain accessories set forth in plaintiff\u2019s specification. It being a collection suit to which no affidavit of defense was filed the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claim was conceded. The defendant filed an answer and a plea in set-off containing this statement: \u201cThe plaintiff is indebted to the defendant in the sum of one hundred dollars for gas and oil furnished by the defendant to the plaintiff, and at the plaintiff\u2019s request\u201d. It was said in our previous opinion that no specification of defendant\u2019s claim was filed as required by Municipal Court Rule No. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-18\">At the original hearing below, plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment was granted and judgment was rendered for the full amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s claim. The defendant excepted to the entry of such judgment on the grounds that he was entitled to a hearing on the merits of his claim in set-off, and that the amount due him from the plaintiff should have been deducted from the plaintiff\u2019s claim and a judgment rendered in plaintiff\u2019s favor for the balance only.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We held that the defendant was not entitled to a hearing on his claim in set-off without compliance with municipal court rule number 7 which says: \u201cspecifications in actions of contract and in pleas or declarations in set-off shall, be filed at the time of filing the declaration or plea. The court may impose terms for failure to comply with this rule\u201d. We further said that the defendant\u2019s exception was without merit and that ordinary procedure would require an affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">But in view of the fact that the case had been pending n the lower court for about three years before judgment was rendered and there was nothing in the record or files to show what disposition, if any, had been made of the defendant\u2019s plea in set-off, and also in view of the provision of rule 7 which, in effect, permitted a defendant to file a specification of a claim in set-off out of time upon such terms as the court should find just, we said that it might well be that justice required a disposition of the defendant\u2019s claim in this case and if the same is found to have merit it should be set off against the claim of the plaintiff. The judgment was therefore reversed pro forma and the cause remanded for further proceedings, including some disposition of the defendant\u2019s plea in set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The defendant contends that this Court intended to and did direct, unconditionally, that a hearing be had on the merits of his claim, and if found to have merit that the amount thereof should be set off against the plaintiff\u2019s claim. But read in connection with the whole of the last two paragraphs of the opinion our statement cannot be so interpreted. When so read it is apparent that a hearing on the merits was directed only in the event that no final disposition of the defendant\u2019s claim in set-off should have been made and that a specification had been or should be filed out of time in compliance with the terms imposed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">After remand the matter came on for hearing in the municipal court before Acting Judge Daley on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for dismissal of the defendant\u2019s claim for failure to file a specification in compliance with the rule, and for judgment in favor of the plaintiff. It appears from findings of the court which are not challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>that at the hearing counsel for the defendant stated, in reply to the court\u2019s question, that he had no motions either oral or written to be filed, and that he had no specification to be filed in support of his claim in set-off, claiming that his specification was included in \u201cDefendant\u2019s Answer and Counter Claim\u201d in paragraph three thereof, which is the statement we have quoted herein. Defendant then moved for a jury trial which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In our previous opinion we had quoted this statement of defendant\u2019s claim which he now urges was a specification, and immediately thereafter had said that the defendant filed no specification as required by municipal court rule number 7, thereby indicating that the statement was not such specification. We adhere to that ruling. Specification is defined by Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary as a \u201cwritten statement containing a minute description or enumeration of particulars.\u201d It is a definite or formal mention of particulars. 58 CJ 828. The defendant\u2019s statement gives no details or particulars of dates, places, amounts or prices of gas or oil alleged to have been furnished. It does not meet the requirements of the rule or of good pleading. The defendant\u2019s statement made before Judge Daley was, therefore, a judicial admission that he had not, at any time, filed a specification as required by rule seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The testimony of Judge Shea, who presided at the previous trial, was then taken, findings of fact were filed, the defendant\u2019s claim in set-off was dismissed and judgment was entered for the plaintiff for the amount shown by its specification with interest and costs, as appears from the docket entries, to which we may refer. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Vermont Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>92 Vt 272, 273, 102 A 1042; <em>Spaulding </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>57 Vt 654, 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Exceptions taken to certain findings and to the judgment would not avail the defendant even if they were more adequately briefed. The exceptions to the findings that no part of the defendant\u2019s answer and counter claim constitutes a specification, and to the finding that the defendant has failed to file a specification with his counter claim as required by the rule are covered by the defendant\u2019s admission and what we have already said. It is not necessary to consider the finding as to what Judge Shea did or failed to do at the previous trial, nor the exception to that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">There was no issue before the court upon which a jury trial was demandable. The judgment was merely a re-entry, with addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>tional interest and costs, of the previous judgment which had been reversed pro forma only. In view of what we have said the entry of such judgment and the dismissal of the plea in set-off were required by the defendant\u2019s judicial admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
