Pietruszka, J.), rendered March 24, 2003. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of murder in the second degree and hindering prosecution in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from be and the same hereby is unanimously affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him, upon a jury verdict, of murder in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1]) and hindering prosecution in the first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>(\u00a7 205.65). Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, County Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting certain photographs of the victim\u2019s charred body in evidence. The two photographs at issue were direct evidence in support of the charge of hindering prosecution (see \u00a7 205.50 [4]). In addition, one of the photographs was used to illustrate and corroborate the testimony of the Assistant Chief Medical Examiner, particularly his testimony concerning pulmonary edema as a result of drowning, and the other was used to illustrate that certain brands of canned corn and ham found near the body in a parking lot were also found at the residence where the murder took place. \u201cPhotographic evidence should be excluded only if its sole purpose is to arouse the emotions of the jury and to prejudice the defendant,\u201d and thus we conclude that the photographs were properly admitted in evidence <em>(People v Pobliner, </em>32 NY2d 356, 370 [1973], <em>rearg denied </em>33 NY2d 657 [1973], <em>cert denied </em>416 US 905 [1974]; see <em>People v Wood, </em>79 NY2d 958, 960 [1992]; <em>see also People v Stevens, </em>76 NY2d 833, 835 [1990]). Contrary to the further contention of defendant, the court properly denied his motion to suppress his statements to the police. \u201cWhere, as here, the People have initially demonstrated the legality of the police conduct . . . , the burden of persuasion on the motion to suppress rests with defendant,\u201d and defendant failed to meet that burden herein <em>(People v Shields, </em>125 AD2d 863, 864 [1986], <em>lv denied </em>69 NY2d 955 [1987]; <em>see People v Di Stefano, </em>38 NY2d 640, 652 [1976]; <em>People v Drumm, </em>15 AD3d 910 [2005]).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\">Defendant failed to preserve for our review his contention that the court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt was erroneous because it implied that jurors must find an articulable reason to support any doubt <em>(see </em>CPL 470.05 [2]; <em>see also People v Martinez, </em>294 AD2d 933, 934 [2002], <em>lv denied </em>98 NY2d 678 [2002]). In any event, that contention is without merit <em>(see People v Antommarchi, </em>80 NY2d 247, 252 [1992], <em>rearg denied </em>81 NY2d 759 [1992]; <em>People v Bowles, </em>265 AD2d 336 [1999]; <em>People v Serrano, </em>170 AD2d 269 [1991], <em>lv denied </em>77 NY2d 1000 [1991]; <em>see also </em>CJI2d [NY] Presumption of Innocence, Burden of Proof, Reasonable Doubt), and thus we reject the further contention of defendant that he did not receive meaningful representation based on defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to that instruction <em>(see generally People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Also contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the evidence is legally sufficient to support the conviction <em>(see generally People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]). Even assuming, arguendo, that defendant is correct that two prosecution witnesses were accomplices, we nevertheless conclude that their testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>sufficiently corroborated by the evidence that defendant was wearing the victim\u2019s leather jacket after the murder, and that the victim\u2019s blood was on that jacket and on other items of clothing worn by defendant (see CPL 60.22 [1]; <em>People v Barnes, </em>99 AD2d 877, 878 [1984]; see <em>generally People v Breland, </em>83 NY2d 286, 293 [1994]; <em>People v Steinberg, </em>79 NY2d 673, 683 [1992]; <em>People v Hudson, </em>51 NY2d 233, 237-239 [1980]). The issue concerning the credibility of those witnesses was for the jury (see <em>Steinberg, </em>79 NY2d at 683), and we see no reason to disturb the jury\u2019s determination of that issue. Finally, the sentence is not unduly harsh or severe. Present\u2014Hurlbutt, J.P., Scudder, Kehoe, Gorski and Pine, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
