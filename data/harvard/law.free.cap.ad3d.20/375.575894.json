This evidence was sufficient to establish the plaintiffs prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of liability <em>(see </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1142 [a]; <em>Nolan v Mizrahi, </em>12 AD3d 430 [2004]; <em>Morgan v Hachmann, 9 </em>AD3d 400 [2004]; <em>Spatola v Gelco Corp., </em>5 AD3d 469 [2004]; <em>Yusupov v Lugo, </em>305 AD2d 496 [2003]; <em>Gillinder v Hemmes, </em>298 AD2d 493 [2002]). The defendants failed to submit an affidavit from a person with personal knowledge of the facts either denying the plaintiff\u2019s allegations or offering a non-negligent explanation for the collision <em>(see Wilke v Price, </em>221 AD2d 846 [1995]; <em>Salenius v Lisbon, </em>217 AD2d 692 [1995]). Furthermore, the defendants\u2019 mere hope that evidence sufficient to defeat the motion may be uncovered during the discovery process was also insufficient to defeat the motion <em>(see Neryaev v Solon, </em>6 AD3d 510 [2004]; <em>Spatola v Gelco Corp., supra; Frouws v Campbell Foundry Co., </em>275 AD2d 761 [2000]). Accordingly, the Supreme Court erred in denying the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability. H. Miller, J.P., S.
