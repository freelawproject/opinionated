Read, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-3\">Tliis is an action brought on a judgment obtained by the plaintiff against the defendant in June, 1S27, in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Delaware. The defendant pleads \u201cnil debet,\u201d to which plea the plaintiff demurs, and the defendant joins in the demurrer. The question is whether nil debet is a good plea to an action of debt upon the judgment rendered as above. An action of debt lies on a judgment within or after a year subsequent to the recovery. 1 Chit PI. (Ed. 1809) 103. Action of debt lies on records, or on judgments. &amp;c. Where the record is the ground of the action, and not merely inducement, nil debet is no iilea. 2 Ld. Iiaym. 1501-1503; Wheatley v. Lane, 1 Saund. 21S, note 4; 1 Chit. 480. There can be no averment of record or its validity. This is the ease of a judgment in the circuit court of the United States, and an action of debt on it in another. Const. U. S. art. 4, \u00a7 1; Acts Cong. May 20, 1790 [1 Stat. 122], and March 27, 1804 [2 Stat. 298]. The courts of the United States regard a judgment in another circuit as one county in Pennsylvania would regard a judgment in another. Armstrong v. Carson\u2019s Ex\u2019rs [Case No. 543]; Green v. Sarmiento [Id. 5.700]; Field v. Gibbs [Id. 4.700]; Mills v. Duryee, 7 Cranch [11 U. 5.] 480: Johnson v. Dessont [Id. 4S0]; Hampton v. M\u2019Connell, 3 Wheat. [10 U. S.] 234; Montford v. Hunt [Case No. 9,725]; Bryant v. Hunter [Id. 2,0GS]; Biddle v. Wilkins, 1 Pet. [20 17. S..1 G80, 092; Mayhew v. Thatcher, 0 Wheat. [19 U. S.] 129. On a general demurer nil debet is a bad plea, however it might be if issue had been taken upon it. Judgments in sister states are not to be taken as foreign judgments. Benton v. Burgot, 10 Serg. &amp; It. 240; Evans v. Tatem, 9 Serg. &amp; R. 252, 259. In New Pork they have come to the same conclusion. In Massachusetts, unsettled. Act March 3, 1797, \u00a7 0; 1 Story\u2019s Laws, 405 [1 Stat. 513]. This is the case of an action of debt simply and directly on the judgment, not the case of a devastavit, or where the judgment is mere inducement. The cases cited were of judgments against the party in his lifetime, but the principle is the same if against an executor or administrator. The judgment should have the same effect here as in the district where it was rendered. This principle does not apply to liens on lands, or distribution of effects. 1 Saund. 330; Tidd, Prac. tit. \u201cForm of a Judgment against an Executor,\u201d ISO. This judgment is conclusive as to assets. People v. judges of Ct. of C. P. Erie Co., 4 Cow. 445. 447; Swearingen v. Pendleton. 4 Serg. &amp; R. 389; 1 Rolle, Abr. 003, pi. 2; 2 D\u2019Anv. Abr. 503; 1 Litt. 404; 2 Hayes, 301; 9 Serg. &amp; R. 259.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-6\">Mr. Ingraham, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-7\">No case has been cited where the judgment was against an executor or administrator. The act of congress relates to judgments in the \"state courts, not to the court of the United States. Montford v. Hunt [supra]. The party there took his chance. In Mayhew v. Thatcher, 0 Wheat. [19 U. S.] 129, the only question was, whether it was necessary to execute a writ of inquiry. Carpenter v. Thornton, 3 Bam. &amp; Aid. 52. If this suit had been brought in the circuit court of Delaware, would this plea have been good? Toll. Ex\u2019rs (Ingraham\u2019s Ed.) 455; 2 Ld. Raym. 1502; Burnet v. Andrews, 1 Saund. 219; 2 Tidd, Prac. (8th Ed.) 1113; 2 Rand. (Va.) 303.
