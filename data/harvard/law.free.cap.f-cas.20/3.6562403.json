Proctor &amp; Gamble claimed that they had introduced to the public, under a trade-mark of their own, a brand of soap under the term and designation of \u201cMottled German Soap,\u201d and they had adopted as a trade-mark upon their packages those words, with a circle with a moon and stars in the middle. The defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>McBride &amp; Co., who were manufacturers in this city, had put upon the market a brand of soap which was termed \u201cS. W. McBride\u2019s German Mottled Soap,\u201d and they had marked these words upon the outside of the packages, in combination with a crescent, within which was a single star instead of a number of stars. The defendants departed widely from the complainant\u2019s trade-mark. They changed the arrangement of the words, so instead of its being \u201cMottled German Soap\u201d it was \u201cGerman Mottled Soap,\u201d and instead of a circle containing several stars it was a crescent containing a single star, prefixed by the name of each maker; and it was argued in that case there could be no possibility of intelligent consumers being deceived. So strong was the case made before me on an application for an injunction that I refused the injunction; but after the proofs were taken, and the case brought to hearing before Judge Drummond, he sustained the infringement, and ordered a perpetual injunction against the defendants. It was also shown in that case that \u201cmottled German soap\u201d or \u201cmottled soap\u201d had been in common use in the trade for nearly fifty years, and that \u201cmottled soap\u201d was a commodity well known to the trade; but Judge Drummond sustained that trade-mark as the exclusive property of the complainant, and held that the defendants infringed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
