In taking depositions under the act of 1789 (1 Stat. 88), it must appear that the witness was sworn to testify the whole truth; also, that the deposition was written by the magistrate, or by the deponent in his presence; otherwise, it is not admissible.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b189-20\">2.

Form of certificate, and judicial decisions as to depositions in note.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-22\">Depositions taken on behalf of the defendant [John D. Haynes], under the 30th section of the judiciary act of 17S9, were objected to by the plaintiff [Thomas G. Rainer, use of Joseph H. Boyle], on the following grounds: (1) That the magistrate certified that the witnesses were by him first \u201ccarefully examined and cautioned and duly sworn to testify the truth in regard to the matters in controversy,\u201d whereas by the act of congress the oath or affirmation should have been to testify \u201cthe whole truth.\u201d 1 Stat. 89; Garrett v. Woodward [Case No. 5,233]; Burroughs v. Booth, 1 D. Chip. 106; Pentle-ton v. Forbes [Case No. 10,960]. (2) That the magistrate certified that the several depositions of the witnesses were reduced to writing by one of the witnesses, and not by himself. (3) That the magistrate failed to state that the depositions were reduced to writing in his presence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-24\">On the first objection it was argued, that the object in view by the act was to obtain the whole truth from a witness with regard to the matter in dispute, that to swear a witness to state the truth, was manifestly not equivalent to an oath to state, the whole truth, and that a witness might truly state the facts as far as he went keeping back material facts, and could well say on an indictment for perjury, that he had testified the truth; and that the oath he had taken did not oblige him to state the whole truth, and so he must be sworn to testify the whole truth, and that must appear in some form. It was admitted that where the form of the oath was not given: but it was certified, that the witness \u201cwas duly sworn, according to law,\u201d or \u201csworn in pursuance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>act of congress,\u201d that would be sufficient; because then it must be intended \u2022 that the oath, as prescribed by the act, was properly administered. Moore v. Nelson [Case No. 3,771]; Doe v. King, 3 How. (Miss.) 125. But where the magistrate, as in this case, sets out the oath administered, and it thereby appears that the act has not been observed, no intendment can be made, and the objection is fatal. As to the second objection, that that was fatal, as had been just decided in the cases of Marston v. McRea [Id. 9,141]; Wilson v. Smith, 5 Yerg. 379. That the third objection was fatal, as appeared from the act of congress and adjudged cases. [Bell v. Morrison] 1 Pet. [20 U. S.) 355; Yoce v. Lawrence [Case No. 10,979]; Edmondson v. Barren [Id. 4,284]; Pettibone v. Derringer [Id. 11,043].</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-3\">S. H.

The form can be easily varied to suit any case where a deposition is desired on account of the residence of the witness more than one hundred miles from the place of trial. It is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\"United States of America. State of Pennsylvania. County of Philadelphia, City of Philadelphia, ss.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">*\u2018I certify that on the sixth day of March. A. D. 1S54. before me.

Alexander J. Fromberger, a witness in behalf of The plaintiffs, to depose in a civil cause depending in the circuit court of the United States for the Eastern district of Arkansas, held at Little Rock in said district, on the common law-side of said court, wherein John Eckel.

Fromberger. being of lawful age and sound mind, and being by me first carefully examined, cautioned, and duly sworn to testify the whole truth touching the matters in controversy in said civil cause, deposes and says (then followed the deposition, which was reduced to writing by the mayor and signed by the witness, and the certificate proceeded as follows.):</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">\"I further certify that the foregoing deposition of Alexander J.
