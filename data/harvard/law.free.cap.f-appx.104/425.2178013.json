California Men\u2019s Colony, Unit II Men\u2019s Advisory Council, </em>506 U.S. 194, 202-03, 113 S.Ct. 716, 121 L.Ed.2d 656 (1993). Further, a litigant seeking to proceed IFP on appeal must show that he is economically eligible and that his appeal is not frivolous. <em>Jackson v. Dallas Police Dep\u2019t, </em>811 F.2d 260, 261 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The district court dismissed the complaint for want of prosecution for failure to pay the filing fee. Lee\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that he paid the filing fee in the district court in a timely manner because Saturdays and Sundays are not counted in the 30 days stipulated by the magistrate judge\u2019s order. This assertion is without merit. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a). Accordingly, the motion for IFP is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Jackson, </em>811 F.2d at 261; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. All outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
