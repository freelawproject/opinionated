Luddington, Texas prisoner #241638, seeks leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) in this appeal from the district court\u2019s decision dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous. The district court denied Ludding-ton\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Luddington challenges the district court\u2019s certification decision pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997), arguing that the district court erred by adopting its order of dismissal as the basis for the certification decision rather than stating the reasons in the order denying IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-22\">Luddington has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith. Accordingly, his request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-23\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Lud-dington\u2019s complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal each count as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). If Luddington accrues three \u201cstrikes,\u201d he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-24\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
