Mapku argues that: (1) the BIA abused its discretion by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, (2) equitable tolling should apply to his case, and (3) that his due process rights were violated when the BIA adopted the reasoning of the IJ and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-23\">Mapku has failed to show that the BIA abused its discretion by affirming the denial of his motion to reopen. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000). As the operation of a statute of limitations is not at issue in this case, Mapku\u2019s equitable tolling argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>211 F.3d 927, 930 (5th Cir.2000). Furthermore, Mapku\u2019s due process argument is unavailing. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
