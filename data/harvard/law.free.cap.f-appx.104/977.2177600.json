For the following reasons, we REVERSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-26\">Elizabeth Wooten filed a personal-injury lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores after she fell while shopping at a Wal-Mart in Holly Springs, Mississippi. Elizabeth Wooten claimed that she was unable to see the small step or curb, over which she allegedly tripped, as she walked into the garden area of the store because it was not clearly marked and the area surrounding the step was cluttered with debris. After Wal-Mart removed the case to federal district court, Tyrone Wooten (Wooten) \u2014 executor of Elizabeth Wooten\u2019s estate \u2014 notified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>court that she had died and was substituted as Plaintiff in the case. The complaint was subsequently amended to include a wrongful-death claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">After discovery, Wal-Mart filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Wooten did not have any evidence to demonstrate that Wal-Mart violated its duty of care. The district court granted the motion, and Wooten appeals from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>King v. III. Cent. R.R., </em>337 F.3d 550, 553 (5th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is proper when the record demonstrates no genuine issue of material fact and where the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 56(c). In deciding whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, all \u201c[djoubts are to be resolved in favor of the nonmoving party, and any reasonable inferences are to be drawn in [that party\u2019s] favor.\u201d <em>Gowesky v. Singing River Hosp. Sys., </em>321 F.3d 503, 507 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">We, of course, apply Mississippi substantive law to this diversity case. <em>See Hill v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>121 F.3d 168, 170 (5th Cir.1997). As in all negligence cases, to survive a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff must provide evidence showing that the defendant owed her a duty, the defendant breached that duty, and this breach was the proximate cause of the injury she suffered. <em>See Ball v. Dominion Ins. Corp., </em>794 So.2d 271, 273 (Miss.Ct.App.2001). The parties agree that the decedent, Elizabeth Wooten, was a business invitee. Therefore, Wal-Mart, while not an insurer of the decedent\u2019s safety, \u201cowed her the duty of exercising reasonable care to keep the premises safe, or of warning [her] of <em>hidden or concealed perils </em>of which [Wal-Mart] knew or should have known in the exercise of reasonable care.\u201d <em>Lucas v. Buddy Jones Ford Lincoln Mercury, Inc., </em>518 So.2d 646, 648 (Miss.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">In granting Wal-Mart\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court held that Wooten had not presented evidence to establish that Wal-Mart had breached its duty of care to the decedent. In reaching this conclusion, the court held that \u201c[t]he owner of a business is not an insurer of the safety of its customers and is not liable for injuries caused by conditions which are not dangerous or which are or should be known or obvious to the customer.\u201d (citing <em>Ball, </em>794 So.2d at 272). The parties agree, however, that the Mississippi Supreme Court has abolished the \u201copen and obvious\u201d defense for premises liability cases, adopting instead a pure comparative negligence regime under which a plaintiffs recovery is diminished, but not barred, where the condition complained of is unreasonably dangerous but easily observable. <em>See Tharp v. Bunge Corp., </em>641 So.2d 20, 25 (Miss.1994). Nevertheless, Wal-Mart asserts that the district court\u2019s statement that Wooten could not recover as a matter of law if the condition was \u201cknown or obvious\u201d is not grounds for reversal because the facts in the summary-judgment record do not demonstrate that the curb over which the decedent allegedly tripped was unreasonably dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">While we might agree with Wal-Mart that the district court\u2019s reference to the obviousness of the condition is not necessarily grounds for reversal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we disagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>with Wal-Mart\u2019s further contention that the summary-judgment record is devoid of facts supporting a finding of dangerousness. In his motion in opposition to summary judgment, Wooten attempted to demonstrate that Wal-Mart breached its duty of care by presenting evidence that the garden area where the decedent fell was in complete disarray on the date in question, with pallets of garden materials and other debris \u201cin the way\u201d of the step, which was not clearly marked to increase its visibility. In response, Wal-Mart argues that its evidence demonstrates that the step was marked with a bright orange stripe on the day of the accident, that the decedent knew about the step because she had visited the garden area on numerous previous occasions, and that the presence of debris in the garden area is immaterial because there is no evidence that decedent actually <em>tripped over this debris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Wal-Mart\u2019s arguments miss the mark. The Supreme Court of Mississippi has indicated that a business owner has a duty \u201cto warn of a condition even though the injured party ... was aware of the hazard\u201d when the injured party \u201ccould not see [the hazard] at the time of his accident.\u201d <em>Biloxi Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr. v. David, </em>555 So.2d 53, 56 (Miss.1989) (discussing <em>Litton Sys., Inc. v. Enochs, </em>449 So.2d 1213, 1215 (Miss. 1984)). Thus, even if Wal-Mart\u2019s evidence shows that the decedent had traversed the step numerous times, a contention that Wooten now disputes, this would not form an absolute bar to recovery; instead, other evidence in the record creates a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether, on the date of the accident, the debris in the garden area concealed the presence of the step, thus creating an unreasonably dangerous condition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See McGovern, </em>566 So.2d at 1228 (stating that an owner has a duty either \u201cto keep the premises reasonably safe\u201d or, \u201cwhen not reasonably safe\u201d to warn of \u201chidden danger or peril that is not in plain and open view\u201d). A jury might reasonably infer that Wal-Mart breached its duty of care in allowing this debris to accumulate and that this breach was the proximate cause of the decedent\u2019s fall. <em>See, e.g., Miss. Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Cargile </em>847 So.2d 258, 262 (Miss.2003) (stating that \u201cproof of a causal connection\u201d may \u201cbe established by circumstantial evidence\u201d if the evidence is \u201csufficient to make the plaintiffs asserted theory reasonably probable,\u201d and, in any event, \u201cit is generally for the trier of fact to say whether circumstantial evidence meets this test\u201d). We therefore conclude that the district court erred in awarding summary judgment to Wal-Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">Accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1011-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">. Importantly, the district court's judgment relied, in the alternative, on a finding that the step to the garden area was not dangerous <em>or </em>that any danger it posed should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>known or obvious to the decedent. <em>Cf. Tharp, </em>641 So.2d at 25 (refusing to abrogate <em>McGovern v. Scarborough, </em>566 So.2d 1225 (Miss. 1990), on similar grounds because, there, the court \"went into great detail to say that the defendant was not negligent and merely threw in the phrase \u2018open and obvious' at the end\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">. This issue of concealment distinguishes the case at bar from past Mississippi cases where a curb or sidewalk on a business-owner's premises was held not to present an unreasonably dangerous condition. <em>See, e.g., Stanley v. Morgan &amp; Lindsey, Inc., </em>203 So.2d 473, 477 (Miss.1967) (seven and one-half inch curb to sidewalk); <em>Ball, </em>794 So.2d at 272-73 (curb from business to parking lot).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
