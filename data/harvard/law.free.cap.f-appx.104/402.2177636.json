Ozuna contends that he has established past persecution on account of his political opinion, and the Respondent has failed to rebut the ensuing presumptions by a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions in Guatemala have fundamentally changed so that he no longer has a well-founded fear of future persecution and so that his life or freedom would not be threatened upon his return.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-18\">When, as in this case, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision without a written opinion, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir. 1997). This court will uphold the IJ\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding of deportation if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-19\">After careful review of the record and the briefs, this court concludes that the IJ\u2019s determination that there has been a fundamental change in Guatemala such that Ozuna no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution is substantially reasonable. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). An alien who does not make the required showing for asylum is not eligible for withholding of deportation. <em>See Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 306 &amp; n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-20\">Ozuna has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to his claim for a discretionary grant of asylum. Thus, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Witter v. I.N.S., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>113 F.3d 549, 554 (5th Cir.1997). Ozuna\u2019s petition for review is.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-16\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
