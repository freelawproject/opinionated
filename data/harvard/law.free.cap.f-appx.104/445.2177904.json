Thomas argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Fed.R.CivP. 60(b)(3) motion as untimely. He contends that he had no knowledge of the evidence alleged to be newly discovered until more than a year after the district court\u2019s judgment was affirmed by this court. He argues that he should not be held to the one year time limit of Fed. R.CrvP. 60(b) because he did not become aware of the Internal Affairs Division investigative report until he received it in the initial disclosure in No. 9:99-CV-333.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-22\">This initial disclosure was made on June 12, 2000. Thus, Thomas became aware of the alleged newly discovered evidence within one year of final judgment. The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Thomas\u2019s motion as untimely. <em>Wilson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>873 F.2d 869, 871 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-23\">Thomas\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Thomas\u2019s motion to supplement the record is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Thomas is hereby informed that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Thomas that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
