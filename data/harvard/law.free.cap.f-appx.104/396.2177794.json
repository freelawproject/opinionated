We review this claim for plain error because Garcia did not raise it in the district court. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>15 F.3d 408, 415 (5th Cir.1994). The record shows that Garcia substantially completed the underlying offense as set forth in the indictment; his argument about his geographical distance from Mexico at the time of his arrest is irrelevant. The district court committed no clear or obvious error by not reducing the offense level. <em>See United States v. Waskom, </em>179 F.3d 303, 308 (5th Cir.1999) (\u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2) requires no reduction for conspirator who made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in criminal endeavor).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">Garcia also contends that there was no evidentiary support for the drug-quantity calculation used to establish his base offense level. The Presentence Report (PSR) relied on the corroborated statements of co-conspirators that linked Garcia directly to the transportation of 17.22 kilograms of cocaine. Because Garcia did not present any evidence to rebut the PSR\u2019s factual findings, the district court was entitled to rely on those findings. <em>See United States v. Ayala, </em>47 F.3d 688, 690 (5th Cir.1995). Further, the PSR\u2019s findings were not the sort of \u201c[b]ald, conclusionary statements\u201d we disapproved of in <em>United States v. Elwood, </em>999 F.2d 814, 817-18 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
