Chavez appeals the 14-month sentence he received after the district court revoked his second term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-22\">Chavez argues that the district court plainly erred when it revoked the second term of supervised release it imposed on September 24, 2002, because, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d), the district court was not authorized to impose as a condition of supervised release that he be confined in a community corrections facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-23\">Chavez fails to establish that the district court\u2019s imposition of residence at a community corrections center as a condition of supervised release was clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994)(en banc). The 2001 Sentencing Guidelines, to which Chavez was subject, plainly state that residence in a community treatment center may be imposed as a condition of supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(e)(l), p.s.; \u00a7 5F1.1. The 2001 Sentencing Guidelines are not in conflict with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d), which authorizes the district court to impose any condition it considers to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.,5 the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
