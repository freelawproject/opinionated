Douglas, Texas prisoner # 1004998, has filed an application for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) on appeal following the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous of his petition for a writ of mandamus. By moving for IFP, Douglas is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">In his petition, Douglas asked the district court to issue a writ of mandamus ordering the state trial court to vacate a protective order in a civil proceeding before that court, which prevented Douglas from obtaining desired discovery. The district court concluded that the writ should be denied because the state case was closed. Douglas has not responded to this conclusion before this court, and any such claim is arguably deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). Moreover, Douglas cannot show that the district court had the authority to order a state trial court to act in a closed case. <em>See Santee v. Quinlan, </em>115 F.3d 355, 356-57 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Moye v. Clerk, DeKalb County Superior Court, </em>474 F.2d 1275, 1276 (5th Cir.1973). Douglas\u2019s appeal is thus without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith and denying Douglas IFP status on appeal, we deny the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>motion for leave to proceed IFP, and we DISMISS Douglas\u2019s appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal of his appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous constitute two \u201cstrikes\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). If Douglas obtains three \u201cstrikes,\u201d he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
