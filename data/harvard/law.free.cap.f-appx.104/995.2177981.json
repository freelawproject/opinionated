We have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal to the extent that IFIC and Allegheny are challenging the district court\u2019s denial of their motion seeking intervention as of right. <em>Edwards v. City of Houston, </em>78 F.3d 983, 992 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc). However, to the extent that IFIC and Allegheny are challenging the district court\u2019s denial of their motion seeking permissive intervention, we have jurisdiction over this appeal only if we determine that the district court abused its vast discretion in denying the motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>IFIC and Allegheny have not shown that the district court erred in denying their motion to the extent that they sought intervention as of right, as they have not shown that the Harris County Bail Bond Board and Harris County cannot represent them adequately in the plaintiffs\u2019 suit. <em>See Edwards, 78 </em>F.3d at 1004-05; <em>Hopwood v. Texas, </em>21 F.3d 603, 605-06 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED to the extent that it denied IFIC and Allegheny\u2019s motion seeking intervention as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">IFIC and Allegheny have likewise not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying permissive intervention. <em>See Ingebretsen v. Jackson Pub. Sch. Disk, </em>88 F.3d 274, 281 (5th Cir.1996). Consequently, to the extent that IFIC and Allegheny seek to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion seeking permissive intervention, their appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">JUDGMENT OF DISTRICT COURT AFFIRMED IN PART AND APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1030-18\">.
