He argues that the district court erroneously calculated his sentence because he should have been held accountable only for the six checks that he cashed and the victims involved, rather than for all of the organization\u2019s intended loss occurring after he joined it and for the victims of that loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-25\">The district court could fairly infer a joint undertaking whose scope encompassed the check-cashing activities of the other members of the organization from the fact that Kirkpatrick participated with the other members in selecting the cities and stores in which to cash the checks and the fact that he coordinated his check cashing with the other members. <em>See United States v. Evbuomwan, </em>992 F.2d 70, 74 (5th Cir.1993); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n.2). The cashing of checks by the other members of the organization was both in furtherance of the organization\u2019s jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable in connection with it. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b472-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
