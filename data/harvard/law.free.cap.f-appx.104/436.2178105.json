Jimenez argues that the district court clearly erred when it denied him a four-level adjustment as a minimal participant, or alternatively, a two-level adjustment as a minor participant under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Jimenez argues that he was entitled to an adjustment because he was a mere courier and because he was substantially less culpable than \u201cJuan,\u201d the other participant in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The district court did not clearly err when it denied Jimenez an adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) inasmuch as his role as a courier does not automatically entitle him to the adjustment. <em>See Burton v. United States, </em>237 F.3d 490, 500 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>868 F.2d 1409, 1410 (5th Cir.1989). Jimenez\u2019s culpability is established by the large amount of marijuana he imported. <em>See United States v. Leal-Mendoza, </em>281 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Rojas, </em>868 F.2d at 1409; and <em>United States v. Gallegos, </em>868 F.2d 711, 713 (5th Cir.1989). Moreover, Jimenez was more than peripherally involved in the offense inasmuch as he left the country to drive the loaded vehicle across the Mexican border. <em>See United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 446-47 (5th Cir.2001). Jimenez fails to show that his status as a courier makes him less culpable than \u201cJuan.\u201d <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Jimenez\u2019s argument that the Government breached the plea agreement when it failed to recommend at Jimenez\u2019s sentencing proceeding that Jimenez be sentenced at the low end of the applicable guidelines range is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Likewise, Jimenez\u2019s argument that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960(a) and (b) are facially unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
