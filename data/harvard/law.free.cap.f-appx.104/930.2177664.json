The district court may modify the imposed term of imprisonment under limited circumstances. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Because Dedrick\u2019s pleadings did not fall under any of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), they were unauthorized and without a jurisdictional basis. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141-42 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, on that alternative basis, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-23\">Dedrick\u2019s motion to supplement his brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b964-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
