Relying on <em>United States v. Doggett, </em>230 F.3d 160 (5th Cir.2000), Tran argues that his indictment contained a jurisdictional defect because it did not charge the drug quantity involved in the offense. He argues that he has no remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and therefore he is entitled to seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 pursuant to the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">A federal prisoner may use 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 to challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence if he can satisfy the mandate of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">[T]he savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-10\"><em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">Although Tran\u2019s appeal focuses on our decision in <em>Doggett, </em>in the district court he relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which was the basis for our <em>Doggett </em>decision. <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, and an <em>Apprendi </em>claim does not satisfy the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary, Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347-48 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1241, 123 S.Ct. 1374, 155 L.Ed.2d 212 (2003). Therefore, Tran\u2019s claims do not fall within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
