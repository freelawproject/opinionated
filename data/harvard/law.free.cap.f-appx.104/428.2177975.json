Gordon appeals the dismissal of his complaint as barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em><footnotemark>**</footnotemark> doctrine. Gordon\u2019s complaint, which sought to appeal the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Madison v. Gordon, </em>39 S.W.3d 604 (Tex.2001), did not raise a cognizable federal claim because under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, federal district courts are prohibited from reviewing or nullifying final state court judgments. <em>See Union Planters Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Salih, </em>369 F.3d 457, 462 (5th Cir.2004). Insofar as Gordon alleges that the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s judgment was void for lack of jurisdiction, he must appeal that issue to the United States Supreme Court if he desires federal review of that ruling. <em>See id. </em>To the extent that Gordon\u2019s arguments can be liberally construed as raising a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim that he was denied access to the courts, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 does not cover claims against purely private parties, and, therefore, this also is not a cognizable federal claim. <em>See Richard v. Hoechst Celanese Chem. Group, Inc., </em>355 F.3d 345, 352 (5th Cir.2003). Given that Gordon has failed to state a federal claim, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to appoint counsel. <em>See Castro Romero v. Becken, </em>256 F.3d 349, 353-54 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-24\">Gordon\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-25\">APPEAL DISMISSED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b462-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
