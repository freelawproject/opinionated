IT IS ORDERED that Chapa\u2019s appeals are consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Chapa contends that the district court erred by declining to give his proposed instruction regarding his state of mind about his citizenship status; erred by declining to instruct the jury that the Government\u2019s burden of proving alienage meant more than proving Chapa\u2019s alien birth; erred by denying his motion for a mistrial; erred by denying him a sentencing adjustment for acceptance of responsibility; and erred by revoking his term of supervised release. Chapa\u2019s contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">Illegal reentry is not a specific-intent crime. The Government therefore did not need to prove that Chapa had any intent or knowledge regarding his citizenship status. <em>See United States v. Trevi\u00f1o-Martinez, </em>86 F.3d 65, 68-69 (5th Cir.1996). The district court therefore did not err by declining to give Chapa\u2019s requested instruction regarding his state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">The district court\u2019s instructions regarding alien status adequately explained the law and the Government\u2019s burden of proof. The district court did not err by declining to give Chapa\u2019s requested instructions on alien status. <em>See United States v. Bishop, </em>264 F.3d 535, 553 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">The denial of Chapa\u2019s mistrial motion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Wyly, </em>193 F.3d 289, 298 (5th Cir.1999). First, the district court sustained Chapa\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s question on which the mistrial motion was based, before the question was answered. Second, the question related to a peripheral issue in the case. It is highly unlikely that the jurors would have relied on the prosecutor\u2019s question to make a finding on the central issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-15\">Because Chapa did not seek an acceptance-of-responsibility adjustment apart from his downward-departure motion, we review his contention under the plain error standard. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). There was no plain error in Chapa\u2019s case. Chapa continued to deny that he was an alien after he was convicted, and he accused a witness of committing perjury about his mother\u2019s birth certificate. No adjustment was warranted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-16\">Chapa\u2019s contention that the district court erroneously revoked his supervised release is based on his challenge to his conviction. Because the conviction is affirmed, the revocation also is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1008-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
