Reed was convicted on his guilty plea of conspiracy to carry a firearm in relation to a drug-trafficking offense, in violation of former 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. In calculating Reed\u2019s offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court added four levels for his possession of a firearm in connection with the offense of conviction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In his motion to reduce his sentence, Reed asserted that he should be resentenced without this four-level increase, in the light of Guideline Amendment 599. The district court denied relief without stating specific reasons. The district court\u2019s ruling on such a motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1009 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Section 1B1.10(c), p.s., provides that Amendment 599 is retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Amendment 599 amends the Commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4. The amendment clarified \u201cunder what circumstances defendants <em>sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 92j.(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses </em>may receive weapon enhancements contained in the guidelines for those other offenses\u201d. Amendment 599 (emphasis added). This does not apply to Reed, who was sentenced for only one offense, which was not \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Although he asserts in a conclusory fashion that the application of Amendment 599 to \u00a7 2K2.4 and not to \u00a7 2K2.1 is unconstitutional, Reed does not identify any issue for appellate review. Appellants, including those proceeding <em>pro se, </em>must brief the issues they present. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">Reed also contends that his sentence should not have been enhanced for possession because he never possessed a firearm. He bases this on his assertion that he was convicted of conspiracy to attempt to possess. This lacks merit because Reed was convicted of conspiracy to use and carry a firearm during a drug-trafficking crime; no attempt was alleged. Furthermore, the presentence investigation report shows that Reed and his coconspirator possessed the firearm in their vehicle. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying relief to Reed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
