A district court may dismiss a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint <em>sua sponte </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) when the complaint demonstrates that the claims asserted are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. <em>Gonzalez v. Wyatt, </em>157 F.3d 1016, 1019-20 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-22\">Bateman\u2019s cause of action accrued on April 7, 1999, when he knew or had reason to know of the injury which formed the basis of his complaint. <em>See Pete v. Met-calfe, </em>8 F.3d 214, 217 (5th Cir.1993); Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a)(Vernon 2003). Bateman filed his complaint in October 2003. Under these circumstances, the district court did not err in dismissing Bateman\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. <em>See Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, Bateman\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Bateman\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is also DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-23\">Bateman is cautioned that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal as frivolous both count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>as strikes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Bateman is warned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; MOTION DENIED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
