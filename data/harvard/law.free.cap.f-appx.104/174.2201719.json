United States, </em>No. 02-718C (Nov. 26, 2003), dismissing Vincent R. Terio\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Terio opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-23\">Terio\u2019s complaint alleged that the Department of Veterans Affairs denied him certain benefit payments, violated his Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection rights, and engaged in violations of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (2003). The United States moved to dismiss Terio\u2019s complaint for, among other things, lack of jurisdiction under RCFC 12(b)(1). The Court of Federal Claims granted the motion, first addressing Terio\u2019s benefits claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-5\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a) precludes this Court from exercising judicial review of veterans\u2019 benefits determinations. <em>See e.g., Davis v. United States, </em>36 Fed.Cl. 556, 559 (1996) . . . . Moreover, as to the portions of Mr. Terio\u2019s claim which may be characterized as an appeal from decisions of the [Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals], .... [t]he Veterans Judicial Review Act of 1988, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7251-7298, grants the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims the exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the [Board].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aml\">With regard to Terio\u2019s Fifth Amendment claims, the Court of Federal Claims explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-8\">[Under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1),] to establish constitutional jurisdiction, the Plaintiff must identify a money-mandating constitutional provision. <em>See e.g., United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 216-217, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983).... This Court lacks jurisdiction to hear claims based on [the due process and equal protection] guarantees because they do not obligate the Federal Government to pay money damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">Finally, the Court of Federal Claims concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over Terio\u2019s FOIA claim because \u201cFOIA vests district courts with jurisdiction to enjoin an agency from withholding records and to order the production of agency records that are being improperly withheld from a complainant.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">Summary affirmance of a case \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir.1994) (summarily affirming the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 dismissal of a complaint). The Court of Federal Claims was correct in concluding that in lacked jurisdiction over the claims raised in Terio\u2019s complaint and properly dismissed his case. Thus, because no substantial question exists regarding the outcome of Terio\u2019s appeal, the court summarily affirms the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims dismissing Terio\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-13\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-14\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion to summarily affirm the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-15\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
