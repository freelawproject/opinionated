Espinosa argues that the district court erred in finding that he did not satisfy the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause.\u201d Espinosa argues that because he was charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(b), he was convicted of a non-existent offense; that the jury must determine the drug quantity used for sentencing; that he was subject to a maximum sentence of only 20 years of imprisonment; and that he is actually innocent of the career offender enhancement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. He asserts that he should be allowed to raise his claims via a \u00a7 2241 application and requests that this court reconsider its holding in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-26\">Espinosa has not met his burden of showing that he meets the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 application under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He has not pointed to a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been imprisoned for conduct that was not pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>hibited by law. Nor has he shown that his claim was foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his guilty-plea conviction, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Reque-na, </em>243 F.3d at 903-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
