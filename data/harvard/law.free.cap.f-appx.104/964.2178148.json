Powell, Robert C. Childs, Willis E. Pickett, Tracy Rowell, and Ronald <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>Foley (collectively, the Plaintiffs) appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment for Northwestern Resources Co. (NRC) relating to the Plaintiffs\u2019 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) claim for overtime compensation for certain pre-shift and post-shift activities.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> The Plaintiffs\u2019 unopposed motion to correct a minor error in their reply brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">The Plaintiffs assert that, among other things, the tasks of signing in at NRC\u2019s \u201cready room,\u201d receiving daily work assignments, conducting pre- and post-shift inspections of the company\u2019s transport vehicles, and travel time to and from their respective job sites, constituted integral components of their principal work activities from which NRC benefited and for which the Plaintiffs were entitled to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">We have reviewed the record and hold that the pre- and post-shift activities cited by the Plaintiffs were neither performed in the ordinary course of business nor for the benefit of NRC. <em>See Vega v. Gaspar, </em>36 F.3d 417, 424-25 (5th Cir.1994). Similarly, as determined by the district court, the Plaintiffs offer insufficient summary judgment proof of a contract or the existence of a custom or practice at NRC that compensated for travel time to a designated excavation site. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b). Accordingly, because the Plaintiffs fail to identify specific evidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine issue for trial, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>Anderson v.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b999-9\"> On stipulation of the parties, the Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claim regarding nonpayment of a night-shift premium was withdrawn and dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
