United States, </em>No. 02-789C (Fed.Cl. Sept. 5, 2002). On July 12, 2002, Wood filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims alleging that the seizure of his property constituted a taking. Wood\u2019s takings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>claim stems from a government seizure of his property during an arrest on December 6,1988. Because a claim for an unconstitutional taking accrues at the time \u201cthe plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action,\u201d <em>Hair v. United States, </em>350 F.3d 1253, 1260 (Fed.Cir.2003), and because the six-year limitations period for actions against the United States is a jurisdictional requirement attached by Congress that must be strictly construed, <em>Hopland Band of Pomo Indians v. United States, </em>855 F.2d 1573, 1576-77 (Fed.Cir.1988), the Court of Federal Claims properly dismissed Wood\u2019s claim as time barred. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501 (\u201cEvery claim of which the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed within six years after such claim first accrues.\u201d). Accordingly, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
