Thomas contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence by two levels pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), which applies when a dangerous weapon was possessed during a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The district court noted at sentencing that it would have given Thomas the same 210-month sentence even if the two-level dangerous-weapon enhancement did not apply. The sentence imposed is within the guideline range that would have applied without the enhancement. Under such circumstances, the error in applying the enhancement, if any, is harmless. <em>See United States v. Rogers, </em>126 F.3d 655, 661 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Thomas also has filed a letter pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) calling our attention to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). However, we have held that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
