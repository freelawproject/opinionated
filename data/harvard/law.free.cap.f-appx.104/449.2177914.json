De La Cruz contends that his civil and due process rights were violated when Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Vela dismissed his complaint, because, as a named defendant in the complaint, Judge Vela should have disqualified himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">De La Cruz\u2019s lawsuit is clearly frivolous and asserts claims against parties which are immune from suit. <em>See FDIC v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 475, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994); <em>Johnson v. Kegans, </em>870 F.2d 992, 995-96 (5th Cir.1989). The better procedure, however, would have been for Judge Vela to have recused himself because he was a named defendant in the proceeding. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instruction to refer the matter to another non-defendant district court judge for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">IFP GRANTED; VACATED and REMANDED with instruction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
