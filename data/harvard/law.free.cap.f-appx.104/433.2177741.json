Ortiz, federal prisoner # 85990-012, appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. In that petition, Ortiz sought habeas corpus relief on the ground that the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) violated his constitutional rights by informing him he was eligible for early release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) and then subsequently determining that he was ineligible for early release. In an appeal from the denial of habeas relief, \u201cthis Court reviews the district court\u2019s determinations of law <em>de novo </em>and its findings of facts for clear error.\u201d <em>Venegas v. Henman, </em>126 F.3d 760, 761 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-25\">Ortiz did not have a constitutionally protected right to early release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B). <em>See Rublee v. Fleming, </em>160 F.3d 213, 216-17 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, the district court properly denied Ortiz\u2019s instant petition. This appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard, v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because it is frivolous, the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the instant appeal is GRANTED. All other outstanding motions are DENIED. The instant appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-26\">MOTION TO DISMISS GRANTED; ALL OTHER OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b467-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
