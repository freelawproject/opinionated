He argues that district court erred in determining that he voluntarily stopped his vehicle, rendering his initial encounter with Border Patrol agents a consensual one, and argues that the encounter was instead a seizure unsupported by reasonable suspicion. He contends that because the district court\u2019s determination whether a seizure occurred was influenced by an incorrect view of the law, this court\u2019s review is <em>de novo, </em>rather than for clear error. <em>See United States v. Mask, </em>330 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">The district court\u2019s determination that Kane\u2019s initial encounter with agents was a consensual one, rather than a seizure, was not \u201cinfluenced by an incorrect view of the law.\u201d <em>See Mask, </em>330 F.3d at 337. The district court did not err in finding the encounter consensual in the light of the evidence that Agent Grajeda\u2019s hand gesture toward Kane\u2019s vehicle was a signal for Kane to slow down, rather than for him stop, but that Kane nonetheless stopped his vehicle. <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>43 F.3d 140, 145-46 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
