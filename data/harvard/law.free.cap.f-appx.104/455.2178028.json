Patino contends for the first time on appeal that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and (b) are facially unconstitutional in view of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Patino acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580 (5th Cir.2000), but he seeks to preserve his argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-23\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d This court has rejected the argument that <em>Apprendi </em>rendered the sentencing provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 facially unconstitutional. <em>See Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d at 582. As Patino concedes, the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Slaughter </em>forecloses his argument. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-24\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
