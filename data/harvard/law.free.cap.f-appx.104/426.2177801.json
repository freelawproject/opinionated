He appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging this conviction. DeWitt-McCotter argues that the district court erred by holding that his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition was subject to dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>because it did not warrant application of the \u201csavings clause\u201d set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He contends that his sentence is not authorized because it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause and, in light of <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. The district court found that DeWitt-McCotter had raised a <em>Bailey </em>claim in a prior motion before the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Because DeWitt-McCotter\u2019s claims fail to meet the requisite standard, the \u201csavings clause\u201d is not applicable to his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Reyes-Reque-na v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
