Stevenson argues that he is actually and factually innocent, that counsel\u2019s failure to request a proper jury instruction constituted ineffective assistance, that the district court should have invoked its mandamus power to correct these errors, and that the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>mission of a co-defendant\u2019s statement violated his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Stevenson has not shown that his claims are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and that his claims were foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claims should have been raised in his trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
