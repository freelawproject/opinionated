Johnson, Louisiana prisoner no. 99104, is serving a life sentence for the 1978 murder of his mother. <em>Johnson v. Cain, </em>215 F.3d 489 (5th Cir.2000). He appeals a district court\u2019s final decision foreclosing consideration of claims raised in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application in 1997 but not addressed by the district court at that time. We have already determined that the claims need not be considered now because Johnson did not contemporaneously attempt to appeal the court\u2019s failure to consider them. <em>In re: Johnson, </em>No. 02-30895 (5th Cir. Dec. 5, 2002) (unpublished). Johnson does not show that our prior decision is clearly erroneous or would work a manifest injustice such that the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine does not apply. <em>See Hopwood v. Texas, </em>236 F.3d 256, 272-73 (5th Cir.2000). Nonetheless, we have considered Johnson\u2019s unaddressed claims and find no merit in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-24\">The decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b463-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
