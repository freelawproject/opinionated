Khawaja argues that the BIA erred in not applying the mixed-motives standard and in not finding that he was a refugee under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-27\">We have reviewed the record and the briefs and conclude that the BIA applied the correct standard in determining whether Khawaja was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of an enumerated ground under the Act. <em>See Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 666 (5th Cir.2002). Additionally, the BIA\u2019s finding that Khawaja was not a refugee under the Act is supported by substantial evidence, as the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-28\">Accordingly, Khawaja\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that <em>this opinion </em>should <em>not </em>be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
