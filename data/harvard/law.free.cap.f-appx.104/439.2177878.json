They allegedly did so by having a writ of possession entered in a state court civil proceeding, which canceled her deed and possession to property located in San Antonio, Texas. We review the dismissal as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Graves v. Hampton, </em>1 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Although Acevedo argues that the actions of the defendants in executing the state court judgment were ex parte and attributable to state action, her claims are unmistakably a challenge to the state court judgment, which awarded the writ of possession with respect to the property in question. Moreover, the Texas appellate court has already held that the writ of possession was a proper award by the trial court in the state court proceeding. <em>See Acevedo v. Stiles, </em>No. 04-02-00077-CV, 2003 WL 21010604 (Tex.App. May 7, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u201c[Ljitigants may not obtain review of state court actions by filing complaints about those actions in lower federal courts cast in the form of civil rights suits.\u201d <em>Hale v. Harney, </em>786 F.2d 688, 691 (5th Cir.1986); <em>see District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Acevedo\u2019s complaint as frivolous. Because the appeal is without arguable merit, it is DISMISSED as FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
