A certificate of appealability was granted as to the issue whether the district court erred in rejecting Meyer\u2019s speedy-trial claim under the standard of review in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Meyer contends that the decision of the state appellate court affirming his convictions was contrary to established Supreme Court precedent in <em>Moore v. Arizona, </em>414 U.S. 25, 94 S.Ct. 188, 38 L.Ed.2d 183 (1973) and <em>Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520 (1992), as it required him to make an affirmative showing of prejudice. Meyer contends that, under <em>Moore </em>and <em>Doggett, </em>prejudice must be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-18\">The state appellate court properly balanced the four factors delineated in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972). The state court\u2019s decision does not indicate that the court considered this to be a case in which the first three factors weighed so heavily in Meyer\u2019s favor that a showing of prejudice was unnecessary. <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 655-56, 112 S.Ct. 2686. Meyer has not shown that the decision of the state appellate court was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, the above cases. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405-06, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b991-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
