The contract also provided for the employment' and payment by the relator of an assistant teacher for the school during the term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-8\">On the 2d day of January, 1875, at a regular meeting of the local directors, by a verbal agreement between the parties thereto, the written contract ivas so modified as to reduce the term of school to two months from and after the 4th of January; to release the relator from the obligation of employing and paying an assistant teacher, if without.such aid he could teach and conduct the school, during-the term named, to the satisfaction of the local directors, and to pay him $125 per month for teaching the school without such aid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-9\">The relator performed the contract, without the aid of an. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>assistant, to the satisfaction of the directors, who, on the 6th of March following, delivered to the relator their certificate, directed to the clerk of Youngstown township, showing that there was due to the relator for two months\u2019 services as teacher of the school named, under the agreement, the sum of $250, which certificate, with the reports required by law and a copy of his certificate of qualifications from the county examiners, he, on the 13th day of March following, presented to the defendant, who at that time was such clerk, and requested him to draw an order on the treasurer of the township for the payment of the amount so certified to be due to him, which the defendant refused to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-5\">Application was afterward made by the relator to the District Court of Mahoning county for a mandamus to compel the defendant to issue the order, which was allowed by the court; and on the 22d day of March, 1876, an alternative writ issued, directed to the defendant as such clerk, commanding him, immediately on the receipt of the writ, to issue the order demanded by the relator for the payment of the sum named, with interest from the 6th day of March, 1875, or to appear before the court on the 27th of March following the date of the writ, and show cause why he had not done so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-6\">The defendant appeared on the day named in the writ, and made return setting out in substance as causes why he should not be compelled to issue the order: 1. That the report filed with him by the relator, at the time the order was demanded, did not show the true number of pupils in attendance upon the school during the term, nor the true average daily attendance of such pupils; 2. That on the day the relator presented the certificate of the local directors, and demanded an order on the township treasurer for the payment of the amount certified to be due him, there was no money in the township treasury applicable to the payment of teachers in sub-district No. 3 of the township; and 3. That the contract made with the local directors, under which the services were rendered by the relator, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>illegal and void, and such as, under the provisions of the \u2022statutes, the local directors had no power or authority to make.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">On the hearing, the district court found that causes one .and two set out in the return were not sufficient to avoid the issuing of a peremptory writ, but that cause three set out in the return was sufficient for that purpose, and thereupon refused the writ, and dismissed the petition at the \u2022costs, of the relator, to which he excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-6\">Yolney Rogers, for the motion,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHN\">urged that the contract was not illegal or opposed to public policy, and cited <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>11 Ohio St. 232; <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Odell, </em>30 N.

They have no power to delegate the employment of teachers for such schools to any other person or persons, nor to provide for the payment of a teacher thereof in any other manner than that pointed out in the last clause of section 58 of the act above referred to; It follows, therefore, that the written contract of No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>vember 30, 1875, between the local directors of the sub-district named and the relator was illegal and void in so-far as it provided for the employment and payment of an assistant teacher by the relator, and for the payment to the relator of a certain sum per month for his services and those of his assistant as teachers of the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Section 53 of the act above cited provides, \u201c That in each-township district the local directors shall employ teachers of the schools in the sub-district in which they reside,\u201d \u201c have power to fix the salaries or pay of said teachers,\u201d and \u201c shall certify the amount due any teacher for services' to the township clerk,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The verbal agreement of Janirary 2, 1875, in effect revoked the illegal and void provisions contained in the written contract of the preceding November, and although it also contained provisions which the local directors had no power or authority to make, the authorized parts of it were so separate and distinct from the unauthorized parts, that the parties thereto were enabled to and did perform those parts of the agreement which the local directors had. aut hority to make, without performing any of the unauthorized portions thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">We are, therefore, of opinion that the court erred in holding that the facts set out in cause three of the defendant\u2019s return were sufficient to avoid the writ; in refusing to-order a peremptory writ to compel the defendant, as such clerk, to issue to the relator the order demanded, with interest on the amount certified to be due to him from March 6, 1875, and in rendering judgment against the relator for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\n<em>Motion granted, and judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
