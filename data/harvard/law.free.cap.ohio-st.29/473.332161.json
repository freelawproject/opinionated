A person who negligently signs and delivers to another a printed form of a negotiable promissory note containing blanks, without knowing it to be such, is estopped, as against a subsequent <em>bona fide </em>holder for value and before due, from denying authority in the person to whom it was delivered to fill the blanks.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-11\">Error to the Court of Common Pleas of Medina county. Reserved in the district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-12\">The original action was brought by defendant in error as indorsee of a negotiable promissory note for $200, dated February 16, 1870, payable to Alfred Ingalls or order July 1, 1870, against the plaintiff' in error, as maker. The defendant denied the execution of the note, and alleged in his answer that the same was forged, fraudulent, and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-13\">On the trial it was admitted that the plaintiff was a <em>bona fide </em>indorsee of the note before due and for value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-14\">The plaintiff' offered the note in evidence, having introduced testimony tending to prove that the defendant\u2019s signature thereto was genuine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u201c The defendant then introduced evidence tending to prove that on or about the day of the date of said note, two strangers (one of whose names is supposed to be McWilliams), representing themselves to be agents of Alfred Ingalls, the payee named in said note, came to his, the defendant\u2019s residence, at Chatham, in said county, and exhibited to him a model of a seed-drill, which they said was invented and patented by said Ingalls, and solicited him to become the,agent in his township for the sale of said drills; that after some hesitation he consented to act as such agent, and made arrangement with said agents, by the terms of which he was to receive from said Ingalls, free of charge, a sample drill, to be shipped from his place of residence in Buchanan county, Iowa; was to pay no consideration for or on account of said agency; but was to sell said drills, make collections, and remit a stipulated share of said collections to said Ingalls, and settle with him for all sales he should make; that said agents undertook to reduce said agreement to writing, filled up in writing certain printed blanks they had with them, in duplicate, and professed to read to him said contracts so filled up; that he affixed his signature to said duplicates, said agents taking one and he retaining the other; that said agents in reading said contract suppressed and did not read to him that portion relating to a consideration of $200, and he knew of no such stipulation until after said agents had gone; that it was also agreed that he, the defendant, should send on an order to said Ingalls for a sample drill, and said agents filled up a blank order which they had with them, and upon the back of said order a statement of the defendant\u2019s property, which order and statement the defendant signed and retained in his own possession to send to said Ingalls. Exhibit \u2018 C,\u2019 attached, is a copy of said contract, and exhibit \u2018D\u2019a copy of said order and statement; the words underscored in each being in writing and the remainder printed, and both of said exhibits are made part hereof. The defendant further introduced evidence tending to prove that he mailed said order to said Ingalls, in pursuance of said agreement; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the -same was returned to him from Chicago for better directions, it having been addressed to A.

The papers, of which exhibits \u2018 C <em>\u2019 </em>and \u2018 D \u2019 are copies, were introduced in evidence and given to the jury. Other evidence was introduced, not deemed material to this bill of exceptions, and the defendant rested.\u201d -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-5\">Thereupon the defendant requested the court to charge the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-6\">\u201c 1..

If the jury find the agreement as above stated, and that the signature affixed to the note in suit is the signature of the defendant, and that he affixed his signature to a printed blank with no intention of executing a promissory note, and gave no authority to write anything over his signature, or fill any of said blanks; and afterward the agents of the said Ingalls, or other person or persons, without his knowledge or consent, filled said blanks, and thereby constituted the note in suit, said note is a forgery, and the plaintiff can not recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-6\">\u201c3.

It is uniformly held that, if one intrusts his signature to another for the purpose of creating a written obligation, and a promissory note is written over the signature, in pursuance of such arrangement, he is bound by it, although the obligation be of a character entirely different from that agreed on or intended. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Grote, </em>4 Bing. 253; <em>Van Duser </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>21 N. Y. 531; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Colson, </em>7 Cowen, 336; 1 Parsons on Notes and Bills, 109 et <em>seq.; Violett v.

Y. 234; <em>Kitchen </em>v. <em>Place, </em>41 Barb. 465 ; <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>31 Barb. 100; <em>Bank, etc. </em>v. <em>Woodworth, </em>18 Johns. 315; <em>Garrard </em>v. <em>Hadden, </em>67 Penn.

When a complete note is executed and delivered, the addition of any material word or words avoids it as to all makers or indorsers not consenting fo the alteration. <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Bank, </em>2 Allen, 236; <em>Worrall </em>v. <em>Gheen, </em>39 Penn.

Detaching a written memorandum from the margin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>of a note, explanatory of its terms, or of the nature of the liability, and negotiating the note, is forgery, and avoids the note. <em>Benedict </em>v. <em>Cowden, </em>49 N. Y. 396; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stratton, 2</em>7 Iowa, 282; <em>Wheelock </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>13 Pick. 165 ; <em>Waite </em>v. <em>Pomeroy, </em>20 Mich. 425.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-5\">5. When the maker\u2019s signature to a note is obtained by 'fraud, and there is no voluntary delivery by the maker, it is void in the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value. <em>Cline </em>v. <em>Guthrie, </em>42 Ind. 227; <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Linbury, </em>22 Mich. 479; <em>Burson </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>21 Mich. 415.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-6\">A careful analysis discloses no case that approaches the docti\u2019ine laid down by the learned jxxdge in his charge. In every ease in which a person has been held liable on a promissory note, his <em>intention </em>to make a xxote or other written obligation, when he affixed his signature, appears.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-7\">J. <em>H. Dickson, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-8\">The plaintiff could read and did xxot, but signed without reading, trusting to the other contracting party, \u201ctwo strangers,\u201d to furnish him knowledge of what he signed, axxd then trusting to them one of the paper\u2019s so signed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-9\">This was gross negligence on the part of plaintiff, and if one of the papers he so signed, turned out to be a promissory note in the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>indorsee, he surely, on principle as well as authority, should suffer instead of the innocent holder who bought the note for a valuable consideration in the usual course of business and before maturity. <em>Sellers </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>3 Ohio St. 302; <em>McKesson </em>v. <em>Stanberry, </em>3 Ohio St. 158; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>McKinnon, </em>38 L.

No. 1876, Law Record, Cin.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b486-10\">McIlvaine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aor\">The exception to the charge as given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the jury was general. It is not now contended that the whole charge was erroneous. Many propositions therein contained were unquestionably the law of the case. And there being no doubt, from the whole record, that the verdict and judgment were right, there is no reason for departing from the rule laid down in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 25 Ohio St. 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The principle involved in the second assignment for error was considered and stated in the case of <em>DeCamp </em>v. <em>Hamma, </em>supra, 467. The special requests to charge, which were refused, ignored the test by which the liability of the defendant below should have been determined, to wit: whether or not he was guilty of negligence in signing and delivering the note sued on without knowledge of its true character.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Where a negotiable instrument, with the genuine signature of \u00e1 prior party, comes into the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value before maturity, the presumption is in favor of its validity; and if such party seeks to escape liability, on the ground that it was not voluntarily executed, the burden of showing that fact rests upon him, and also to show that he was without negligence in the premises..</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">And the same principle applies, where the defense is that blanks in a printed form were filled, without authority, subsequent to the delivery. The signing and delivery of a printed form, with blanks, which, when filled up in accordance with the tenor and apparent purpose of the paper, makes it a negotiable promissory note, is such carelessness in the signer as will estop him from denying the authority for filling the blanks, as against an innocent holder before maturity and for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\n<em>\u2022'Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
