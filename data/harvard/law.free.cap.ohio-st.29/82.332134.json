Common Pleas of Hamilton county, under the provisions of the act of January 5, 1871 (68 Ohio L. 6), on the application of Leo Cohnen, appointed W. A. Cop-pick guardian of the property of William A. Hagany, upon satisfactory proof that, hy reason of intemperance and habitual drunkenness, he was incapable of taking care of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">On the hearing, Hagany, by his counsel, demanded a trial by jury, which demand the court refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">The district court, on petition in error, affirmed the judg. ment and order of the common pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-8\">On this case, it is insisted by the plaintiff in error, that the statute of January 5, 1871, entitled an act for the appointment of guardians of habitual drunkards, etc., under which the court of common pleas assumed to act, is in conflict with the constitution:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-9\">1.

The statute (68 Ohio L. 6), is unconstitutional and void because the legislature had no authority to vest the appointment of a guardian in the common pleas court. The probate court has exclusive jurisdiction. Section 8, article 4, of the present constitution; section 5, article 3, of the old constitution; 19 Ohio, 357; <em>Morningstar </em>v.

The statute is unconstitutional because it fails to provide for a trial by jury. <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>2 Pick. 383; <em>Nor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>ton </em>v. <em>McLeary, </em>8 Ohio St. 205; <em>Reckner </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>22 Ohio St. 292 ; <em>Gaston </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>6 Wis. 508 ; 30 How.

The right thus secured was such as was recognized by the common law. At common law the right of trial by jury did not exist in cases like unto those provided lor i a-the statute.
