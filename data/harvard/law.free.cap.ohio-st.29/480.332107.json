Two men came to my place about dinnertime on the 15th day of April, 1874, in a two-horse wagon, and had their horses put in the stable and fed ; they came-lo the house and took dinner.

Nothing was said about their business until they were ready to start away. They said they were agents for the sale of a patent plow or the territory therefor. One of the men took me some distance from the wagon and showed me a model of the plow, and made a contract with me to sell plows for them in the townships of Salem and Wayne, in Jefferson county. They agreed to send me the plows from Hamilton, Butler county, Ohio, toHnionport, said county. I agreed to' sell the -plows for them, and for my services was to have the difference between the cost price and the retail price, which they said would be ten dollars each plow. I was to be at no expense except, to haul-the plows from Unionport to-my place of residence.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>They gave me an order for thirty plows on the Hamilton Plow Company, and told me to send the order to the Hamilton Plow Company, and they would send the plows to me.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">\u201c \u00a3 They told me to use the money I received from the sale of the plows, or put it in bank for them, and they would come around every six months and get it; and told me if I could not sell the plows they would come and take them off my hands and make other arrangements for their sale.

He wrote on the box, and when he got done writing, the man on the ground said to the man on the wagon: \u201c Read it; you can read it better than he can.\u201d The man in the wagon then read it to me; read nothing in the paper about a note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-7\">\u00a3\u00a3 \u2018 The man on the ground then got in the wagon and I stood on the wheel. The papers were arranged one on top of the other. It being windy, they each assisted in holding the papers which I signed, by spreading their hands out upon them. There were three papers ; they said they were contracts in duplicate and a property statement. One of the contracts was kept by me. I signed no other papers than the contracts in duplicate and the property statement, three in number. The other contract and property statement they took with them. The papers were so placed that the signatures, when written, were close together. They then left immediately.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-8\">\u201c \u00a3 I did not know that the contract said anything about a note; neither did they, when they read it to me, read anything about a note.

These requests fairly assumed the true test of the defendant\u2019s non-liability, to wit, that he was without negligence in the premises.. We have looked into the testimony for the purpose of seeing whether the defendant could have been prejudiced by these refusals, but instead of finding evidence-tending to relieve the defendant from suspicion of negligence, we find indubitable proofs of gross negligence on his part. There was some testimony tending to show that the name of the defendant to the note was not his genuine signature, but that fact is not an element contained in the propositions requested and refused. These requests assume-that the signature was genuine, but obtained by fraud and-without negligence on the defendant\u2019s part. And the genuineness of the signature being granted, the case made on. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the proof was that the defendant relied solely on the representations of Ingalls as to the character of the paper. His^own testimony was : \u201c I did not read the papers at the time I signed them; I can read. No objection was made to my reading the papers at or before the time I signed them.\u201d When all the testimony was in, if it had been demurred to on the ground that proper care and caution had not been exercised by the defendant in the premises, the demurrer should have been sustained by the court. Upon this point there was no issue of fact for the jury to determine. The admitted conduct of the defendant presented a mere question of law. And the law, upon the admitted fact, is that the defendant was guilty of negligence, and thei\u2019efore there was no error to his prejudice in refusing to give these instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The 3d request was properly refused, as in it the element of care on the part of defendant was omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The 17th proposition in the charge as given, when considered in the case as it was made in the proof, was not objectionable. It is true the rule, as given to the jury for their guidance, contained no \u25a0 qualification in favor of the defendant, if the jury had found him free from fault or negligence in the transaction ; but, as shown above, such qualification, had it been made, would have been a mere abstraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Did the court of common pleas err in striking from the allegations in the defendant\u2019s answer, to wit, \u201c the said note is false, fraudulent, and forged,\u201d the words \u201c false and fraudulent?\u201d We think not. .Theallegation that the note was forged remained in the answer; and if the words stricken out were meant to describe the note as other than \u201c forged,\u201d they certainly did not give it any quality or character which made it invalid in the hands of an innocent indorsee before maturity and for value. But, again, whatever the pleader may have meant by the words \u201cfalse and'fraudulent,\u201d the scope of the issues which remained, to wit, that the note was forged, and that the defendant \u201c did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>not make, sign, or deliver \u201d it, was ample for the admission \u25a0of all the testimony offered in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Judgment of the district court reversed, and the judgment of the common pleas affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
