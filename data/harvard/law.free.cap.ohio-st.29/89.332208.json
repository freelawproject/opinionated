The rule in question,for the enforcement of which, in the manner stat\u00e9d, damages are claimed by the plaintiff in this action, was, in our opinion, reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The pupil having failed to comply with, the rule, the teacher in excluding him from the school until he should comply with it or offer a reasonable excuse to the board for his non-compliance, acted under the authority of and with the consent of the board, and the action of the defendants in the premises having been, as they aver in their answer, in their judgment,for the best interests and welfare of the school, they are not liable in damages to the plaintiff therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">It follows, therefore, that the coui't of common pleas did not err in overruling the demurrer of the plaintiff to the answer of the defendants, and its judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
