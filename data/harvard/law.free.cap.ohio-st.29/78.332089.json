In an action by an indorsee against the maker of a promissory note, the defendant by his answer, as a <em>first </em>ground of defense, denied the making of the note; and, as a <em>second </em>ground of defense, alleged that if the signature to the note was genuine it was obtained by a <em>\u201c </em>cunningly-devised scheme,\u201d or trick, and that there was no valid consideration for the note, of which facts the indorsee had full knowledge when ho took the note. <em>Held: </em>That the defendant had a right to insist upon both these grounds of defense, and that it was error in the court to rule him to elect on which ground he would rely.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-15\">Motion for leave to file a petition in error to reverse the judgment of the District Court of Ashland county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>This was an action by the Citizens\u2019 Bank against Clos\u2022son, upon a promissory note alleged to have been made by him to R. R. Eenner &amp; Co., or order, and indorsed to the bank before due. Closson set up ,two several defenses in his answer: 1. He denied the execution of the note. 2. He alleged that if the signature to the note was his it was obtained by \u201c a fraudulent and cunningly-devised scheme,\u201d or trick, without his knowledge ; that he was induced by false and fraudulent representations of Eenner &amp; Co. to sign certain papers, represented to be mere receipts or orders i'elating to a proposed agency for selling a patent invention, and if he signed the note his signature was procured by making him believe he was signing one of the receipts or orders ; that it was obtained without consideration, and that the bank had knowledge of these facts when it purchased the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">On motion of the plaintiff, the court ordered the defendant to elect upon which of these grounds of defense he would rely. The defendant excepted to the order, and elected to rely upon the first-named defense, the denial of the execution of the note, and the case was tried upon this issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">On the trial, the plaintiff gave in evidence a note of the tenor and effect of that described in the petition, with evidence .tending to prove the defendant\u2019s signature thereto; and the defendant gave evidence tending to show that the note had been altered without his knowledge or consent by the payee\u2019s agent, after its delivery, by inserting the words \u201c payable at the Eirst National Bank of Ashland, Ohio,\u201d and also the words \u201c eight per cent, interest.\u201d The note seems to have been in the form of a printed blank filled up, but whether the blanks left in the printed form were such as to indicate that they were to be filled up with these words, or whether these words, or either or any of them, were written .or printed, does not appear from the record. Upon this evidence the defendant asked the court to-instruct the jury that if they found that the agent of the payee \u201c ha,d made a material alteration in said note fraudulently,\u201d after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>its delivery, and without the defendant\u2019s knowledge or consent, the plaintiff could not recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">The court refused this request, and instructed the jury as follows : \u201c If you find from the evidence that the defendant executed the note in controversy, . . . and left blanks in the same, which were afterward filled up by inserting therein the words <em>\u2018 </em>payable at Eirst National Bank of Ashland, Ohio,\u2019.and \u2018 eight per cent, interest,\u2019 and these blauks were so filled without the knowledge of the plain'tiff, and that the plaintiff in due course, and for valuable consideration, became the purchaser of the note in suit, the defendant will be liable on said note, notwithstanding such alterations were made without his knowledge and consent.\u201d To which instructions, as well as to the court\u2019s refusal to instruct as requested, the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-7\">The jury having found for the plaintiff, and judgment having been entered upon the verdict, the defendant prosecuted his petition in error in the district court, where the judgment was reversed. Leave is now asked by the plaintiff* to file a petition in error to reverse the judgment of the district court, the questions presented being, <em>first, </em>whether the court erred in ruling the defendant to elect between his defenses; and, <em>second, </em>whether there was error in the. court\u2019s instructions, or in its refusal to give the instructions requested.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-8\"><em>Smith &amp; Smith, </em>for the motion:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-9\">Section 93 of the code does not confer the right to maintain inconsistent defenses in the same action.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A88\">The code allows a defendant to \u201c set forth in his answer as many grounds of defense, counter-claim,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>or set-off as he may have,\u201d and it contains no limitation upon this privilege, except what is implied in the provision that pleadings shall be verified by oath. There is no provision requiring the several grounds of defense to be technically consistent with each other, or requiring an express admission of the truth of averments sought to be avoided by new matter. It is merely required that the auswer shall be \u201c verified\u201d by oath. When two alleged grounds of defense plainly contradict each other, they are not susceptible-of verification, because it is impossible for both to be true. The verification of one is the falsification of the other. In such a case, the answer, though sworn to, is not \u201c verified,\u201d and should, on motion, be stricken from the files, or the defendant be put to his election. Was there any such contradiction or irreconcilable repugnancy between the two defenses set up in this answer ? We think not. Taken together, the two defenses amount to this : That the defendant is ignorant whether he signed the note or not; he does n.ot believe he signed it, and therefore denies it; and that, if he did sign it, his signature was obtained by fraud, and vsdthout consideration. The word \u201c note,\u201d where'it occurs in the second defense, so far as the question of verification is concerned, can well be understood in the sense of \u201c <em>supposed </em>note.\u201d It certainly is not consistent with the spirit and intention of the code that a party having one or the other of two good defenses, without the means of knowing, otherwise than from the developments to be made upon the trial, which of the two, in fact or in law, is his true defense, shall, at his peril, be compelled to elect in advance on which he will rely, to the exclusion of the other. When, from the nature of the case, it is rendered uncertain which of two grounds of defense is the true and proper one, it is competent for the defendant, in his answer, to set them both up, provided they will admit of being stated in such form that the answer can be sworn to -without falsehood, and in good faith. Such was the case here, and we think the court erred in putting the defendant to his election. '</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>We are of opinion also that the court erred in refusing the instruction requested. The proposition asked was good law, as applied to the case. The plaintiff had declared upon the note in its altered condition. If the alteration had been made fraudulently, and without the defendant\u2019s knowledge or consent, the note, as described in the petition, was not his note. Whether, in any such case, an innocent indorsee could recover upon the <em>original </em>note was not the question. The question was whether the defendant made the note in its altered form. The court was undoubtedly Tight in telling the jury that the holder has an implied authority to fill up blanks which appear upon the face of the note to have been intended to be filled up. Rut that was no answer to the request made by the defendant. The character of these blanks does not appear, and the request was to charge the jury as to the effect of filling them up \u201c fraudulently, and without the defendant\u2019s knowledge and consent.\u201d If the blanks were in a form to imply authority to fill them up, the act of filling them up was not fraudulent, uor against the defendant\u2019s consent, but by his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">On both these grounds, therefore, we think the district court was right in x-eversing the judgment of the common pleas. <em>Motion overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
