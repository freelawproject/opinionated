Shalala, Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services (hereafter, Secretary), of reimbursement of Medicare costs claimed by Plaintiff-Appellant Girling Health Care, Inc., Girling challenges the propriety of the district court\u2019s use of the summary judgment mechanism when reviewing a decision of an administrative agency. Girling also asserts the absence of substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s decision. As this appeal involves a \u201ccomplex and highly technical regulatory program,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we write somewhat more extensively here than we might otherwise have when affirming a district court\u2019s summary judgment disposition of such an agency case. For the reasons hereinafter set forth, we affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment affirming the Secretary\u2019s decision and dismissing Girling\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-25\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b298-26\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"AhK\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-27\">This case arises under the Medicare Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Medicare home health care agencies,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> such as Girling, are reimbursed by the Medicare program through private organizations acting as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u201cfiscal intermediaries\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under contract with the Secretary. Under the Medicare Act, the Secretary prescribes methods for determining a provider\u2019s \u201creasonable cost\u201d of providing services to Medicare beneficiaries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The fiscal intermediary determines the provider\u2019s reasonable cost based on an annual cost report submitted by the provider.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The provider is notified of the intermediary\u2019s determination in a written notice known as a \u201cnotice of program reimbursement\u201d (\u201cNPR\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">A provider that is dissatisfied with an intermediary\u2019s determination is entitled to a hearing before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (\u201cPRRB\u201d) if (1) the amount in controversy is $10,000 or more, and (2) the provider makes a request within 180 days following the date on which the NPR was mailed to the provider.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The PRRB\u2019s decision may be reversed, affirmed, or modified by the Secretary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court has jurisdiction to review a final reimbursement decision by the PRRB or the Secretary under the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Administrator\u2019s reversal of the PRRB\u2019s decision in this case constitutes the final decision of the Secretary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">B. <em>Operable Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Girling\u2019s Memphis, Tennessee, sub-unit submitted its cost report for the 1986 fiscal year to Prudential, its fiscal intermediary, on November 6, 1986. On November 5, 1987, Prudential issued its NPR finding that Girling owed the Medicare program $31,591. Girling appealed the decision to the PRRB, contesting Prudential\u2019s failure to include a number of reimbursable costs and charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">On April 11, 1988, Prudential informed Girling that it had \u201cordered\u201d a detailed listing of paid claims (a, PS &amp; R <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>), which would be forwarded to Girling so that it could identify any discrepancies. On July 11, 1988, Prudential wrote to Girling and explained that on April 29, 1988, Prudential had sent the PS &amp; R of paid claims for fiscal years 1986 and 1987 to Girling but that Prudential had never received Girling\u2019s analysis of that report. Prudential requested that Girling submit its reconciliation by July 29, 1988, so that Prudential could analyze the disputed claims prior to terminating its role as intermediary on January 1,1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">The record contains a letter dated July 28, 1988, indicating Girling\u2019s intent to forward its reconciliation to Prudential; however, the address on the forwarding letter does not include a city or state. Nothing in the record indicates that Girling\u2019s reconciliation was ever received by Prudential. On August 9, 1988, Prudential again wrote to Girling and referred to Girling\u2019s being \u201cin the process of identifying the discrepancies in your records and ours.\u201d Prudential never issued a report concerning Girling\u2019s reconciliation; neither did Prudential furnish its successor, Blue Cross of Iowa, a copy of the PS &amp; R or other supporting information concerning the reimbursement dispute with Girling.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">The PRRB held a hearing on November 30,1993. On May 24,1994, the PRRB issued a decision reversing Prudential\u2019s disallowance of the reimbursement costs. The PRRB found that Girling had submitted \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to show that the PS &amp; R was flawed and that Girling should not be prejudiced by Prudential\u2019s failure to transfer the documentation to Blue Cross of Iowa. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>The PRRB also determined that Girling had timely submitted reconciliation data to Prudential.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The Administrator of the HCFA reviewed and reversed the decision of the PRRB, finding that Girling had not presented sufficient evidence to show that the cost amounts from the PS &amp; R used by Prudential were inaccurate. The Administrator held that Girling\u2019s \u201creconstructed\u201d data, which was retrieved with only limited success from Girling\u2019s archived computer billing records, failed to meet the requirements of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.20. The Administrator\u2019s decision was the final decision of the Secretaiy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Girling filed the instant suit in the district court, seeking reversal of the Secretary\u2019s decision. Girling contends that it had submitted adequate data for reimbursement, but that the Secretary had \u201cignored evidence before the PRRB.\u201d The Secretary and Girling each moved for summary judgment. In its motion, Girling contended that the Secretary had made an arbitrary decision to deny reimbursement, which decision was not supported by substantial evidence, and that the Secretary had conducted an overly broad review of the PRRB\u2019s decision. Concluding that the Secretary\u2019s review of the PRRB\u2019s decision was not limited and that the Secretary\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, the district court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and Girling timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">A. <em>Summary Judgment Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Despite having filed its own motion for summary judgment, Girling argues to us that the summary judgment mechanism used by the district court is inconsistent with the standards for judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act. Citing <em>Olen-hm,se v. Commodity Credit Corp.,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Girling argues \u2014 for the first time on appeal<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 that the district court should have reviewed Girling\u2019s summary judgment motion under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and that such review would have required the district court to \u201cexamine[ ] the entire administrative record.\u201d Girling insists that the district court\u2019s failure to examine the entire record is the \u201conly logical conclusion\u201d that can be distilled from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">This argument is frivolous. As more fully explained below, the district court properly focused on whether the Secretary\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. In addition, <em>Olenhouse </em>is factually distinguishable and logically inapplicable. In <em>Olenhouse, </em>the Tenth Circuit addressed an instance in which the district court went beyond the administrative record to decide the administrative case before it, leading the appeals court to hold that summary judgment was an inappropriate mechanism for deciding administrative cases.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Here, the district court did not go beyond the administrative record; neither is that the basis for Girling\u2019s contention that the summary judgment standard is inappropriate. On the contrary, Girling contends that the district court did not delve deeply enough into the administrative record, not that the district court reviewed matters not considered by the Secretary which were outside of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">We have consistently upheld, without comment, the use of summary judgment as a mechanism for review of agency decisions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Our practice is supported by the commentators.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-16\">The summary judgment procedure is particularly appropriate in cases in which the court is asked to review or enforce a deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>sion of a federal administrative agency. The explanation for this lies in the relationship between the summary judgment standard of <em>no genuine issue as to any material fact </em>and the nature of judicial review of administrative decisions____ [T]he administrative agency is the fact finder. Judicial review has the function of determining whether the administrative action is consistent with the law\u2014that and no more.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\"><em>As </em>Girling presents no compelling argument for changing this practice, we decline the invitation to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">B. <em>The Secretary\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">We will not reverse the Secretary\u2019s decision unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with law, or unsupported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Substantial evidence is \u201c \u2018more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Girling argues that the district court\u2019s decision was not based on a \u201cthorough\u201d discussion of the decision by the PRRB and the subsequent reversal of that decision by the Secretary. The expertise of the PRRB and the HCFA Administrator are deemed equivalent, even when the latter reverses the former.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Girling contends that the district court erred by not reviewing the PRRB\u2019s decision that Girling had provided adequate records. Although deemed equal in expertise with the PRRB, the Secretary nevertheless has the option of making the final decision, and hers is the only one that is subject to judicial review.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-18\">Congress charged the Secretary with the primary responsibility for interpreting the cost reimbursement provisions of the Medicare Act, so courts accord particular deference to her interpretation of Medicare legislation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Courts are required to \u201cgive substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201cunless an \u2018alternative reading is compelled by the regulation\u2019s plain language or by other indications of the Secretary\u2019s intent at the time of the regulation\u2019s promulgation,\u2019 \u201d we must defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-19\">The provider bears the burden of maintaining financial records and statistical data sufficient for proper determination of costs payable under the program.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Secretary found that, under the applicable regulations, Girling bore the burden of verifying the data used in computing allowable costs, and that Girling had failed to carry that burden. The Secretary is not permitted to issue payments to a provider unless the provider \u201chas furnished such information as the Secretary may request in order to determine the amounts due____\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201cThe principles of cost reimbursement require that providers maintain sufficient financial records and statistical data for proper determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>of costs payable under the program.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> These financial records must be \u201ccapable of verification by qualified auditors\u201d and \u201cin sufficient detail to accomplish the purposes for which it is intended.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> A provider\u2019s own cost accounting system is \u201conly the first step in the ultimate determination of reimbursable costs.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Another step in the ultimate determination of reimbursable costs involves the intermediary\u2019s PS &amp; R.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">As part of the reimbursement process, intermediaries are required to report all Medicare charges submitted by a provider along with any reimbursement for those charges in Provider Statistical and Reimbursement Reports (\u201cPS &amp; R reports\u201d), compiled quarterly. Intermediaries must use these reports to check amounts on a provider\u2019s annual cost report. Intermediaries must also send the provider a Provider Summary Report for the PS &amp; R reports used by the intermediary. The provider is then afforded the opportunity to furnish proof that the summary is inaccurate. If the provider fails to show any inaccuracies, the intermediary will then rely on the PS &amp; R report to adjust the charges reported in the provider\u2019s cost report.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Intermediaries, such as Prudential and Blue Cross of Iowa, have been directed by the Secretary to use the information in the PS &amp; R \u201cunless the provider furnishes proof that inaccuracies exist.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In an attempt to prove the PS &amp; R information inaccurate, Girling proffered a billing transmittal log that could not be reconciled because the period for' reprocessing had expired. Girling also provided claims information that it had reconstructed from a computer billing log. Girling did not contest that the period for reprocessing had expired; rather it explained that it was unable to reconstruct all of the billing information for the pertinent period from the computer tapes. Regarding the accuracy of Girling\u2019s information, a controller for Girling stated that \u201c[w]e were unable to locate a couple of periods during the year[.] [A]s well, some of the data on the tapes was damaged and therefore unretrievable.\u201d As noted by the district court, the sum of the evidence provided to Prudential by Girling in an effort to rebut the PS &amp; R consisted of four pages titled \u201cFY1986 Reconciliations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">Moreover, an audit coordinator for Blue Cross of Iowa testified before the PRRB that the information provided by Girling was insufficient to enable an intermediary to determine the number of allowable home visits, and that there was no way to reconcile the claims. Failure to provide records susceptible of being audited allows the Secretary to deny reimbursement. Thus Girling\u2019s failure to submit documentation to enable the intermediary to determine Medicare charges accurately is sufficient cause for reliance on the PS &amp; R Reports. The Secretary\u2019s decision to rely on the PS &amp; R Reports, rather than on Girling\u2019s recreated and admittedly incomplete data, is supported by substantial evidence. As the regulations and MIM \u00a7 2242 place the burden of maintaining records on the provider, the Secretary\u2019s decision not to reheve Girling of the burden was neither arbitrary nor capricious. For the foregoing reasons, the summary judgment of the district court is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-15\">. <em>See Thomas Jefferson University v. </em>Shalala, - U.S. -, -, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 2387, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-18\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 <em>et seq.
