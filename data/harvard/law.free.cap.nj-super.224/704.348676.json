I had hoped that this would at least temporarily clear up the condition but I did receive a telephone call on June 16th from Roberta Blair, the tenant in Apt. 10-R, who advised me that the situation still persists____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-11\">In addition to my previous complaints, I have this morning, received information pertaining to Mr. Sliker, reports of numerous assaults and battery, disorderly persons, thefts, drunk driving and driving while a license has been suspended____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-12\">In any event, it would appear that we made a serious error earlier in the year in formally accepting the fact that Gerald Sliker was living with Ellen Gunn and accepting his tenancy on that basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-13\">It certainly appears that he is not the kind of person that we want at Brookside Terrace and for that reason as well as those stated in my letter of April 29, 1987, we are not going to renew the lease of Mrs. Gunn and Mr. Sliker which expires on July 31, 1987.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-14\">I hope you will agree that they should move out in order to avoid legal proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">Defendants did not vacate the premises and on August 7, 1987 plaintiff filed this tenancy action. The complaint alleged that \u201c[defendants have breached their lease with plaintiff in that they have maintained their apartment in a unclean and uninhabitable condition, have engaged in the consumption of alcoholic beverages on the balcony of their apartment and have further caused loud and profane language to be shouted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>public contrary to the rights and best interests of all other tenants in said apartment and failed and/or refused to cease said activities despite repeated requests of the landlord.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The case was tried in the Special Civil Part on August 24 and 25,1987. At the beginning of the trial, plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the court to decide whether plaintiff\u2019s letters of April 29, 1987 and June 19, 1987 satisfied the statutory requirements for notice of alleged violations of a landlord\u2019s rules and regulations. The trial court apparently ruled that the letters provided adequate notice and directed plaintiff to present its evidence in support of the complaint. This evidence consisted of testimony by plaintiff landlord\u2019s representative and various tenants who alleged that defendants\u2019 apartment was filthy and had caused roaches to infest the building, that foul odors emanated from defendants\u2019 apartment, that defendants were noisy, and that they consumed alcoholic beverages on their balcony and shouted obscenities. Gunn testified for the defendants and denied all of these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Following the presentation of evidence by the parties, the trial court stated that it had examined a court file in a case brought by the Division of Youth and Family Services against Gunn, in order to resolve the factual disputes between the parties. The court took judicial notice of certifications by two social workers contained in this file. These certifications indicated that defendants\u2019 apartment was extremely dirty and that on one occasion at least one hundred dead cockroaches had been found on the floor. The court found that these certifications were \u201crelevant to the question whether or not Susan <em>[sic </em>] Gunn was being truthful when she testified to the Court that she's an immaculate housekeeper.\u201d The court then proceeded to find plaintiff\u2019s witnesses to be more credible than Gunn. Thus, the court concluded that defendants had violated the landlord\u2019s rules and regulations incorporated in their lease and directed that a judgment of possession be entered. Defendants appealed, and the trial court granted a stay pending appeal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The Anti-Eviction Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1 <em>et seq., </em>comprehensively regulates the grounds on which a residential tenant may be evicted and the procedures a landlord must follow before evicting a tenant. Unless the landlord demonstrates compliance with these statutory provisions, a judgment for possession may not be entered. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.3; <em>see Georgia King Associates v. Fraiser, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>146 (App.Div. 1986). The provisions of the Anti-Eviction Act apply not only during the term of a lease but also to nonrenewal of a lease. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.3(a); <em>see Harden v. Pritzert, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>237, 240 (App.Div.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">One statutorily permissible grounds for eviction is that a tenant \u201c... has continued, after a written notice to cease, to substantially violate or breach any of the landlord\u2019s rules and regulations governing said premises, provided such rules and regulations are reasonable and have been accepted ... by the tenant.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(d). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.2(b) also requires \u201c[f]or an action alleging continued violation of rules and regulations under paragraph d ... one month\u2019s notice prior to the institution of the action for possession.\u201d Thus, four statutory preconditions must be satisfied before a dispossess action can be filed for a tenant\u2019s failure to comply with a landlord\u2019s rules and regulations: (1) the tenant must violate the landlord\u2019s rules and regulations; (2) the landlord must give the tenant a notice to cease the violations; (3) the tenant must continue to violate the rules and regulations after receipt of the notice to cease; and (4) the landlord must give the tenant a notice of termination one month before filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">We reverse the judgment of possession entered in this case because plaintiff failed to serve a notice to cease upon defendants and thus failed to provide them with the opportunity to conform with plaintiff\u2019s rules and regulations. The April 29, 1987 letter to Gunn alleged various violations of the landlord\u2019s rules and regulations and then flatly stated that \u201cyour lease will not be renewed on its expiration date, July 31, 1987.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>June 19, 1987 letter to defendants\u2019 attorney also simply stated that \u201c... we are not going to renew the lease of Mrs. Gunn and Mr. Sliker.\u201d Neither of these letters even suggests that defendants\u2019 tenancy would be continued if they ceased violating the landlord\u2019s rules and regulations. Hence, neither letter satisfies the requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(d) that a tenant be given a \u201cnotice to cease\u201d before being subject to eviction for violating a landlord\u2019s rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Although plaintiff\u2019s failure to provide defendants with a notice to cease requires reversal without more, we also find it necessary to comment upon the trial court\u2019s reliance upon certifications filed in another case in reaching its decision in this case. These certifications were not marked into evidence and are not included in the defendants\u2019 appendix. However, it is clear from the court\u2019s opinion that the certifications were signed by social workers who had visited defendant\u2019s apartment and allegedly found it to be extremely dirty. It is also clear that the court considered these certifications in order to resolve the critical factual dispute between the parties regarding the condition of defendants\u2019 apartment, even though the persons who signed the certifications did not appear at the hearing and therefore were not subject to cross-examination. Hence, the certifications were hearsay and inadmissible under Evidence Rule 63.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The trial court stated that it could consider the contents of these certifications pursuant to Evidence Rule 9(2)(b), which permits a court to take judicial notice of \u201crecords of the court in which the action is pending.\u201d This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of judicial notice. A court may take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>judicial notice that a certification has been filed. In addition, a court can take notice of what is alleged in a certification, if the fact that the allegation has been made is itself relevant. However, a court may not take judicial notice of the contents of a certification for the purpose of determining the truth of what it asserts simply because the certification has been filed with a court and thus is part of a court record. The rules regarding judicial notice are designed solely to provide a speedy and efficient means of proving matters which are not in genuine dispute. <em>See </em>9 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>(Chadbourn rev. 1981), \u00a7 2565-\u00a7 2567a at 693-719. Therefore, these rules may not be used to circumvent the rule against hearsay and thereby deprive a party of the right of cross-examination on a contested material issue of fact. <em>See People v. Rubio, </em>71 <em>Cal.App.</em>3rd 757, 139 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>750, 755-756 (Ct.App.1977); <em>cf. Evid.R. </em>63(3), which permits testimony in a prior proceeding to be admitted in evidence if a witness is unavailable to testify in a later proceeding, provided certain procedural safeguards are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">For the reasons previously stated, the judgment of possession is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for entry of an order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\">Defendant Gerald Sliker did not sign the lease. However, he moved in with Gunn during the term of the lease and thereafter plaintiff accepted Sliker's co-tenancy with Gunn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Defendants also argue that it was improper for the court to consider these certifications because they are records of the Division of Youth and Family Services which are required to be kept confidential pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a. Since the certifications have not been furnished to us and the record does not indicate the circumstances of their submission to the trial court, we decline to consider this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
