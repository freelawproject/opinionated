DeMarco appeals from determinations finding him guilty of two separate contempts in the face of the court. <em>R. </em>1:10-1. He argues on this appeal that he should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>have been allowed to obtain an adjournment to get transcripts of the colloquy which occurred during a gambling conspiracy trial captioned <em>State v. Carmine Mancinelli et al. </em>He also argues that alternatively the trial judge should have handled all of the contempt proceedings in accordance with the procedures under <em>R, </em>1:10-2. Finally, he argues that statements he made to the trial judge were not contumacious <em>per se </em>when reviewed in the context of the trial proceedings contemporaneous with the statements. On this appeal we consider the matter <em>de novo </em>and make independent findings. <em>R. </em>2:10-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">During pre-trial proceedings on December 9, 1986 about whether the press and the public should have access to particular documents, DeMarco challenged what he referred to as the far-reaching nature of the proposed form of order.. He posed and answered a hypothetical question by saying that the judge would stop the trial and produce the documents even to school children who might be observing the trial. DeMarco stated \u201c[tjhat\u2019s what you want to happen, obviously, because you want this order to be signed.\u201d The transcript reveals the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">THE COURT: I repeat, Mr. DeMarco, I made no decision. I don\u2019t want this order to be signed, as you put it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">Now, please present your arguments as an attorney should present arguments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">MR. DE MARCO: I am presenting my argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">THE COURT: I made my position. I have an open mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">MR. DE MARCO: You say you have an open mind. It is my experience during the course of this limited pretrial proceeding that every argument defense counsel has made has been confronted with your absolute certainty about how wrong we are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">THE COURT: Mr. DeMarco, that statement borders on being contemptuous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">We\u2019ll have a recess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-13\">MR. DE MARCO: If you feel I\u2019m contemptuous you have a remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">THE COURT: Mr. DeMarco\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-15\">MR. DE MARCO: If you feel I\u2019m contemptuous\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">The court recessed, and advised DeMarco that it was instituting a summary contempt proceeding under <em>R. </em>1:10-1 and directed him to immediately show cause why he should not be held in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>contempt and adjudged summarily because of statements which the judge then read (presumably after having the court reporter transcribe the few pages of the record that were involved). The court noted that DeMarco had refused to calm down and said twice that if the judge felt that he was being contemptuous, he had a remedy. DeMarco then asked for a recess of about 20 to 30 minutes. The court granted the recess and DeMarco requested Joseph Afflitto, an attorney representing a codefendant, to represent him in the contempt proceeding. The court then rejected a request by counsel for a further adjournment to study the transcript and indicated that if it was a question of an hour or two to have the court reporter read back whatever transpired, he would gladly do that, but he would not adjourn the hearing beyond that. The court then stated that it would give counsel a few hours and continued the matter until 1:30 p.m. Because the issue raised by the press had not been resolved, the court decided to complete the hearing on the proposed form of order before addressing the contempt hearing. When DeMarco was heard concerning the proposed form of order, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">[MR. DE MARCO:] ... The press and the Court and <em>Greco </em>says the press is the vehicle of the public and in that manner they get to know what\u2019s in the transcript because they use the press. But nowhere do I see any one of these <em>cases </em>\u2014 I\u2019m <em>sorry, was I disturbing the Court? </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">THE COURT: Mr. DeMarco, what\u2019s the purpose of that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">MR. DE MARCO: I saw you were \u2014 you just leaned back quickly. I thought I was disturbing the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">THE COURT: Are you baiting the Court once again, Mr. DeMarco?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">MR. DE MARCO: I have never baited the Court before. I think you are baiting me now. I really can\u2019t finish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">THE COURT: There you go again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">MR. DE MARCO: I can\u2019t continue the argument. Every time you argue something\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">THE COURT: Please finish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-14\">MR. DE MARCO: I really can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. I got a threat of contempt over my head. I\u2019m making a legitimate argument to you. You\u2019re accusing me of baiting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-15\">THE COURT: I\u2019m listening to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-16\">MR. DE MARCO: I really can\u2019t continue when I get accused of baiting a Court when I\u2019m making a legitimate argument. You know, it begins to \u2014 I begin to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>frightened to say anything. The next thing you\u2019re going to hold me in contempt for the way I sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">THE COURT: You are to present your arguments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">MR. DE MARCO: I\u2019m sorry, I cannot continue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The summary contempt proceeding continued on December 10,1986 and the judge included the statements made by DeMarco at the end of the morning hearing. The judge stated that he did not defer the hearing partially because DeMarco had been abusive to him one day when a \u201cMr. Bidnik\u201d was in the courtroom. However, he stated that for purposes of the contempt hearing he was not considering, and would not \u201cconsider anything other than appeared] in [the] transcript.\u201d After this hearing was completed the judge withheld adjudication until the conclusion of the trial. There appears to have been no adjudication ever made with respect to this incident. The judge apparently took no further action with reference to the earlier remarks of DeMarco on December 9, and 10, 1986. Whether this was due to the court\u2019s acceptance of counsel\u2019s suggestion that perhaps time might cool things down does not appear in the record. The judge may have thought this was enough warning or that after reflection DeMarco might offer some form of apology for what occurred. Since there is no adjudication relative to December 9, we do not consider it. We do note that the record reflects a disrespectful and defiant attitude of counsel toward the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">On December 15, 1986, while the judge was hearing arguments about the admissibility of transcripts of certain intercepted telephone conversations, DeMarco indicated to the judge that he would use in cross-examination the fact that there were mistakes as to dates and times. The prosecutor then argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af\">MR. CAMPOLO: What I wanted to say, we even got back to format here, the format for each one of these transcripts vary significantly. There\u2019s not even any assumption that any of this introductory matter, other than the actual transcripts, will ultimately be permitted to the jury because someone who sponsors in this evidence will have to testify about the date and time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">This is a question of really housekeeping for the Court, whether you want to allow this sort of introductory information on the transcript, whether some counsel may reserve the right [to] redact it altogether.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Again, I\u2019m looking for some simplicity here, and defense counsel even concedes that we\u2019re correcting these transcripts as we go through. Some of the words are inaccurate, some of them are misspelled, there are differences of interpretation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">And for them now to argue that somehow the mistyping of the day of the week on one of these transcripts by some unknown person somehow raises a crucial issue of cross-examination, is preposterous. <em>I think it\u2019s a fraud, and I would </em>\u2014 [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">DeMarco objected, arguing that if the prosecutor wanted to get personal, he was \u201cfooling with the wrong crowd.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">THE COURT: I would urge counsel\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">MR. DE MARCO: Urge the Prosecutor, he started it and I\u2019ll finish it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">THE COURT: Please at all times conduct yourselves as attorneys. And if you avoid the use of strong language, please avoid it when referring to the argument of your adversaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">MR. DE MARCO: I object to when I raise an argument that it be called a fraud, and I want an apology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">MR. CAMPOLO: I will not apologize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-13\">MR. DE MARCO: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-14\">THE COURT: We were going to proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-15\">MR. DE MARCO: Wait a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-16\">THE COURT: We are going to proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-17\">MR. DE MARCO: I think that language was <em>more contemptuous </em>than what I said to this Court, and you let him get away with [it],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-18\">THE COURT: We are going to proceed. I\u2019ve got to have this case completed. I\u2019m not going to have counsel obstruct the continuation of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-19\">MR. DE MARCO: Judge, you overlook if defense counsel in pursuit of a Constitutional issue uses strong language, you want to hold him in contempt. But the Prosecutor can get up and patch up his case and call the defense a fraud and you let him get away with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-20\">I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being fair now, Judge. You have to be evenhanded to both sides, and you\u2019re not being that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-21\">THE COURT: All right. The Court notes that once again Mr. DeMarco is attacking the integrity of the Court; and I want a copy of this transcript. MR. DE MARCO: See, Judge, it\u2019s another example, the State can get up and make remarks and the Court just let\u2019s it go. When defense counsel stands up and defends his clients in defense of his client\u2019s rights, you use every intimidating method you know how to try and silence the defense. [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The judge recessed the trial and requested a copy of the transcript from the court reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Additional pre-trial proceedings took place on February 25, 1987 with respect to a subpoena issued at the request of a codefendant to the Superintendent of the State Police for the production of certain documents and records. The Attorney General<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the State Commission of Investigation had moved to quash the subpoena, in part based on lack of relevance and materiality. The judge reserved decision and gave the Deputy Attorney General until the next day to prepare affidavits concerning the difficulty of retrieving the information requested. DeMarco interjected \u201c[hjow about testimony rather than an affidavit?\u201d When the judge indicated that he would accept an affidavit, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">MB. DE MARCO: How about if we don\u2019t accept an affidavit? Maybe we want to cross-examine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">Could we have the name who\u2019s going to prepare the affidavit so we can issue a subpoena so we can question him? I think we have the right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">MR. CISZAK: I imagine I will prepare the affidavit based on the facts that were given to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">MR. DE MARCO: Then it\u2019s no one\u2019s affidavit except his affidavit. We can\u2019t ask him questions because it\u2019s going to be double hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">MR. PETRINA: I can\u2019t see how Mr. Ciszak is going to tell you he is going to prepare an affidavit. An affidavit is sworn testimony, in effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">Is he going to tell whoever is giving this what he\u2019s going to say? That person is suppose to say it, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-12\">MR. CISZAK: Hopefully counsel doesn\u2019t think that the Court is so ignorant to think that every client prepares his own affidavit and the attorney just allows him to put it in the proper form obviously for our clients. And every person who made it out of law school knows that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-13\">MR. DE MARCO: I understood it was going to be your affidavit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-14\">MR. CISZAK: I said I\u2019ll prepare it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-15\">MR. DE MARCO: You\u2019re not going to sign it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-16\">MR. CISZAK: Of course not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-17\">MR. DE MARCO: Can you tell us whose affidavit it\u2019s going to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-18\">MR. CISZAK: I imagine the person who signs it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-19\">MR. DE MARCO: I would like to know the person so I can subpoena him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-20\">I mean Mr. Ciszak thinks this is funny. It\u2019s not funny to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Since December 1 we tried to pick a jury. I would like to continue it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">Can we find out whose affidavit it\u2019s going to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">THE COURT: I\u2019m sure Mr. Ciszak doesn\u2019t think these proceedings are \u201cfunny\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">MR. PETRINA: He\u2019s laughing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">THE COURT: All right. Let\u2019s proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">MR. DE MARCO: He\u2019s somebody from the State, it\u2019s got to be, right? THE COURT: I\u2019m going to take drastic action, I\u2019m warning counsel, I\u2019m going to take drastic action if counsel don\u2019t behave in these proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">MR. DE MARCO: Is the Court threatening me? Are you threatening me, Judge? Is that a threat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-12\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-13\">MR. DE MARCO: Is it a threat to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-14\">THE COURT: Mr. DeMarco.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-15\">MR. DE MARCO: Are you threatening me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-16\">THE COURT: Mr. DeMarco, not a further word from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-17\">MR. DE MARCO: There will be further words from me in defense of my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-18\">There\u2019s not a judge nor a man who would quiet me in a courtroom when I\u2019m defending a client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-19\">THE COURT: You constantly demean the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-20\">MR. DE MARCO: I demeaned you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-21\">I think the State has served to demean you throughout these entire proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-22\">After some additional discussion about when the affidavits could be available, DeMarco informed the court that he would not be satisfied with an affidavit, but rather wanted a subpoena for the two individuals and persistently asked why they could not be brought in. The judge determined that they would meet at 11 a.m. and work through the lunch hour to accommodate DeMarco and Afflito. DeMarco replied \u201cyou\u2019re not accommodating me at all, you\u2019re accommodating an order from Judge Bissel, not me.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-23\">DeMarco again requested the names of the individuals and when the Deputy Attorney General replied he was not sure who they would be, the judge determined that it would respond to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>defense counsel\u2019s request the next day. DeMarco then remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">Another waste of time. So when I get the names, then I\u2019ll waste more time by issuing a subpoena and we\u2019ll have to wait until they come.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">Your Honor, talking about dancing to the tune. You are dancing to the tune of the State. I can\u2019t believe an Attorney General comes in here and tells you I\u2019m going to submit an affidavit of two people tomorrow, but I\u2019m not going to give up their names and you\u2019re going to sustain that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">That record is going to look beautiful when someone sees that, it looks beautiful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">I have nothing further, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">Thank you for the justice today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">The next day, February 26, 1987, the judge found that DeMarco\u2019s statements to the court constituted contempt of court under <em>R. </em>1:10-1. An order was entered to this effect on March 6, 1987 and recited that a hearing regarding the penalty would take place upon conclusion of the trial of <em>State v. Mancinelli, </em>the underlying proceeding. The order specifically found the following quoted statements contumacious and attached copies of the transcript page to the order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">(1) <em>'HE\u2019S SOMEBODY FROM THE STATE, IT\u2019S GOT TO BE, RIGHT? </em>(See attached transcript page 81, lines 22-23) [footnote omitted];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-12\">(2) \u2018YOUR <em>HONOR, ..., YOU ARE DANCING TO THE TUNE OF THE STATE.\u2019 </em>(See attached transcript \u2014 page 93, line 11).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-13\">(3) <em>'THANK YOU FOR THE JUSTICE TODAY.\u2019 </em>(See attached transcript-page 93, line 20).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">According to a newspaper article in <em>The Record </em>of March 26, DeMarco was reported as saying to a staff reporter on March 23, the final day of trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-15\">This genius we have on the bench couldn\u2019t give the right charge on conspiracy. He doesn\u2019t know the law of conspiracy, but he expects 12 laymen to know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-16\">On March 25, 1987 DeMarco was ordered to show cause on April 1, 1987 why he should not be held in contempt for his conduct on December 15, 1986 and his March 23 statement to the reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-17\">On April 1,1987, apparently after the trial was concluded, the judge rejected DeMarco\u2019s request for additional time to obtain portions of the transcripts. On April 1, 1987 the court conducted the summary contempt proceedings. The statements made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>to the court on December 15, 1986 were found to constitute contempt under <em>R. </em>1:10-1. A fine of $500 was imposed with respect to that offense. In addition, the judge gave DeMarco an opportunity to address the March 6, 1987 contempt order relative to the February 25 incident. The judge reaffirmed the contempt finding in that order and imposed a $500 penalty. A judgment of contempt was entered on April 3, 1987. Payment of the fines was stayed pending determination of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The matter of the statement of March 23 to the newspaper reporter was treated as a separate and independent matter and was referred to the Office of Attorney Ethics in Trenton for action. Although the judge could have alternatively instituted <em>R. </em>1:10-2 proceedings, he expressly did not rule on that matter, and as neither that statement nor the referral is the subject of the Notice of Appeal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we do not pass upon DeMarco\u2019s contentions concerning the statement assertedly made to the newspaper reporter on March 23, and the subsequent publication thereof in the newspaper of March 26. The judge did not make a contempt finding with respect to that statement or consider it in his adjudication. He referred it to the Office of Attorney Ethics which presumably is acting thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">DeMarco argues that the judge should not have proceeded in a summary manner, and that his rights were violated when the judge proceeded under <em>R. </em>1:10-1 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">Contempt in the actual presence of a judge may be adjudged summarily by the judge without notice or order to show cause. The order of contempt shall recite the facts and contain a certification by the judge that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">When a contempt is committed in the presence of the judge, he may act summarily without notice or order to show cause. <em>In re Yengo, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>111, 121 (1980), <em>cert. </em>den. 449 <em>U.S. </em>1124, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>941, 67 L.Ed.2d 110 (1981).

Notice and an order to show cause are only required when the proceedings are under <em>R. </em>1:10-2. When the proceedings are under <em>R. </em>1:10-1, the judge \u201cmay act upon his own knowledge of the facts,\u201d <em>In re Contempt of Ungar, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>322, 332 (App.Div.1978), however the \u201ccontemnor\u2019s right to be heard includes the right to present \u2018proof of material facts, if any, of which the court may be unaware.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Carton, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>9, 21, 222 A.2d 92 (1966)). Contempt has been defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">... a disobedience of the court by acting in opposition to its authority, justice and dignity. It comprehends any act which is calculated to or tends to embarass, hinder, impede, frustrate or obstruct the court in the administration of justice, or which is calculated to or has the effect of lessening its authority or its dignity; or which interferes with or prejudices parties during the course of litigation, or which otherwise tends to bring the authority and administration of the law into disrepute or disregard. In short, any conduct is contemptible which bespeaks of scorn or disdain for a court or its authority.

See <em>State v. Vasky, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 98; <em>In re Hinsinger, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 495. As cogently stated by Justice Handler in his concurring opinion in <em>In re Yengo:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">It has long been recognized that there are occasions when this inherent authority must be exercised both swiftly and summarily in order to ensure obedience to court orders and respect for court procedures\u2014 The summary contempt power is integrally related to judicial self-preservation\u2014 \u2018The sole credible basis for the summary contempt process is necessity, a need that the assigned role of the judiciary not be frustrated____\u2019 This judicial \u2018power is as ancient as the courts to which it is attached and \"as ancient as any other part of the common law.\u201d \u2019 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">The summary contempt power operates upon contemptuous conduct occurring \u2018in the actual presence of a judge.\u2019 <em>B. </em>1:10-1. New Jersey courts have treated the question of what constitutes a contempt in the \u2018actual presence of the court\u2019 primarily in terms of the capacity of such conduct to undermine the court\u2019s authority and to interfere with or obstruct the orderly administration of justice. [Citations omitted]. [84 <em>N.J. </em>at 130-131].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">DeMarco\u2019s procedural argument is that despite the judge\u2019s statements that he intended to proceed on the basis of a summary contempt under <em>R. </em>1:10-1, the delay in adjudication of the penalty until the close of the trial, and the alleged consideration by the judge of matters other than the statements made in open court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> somehow converted the matter into a <em>R. </em>1:10-2 proceeding. He further argues procedurally that he should have been allowed time to obtain transcripts of the relevant portions of the testimony. Dealing with the latter aspect first, we note that on several occasions the judge provided copies of the relevant pages of the transcript, although it was not necessary that this be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">Moreover, we note that despite the lack of additional transcript pages, DeMarco\u2019s counsel at the hearing before the trial judge argued at length as to the surrounding circumstances at the time of his conduct. Counsel sought to justify DeMarco\u2019s statements in light of what had occurred. DeMarco neither alleges nor asserts any specific language in the transcripts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>which in any way would affect the determination below or here. He fails to articulate in his brief how an adjournment would have benefited him in any fashion, other than by way of a mere generalization. There is no indication in the record that DeMarco was prejudiced in any fashion. He was aware that a hearing would be scheduled at the close of the criminal proceeding and was therefore free to obtain the transcripts during the ensuing weeks. He knew of the first instance on December 15, 1986. Likewise, he was given verbal notice on February 25, 1987 with respect to what had transpired on that date and written notice in the order. An order adjudicating his contempt had been entered on March 6, 1987, with the penalty aspect deferred. DeMarco apparently chose to do nothing from February 25 either until the date the order to show cause was entered or received, or even until the hearing date regarding obtaining the few additional transcript pages involved. In any event, there was no factual discrepancy and counsel was able to argue the issue thoroughly without additional transcript pages. Our thorough review of the transcripts does not demonstrate any basis for challenging the judge\u2019s determination. Indeed, the delay in the proceedings was partially as a result of counsel\u2019s argument and request.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We also note that such a delay does not automatically convert the proceeding into one requiring a hearing before another judge and the formalities under <em>R. </em>1:10-2. See <em>Kerr S.S. Co., Inc. v. Westhoff, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 305 (App.Div.1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, it is obvious that DeMarco\u2019s words were spoken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>in the presence of the judge on December 15, 1986 and February 25, 1987 and directed at him. No further evidence was needed for the judge to certify to his observations of that contumacious behavior. It is evident from the record that the statements of attorney DeMarco, who is expected to act as an officer of the court, were directed at the court, and contrary to his contention not in response to or directed at other attorneys in the case. This clearly resulted in a disruption of the proceedings by the use of improper or offensive words or conduct directed at the judge and constituted direct contempt. <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>134 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 475 (App.Div.1975), mod. on other grounds 69 <em>N.J. </em>937 (1975). Cf. <em>In re McAlevy, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>349, 351-352 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Nor does the claim that other matters were considered on April 1 have any merit. The judge made it clear that he would not consider or base his ruling on such matters. He specifically stated that the contumacious conduct consisted of DeMarco\u2019s statements to him and that he was only considering those statements. References in the March 6 and March 25, 1987 orders were made to those remarks and the order included transcript quotations and page references to the copies annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The incidents involved were relatively recent and uncomplicated and treated virtually contemporaneously. DeMarco\u2019s presentation was not inhibited. He was not precluded from offering an explanation of his conduct. He could even have had the court reporter read back the few pages of transcript that were involved. This certainly would not have been difficult because the sections had already been marked and transcriptions made by the court recorder at the judge\u2019s request. The judge here properly relied on his observation of what happened in the courtroom and what was said. There was no requirement to transfer the matter to another judge. Furthermore, counsel\u2019s disagreement with the judge\u2019s characterization of the proceedings does not change an <em>R. </em>1:10-1 proceeding into an <em>R. </em>1:10-2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>proceeding. See <em>Matter of Daniels, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>550, 580-581 (App.Div.1987), certif. granted 109 <em>N.J. </em>496 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In summary, denial of DeMarco\u2019s request for an opportunity to obtain more complete copies of the transcripts was not a denial of due process of law. There is, of course, under the court\u2019s power to punish directly a diminishing of the \u201cprocedural due process accorded to the alleged contemnor.\u201d <em>In re Yengo, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 122. Here, however, the judge below, as well as DeMarco, was fully aware of all of the material facts. Appropriate arguments concerning his state of mind could be made, and indeed were made. DeMarco had adequate notice. There was no need to further adjourn the hearing until additional transcript pages were obtained or could be obtained. No sufficient reason is even shown why the limited portions of the transcript that might have been necessary could not have been speedily obtained either during the trial or between the time that the February 25,1987 order to show cause was signed and the April 1, hearing date.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is clear from the record that DeMarco knew what he was doing, knew the consequences (on an earlier occasion he indeed twice challenged the judge to use his contempt authority if the judge thought he was being contumacious) and had sufficient recall as to what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">DeMarco had a right to and received a hearing with the attendant right of allocution. See <em>Taylor v. Hayes, </em>418 <em>U.S. </em>488, 500, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>2697, 2704, 41 L.Ed.2d 897, 908 (1974); <em>In re Yengo, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 122; <em>In re Logan, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>475, 477 (1968); <em>In re Kozlov, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>316, 326 (App.Div.1978), rev\u2019d on other grounds 79 <em>N.J. </em>232 (1979). Under our due process concepts it is also appropriate to allow the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>contemnor the right to be represented by an attorney, to retreat from his conduct, and to have the opportunity to correct misunderstandings on the part of the judge. <em>In re Kozlov, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 326. Hence, although in a direct contempt proceeding the judge is empowered to adjudicate the contemnor\u2019s conduct immediately, procedural due process is satisfied by a hearing in which the alleged contemnor is given every opportunity to place his position before the trial judge before whom the conduct occurred. <em>In re Yengo, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 127. The record clearly discloses that the judge informed DeMarco virtually immediately after each incident that a hearing as to his alleged contumacious conduct would be held. The statements that had been made and formed the basis of the hearing were those made by DeMarco to the judge. There was no factual disagreement as to what was said. The hearing was to determine whether the conduct was contumacious in light of the surrounding circumstances and whether the attorney had intended to commit contempt. Our review of the record satisfies us fully that the judge properly held the contempt proceedings under <em>R. </em>1:10-1 as to those matters for which he had adjudicated DeMarco in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We now turn to DeMarco\u2019s substantive claim that his comments were not contumacious <em>per se </em>when reviewed in the context of the proceedings. DeMarco contends that in each incident which resulted in the two contempt citations on appeal, he was only engaging in a \u201cdialogue\u201d with the trial judge or responding to allegations by the prosecutor that he was making fraudulent assertions. Our review of the record amply demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that DeMarco exhibited a pattern of abusive and unwarranted behavior directed at the trial judge. His statements far exceeded the bounds of colloquy and constituted rude, uncalled for attacks upon the objectivity and integrity of the judge, thus disrupting the trial proceedings. See <em>Cooke v. United States, supra, </em>267 <em>U.S. </em>at 536, 45 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 394, 69 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 773; <em>Matter of Stanley, </em>102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>N.J. </em>244, 253 (1986); <em>In re McAlevy, supra, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>at 351-352; <em>State v. Vasky, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 98; <em>State v. Gonzalez, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 475. See also <em>R.P.C. </em>3.5(c) and 8.4(a) and (d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The conduct displayed by DeMarco here was hardly within the bounds of appropriate vigorous representation of a client expected of a lawyer in the presentation of a matter or trial of a case. See <em>In re Vincenti, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>591, 602 (1983); <em>In re Mezzacca, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>387, 389-390 (1975). As stated in <em>In re Vincenti, \u201c </em>\u2018[a]n attorney who exhibits the lack of civility, good manners and common courtesy here displayed tarnishes the entire image of what the bar stands for.\u2019 \u201d 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 601 (quoting <em>In re McAlevy, supra, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>at 352). For instance, in the incident of December 15, at the pre-trial motion the judge obviously was trying to stop an argument between the prosecutor and DeMarco. The judge had requested the attorneys to conduct themselves properly and avoid strong language in referring to their adversaries. DeMarco was not satisfied with this and proceeded to charge the judge with being unfair and even characterized his adversary\u2019s statement to him as \u201cmore contemptuous\u201d than his own statement to the judge. Even if another attorney made such a statement directed to the court (it was not directed at the court here) that does not excuse DeMarco\u2019s earlier remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The judge\u2019s integrity was also unfairly attacked by DeMarco at the February 25,1987 court proceeding. Apparently DeMarco was displeased with the fact that the court had not ruled along the lines that he requested. We have quoted earlier in this opinion the language used by counsel. But an adverse ruling is never cause for such conduct or statements by counsel, either directed at the court or to opposing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Nor is such conduct justified either by belief of the contemnor that the judge\u2019s rulings or comments are provocative, or as a reaction to an asserted erroneous ruling. <em>In re Contempt of Carton, supra, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>at 18-19. As the Supreme Court commented in <em>In re Vincenti, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 603, \u201c[rjespect for and confidence in the judicial office are essential to the maintenance of any orderly system of justice.\u201d Our courts have determined that any act in opposition to or which tends to lessen or bring into disrepute the court\u2019s authority or dignity is punishable by contempt. <em>State v. Gonzalez, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 475. Disruptive conduct is punishable by contempt proceedings. Such actions as committed here by DeMarco, viewed objectively in the context of the proceedings were indeed contumacious. <em>In re Vincenti, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 600-601.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">We reject as meritless DeMarco\u2019s attempt to justify his rude attack on the trial judge as a reasonable reaction to statements by either the judge or the attorney who was representing the State. The remarks were obviously addressed to the judge. They demonstrated DeMarco\u2019s persistent pattern of disrespectful, insulting behavior which constituted neither appropriate advocacy nor heat-of-trial remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The judge below acted with restraint and in an effort to preserve order. He was restrained in his actions and used his summary contempt power as a last resort, after repeated warnings which were ignored. See <em>Com. of Pa. v. Local Union 542, Intern\u2019l Union of Oper. Engrs., </em>552 F.2d 498, 514 (3d Cir.1977), <em>cert. </em>den. 434 <em>U.S. </em>822, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>67, 54 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>79 (1977). We find, in the exercise of our <em>de novo </em>jurisdiction that the attorney\u2019s actions impacted adversely on the authority of the court and constituted contempt. See <em>In re Yengo, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Accordingly, the judgments of conviction are affirmed. The stays are vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-22\">The significance of the reference to \"crowd\u201d is uncertain.
