Laurel. The defendant was convicted of these two violations of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50 (DWI) in the Mt. Laurel Municipal Court on February 3, 1987. On his appeal <em>de novo </em>on the record, <em>R. </em>3:23-8, the Law Division judge found him not guilty of the second offense. The State now appeals and the defendant contends that the appeal must be dismissed because the judgment of the Law Division operated as an acquittal of the second offense. Although the Law Division judge erroneously acquitted the defendant of the second offense, we agree that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars this appeal which seeks in effect to reinstate the second conviction after an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">On the morning of September 28, 1986 at about 3:30 a.m. Patrolman Zelby of the Mount Laurel Township Police Department arrested defendant for driving while under the influence of alcohol and took him to the station house. At about 4:15 a.m. Corporal Shepard administered two blood alcohol tests which produced readings of .23. The police told defendant to have someone come and pick him up at the station. They returned his car keys and identification to him. Instead of taking defendant home, his friend drove defendant back to his parked truck which he drove away. While on his way home to Mount Holly, defendant was stopped again at about 5:15 a.m., this time by Patrolman Plunkett of the Mount Laurel police, for driving while under the influence of alcohol in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50. He was again taken to the police station where Corporal Shepard again administered two breathalyzer tests. These tests produced readings of .21 and defendant was charged a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">As noted, the Municipal Court judge convicted defendant of both offenses. The Law Division judge on the appeal <em>de novo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>on the record found that the second offense was \u201cpart of the same offense\u201d and acquitted defendant of the second offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">At the plenary trial <em>de novo </em>on the record established in the Municipal Court, <em>R. </em>3:23-8, the Law Division judge made these findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">I find him guilty on Ticket 35853, driving at 3:30 a.m. On Ticket 3641, driving at 5:13 a.m., I find him not guilty. That is part of the same offense, even though he was at the station and went out. Because if he was \u2014 the proof of the first is the disproof of the second, actually. Because if he was so drunk that he was fumbling, that he couldn\u2019t get to the letter J in the alphabet, that he got out of the vehicle and swayed and staggered, that he couldn\u2019t walk heel to toe, that he almost fell, that he had a .23 blood alcohol at 4:19 a.m. when the test was given, he was too drunk to know that he shouldn\u2019t be driving. And they shouldn\u2019t have given him his keys and his ID to put him in a position where he could then go out and do it. He should have been kept from driving. And having been permitted to drive in that way, it relates back to the first offense. And I express no opinion as to what the liabilities would have been if he had been released as a drunk and killed someone. He shouldn\u2019t have been let out with his own keys at that point because he didn\u2019t know what he was doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">Therefore, as I said, I find him guilty of the offense that took place at 3:30 a.m. and not guilty of the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The judge then signed a \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d which stated in pertinent part</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">The defendant having appealed a conviction entered by the Municipal Court of the TOWNSHIP of MT. LAUREL on FEBRUARY 3, 1987, and this Court having conducted a plenary trial de novo on the record, and this court having rendered a judgment of guilty on the charge of violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50 DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">It is on this 9th day of June, 1987, ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the defendant be and is sentenced MOTION BY MS. NANCY GRAHAM, ESQ., DEFENSE ATTY. TREAT THE TWO MOTOR VEHICLES SUMMONS AS ONE OFFENSE \u2014 GRANTED. COURT FINDS DEFENDANT \"GUILTY\u201d OF TICKET #3583 AND \u201cNOT GUILTY\u201d OF TICKET #3641.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">This acquittal was erroneous and contrary to binding precedent. <em>State v. Metcalf, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46 (App.Div.1979), is indistinguishable. In <em>Metcalf </em>defendant was charged while driving under the influence of alcohol twice in the same night. On that appeal defendant also contended that he was guilty on a single offense because his inebriation was a single event. We rejected that argument and said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Defendant engaged in two driving incidents; one prior to the time he was arrested in Franklin Township, the other after his release for the first charge, for driving in Bridgewater Township. Had defendant\u2019s journey not been interrupted, he probably could not have been guilty of more than one offense, notwithstanding passing through more than one municipality. The interruption of the journey by the first arrest prevents the driving of the vehicle from being regarded legally as a single unitary offense, [Id. at 48, citations omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Our Supreme Court has \u201cconsistently applied double jeopardy principles which accord with the federal constitution because its language is broader than our own state constitution\u2019s double jeopardy clause.\u201d <em>State v. Barnes, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>362, 370 (1980). The two clauses are therefore effectively \u201ccoextensive in principle and scope.\u201d <em>State v. Farmer, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>145, 168 (1966) , <em>cert. </em>den. 386 <em>U.S. </em>991, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1305, 18 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>335 (1967) ; <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>784, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>2056, 23 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 707 (1969). Under our Rules of Appellate Practice the State may only appeal \u201ca judgment of the trial court dismissing an indictment, accusation or complaint, where not precluded by the constitution of the United States or of New Jersey.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:3-l(b); <em>Pressler, Current N.J. Court Rules </em>Comment <em>R. </em>2:3-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">We conclude that both State and Federal authorities go against the State\u2019s claim that the Municipal Court\u2019s judgment of guilty for the second offense should be reinstated by this court. In <em>State v. McKelvey, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>259 (App.Div. 1976), defendant was convicted in the municipal court of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor on a restricted service road at the Newark Airport. After a <em>de novo </em>trial on the record on appeal to the former County Court, defendant prevailed. The County Court entered a judgment of acquittal on the ground that defendant had not been operating the vehicle on a public road. We concluded \u201cthat the State\u2019s appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260. We stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">Here the judgment of acquittal was on the merits after a trial and [the appeal] is not appropriate. Contrary to the State\u2019s contention, the court\u2019s action was not based on a procedural ground or one that can be equated with such a ground. The fact that the acquittal was granted for a legal reason, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>on the basis of a factual determination, does not alter the result. This is so whether or not the trial judge may have erred in his ruling. <em>[Id. </em>at 261],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\"><em>See also Newark v. Pulverman, </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>105 (1953); <em>Paramus v. Martin Paint, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>138 (App.Div.1974). We held in <em>State v. Gadson, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 464 (App.Div.1977), that a technically illegal verdict \u201cdoes not give rise to the right of the State to appeal; this because, as a general rule, legal errors which result in an acquittal do not remove the bar to the State\u2019s right to appeal that acquittal.\u201d <em>See Fong Foo v. United States, </em>369 <em>U.S. </em>141, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>671, 7 L.Ed.2d 629 (1962) (a verdict of acquittal, though erroneous legally, is final and could not be reviewed).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>82, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2187, 57 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 65 (1978) (dismissal for speedy trial violation not an acquittal), Chief Justice Rehnquist observed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">[T]he fact that \u201cthe acquittal may result from erroneous evidentiary rulings or erroneous interpretations of governing legal principles,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>affects the accuracy of that determination, but it does not alter its essential character. By contrast, the dismissal of an indictment for preindictment delay represents a legal judgment that a defendant, although criminally culpable, may not be punished because of a supposed constitutional violation. <em>[Id. </em>at 98, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2197],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">In <em>Sanabria v. United States, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>54, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2170, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>43 (1978), decided the same day as <em>Scott, </em>Justice Marshall observed that the principle of the bar of prosecution by an acquittal was so fundamental to double jeopardy jurisprudence that \u201cthis rule is manifested by its explicit extension to situations where an acquittal is based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2178. We reject the State\u2019s contention that the Law Division judge\u2019s verdict of acquittal was simply a termination of the proceedings below on legal grounds unrelated to the merits, and thus appealable. The Law Division judge found defendant \u201cnot guilty\u201d after the matter was submitted to him on the merits and two days later signed a judgment of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d As Justice Marshall said in <em>Sanabria, </em>\u201c[wjhile form is not to be exalted over substance in determining the double jeopardy consequences of a ruling terminating a prosecution, [citations omitted], neither is it appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>priate entirely to ignore the form of order entered by the trial court.\u201d 437 <em>U.S. </em>at 66, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2180. The order in <em>Sanabria </em>declared the defendant \u201cacquitted\u201d after a motion to strike key evidence was erroneously decided in his favor. \u201cThe judgment of acquittal, however erroneous, bars further prosecution on any aspect of the count and hence bars appellate review of the trial court\u2019s error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2181.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
