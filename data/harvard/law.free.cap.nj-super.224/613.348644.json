(Prospect) in September 1982. Prospect is a subsidiary of defendant, Prospect Purchasing Corporation. The other corporate defendants are subsidiaries of Prospect. All corporate defendants are wholly owned by defendant, Nathan Milikowsky and his brother Daniel Milikowsky. Plaintiff was also a member of Prospect\u2019s Board of Directors. He was fired in February 1984. Plaintiff testified that he was told that the company could not afford his salary. David Milikowsky testified that he and Nathan were unhappy with plaintiff\u2019s performance and that the company needed to cut overhead.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">Plaintiff commenced this action seeking damages for wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>ful discharge under a variety of legal theories.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only theory of recovery before us is based on <em>Woolley v. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>284 (1985), mod., 101 <em>N.J. </em>10 (1985). The trial judge ruled against plaintiff and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In <em>Woolley, </em>the Court held that \u201can implied promise contained in an employment manual that an employee will be fired only for cause may be enforceable against an employer even when the employment is for an indefinite term and would otherwise be terminable at will.\u201d <em>Id., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 285-286. Plaintiff contends that four memoranda <em>written by him </em>in 1982 and 1983, constitute an employment manual and contain an implied promise that no employee, including the president of the corporation, will be fired without cause. We find it unnecessary to address the applicability of <em>Woolley </em>to a corporate president<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because in our view the memoranda relied upon by plaintiff do not include an implied promise that employees will be fired only for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The first memorandum, dated October 1, 1982, is not relevant. It is limited to plaintiffs establishment of a management committee on labor relations and identifies the committee members.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The third memorandum, dated November 3, 1982, was addressed to non-union employees and was limited to the subject of employee benefits. It addressed holidays, vacations, sick days, salary reviews, incentive bonus and group health and life benefits. The fourth memorandum, dated December 13, 1983, was addressed to all department heads regarding \u201c1982 PERSONNEL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS.\u201d It announced that the corporation had developed a performance appraisal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>procedure which would serve \u201cas the basis for determining employee compensation increases each year.\u201d We fail to perceive in those three memoranda, considered individually or as a group, any implied promise not to terminate employment without cause. <em>See Ware v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Plaintiff relies primarily on the second memorandum titled Company Rules. It bears the legend \u201cEffective 11/1/82,\u201d and is reproduced as an appendix to this opinion. These rules are clearly an attempt to define employee actions which will constitute industrial offenses in the eyes of Prospect and to give notice to employees of the elements of those offenses and the consequences to an employee if he engages in prohibited action. The rules provide no basis for an implied promise not to terminate without cause. <em>Cf. Ware, supra, </em>at 145-146.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In <em>Woolley, </em>that part of the manual relied upon by the Supreme Court was titled \u201cTermination\u201d and contained six numbered sections dealing with termination. The <em>Woolley </em>manual in section III defined \u201cthe types of termination\u201d as layoff, discharge due to performance, discharge disciplinary, retirement and resignation. Therefore, the manual in <em>Woolley </em>supported the conclusion that it was intended to be a <em>comprehensive </em>treatment of the subject of employment termination. In the present case, plaintiff\u2019s memoranda do not purport to cover comprehensively the subject of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Moreover, Section II of the <em>Woolley </em>manual declared the policy of Hoffman-La Roche to be \u201cto retain to the extent consistent with company requirements, the services of all employees who perform their duties efficiently and effectively.\u201d There is no similar undertaking or expression of policy in the Prospect memoranda.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">COMPANY RULES</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">PROSPECT INDUSTRIES CORP.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Effective 11/1/82</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">The following company rules and work policies are developed to</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">ensure the <em>safety, dignity </em>and <em>productivity </em>of every employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">VIOLATIONS OF COMPANY RULES WILL RESULT IN DISCIPLINARY ACTION.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-12\">1st violation will result in a verbal warning to be noted in the employee\u2019s personnel file. <em>First violation of rules marked with an asterisk (*) will result in immediate termination.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-13\">2nd violation will result in a written warning to be included in the employee\u2019s personnel file for the period of eighteen months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-14\">3rd violation will result in a disciplinary layoff for one to five days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-15\">4th violation within any 18 month period will result in discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-16\">Disciplinary action will result from the commission of any of</p>\n<p id=\"b649-17\">the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-18\">*1.
