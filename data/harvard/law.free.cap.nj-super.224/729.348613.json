THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING DEFENDANT STATE OF NEW JERSEY IMMUNE UNDER THE LICENSING PROVISION OF THE TORT CLAIMS ACT SINCE THE STATE\u2019S NEGLIGENCE DID NOT INVOLVE THE ISSUANCE, DENIAL, SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF A LICENSE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Payne urges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-10\">SUMMARY JUDGMENT WAS IMPROPERLY GRANTED, SINCE CO-DEFENDANTS MAY BE VICARIOUSLY LIABLE UNDER <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">When the fire occurred, it appears that Payne had received a state license to operate as a rooming and boarding house, although there was a bureaucratic nightmare of failures to coordinate inspections which disclosed numerous municipal and state violations. For the purposes of the summary judgment motion, it can be assumed that both the City and the State had performed inadequate or incompetent inspections and that the continued operation of a rooming and boarding house with an excessive number of people in occupancy, as well as other municipal and state violations existed at the time of the fire. It was not disputed that the fire was attributed to a pan of unattended cooking oil in the room of one of the tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">The thrust of the allegations against the governmental entities (no individual governmental employees were joined) was as follows: (1) that the regulatory control exercised over Payne\u2019s property should result in its being regarded as publicly \u201ccontrolled\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:4-2 so as to subject the public entities to liability for their awareness and failure to correct dangerous and hazardous conditions; (2) liability arising out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>failures in enforcement of ordinances, regulations or statutes applicable to the premises as occupied and operated; (3) negligence in licensing procedures; (4) negligence arising directly or indirectly from improper inspection and coordination of inspection results \u201coutside the scope thereof\u201d; (5) breach of good faith obligations under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-1 <em>et seq., </em>and (6) breach of duties said to arise from the asserted placement of welfare recipients into the nonconforming and defective building. (Some residents received welfare from the City of Elizabeth, although plaintiff Garry received only county welfare.)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The burden in this case was upon the public entities to plead and prove their immunity under the Tort Claims Act <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 <em>et seq.). </em>To succeed on the motion it was necessary that the trial judge have proof of a nature and character which would exclude any genuine dispute of fact. Once a moving party has met that burden, it is recognized that summary judgment is not only warranted but desirable. <em>See Kolitch v. Lindedahl, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>485, 497 (1985); <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">We have carefully reviewed the record that was submitted to us with the several appeals. We have also considered carefully the briefs and oral arguments of counsel, and we are satisfied that, in light of applicable law, the arguments made by appellant are clearly without merit, and that the summary judgments in favor of the State and the City of Elizabeth should be affirmed, substantially for the reasons expressed by the trial judge during oral determinations made on February 27, 1987 and July 2, 1987. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Additionally, we note our agreement with the analysis in <em>Kenney v. Scientific, Inc., </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228, 238 (Law Div. 1985), that \u201cgovernment regulation does not convert private property into public property ...\u201d <em>See also Brothers v. Highlands, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>146 (App.Div.1981) and <em>Danow v. Penn Central Transp. Co., </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>597 (Law Div.1977). We are aware of the speculation of the trial judge in <em>Bosch v. Hain, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>204 (Law Div.1982) on this issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold, however, that to extend the concept of control beyond possessory control for purposes of government liability would substantially vitiate the protections afforded to governmental entities under the act, and particularly so with respect to licensing, inspection and enforcement functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">As the Supreme Court has observed, the Tort Claims Act was intended to ensure that any immunity provisions provided in the act or by common law will prevail over the liability provisions. <em>See, e.g., Malloy v. State, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>515, 519 (1978); <em>see also </em>concurring opinion of Justice O\u2019Hern in <em>Kolitch v. Lindedahl, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 498. \u201cImmunity is the dominant consideration of the act.\u201d <em>Birchwood Lakes Colony Club v. Medford Lakes, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>582, 596 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">We agree with the trial judge that the distinction between ministerial or discretionary acts does not enter into the picture when dealing with alleged liability arising out of failure to enforce laws, failure to make or properly carry out inspections, or improper licensing or failures to license. <em>See Malloy v. State, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>515, 520 (1978); <em>Kenney v. Scientific, Inc., </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228, 237 (Law Div.1985); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-4, 5, 6; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-5, 6, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">We add that we see no issue of \u201cgood faith\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-3 comprehended by the facts disclosed in the record before the court. Compare discussion in <em>Marley v. Palmyra Boro., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>271, 292 (Law Div.1983). It has been recognized that regulatory activities which are engaged in for the benefit of the public generally would be discouraged by imposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>tion of civil tort liability, and that this is not in the public interest. <em>See, e.g., National Spring Co. v. Pierpont Assoc., </em>146 <em>N.J.Super. </em>63, 68-69 (Law Div.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The assertion that the record discloses negligence \u201cduring the course of, but outside the scope of any inspections <em>...\u201d </em>so as to come within the exception conferred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-6 is specious. As observed in <em>National Spring Co. v. Pierpont, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 69, this language of the statute refers to negligent acts which have nothing to dp with the inspection but create harm, <em>e.g., </em>negligently leaving open a door or grating.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">As to the contention that liability of the City of Elizabeth arises in a non-immunized context by reason of its asserted placement of welfare recipients into the building and paying their rent <em>(cf. </em>dissent in <em>Doe v. Youth &amp; Family Services Division, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499, 507-508 (App.Div.1981) rev\u2019d on dissent, 89 <em>N.J. </em>284 (1982)), we have perused carefully the record, and note that it discloses, without contradiction, that the welfare department of the City of Elizabeth was paying Payne for certain welfare boarders (not plaintiff Garry) but that no welfare recipients were placed or compelled to live in the premises. Thus, even assuming liability for negligent placement, there was nothing to contradict the sworn denial that anyone was placed there by the Elizabeth Welfare Authority. The prosecutor\u2019s report does not refute this. Moreover, the essence of the alleged duty arising from improper placement is bottomed in the underlying failure to inspect before placement. Thus, the statutory immunity provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-6 <em>et seq. </em>would predominate, in any event. <em>Malloy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Finally, although not integral to our analysis, we cannot fail to note that situations abound in which conscientious advocates have actually sought to prevent strict enforcement of state and municipal codes which are sometimes perceived as operating to aggravate the growing problem of homelessness. We are convinced that the Legislature did not intend that the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>should compound such societal dilemmas by affording to Title 59 an interpretation which offers the possibility of imposing tort liability on a dammed-if-you-do dammed-if-you-don\u2019t basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b767-9\">The following language appears in <em>Bosch, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 210:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-10\">In light of this extensive regulatory control a persuasive argument can be mounted to label the property in question as \u2018public,\u2019 sufficient to bring into play chapter 4 of the act. There is an equally substantial argument advanced by the State that such concept of regulatory control must be coupled with an interest in the real estate. It is unnecessary for the court to resolve this difficult question since it has reached the conclusion that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-6 is not applicable under the facts presented.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
