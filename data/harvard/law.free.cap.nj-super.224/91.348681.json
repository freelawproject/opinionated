Defendants raised a number of defenses including claims that the ordinance is unconstitutional and that, in any event, their use of the house was not precluded by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The trial judge, Judge Miller, upheld the validity of the ordinance but determined that defendants\u2019 tenants (ten unrelated college students) qualified as a \u201cfamily\u201d within the definition of the ordinance. By way of appeal and cross appeal, plaintiff challenges the latter determination and defendant the former. We have carefully reviewed this record. We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Miller in his opinion which is reported at 219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64 (Ch.Div.1987).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
