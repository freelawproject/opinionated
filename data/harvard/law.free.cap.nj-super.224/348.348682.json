Phillips. Brenda\u2019s father pulled her from the car, and carried her into the house and called the local first aid squad. Brenda\u2019s parents and their other children watched helplessly as the first aid squad\u2019s revival attempt failed. They filed claims for wrongful death, survivorship and emotional distress against the estate of Phillips. Phillips\u2019 liability insurance carrier, defendant State Farm Insurance Co. (State Farm), disclaimed maximum coverage on the $25,000-per-injury/$50,000-pei&gt;-accident liability policy. Plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action against State Farm seeking a declaration that more than one person suffered bodily injury as a result of Brenda\u2019s death, and seek<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ing to require State Farm to pay on.behalf of Phillip\u2019s estate the policy limit of $50,000 per accident, rather than the policy limit of $25,000 per injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following cross-motions for summary judgment, the judge granted plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion and denied that of defendant. Defendant appeals from the ensuing June 5,1987 order, contending as it did before the Law Division that the individual family members\u2019 claims for emotional distress are derived entirely from Brenda Haines\u2019s one bodily injury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">State Farm\u2019s claim that there was one injury, Brenda\u2019s death, equates the claim of Brenda\u2019s family with the <em>per quod </em>claim of a spouse, which would undeniably be included within State Farm\u2019s $25,000-per-injury limit for Brenda\u2019s death. <em>See Williams v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., </em>99 <em>N.J.Super. </em>377, 379 (Law Div.1968), aff'd 104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>403 (App.Div. 1969), aff\u2019d 54 <em>N.J. </em>580 (1969). <em>Accord: Travelers Indem. Co. v. Comelsen, </em>272 <em>Md. </em>48, 321 A.2d 149 (1974); <em>Graham v. American Casualty Co. of Reading, Pa., </em>261 <em>La. </em>85, 259 (So.2d 22 (1972); <em>United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n. v. Warner, </em>64 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>957, 135 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>34 (Cal.App.1976); <em>Skroh v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>227 (So.2d 328 (Fla.App.1969). The stated rationale for this limitation is that a <em>per quod </em>claim is one for consequential damage flowing from the injuries to another, rather than damage for direct injury. <em>See </em>Annotation, \u201cConstruction and Application of Provision in Liability Policy Limiting Amount of Insurer\u2019s Liability to One Person,\u201d 13 <em>A.L.R.3d </em>1228, 1234 (1967). The question posed by this appeal is whether plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action for the negligent infliction of emotional distress is analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>An action <em>per quod </em>is of ancient origin. A husband originally sought damages for the loss of his wife\u2019s society, companionship and services due to the fault of another. <em>Ekalo v. Constructive Serv. Corp. of America, </em>46 <em>N.J. 82, </em>84 (1965). That doctrine has been expanded over the years, not only for married claimants, <em>id. </em>at 95, but also for parents, concerning the loss of services of a child. <em>Orr v. Orr, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>236, 239-240 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Plaintiffs assert that the law of consortium is inapposite because, under <em>Portee v. Jaffee, </em>84 <em>N.J. 88 </em>(1980), emotional distress claims are not derivative, but separate and independent actions. Defendant argues that plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action can be both derivative and independent, relying upon <em>Tornquist v. Perkowski, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 96-97 (Law Div.1984), and <em>Orr v. Orr, supra, </em>where our Supreme Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">[W]hile ordinarily the facts establishing initial liability of the defendant to the child must be proved in a parent\u2019s cause of action for consequential damages, application of the term \u2018derivative\u2019 to such a cause of action does not thereby transform what is basically a separate cause of action into one which is dependent upon the continued existence of another. [36 <em>N.J. </em>at 239],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\"><em>See Ekalo v. Constructive Service Corp. of America, supra, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>at 90 (1965); <em>Neely v. Kossove, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>503, 505 (Law Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">We reject defendant\u2019s reasoning. We have addressed the difficulty in reconciling the derivative yet separate nature of a <em>per quod </em>claim by stating that such a claim is separate only in the sense that it is a separate element of a damage claim. <em>Tichenor v. Santillo, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>165, 175 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">In <em>Goncalvez v. Patuto, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620 (App.Div.1983), we held that a claim for emotional distress is significantly different from a <em>per quod </em>claim. There a release of a wrongful death claim, survival claim and a <em>per quod </em>claim by parents did not bar decedent\u2019s brother\u2019s claim for emotional distress. We said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">Even more significant is the fact that Rui\u2019s emotional injury claim constitutes his own independent cause of action. <em>Unlike all the claims made in the first action resulting from Mario\u2019s injury and death, Rui\u2019s emotional injury claim is not derivative therefrom in any practical or technical sense. </em>Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>status is precisely the same as if he had sustained his own physical injury in the bicycle-automobile accident but no suit on his behalf was simultaneously instituted. <em>[Id. </em>at 628. (emphasis added)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The distinction is also made clear in <em>Portee v. Jaffee, supra. </em>\u201cWhile any harm to a spouse or a family member causes sorrow, we are here concerned with a more narrowly confined interest in mental and emotional stability. When confronted with accidental death, \u2018the reaction to be expected of normal persons,\u2019 ... is shock and fright.\u201d 84 <em>N.J. </em>at 100. It is the \u201csensory perception of a shocking event\u201d which causes a separate, compensable injury. <em>Acevedo v. Essex County, </em>207 <em>N.J. Super. </em>579, 585 (Law Div.1985). In a <em>Portee </em>claim, it is the plaintiff\u2019s perception which causes the perceiver to \u201csuffer a traumatic sense of loss.\u201d <em>Portee, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 99. Such emotional distress is not the equivalent of grief from losing a loved one, but is inflicted by the trauma of seeing a loved one suffer or die or of seeing efforts to revive her being unsuccessful. <em>Eyrich for Eyrich v. Dam, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 258-259 (App.Div.1984), certif. den. 97 <em>N.J. </em>583 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Defendant also urges that emotional distress is not a \u201cbodily injury\u201d and therefore is not an injury covered by a policy which limits coverage to \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Phillips\u2019 policy defined \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury to a person and sickness, disease or death which results from it.\u201d Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, this definition, which defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury,\u201d is anything but clear and should therefore be construed against defendant. <em>See Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336 (1985); <em>Hoboken Camera Center, Inc. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>484 (App.Div.1967); 13 <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, </em>sec. 7401 at 197 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In <em>NPS Corp. v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 551 (App.Div.1986), we held that the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d in an employer\u2019s liability policy encompassed claims for emotional distress resulting from the unauthorized offensive touching of an employee\u2019s person. There we noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>that the policy (as in this case) did not expressly limit bodily injury to physical harm. Viewing the terms from \u201cthe general expectations of the average purchaser in the light of the contract language,\u201d <em>Linden Motor Freight Co., Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>511, 525 (1963); <em>see Ellmex Const. Co., Inc. v. Republic Ins. Co., </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>195, 204-205 (App.Div.1985); <em>Great American Ins. v. Lerman Motors, Inc., </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>319, 326 (App.Div.1984), we reject defendant\u2019s urging that we construe the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d narrowly in the light of the alternate, broader term, \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d Defendant\u2019s reliance upon <em>Williams dicta, </em>99 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 380, concerning policy language is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Defendant\u2019s reliance upon <em>Skroh v. Travelers Insurance Company, supra, </em>227 So.2d 328 (Fla.App.1969) and <em>United Pacific Insurance Co. v. Edgecomb, </em>41 <em>Wash.App. </em>741, 706 P.2d 233 (Wash.App.1985) is also misplaced. While in both cases plaintiffs were unable to recover beyond the policy monetary limits for one injury, in neither case was a <em>Portee </em>claim involved. In <em>Skroh, </em>plaintiff father claimed damages for pain and suffering stemming from the loss of his son and not for his own injury, 227 So.2d at 330. In <em>Edgecomb, </em>the court stated that the father\u2019s claim was derivative from his son\u2019s injuries particularly because he did not witness the accident, 706 <em>P.</em>2d at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Plaintiffs rely upon and defendants attempt to distinguish <em>Employers Casualty Insurance Co. v. Foust, </em>29 <em>Cal.App.</em>3d 382, 105 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>505 (1972). While that case resolved the identical policy construction question in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, defendant asserts that the court there found that the emotional distress was accompanied by physical injury and that this construction was determinative. <em>Id. </em>105 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 508. We need not decide whether, as plaintiffs argue, the California courts require physical harm merely as a matter of proof of emotional distress <em>(see Dillon v. Legg, </em>68 <em>Cal.2d </em>728, 69 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>72, 441 P.2d 912 (1968); <em>but see Molien v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., </em>27 <em>Cal.3d </em>916, 167 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>831, 616 P.2d 813 (1980), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>cited in <em>Strachan v. John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>523 (March 16, 1988) (slip opinion at 19)) or, as defendant contends, California\u2019s emotional distress law requires evidence of physical harm. We are persuaded that, in New Jersey, a cause for emotional distress is a separate action, not a derivative claim, and that plaintiffs\u2019 insurance contract construction must prevail. <em>Goncalvez v. Patuto, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 628. Moreover, the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d encompasses a claim for emotional distress. <em>NPS Corp. v. Insurance Co. of North America, supra, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Plaintiffs were thus entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. <em>R. </em>4:46-1; <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67, 74-75 (1954); <em>Milacci v. Mato Realty Co., Inc., </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>297, 300-301 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We accordingly affirm the June 5, 1987 order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The limits of liability in Phillips\u2019 policy were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">The amount of bodily injury liability coverage is shown on the declarations page under 'Limits of Liability \u2014 Coverage A \u2014 Bodily Injury, Each Person, Each Accident.\u2019 Under \u2018Each Person\u2019 is the amount of coverage for all damages due to <em>bodily injury </em>to one <em>person </em>[$25,000]. Under 'Each Accident\u2019 is the total amount of coverage for all damages due to <em>bodily injury </em>to two or more <em>persons </em>in the same accident [$50,000].</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
