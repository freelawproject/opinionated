Plaintiff appealed and the ex-wife and one charity cross-appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The threshold issue in this case is the law to be applied in determining whether, and to what extent, a testator\u2019s will has been revoked by his divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Testator was married in March 1968 in Washington, while domiciled in that state. In May 1968 he executed a will, providing, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">\"THIRD: If my beloved wife, Gwendolyn Minta King, survives me, I direct the following disposition of my estate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">\"1. I devise and bequeath all of the estate and effects whatsoever and wheresoever, both real and personal, to which I may be entitled * * * unto my beloved wife, Gwendolyn Minta King, absolutely * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">\u00ab * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-11\">\"FOURTH: In the event that my said wife shall not survive me, then * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-12\">\"1. * * * one half * * * to the Unity School of Christianity of Tacoma, Washington for its use in the Tacoma area for general charitable purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-13\">\"2. I devise and bequeath the remaining one half * * * to the Reece Christian Church of Reece, Kansas for general charitable purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">In June 1968 the parties signed a property agreement for divorce, and in October 1968 a decree of divorce was entered. Testator moved to Oregon in 1974. He died in this state on February 4, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">The parties do not dispute that testator was domiciled in Oregon at his death, but are in disagreement over the effect of that fact with reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>choice of law to determine the effect of his divorce upon his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\">The relevant Washington statute, RCW 11.12.050,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">\"* * * A divorce, subsequent to the making of a will, shall revoke the will as to the divorced spouse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Oregon has had two different statutes on the matter during the relevant period. From 1965 to 1970 ORS 114.130 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">\"A will made by any person is deemed revoked by his or her subsequent * * * divorce, * * * unless the will expressly declares the intention of the testator that the will shall not be revoked by such action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">ORS 114.130 was repealed as of July 1, 1970, and replaced by ORS 112.315:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">\"Unless a will evidences a different intent of the testator, the divorce or annulment of the marriage of the testator after the execution of the will revokes all provisions in the will in favor of the former spouse of the testator and any provision therein naming the former spouse as executor, and the effect of the will is the same as though the former spouse did not survive the testator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">In <em>Butte v. Crohn, </em>8 Or App 284, 494 P2d 258 (1972),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we held that the above provision of the new probate code is not retroactive; in other words, divorces prior to July 1, 1970, effect total revocation even though the testator does not die until after the new probate code became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Plaintiff urges us to apply the general rule that the law of the domicile at the date of death applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>revocation by operation of law;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> hence <em>Butte </em>applies and requires that testator be found intestate. Testator\u2019s ex-wife argues that there is no law to apply; hence we should hold that the will has not been revoked. Her theory is that Oregon law applies because Oregon is the domicile at date of testator\u2019s death, but <em>Butte </em>cannot apply because testator was a foreign domiciliary at the time of the divorce, and <em>Butte </em>cannot mandate an <em>eo instante </em>revocation of a will based upon a divorce in a foreign jurisdiction. She argues that Washington law cannot apply because it deems revocation ambulatory,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and testator was not a Washington domiciliary at the date of his death. We cannot agree with either of these parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\">In following the general rule of applying the law of decedent\u2019s domicile at date of death, case law as well as statutes may be applicable. Here, however, there is no case law directly in point. <em>Butte </em>concerned a testator who was domiciled in Oregon both at date of divorce and date of death. <em>Butte </em>does not apply to this readily distinguishable situation, for it makes little sense to hold that <em>eo instante </em>revocation of a will by divorce applies to testator\u2019s divorce beyond Oregon\u2019s borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"> Therefore, in cases such as this, where a testator domiciled elsewhere at the time of his divorce is an Oregon domiciliary at the date of death, and the laws relating to revocation by divorce do not change during the period he was domiciled in Oregon, the law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>effect during the period he was domiciled in this state, even though different from that in effect when he was divorced, applies to determine whether and to what extent his will was revoked by reason of his divorce. Hence, ORS 112.315 applies; testator\u2019s will was revoked as to his wife, and read as if she had not survived him.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\">Several issues remain to be resolved regarding the charities and the gifts over.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Reece Christian Church (Reece) filed an answer denying allegations in plaintiff\u2019s complaint that it did not have capacity to take under the will. However, the church\u2019s Kansas attorney then notified its Oregon attorney that it would not proceed further with the case because of religious scruples against litigation. Its attorney then moved for and was granted permission to withdraw from representation. Unity Center, the other charity, moved for a default judgment against Reece. The motion was denied. The statute governing default judgments, ORS 18.080, provides that default judgments \"may be had upon failure to answer.\u201d ORS 18.080(1). There was here no failure to answer. The motion was properly denied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"> Plaintiff challenges the bequest to Unity Center on the ground that there is no entity with the name mentioned in testator\u2019s will. Testator named as co-contingent beneficiary \"the Unity School of Christianity of Tacoma, Washington for its use in the Tacoma area for general charitable purposes.\u201d Plaintiff concedes that there exists a church named the Unity Center of Tacoma which is affiliated with Unity School of Christianity of Unity Village, Missouri. There is no claim of an ambiguity, for only one entity, the Unity Center, claims to be the entity named in the will. Furthermore, there is evidence that decedent\u2019s wife had taken classes at Unity Center and that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>drawing up their wills, testator and his wife decided to divide the gifts between a church with which she had been involved, Unity Center, and one with which he had been involved, Reece. There is no need to determine whether Oregon\u2019s or Washington\u2019s law should be applied to determine whether the misnomer is fatal to the gift to Unity. Both states uphold gifts when the identity of the beneficiary is readily ascertainable, although the testator made a slight error in the name of the beneficiary. <em>Hansen v. Oregon Humane Soc., </em>142 Or 104, 18 P2d 1036 (1933); <em>In re France\u2019s Estate, </em>64 Wash 2d 703, 393 P2d 940 (1964).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Sufficient verification is evident here.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"> Plaintiff contends that even if we find the misnomer nonfatal, the gift to Unity <em>School </em>must fail because Unity <em>Center </em>is a church, and thus changing the purpose of a bequest is beyond a court\u2019s powers under the doctrine of <em>cy pres. </em>That doctrine allows a court to modify the original terms of a gift to a charity where the gift is not effective according to its original tenor and the testator evinced either a general charitable intent or an intent to aid a certain type of charity. <em>See, Good Samaritan Hosp. v. U. S. Nat., </em>246 Or 478, 425 P2d 541 (1967); <em>Townsend v. Schalkenbach etc., </em>33 Wash 2d 255, 205 P2d 345 (1949). Plaintiffs argument is not well taken. First of all, as noted above, testator sought to benefit a certain religious entity, of whose name he was uncertain, where his then wife had taken a class. Second, he gave the gift to be used for general charitable purposes. There is no need to use the <em>cypres </em>doctrine where the gift is to be used for general charitable purposes, as the testator intended, by the entity he thought he was naming correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Finally, both plaintiff and Unity Center contend that Reece cannot take because Reece did not have corporate status at the time of decedent\u2019s death. However, that is not a bar to taking under a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The general rule is that the law of the domicile of the beneficiary determines whether the beneficiary has capacity to take a bequest of personalty. 6 BoweParker, Page on Wills (1962), \u00a7 60.15 at 471. Kansas will not invalidate a gift to a church merely because a testator neglects to appoint a trustee, or because the church is unincorporated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Barnhart v. Bowers, </em>143 Kan 866, 57 P2d 60 (1936), a testatrix bequeathed the residue of her estate to a named church \"to be invested and reinvested among the members of said church, and the income derived therefrom to be used for the benefit of said Church.\u201d The court found that the testatrix sought to create a trust for the benefit of the church, and named the church as trustee. However, the church, at the time of testatrix\u2019s death, was unincorporated, and therefore arguably lacked capacity to take property as a trustee. Since it had been subsequently incorporated, however, the court appointed the incorporated church as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\">Here, similarly, the testator left a gift to the Reece Christian Church, to be used for general charitable purposes. Although Reece was unincorporated at the time of testator\u2019s death, it is now incorporated. Reece therefore may take the property bequeathed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-11\"> RCW 11.12.050 became effective July 1, 1967. Earlier Washington statutes are identical. <em>See, e.g., In re Ziegner\u2019s Estate, </em>146 Wash 537, 264 P 12, 13 (1928).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b272-12\"> <em>Cf, e.g., DeMars v.

The second Restatement acknowledges the general rule, but makes an exception where application of the law of the domicile at death would defeat the testator\u2019s expectations.
