Construed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff in error, it at most amounts to a certificate approving the bill of exceptions as being in part true and in part untrue.' Such a certificate \u201cis absolutely void and in legal potency and effect in the creation of a writ of error amounts to no more than a refusal by the judge to affix his name to the certificate which constitutes a writ of error.\u201d <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Peoples Loan &amp;c.
