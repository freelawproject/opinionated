[Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">ISU filed.its application<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> accompanied by an addendum and an additional descriptive paper designated \u201cSpecifications for the Purchase of a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer.\u201d The reasons set out in the application why the Varian instrument is not the scientific equivalent of the Japanese article included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">2. Variable temperature work is planned \u2014 particularly low temperature studies of small chemical shift temperature coefficients, and thermodynamic and kinetic studies of conformational changes <em>which require the best </em>available range, stability, and determination of sample temperature. The Perkin Elmer R-20 specifications include the range of \u2014100\u00b0G to 200\u00b0G, automatically controlled, without loss of resolution, stable to within \u00b1.5\u00b0 and precisely determinable at the sample due to an \u201cIn probe\u201d thermocouple. The Varian variable temperature specifications offer temperature control at the sample of \u00b12\u00b00, [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] and a calibration accuracy of \u00b13\u00b0C and a \u201460\u00b0C to 200\u00b0G range-with spinning sample. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In approving the application the Secretary stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">No instrument or apparatus of equivalent scientific value to the foreign article, for the purposes for which such article is intended to be used, is being manufactured in the United States. REASONS: (1) The foreign article provides a sample temperature range from minus 100 degrees Centigrade to plus 200 degrees Centigrade. (See specifications for Hitachi Perkin-Elmer Model R-20 High Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer.) The Varian Model HA-60IL-HR-60 has a temperature range from minus 60 degrees Centigrade to plus 200 degrees Centigrade. (Varian brochure V4341 and V4341-1.) We are advised by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) (memorandum dated September 28, 1967), that, in view of the purposes for which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>foreign article is intended to be nsed, tbe difference in temperature range is significant. (2) Tbe foreign article provides a means for controlling tbe temperature witbin plus or minus 0.5 degree Centigrade whereas tbe Var\u00edan Model HA-60IEHR-60 provides a means for controlling tbe temperature witbin plus or minus 1 degree Centigrade. We are advised by tbe National Bureau of Standards (memorandum dated October 20, 1967) that \u201ctbe difference between \u00b11.0\u00b0C and \u00b10.5\u00b0C is such as to affect significantly tbe capability to perform certain experiments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">For tbe foregoing reasons, we find that tbe Var\u00edan Model HA-60IL-HR.-60 is not of equivalent scientific value to tbe foreign article for tbe purpose for wbicb sucb article is intended to be used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Var\u00edan filed comments before the Secretary opposing tbe application, asserting that it manufactured apparatus which is of equivalent scientific value to the proposed, import. Those comments raised two issues, i.e., whether the Var\u00edan apparatus performs in the same temperature range, and whether it has the same temperature stability as the Japanese equipment. Here Var\u00edan argues the same questions, along with other contentions not raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">We think it clear that those contentions made here for the first time cannot be considered by us. It is firmly established that a court reviewing the action of an administrative agency does not consider issues raised by the party seeking review which could have been raised before the agency but were not. <em>Unemployment Compensation Commission </em>v. Aragon, 329 U.S. 143 (1946); <em>United States </em>v. <em>L. A. Tucker Truck </em>Lines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33 (1952). That principle governs here since Vardan\u2019s new arguments could, and should, have been raised before the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">As to the matters properly before us,  we have set out the statute which gives us jurisdiction to review the findings of the Secretary \u201con questions of law only.\u201d Such review of the findings here is limited to determining whether the administrative decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>In re Von </em>Clemm, 43 CCPA 56, CAD 609 (1955); <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations </em>Board, 340 U.S. 474 (1951); <em>Securities and Exchange Commission </em>v. <em>New England Electric System, </em>390 U.S. 207, 211 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">With respect to the Secretary\u2019s findings that the domestic instrument does not match the temperature characteristics of the Japanese article, Var\u00edan points out that it stated in its comments regarding the application that the temperature range of its instrument is from \u2014120\u00b0C to 200\u00b0C and that its \u201ctemperature control specification * * * is \u00b11\u00b0C, and in a typical operation, more nearly \u00b1%\u00b0C.\u201d However, a brochure which Var\u00edan submitted with its comments has the temperature range printed therein as \u201c \u201460\u00b0C to +200\u00b0C\u201d.at two locations with the figure \u201c \u201460o,C\u201d crossed out and the figure \u201c \u2014 120\u00b0 C\u201d substituted by hand at only one of the locations. The printed bro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>chure sets out the temperature control characteristic as \u00b11\u00b0C at the sample contrary to its assertion relative to <em>\u00b1y2\u00b0C </em>in its comments as cited above, and no change or correction was made in that item.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\">We are satisfied that such evidence must be \u00a1accepted under the present circumstances as substantial support for the finding that the Varian apparatus has a temperature rnge of but \u2014 60\u00b0C to 200\u00b0C rather than one extending from \u2014 100\u00b0C or \u2014 120\u00b0C to the same upper limit. As to the finding relative to the \u201ctemperature control specification,\u201d the evidence is substantially stronger since the very statement relied on to prove the \u00b1%\u00b0C characteristic is but an equivocal modification of the direct statement that the specification is \u00b11\u00b0C.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Turning to the Secretary\u2019s finding that Varian\u2019s \u00a1apparatus is not the scientific equivalent of the Japanese apparatus for the \u201cpurpose for which such article is intended to be used,\u201d ISTJ\u2019s reason No. 2, quoted above, states that the variable temperature studies planned by it \u201crequire the best available range, stability, and determination of sample temperature.\u201d Also pertinent to the finding is the memorandum of the National Bureau of Standards referred to by the Secretary, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">* * * The applicant intends to use the foreign article for low temperature studies of small chemical shift temperature coefficients as well as a general research tool and as a classroom training device. The only comparable domestic article known to us is the Varian HA-60-IL. On the basis of general usage the domestic instrument is scientifically equivalent to the foreign article. However, on the basis of the applicant\u2019s need for low temperature operation and resolution, we find the foreign instrument\u2019s low temperature control of \u00b10.5\u00b0C and resolution of 1 in 10\"s (0.6 Hz for protons) to be pertinent characteristics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">Varian in its letter opposing the granting of duty free status for the applicant states that their temperature control is \u201cnearly\u201d \u00b1%\u00b0G. However, in its response to the applicant\u2019s request for bids Varian offered an instrument that would perform according to the specification in brochure V 4341 and V 4341-1. The brochure lists the temperature that can be maintained as \u00b11\u00b00. We find the difference between \u00b11.0\u00b00. and \u00b10.5\u00b0C is such as to affect significantly the capability to perform certain experiments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">We find therefore that a pertinent characteristic offered by the foreign manufacturer is not offered by the domestic manufacturer. The instruments are not scientifically equivalent for the purpose for which the foreign instrument is being bought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Likewise significant is the memorandum of tbe Public Health Service of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, referred to in the decision of the Secretary. That document states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">It is the Committee's opinion that the planned low temperature research studies at Illinois University involving temperature coefficients of small chemical shifts and thermodynamic and kinetic conformational changes, establish as pertinent characteristics the range, stability and accuracy of measurement of temperature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The foreign article has a sample temperature range of \u2014100\u00b0 to \u00a1+200\u00b0C stable to \u00b10.5\u00b0C, measured with a themoeouple. The domestic article has a temperature range of \u201460\u00b0 to \u25a0+200\u00b0C, controlled to \u00b11.0\u00b0C (calibration accuracy of =h3\u00b0C), measured with a resistance thermometer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">The Committee believes that in the pertinent characteristics cited, the foreign and domestic articles are not scientifically equivalent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Considering the record in light of those reports from agencies which, unlike this court, must be credited with expertise in the field, we conclude that there is substantial evidence to show that the requirement of a sample temperature range of \u2014100\u00b0 C to +200\u00b0C, stable to \u00b1.5\u00b0C, is material to the purpose for which ISU has stated it intends to use the NMK. spectrometer and to support the ultimate finding of the Secretary that the Var\u00edan apparatus is not of equivalent scientific value to the Japanese apparatus for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Since we find no error of law in the Secretary\u2019s decision, it is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">.Judge Smith participated in the hearing of this case but died before a decision was reached.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-13\"> The notice of the decision is signed- by <em>the </em>Director, Office of Scientific and [Technical Equipment.
