Debtors proposed to increase plan payments and shorten the term of their plan from five years to three years. The chapter 13 trustee and appellee, David M. Howe, objected to the shortened term, contending that Debtors were above-median and required to contribute their increased income to a five year plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-22\">The bankruptcy court granted Debtors\u2019 motion to increase their payments under the plan, but denied their request to shorten the term. The court held that in addition to satisfying the good faith requirement under \u00a7 1325(a)(3), which applies to modified plans by reference in \u00a7 1329(b)(1), Debtors also had to show a substantial, unanticipated change in their circumstances since the time of confirmation and that their proposed modification correlated to their change in circumstances. The bankruptcy court found that Debtors\u2019 proposed reduction in the term of their plan did not correlate with their change in circumstances (i.e., the increase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>in their income), nor did they offer any justification for reducing the length of their plan payments. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Although the reasoning of the bankruptcy court for denying the shortened term deviates from our precedent, for the reasons stated below we nevertheless AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The facts in this appeal are not in dispute and are adequately summarized in the bankruptcy court\u2019s published decision, <em>In re Mattson, </em>456 B.R. 75 (Bankr.W.D.Wash.2011). We incorporate the relevant facts below and supplement them when needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">On December 21, 2010, Debtors filed their chapter 13 petition. Their schedules listed assets including a house, four vehicles, various funds in bank accounts, personal and household furnishings and over $83,000 in a retirement account, most of which were exempted. Debtors\u2019 Schedule F listed $163,367 in unsecured debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Schedule I showed that Debtors were employed by the Camas School District. Ms. Mattson was a teacher, earning an average of $3,067 per month; Mr. Mattson was listed as a \u201csubstitute janitor\u201d from which he had no earnings yet per month and also showed an average $1,200 per month from operation of a business. Debtors\u2019 combined average monthly income totaled $4,267 per month. Debtors\u2019 Schedule J reflected expenses of $4,117 per month, leaving a monthly net income of $150 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Schedule I stated that Mr. Mattson had just been hired as a substitute janitor within a week before the bankruptcy filing, and while he had not commenced work yet, he anticipated getting $16.50 per hour for what work he would be given. That was expected to reduce his other income from \u201coperation of a business.\u201d Mr. Mattson\u2019s businesses were not identified in the schedules, but the bankruptcy court noted that the case was filed as \u201cf/d/b/a Robbyn D. Mattson Insurance\u201d and \u201cd/b/a East County Battery Doctors.\u201d Debtors\u2019 Statement of Financial Affairs Number 18 identified prior businesses as \u201cinsurance sales\u201d and \u201creconditioning/sales of automotive batteries.\u201d Schedule I further noted that Mr. Mattson also earned approximately $2,760 a year coaching sports but this income was excluded from Schedule I as it was only for two months of the year and would not be available during an average month.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Debtors\u2019 Form B22C indicated they were above-median debtors and reflected a projected disposable income of $253 per month, although the Form B22C also noted that it didn\u2019t accurately reflect Debtors\u2019 projected income because it reflected the income from Mr. Mattson\u2019s previous job and his seasonal income. Looking to the prior six-month period, Debtors argued, showed a substantially higher amount than their average income would be going forward, given Mr. Mattson\u2019s lower income from the new job and the unavailability of the seasonal income.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">Debtors filed a chapter 13 plan which proposed a $150 per month payment for 60 months, for total payments of $9,000. Those payments went to Debtors\u2019 attorney and unsecured creditors, who were expected to receive 2% on their claims. Debtors proposed to pay directly the secured creditors on their home and one vehicle. The bankruptcy court confirmed Debtors\u2019 plan by order entered on March 2, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">Just over two and a half months later, on May 24, 2011, Debtors filed amended Schedules I and J. On amended Schedule I, Mr. Mattson was now listed as a \u201cjanitor\u201d (rather than substitute) and the aver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>age monthly income for both Debtors had increased to a total of $5,936 per month. Ms. Mattson\u2019s income had increased slightly more than $400 a month, and Mr. Mattson\u2019s income had doubled, to over $2450 per month. The amended Schedule J listed higher expenses totaling $4,906 per month, nearly $800 per month higher than the original schedule. While the amended Schedule J no longer reflected business operation expenses of $288 per month, indicating Debtors\u2019 apparent abandonment of Mr. Mattson\u2019s previous business, expenses in nearly every other category increased. Some of the increases reflected potentially expected changes due to Mr. Mattson\u2019s increase to full time employment as a janitor (increases in transportation and clothing, for example). However, the amended Schedule J also included increased expenses in other areas (for example, electricity and heating fuel for Debtors\u2019 home, home maintenance, food, medical and dental expenses, vehicle maintenance and licensing, and recreation and entertainment). In total, though, the amended Schedule I and Schedule J showed an overall increase in monthly excess income to $1,030 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Approximately three weeks after the amended schedules were filed, or just over three months after the plan had been confirmed, Debtors filed their amended plan and a motion for modification on June 15, 2011. In their motion to modify, Debtors stated that modification was necessary because their income had increased. Under the amended plan and motion, Debtors\u2019 plan would be modified to provide for increased payments of $900 per month in June 2011 and then $1,000 per month beginning with the July 2011 payment and the term of the plan would be reduced from 60 to 36 months. Debtors\u2019 amended plan proposed to pay their attorney and unsecured creditors, who would receive a payout increasing from $4,000 to $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The chapter 13 trustee objected to Debtors\u2019 motion, arguing that Debtors should be required to pay the increased $1,000 monthly payment for the confirmed commitment period of 60 months. Under the originally filed means test, from which Debtors had increased their income, Debtors had a positive monthly disposable income of $253 per month. Given the positive disposable income figure, the trustee argued, Debtors were not permitted under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Maney v. Kagenveama (In re Kagenveama), </em>541 F.3d 868 (9th Cir.2008), to seek a deviation from the 60 month commitment period and Debtors cited no authority in their motion which would allow them to do so. The trustee maintained that because Debtors\u2019 income had increased there was no reason why Debtors could not make payments for 60 months. Lastly, the trustee argued that Congress clearly intended that above-median debtors propose and complete a 60 month plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Debtors replied that they were not bound to any predetermined commitment period because income based calculations under \u00a7 1325(b) were not applicable to modifications under \u00a7 1329 under our holding in <em>Sunahara v. Burchard (In re Sunahara), </em>326 B.R. 768 (9th Cir. BAP 2005). Debtors argued that as long as their proposed amended plan was filed in good faith and met the other requirements of chapter 13 incorporated into \u00a7 1329, they could reduce the duration of the plan, without consideration of the applicable commitment period in the confirmed plan. Debtors also cited other bankruptcy court decisions in the Ninth Circuit which they contended authorized the debtor to amend his or her plan to less than 60 months. <em>In re Hall, </em>442 B.R. 754, 760-61 (Bankr.D.Idaho 2010); <em>In re Ewers, </em>366 B.R. 139, 143 (Bankr.D.Nev.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>After a hearing on July 5, 2011, the matter was submitted and the bankruptcy court issued its published opinion. In it, the court decided that a predictable test for crafting and reviewing plan modifications was preferable to the good faith analysis espoused in <em>In re Sunahara. </em>Accordingly, the court held that, in addition to the <em>Sunaham </em>good faith analysis, plan modification under \u00a7 1329 also requires the moving party to show that there has been a substantial change in the debtor\u2019s circumstances after confirmation \u201cwhich was unanticipated or otherwise could not be taken into account at the time of the confirmation hearing, <em>and that the change in the plan correlate[s] to the change in circumstances.\u201d In re Mattson, </em>456 B.R. at 82 (emphasis in original). In light of this standard, the bankruptcy court found that Debtors\u2019 proposed modification to shorten the term of their plan did not correlate with the change in circumstances\u2014their increased income. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The bankruptcy court also addressed the relevance of the applicable commitment period to plan modifications. The court found that \u00a7 1329(c), which states that a plan \u201cmodified under this section may not provide for payments over a period that expires after the applicable commitment period under section 1325(b)(1)(B),\u201d suggested that the applicable commitment period did not go away with modification, but was fixed at confirmation. <em>Id. </em>at 83. In other words, \u201c[t]he plan may be extended by the Court for good cause, though not beyond five years, but the applicable commitment period from \u00a7 1325(b) cannot be altered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the bankruptcy court did not accept the trustee\u2019s position that, unless a debtor proposed to pay the unsecured creditors in full, the length of the plan could not be reduced under \u00a7 1329(a)(2). The court acknowledged that a debtor\u2019s financial circumstances may change in a way that justified a reduction in plan length as demonstrated by <em>In re Ewers, </em>366 B.R. 139.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The bankruptcy court entered the Memorandum Decision on August 26, 2011. Debtors timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over this proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334 and 157(b)(2)(L). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">III. ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in denying Debtors\u2019 request to shorten the term of their plan from five years to three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">IV. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">Modification under \u00a7 1329 is discretionary. <em>In re Sunahara, </em>326 B.R. at 772; <em>Powers v. Savage (In re Powers), </em>202 B.R. 618, 623 (9th Cir. BAP 1996). A bankruptcy court abuses its discretion if it applies the wrong legal standard or its findings are illogical, implausible or without support in the record. <em>Traffic-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>School.com, Inc. v. Edriver Inc., </em>653 F.3d 820, 832 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">While the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision whether to allow modification is reviewed for abuse of discretion, whether the bankruptcy court was correct in its interpretation of the applicable statutes is reviewed de novo. <em>Towers v. United States (In re Pac.-Atlantic Trading Co.), </em>64 F.3d 1292, 1297 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Whether a plan modification has been proposed in good faith by the debtor is a question of fact, and the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings on that issue are reviewed for clear error. <em>Downey Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Metz (In re Metz), </em>820 F.2d 1495, 1497 (9th Cir.1987). A factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is illogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that can be drawn from the facts in the record. <em>United States v. Hinkson, </em>585 F.3d 1247, 1262-63 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Siriani v. Nw. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. (In re Siriani), </em>967 F.2d 302, 304 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">y. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Chapter 13 plan modification is governed by \u00a7 1329. Section 1329(a) provides for post-confirmation plan modifications under four delineated circumstances, two of which are relevant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">At any time after confirmation of the plan but before the completion of payments under such plan, the plan may be modified, upon request of the debtor ..., to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">(1) increase ... the amount of payments on claims of a particular class provided for by the plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-14\">(2) extend or reduce the time for such payments!)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">When a debtor\u2019s proposed modifications fall within one or both of these provisions, the bankruptcy court must then decide whether the proposed modification complies with \u00a7 1329(b)(1). That section states: \u201c[s]ections 1322(a), 1322(b), and 1323(c) of this title and the requirements of \u00a7 1325(a) of this title apply to any modification under subsection (a) of this section.\u201d The statute\u2019s reference to \u00a7 1325(a) means that the plan as modified must be proposed in good faith under \u00a7 1325(a)(3). In this Circuit, bankruptcy courts make good faith determinations under \u00a7 1325(a)(3) on a case-by-case basis, after considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Leavitt v. Soto (In re Leavitt), </em>171 F.3d 1219, 1224-25 (9th Cir.1999); <em>550 W. Ina Rd. Trust v. Tucker (In re Tucker), </em>989 F.2d 328, 330 (9th Cir.1993); <em>Goeb v. Heid (In re Goeb), </em>675 F.2d 1386, 1390 &amp; n. 9 (9th Cir.1982); <em>see also Smyrnos v. Padilla (In re Padilla), </em>213 B.R. 349, 352 (9th Cir. BAP 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">Notably missing from \u00a7 1329 is any express requirement that a substantial and unanticipated change in the debtor\u2019s financial circumstances is a threshold requirement to overcome the res judicata effect of a confirmed plan under \u00a7 1327(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ever, concerns over the finality of a confirmed plan led to the judicially developed substantial and unanticipated change test to inform the court on the initial question of whether the doctrine of res judicata prevented modification of a confirmed plan. <em>See Murphy v. O\u2019Donnell (In re Murphy), </em>474 F.3d 143, 149 (4th Cir.2007). The Fourth Circuit, which is the only Court of Appeals to apply the substantial and unanticipated change test, explained the multi-step analysis for plan modification using the test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">[Wjhen a bankruptcy court is faced with a motion for modification pursuant to \u00a7 1329(a)(1) or (a)(2), the bankruptcy court must first determine if the debtor experienced a substantial and unanticipated change in his post-confirmation financial condition. This inquiry will inform the bankruptcy court on the question of whether the doctrine of res judicata prevents modification of the confirmed plan. If the change in the debtor\u2019s financial condition was either insubstantial or anticipated, or both, the doctrine of res judicata will prevent the modification of the confirmed plan. However, if the debtor experienced both a substantial and unanticipated change in his post-confirmation financial condition, then the bankruptcy court can proceed to inquire whether the proposed modification is limited to the circumstances provided by \u00a7 1329(a). If the proposed modification meets one of the circumstances listed in \u00a7 1329(a), then the bankruptcy court can turn to the question of whether the proposed modification complies with \u00a7 1329(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 150 (citing <em>Arnold v. Weast (In re Arnold), </em>869 F.2d 240, 243 (4th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">The First, Fifth and Seventh Circuits have rejected this approach and do not impose on parties seeking to modify a confirmed plan the threshold requirement of the substantial unanticipated change test. See <em>Barbosa v. Solomon, </em>235 F.3d 31, 41 (1st Cir.2000), <em>Meza v. Truman (In re Meza), </em>467 F.3d 874, 878 (5th Cir.2006), and <em>In re Witkowski, </em>16 F.3d 739, 746 (7th Cir.1994) all holding that no change in circumstances is required. The Ninth Circuit has not directly ruled on the issue but in <em>Anderson v. Satterlee (In re Anderson), 21 </em>F.3d 355, 358 (9th Cir.1994) suggested in dicta that the substantial and unanticipated change test applies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Pak v. eCast Settlement Corp. (In re Pak), </em>378 B.R. 257, 268 (9th Cir. BAP 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">Although dicta from the Ninth Circuit is persuasive, we are bound only by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holdings and not by the court\u2019s election, whether express or implied, to leave open particular legal questions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, in interpreting a statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>we have been instructed to follow the plain meaning rule and apply a statute according to its terms unless to do so would lead to absurd results. <em>Lamie v. U.S. Trustee, </em>540 U.S. 526, 534, 124 S.Ct. 1023, 157 L.Ed.2d 1024 (2004). As a consequence, we have traditionally taken a plain meaning approach to statutory interpretation questions. For this reason, in <em>In re Powers, Max Recovery, Inc. v. Than (In re Than), </em>215 B.R. 430, 435 (9th Cir. BAP 1997), and <em>McDonald v. Burgie (In re Burgie), </em>239 B.R. 406, 409 (9th Cir. BAP 1999), we held that the res judicata doctrine did not apply to plan modifications and, therefore, the substantial and unanticipated change test was unnecessary as a threshold requirement because the plain language of \u00a7 1329 did not support this judicially created requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See also Ledford v. Brown (In re Brown), </em>219 B.R. 191, 195 (6th Cir. BAP 1998) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Despite our not adopting the substantial and unanticipated change test as a prerequisite to plan modification, we have held, as did the Seventh Circuit in <em>In re Witkowski, </em>that the bankruptcy court may consider a change in circumstances in the exercise of its discretion. <em>In re Powers, </em>202 B.R. at 623. In the end, in evaluating plan modifications, it may make little practical difference whether the bankruptcy court applies the substantial and unanticipated change test as a threshold requirement or uses it as a discretionary tool.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">In light of this background, and the purpose behind the substantial and unanticipated change test, we conclude that to the extent the bankruptcy court applied the test it was harmless error given that Debtors did experience a substantial and unanticipated change in their post-confirmation income. Thus, even under the Fourth Circuit\u2019s more stringent standard, the doctrine of res judicata did not prevent Debtors from modifying their plan under \u00a7 1329(a)(1) or (2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the bankruptcy court was still required to determine whether Debtors\u2019 proposed modification to reduce the term of their plan complied with \u00a7 1329(b)(1) and its cross reference to the good faith requirement under \u00a7 1325(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In this regard, the bankruptcy court acknowledged our holding in <em>In re Sunahara </em>that \u00a7 1329(b)(1) does not reference or otherwise incorporate the provisions concerning the disposable income test and applicable commitment period contained in \u00a7 1325(b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See also In re Hall, </em>442 B.R. at 761 (holding because \u00a7 1329 does not include any reference to \u00a7 1325(b), even though \u00a7 1329 includes specific reference to other Code sections, the requirements of \u00a7 1325(b) should not be applicable to \u00a7 1329 modifications).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As a result, if a debtor\u2019s plan modification was challenged, he or she need not show that all of their projected disposable income was devoted to making plan payments under the modified plan. <em>In re Sunahara, </em>326 B.R. at 781-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">However, as the bankruptcy court aptly observed, <em>In re Sunahara </em>did not leave a wide open field for modifications to be approved. <em>In re Mattson, </em>456 B.R. at 79; <em>see also Barbosa, </em>235 F.3d at 41 (noting that \u201cas a practical matter, parties requesting modifications of Chapter 13 plans must advance a legitimate reason for doing so\u201d); <em>In re Powers, </em>202 B.R. at 622 (\u201cAlthough a party has an absolute right to request modification between confirmation and completion of the plan, modification under \u00a7 1329 is not without limits.\u201d); <em>In re Meeks, </em>237 B.R. 856, 859-60 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1999) (\u201c[T]he Debtors need not demonstrate a substantial, unanticipated change in circumstances in order to modify their confirmed chapter 13 plan. However, neither can Chapter 13 debtors simply modify their plans willy nilly.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The <em>Sunahara </em>Panel held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">[Ijmportant components of the disposable income test are employed as part of a more general analysis of the total circumstances militating in favor of or against the approval of modification, without requiring tortured and illogical statutory interpretations (where the outcome differs depending upon which party is seeking modification, whether a certain party has objected, or whether \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 exist, etc.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">326 B.R. at 781. Thus, the Panel instructed the bankruptcy court to \u201ccarefully consider whether modification has been proposed in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing \u00a7 1325(a)(3)). We reasoned that a good faith determination</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">necessarily requires an assessment of a debtor\u2019s overall financial condition including, without limitation, the debtor\u2019s current disposable income, the likelihood that the debtor\u2019s disposable income will significantly increase due to [greater] income or decreased expenses over the remaining term of the original plan, the proximity of time between confirmation of the original plan and the filing of the modification motion, and the risk of default over the remaining term of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>plan versus the certainty of immediate payment to creditors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 781-82; <em>see also In re Grutsch, </em>453 B.R. at 427 (\u201c \u2018The good faith requirement of \u00a7 1325(a)(3) fills the gap that would otherwise exist, allowing all parties to object to inappropriate payment terms\u2014 whether excessive or inadequate\u2014in a proposed modification.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Here, the bankruptcy court believed that the good faith test lacked predictability and therefore added the requirements of the substantial and unanticipated change test and that the change in the plan correlate to the change in circumstances. 456 B.R. at 82. We conclude that the bankruptcy court\u2019s second requirement\u2014that the proposed modification correlate to Debtors\u2019 change in circumstances\u2014necessarily implicates a good faith analysis. <em>See In re Savage, </em>426 B.R. 320, 324 &amp; n. 3 (Bankr.D.Minn.2010) (in order to comply with the \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement of \u00a7 1325(a)(3), \u201cthe required change in financial circumstances should be directly resonant with the nature of the proposed modification\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, we view the bankruptcy court\u2019s correlation requirement as simply another factor that may be considered under the totality of circumstances approach to a good faith analysis in this Circuit. We emphasize, however, that no single factor is determinative of the lack of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Contrary to the bankruptcy court\u2019s belief that the good faith test lacks predictability, we continue to accept that a good faith analysis under \u00a7 1325(a)(3), although not an exact science, adequately guides the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion for deciding plan modification issues.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">[0]ur reliance in <em>Sunahara </em>on the \u00a7 1325(a)(3) good faith standard is vulnerable to criticism that it introduces a level of subjectivity that could yield disparate results. That subjectivity, however, is constrained by settled law of the circuit that good faith is to be assessed through the matrix of whether the plan proponent \u2018acted equitably\u2019 taking into account \u2018all militating factors\u2019 in a manner that equates with the \u2018totality\u2019 of circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-11\"><em>Fridley v. Forsythe (In re Fridley), </em>380 B.R. 538, 543 (9th Cir. BAP 2007) (citation omitted). Thus, the <em>Fridley </em>Panel dismissed the argument that adopting the reasoning in <em>In re Sunahara </em>would license \u201ccircumvention of \u00a7 1325(b) by the ploy of confirming a plan that complies with \u00a7 1325(b) and then promptly modifying the plan in a manner that does not comply with \u00a7 1325(b). Such a stratagem plainly would be an unfair manipulation of the Bankruptcy Code, which is a factor named in <em>Goeb </em>as indicative of a plan proponent not acting equitably and, hence, not in good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">The \u201csettled law\u201d in this Circuit referred to by <em>In re Fridley </em>demonstrates that the good faith test under \u00a7 1325(a)(3) is neither ill-defined nor does it lack a predictable base. In <em>In re Goeb, </em>the Ninth Circuit set forth a generalized test for good faith that includes consideration of the substantiality of proposed plan payments; whether the debtor has misrepresented facts in the plan; whether the debtor has unfairly manipulated the Bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ruptcy Code; and whether the plan is proposed in an equitable manner. 675 F.2d at 1390. At the very least, these factors direct attention away from the amorphous good faith concept, bringing relevant facts to the foreground. Moreover, the standards set forth in <em>In re Goeb </em>offer a solid framework for evaluating a variety of circumstances, which is consistent with the discretionary aspect of plan modifications. At bottom, determinations of good faith are made on a case-by-case basis, after considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>Finally, bankruptcy courts are not free to ignore the concept of good faith in plan modifications given that \u00a7 1329 specifically references \u00a7 1325(a) and its good faith requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s holding and the facts of this case fit within a conventional good faith analysis. The burden of establishing that a plan is submitted in good faith is on the debtor. <em>Fid. &amp; Cas. Co. of N.Y. v. Warren (In re Warren), </em>89 B.R. 87, 93 (9th Cir. BAP 1988); <em>see also In re Hall, </em>442 B.R. at 758 (moving party bears the burden of showing sufficient facts to indicate that modification of debtors\u2019 confirmed chapter 13 plan is warranted). Further, the bankruptcy court has an independent duty to determine whether a chapter 13 plan is proposed in good faith. <em>Villanueva v. Dowell (In re Villanueva), </em>274 B.R. 836, 841 (9th Cir. BAP 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Here, the record shows Debtors failed to meet their burden of proving that the shortened term of their plan was made in good faith under the <em>Goeb </em>standards. Those standards clearly require more than a showing of Debtors\u2019 subjective good faith. Simply put, Debtors\u2019 contribution of a portion of their increased income to their plan for a three year period does not amount to per se good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Indeed, the bankruptcy court considered whether Debtors\u2019 proposal was made in good faith in light of the relevant militating factors. The court found Debtors were not retiring, leaving the employment market or changing jobs in some other way nor did they contend they had health issues. Debtors do not dispute these findings on appeal nor do they point to any facts in the record which showed they would be unable to continue their increased payments beyond the 36 month period that they proposed. Although the doctrine of res judicata did not prevent Debtors from shortening the term of their plan, they advanced no legitimate reason for doing so under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">As a consequence, in light of Debtors\u2019 increased income, allowing them to shorten the term for their plan would be an inequitable result under <em>In re Goeb. See also In re Stitt, </em>403 B.R. 694, 703 (Bankr.D.Idaho 2008) (noting that the \u201cgood faith requirement of \u00a7 1325(a)(3) gauges the overall fairness of a debtor\u2019s treatment of creditors under a plan\u201d). In addition, Debtors\u2019 proposed modification to shorten the term of the plan when their income significantly increased is inconsistent with the overall policies of chapter 13 and the enactment of BAPCPA, which \u201chas been read to tighten, not loosen, the ability of debtors to avoid paying what can reasonably be paid on account of debt.\u201d <em>In re Kamell, </em>451 B.R. 505, 508 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.2011). As the bankruptcy court aptly noted, \u201cthere is clearly more that could\u2014in \u2018good faith\u2019\u2014 be paid to their creditors.\u201d <em>In re Mattson, </em>456 B.R. at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Finally, we emphasize that the continued absence from \u00a7 1329(b)(1) of any reference to \u00a7 1325(b) is conclusive as to whether a debtor may modify his or her plan to reduce the term below the applicable commitment period required for an original plan. \u201cCongress is presumed to act inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tionally and purposefully when it includes language in one section of the Bankruptcy Code, but omits it in another section.\u201d <em>In re Ewers, </em>366 B.R. at 143. Congress, aware of the function of the means test in chapter 13 relating to confirmation of original plans, did not amend \u00a7 1329(b)(1) to incorporate \u00a7 1325(b). As noted by the bankruptcy court in <em>In re Ewers, </em>\u201cBAJPCPA added the term [applicable commitment period] in \u00a7 1329(c), which deals with the maximum length of a modified plan, obviously as a conforming amendment.... \u2018Three years\u2019 in \u00a7 1329(c) was switched to \u2018the applicable commitment period under section 1325(b)(1)(B),\u2019 no doubt, to be harmonious with \u00a7 1325(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143. Having taken the opportunity to amend \u00a7 1329(c), Congress\u2019s decision not to amend \u00a7 1329(b) may be seen as deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Therefore, the plain language of \u00a7 1329(a)(2), which authorizes modifications to extend or reduce the time for payments under the plan, continues to control. As the bankruptcy court correctly acknowledged, a debtor\u2019s circumstances may justify a reduction in plan length. <em>Mattson, </em>456 B.R. at 83 (citing <em>In re Ewers, </em>366 B.R. 139).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the end, the appropriateness of any particular modification is subject to the court\u2019s discretion, as limited by \u00a7 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">For the reasons stated, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying Debtors\u2019 proposed modification to shorten the term of their plan. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-16\">.

In <em>Ewers, </em>the debtors\u2019 income went down when they retired after confirmation of their plan. They moved to reduce the term of their plan from five years to three years. The bankruptcy court held that the term of a modified plan is not restricted to the applicable commitment period that was first established under \u00a7 1325(b). The court found that the debtors' chapter 13 plan may be modified to a three-year plan without paying their unsecureds in full, if the plan otherwise satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 1329(b), which included the requirement of good faith under \u00a7 1325(a). In the end, the bankruptcy court allowed the trustee to provide further briefing on the issue of the debtors\u2019 good faith with respect to the timing of their retirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b245-11\">.

The issue in <em>Ransom </em>also was not about plan modification but whether the debtor was entitled to a car-ownership deduction for purposes of the means test when he owned his car free and clear. The Supreme Court held that the debtor was not entitled to a deduction expense for a vehicle which he did not have. The court further held that \"[t]he appropriate way to account for unanticipated expenses like a new vehicle purchase is not to distort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the scope of a deduction, but to use the method that the Code provides for all Chapter 13 debtors (and their creditors): modification of the plan in light of changed circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">.

The plain language of subsection (3) of \u00a7 1329(a) requires a post-confirmation change in circumstances, i.e. payment on the claim outside of the plan. While subsections (1) and (2) contain no such requirement, the significance of that fact is limited by \u00a7 1329(b)(1), which requires that the modified plan comply with \u00a7 1325(a). If, for example, a creditor seeks to modify the plan to increase payments to the unsecured creditor class under \u00a7 1329(a)(1), the modification cannot be approved unless the debtor has the ability to make the increased payments. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1325(a)(6). If the debtor has satisfied the obligation to use all disposable income to fund the plan, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1325(b), the creditor\u2019s modification will be disapproved unless there has been a post-confirmation improvement in the debtor's financial circumstances. Conversely, any effort by the debtor to reduce payments is circumscribed by the good faith requirement of \u00a7 1325(a)(3)____</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b247-13\">.
