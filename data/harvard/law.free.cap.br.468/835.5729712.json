Dunn Construction Company (\u201cJ.E. Dunn\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and other lienholders. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Trilogy filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on May 15, 2009. Its business consisted of the ownership and operation of a real estate development project located in the \u201cPlaza\u201d area of Kansas City, Missouri, known as the West Edge Project. Construction of the project commenced in January 2006 and continued until shortly before the bankruptcy petition was filed. By the date of the bankruptcy filing, numerous contractors, suppliers, and vendors asserted mechanic lien claims against the project for unpaid balances due.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The liens against the project far exceeded its value and on January 24, 2010, Trilogy commenced an adversary proceeding seeking a declaratory judgment as to the validity and priority of all liens against the project. On January 20, 2012, the bankruptcy court entered its Order of Final Judgment in the adversary proceeding which determined the amount, validity, and priority of various consensual liens and the mechanic lien claims. The mechanic lien claims alone totaled more than $17,000,000.00.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">On July 8, 2010, Trilogy filed a motion under \u00a7\u00a7 105(a) and 368 of the Bankruptcy Code to, <em>inter alia, </em>conduct an auction sale of the project free and clear of liens. The motion was granted and an auction was conducted. On August 31, 2010, the bankruptcy court entered its sale order authorizing Trilogy to close on the sale of the project free and clear of liens to WERC, LLC (\u201cWERC\u201d) for the sum of $10,000,000.00 as the prevailing bid at the auction. The sale order also approved the backup bid of VA West Properties, LLC (\u201cVA West\u201d) for $9,500,000.00 and authorized Trilogy to conclude a sale to VA West in the event the sale to WERC was not consummated. Finally, the sale order provided: \u201cAll lien claims and interests shall attach to the sale proceeds to the extent of their validity, perfection, and priority against the Project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">Pursuant to the sale order, WERC entered into a purchase agreement under which it posted an earnest money deposit in the amount of $1,000,000.00 and agreed to close by September 30, 2010. WERC failed to close, the purchase agreement was terminated, and the deposit was retained by Trilogy as liquidated damages. Subsequently, Trilogy closed on the sale of the project to VA West as the approved backup bidder under the sale order. Trilogy currently retains possession of both the net proceeds from the sale to VA West and the deposit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>On December 5, 2011, Trilogy filed its motion for determination of secured status under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506. Under the terms of the motion, Trilogy sought a determination that the mechanic lien claims did not attach to the deposit and that the deposit was an unencumbered asset of Trilogy\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy estate. After a hearing on January 11, 2012, the bankruptcy court announced its ruling that the deposit is part of the sale proceeds of the project and, pursuant to the sale order, the deposit is subject to the mechanic lien claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s January 11, 2012, order interprets the scope of the phrase \u201csale proceeds\u201d as used in the sale order. A bankruptcy court\u2019s interpretation of its own order is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Boyher v. Radloff (In re Boyher), </em>2012 WL 752336 (8th Cir. BAP Mar. 9, 2012) (citations omitted). An abuse of discretion will be found only if the court\u2019s judgment was based on clearly erroneous factual findings or on erroneous legal conclusions. <em>See In re Bowman, </em>253 B.R. 233, 237 (8th Cir. BAP 2000). \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court, on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N. C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (quoting <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">In its brief, Trilogy raises several issues to be considered on appeal, with its lead argument being that Missouri mechanic lien law provides no basis for attachment of mechanic liens to the deposit. Trilogy asserts that since Missouri statutory law is the source of law for creation of any lien in favor of the mechanic lien creditors, the creditors must necessarily demonstrate that the Missouri mechanic lien statutes establish a lien against the deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">That argument -is inapposite to this appeal. Missouri\u2019s mechanic lien law is relevant only to the issue of the extent and priority of the various liens against the project\u2014which was decided in the adversary proceeding that is the subject of a separate appeal pending in the United States District Court. It also fails to recognize that the mechanic lien claims attached to the sale proceeds by virtue of the sale order\u2014not by operation of Missouri law. The sale order, which was prepared and submitted to the bankruptcy court by Trilogy, authorized the project to be sold free and clear of liens and expressly provided for liens to attach to the \u201csale proceeds\u201d to the extent of their validity, perfection, and priority against the project. The sale order was not appealed and became final. Thus, the only issue to be considered is whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in deciding that the deposit was part of the sale proceeds of the project.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>As indicated, the sale order authorized the sale of the project free and clear of liens and specifically provided that \u201c[a]ll lien claims and interests shall attach to the sale proceeds to the extent of their validity, perfection, and priority against the Project.\u201d The sale order does not define \u201csale proceeds,\u201d nor is there any requirement that the lien claimants have some sort of statutory or legal claim to the deposit in order for it to constitute sale proceeds. The sale order simply substituted the \u201csale proceeds\u201d in place of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">At its core, the motion to determine secured status filed by Trilogy was a motion asking the bankruptcy court to interpret its own prior order. As noted previously, a bankruptcy court\u2019s interpretation of its own order will be overturned by an appellate court only if an abuse of discretion is found. <em>Boyher v. Radloff (In re Boyher), </em>2012 WL 752336 (8th Cir. BAP Mar. 9, 2012) (citations omitted). After all, the judge who entered the order is clearly in the best position to interpret its meaning.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In his oral ruling, the bankruptcy judge thoroughly explained his analysis. He explained that WERC paid the deposit as part of a contract giving it the right to buy the project. He also recognized that the deposit would not exist but for the project, and if the sale to WERC had closed, the deposit \u201cwould have been proceeds and there\u2019s no reason to treat it differently because it didn\u2019t close.\u201d The bankruptcy court\u2019s decision was not based on clearly erroneous factual findings or erroneous legal conclusions and, therefore, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-16\">.

Following a hearing on October 22, 2010, the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the expenditure of $100,000.00 of the deposit funds to maintain the project pending the closing with VA West. Thus, the remaining deposit funds at issue are in the amount of $900,000.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\">. Trilogy\u2019s other assignments of error similarly miss the mark by failing to recognize that attachment of the mechanic lien claims to the sale proceeds has been decided by a final order of the bankruptcy court. Thus, the arguments raised under \u00a7 552(a) and \u00a7 506(d) are irrelevant to the interpretation of the scope of the words \"sale proceeds.\u201d Further, the fact that the purchase agreement called for the deposit to be paid to the seller if the buyer failed to close does not determine whether the deposit should be considered \"sale proceeds\u201d under the terms of the sale order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b716-6\">. Indeed, that interpretive principle even applies to fictional characters: \" \u2018When <em>I </em>use a word,\u2019 Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, \u2018it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less.\u2019 \u201d Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass &amp; What Alice Found There (Macmillan Publishing) (1871).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
