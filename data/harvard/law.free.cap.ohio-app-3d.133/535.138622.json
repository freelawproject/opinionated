The trial court found in favor of appellees on all counts and awarded compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorney fees. The city appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">The city owns Boike Park, which is located in Symmes Township, outside the Loveland city limits. Appellees are owners of properties within the Chatham Woods subdivision in Symmes Township. The park is adjacent to a large pond that occupies portions of appellees\u2019 properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">Prior to the city\u2019s activities in Boike Park, appellees\u2019 pond was an aesthetically pleasing and ecologically well-balanced pond. The .pond featured an electric pump, capable of being lit in the evening, which created a fountain of water that served to oxygenate the pond and minimize mosquito breeding through water movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">In late 1995 or early 1996, the city caused large amounts of earth material to be deposited in Boike Park. The city failed to maintain effective erosion-control measures, thus drastically increasing the amount of water flow and sediment draining from the park into appellees\u2019 pond. As a result of the city\u2019s activities in Boike Park, the pond became mud-filled, thereby disabling the pump. In turn, mosquitoes, pests, and bad odors increased. As a result, appellees were deprived of the use and enjoyment of the pond and portions of their property adjacent to the pond.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">The city assigns as error (1) the trial court\u2019s finding that no extraterritorial immunity exists for the city\u2019s activities in Boike Park, (2) the trial court\u2019s failure to grant judgment for the city where appellees failed to plead or argue an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>exception to political subdivision immunity, (3) the trial court\u2019s failure to grant judgment to the city based on immunity, (4) the trial court\u2019s award of punitive damages and attorney fees against the city; and (5) the trial court\u2019s allowance of a damages hearing. We review each of these assignments of error in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">II. EXTRATERRITORIAL IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The city claims that the trial court erred in deciding that the city was not immune for activities occurring in Boike Park because the park was outside the city\u2019s territorial limits. We agree. R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) establishes for political subdivisions, including municipalities, immunity from liability for losses in connection with functions defined within the statute as governmental or proprietary functions. The construction and maintenance of a park by a municipality is a governmental function. R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(u). Nothing within the statute limits governmental functions to actions that occur within the boundaries of the municipality. <em>Perry v. E. Cleveland </em>(Feb. 16, 1996), Lake App. No. 95-L-111, unreported, 1996 WL 200558. Nor is there a constitutional barrier confining the city\u2019s power to provide for parks to the geographical area of the city proper, where provision for parks is made in the exercise of local self-government. <em>McDonald v. Columbus </em>(1967), 12 Ohio App.2d 150, 41 O.O.2d 228, 231 N.E.2d 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Furthermore, a municipality may exercise powers of local self-government beyond its territorial limits if that is authorized by statute. <em>Springfield v. All Am. Food Specialists </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 464, 620 N.E.2d 120, citing <em>Prudential Co-Operative Realty Co. v. Youngstown </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 204, 160 N.E. 695. The establishment and maintenance of parks is a power of local self-government that a municipality is statutorily empowered to exercise either inside or outside its corporate limits. R.C. 719.01(B) and 719.02. Therefore, acts or decisions relating to, or occurring on, a municipality\u2019s extraterritorial property are entitled to the same immunity protection as those occurring on lands within the borders of the municipality. <em>See Perry, supra. </em>Thus, we hold that the city\u2019s construction and maintenance of Boike Park is a governmental function afforded the immunity protections of R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). Although this aspect of the city\u2019s argument in its first assignment of error is well taken, the assignment itself is not, for the reasons given as we turn our attention to the statutory exceptions to a municipality\u2019s immunity, and the nonliability defenses that a municipality may assert, to determine whether any of the exceptions or defenses apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">III. EXCEPTIONS TO IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">The city\u2019s immunity for a governmental function remains subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>five exceptions of former R.C. 2744.02(B),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in effect at the time of this action. <em>Cater v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 24, 697 N.E.2d 610. The city contends that since appellees failed to plead or prove any such exception to immunity, the trial court erred in failing to grant judgment to the city. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">In their complaint, appellees made allegations of both common-law and statutory nuisance for the city\u2019s actions regarding the sediment flowing from Boike Park into appellees\u2019 pond. Appellees alleged that, by its placement of earth material on the park property, the city created and maintained a continuing nuisance. Appellees further alleged that the city\u2019s diversion of the water upon Boike Park from its natural course was prohibited by statute. The city\u2019s answer contained its assertion of absolute immunity pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Former R.C. 2744.02(B)(3)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provided an exception to immunity for a governmental function:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cPolitical subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to persons or property caused by their failure to keep public roads, highways, streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, bridges, viaducts, <em>or public grounds </em>within the subdivisions open, in repair, and <em>free from nuisance </em>* * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">While the language \u201cwithin the subdivisions\u201d appears to limit this exception to areas within the geographical limits of the city, the phrase \u201cpublic grounds\u201d has been interpreted to include such areas as municipally owned and controlled parks that are established and maintained for the general public. <em>Cater, supra, </em>citing <em>Cleveland v. Ferrando </em>(1926), 114 Ohio St. 207, 150 N.E. 747. Because Boike Park was established by the city for the general public, we hold that the exception for nuisance applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Under the common law, a nuisance is generally recognized as something that is either obnoxious or offensive to others. <em>Hacker v. Cincinnati </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 764, 721 N.E.2d 416, citing <em>Williamson v. Pavlovich </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 179, 543 N.E.2d 1242. A nuisance has also been defined in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">\u201c[A] distinct civil wrong arising or resulting from the invasion of a legally protected interest and consisting of an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the property of another; the doing of anything or the permitting of anything under one\u2019s control or direction to be done without just cause or excuse, the necessary consequence of which interferes with or annoys another in the enjoyment of his legal rights; the unlawful doing of anything or the permitting of anything under one\u2019s control or direction to be done, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>results in injury to another; or the collecting and keeping on one\u2019s premises anything inherently dangerous or likely to do mischief if it escapes, which, escaping, injures another in the enjoyment of his legal rights.\u201d <em>Gaines v. Wyoming </em>(1947), 147 Ohio St. 491, 34 O.O. 406, 72 N.E.2d 369, citing <em>Taylor v. Cincinnati </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 426, 28 O.O. 369, 55 N.E.2d 724.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Former R.C. 3767.01(C), effective at the time of this action, further defined a nuisance as \u201cthat which is defined and declared by statute to be such * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In this case, the trial court found the city\u2019s activities pertaining to Boike Park to be both a common-law nuisance and a statutory nuisance in violation of R.C. 3767.13.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Where there is competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s factual findings, the reviewing court should not disturb the judgment as against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>Faber v. Queen City Terminals, Inc. </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 197, 201, 638 N.E.2d 115, 118. A review of the record demonstrates ample support for the trial court\u2019s factual findings. Therefore, where appellees alleged, and the trial court found, that the city\u2019s activities in Boike Park constituted a nuisance, appellees sufficiently pleaded and proved an exception to immunity for a governmental function. Thus, the city\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">IV. NON-LIABILITY DEFENSES</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">In its third assignment of error, the city asserts that the trial court erred in failing to grant judgment for the city based on the immunity provisions of R.C. Chapter 2744. We have determined that, pursuant to statute, immunity applies to the city\u2019s activities in Boike Park, and that the city\u2019s maintenance of a nuisance on that public ground provided an exception to the city\u2019s immunity. However, the statutory scheme of R.C. Chapter 2744 sets up a third tier of analysis once an exception to immunity is found to apply. <em>Cater, supra, </em>at 27, 697 N.E.2d at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">We must now determine whether one of the defenses contained in R.C. 2744.03 applies to shield the city from liability. In this case, the city failed to argue any nonliability defense provision of R.C. 2744.03, even though appellees, in their complaint, had maintained that the city was hable for nuisance. We must, therefore, review the record to determine if any nonliability provision applies to the facts in this case. R.C. 2744.03(A)(5), the pertinent subsection,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u201cThe political subdivision is immune from liability if the * * * loss to persons or property resulted from the exercise of judgment or discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment, supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources, <em>unless the judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In this case, the trial court found that the city \u201cacted with manifest arrogance, malice and bad faith. [The city] has disregarded the advice and recommendations of the County\u2019s land management professionals and the [c]ity\u2019s own engineers. [The city\u2019s] conduct has been, and continues to be, outrageous and in reckless disregard for the laws of this state.\u201d Although the city would normally be immune for losses in connection with the exercise of judgment or discretion in the use of materials and resources in Boike Park, the trial court was entitled to find that the city\u2019s judgment or discretion was exercised in bad faith. Therefore, none of the nonliability defense provisions of R.C. 2744.03 apply. The city\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">V. ATTORNEY FEES AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The city\u2019s fourth assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s award to appellees of attorney fees and punitive damages. In the absence of statutory authorization, neither punitive damages nor attorney fees can be awarded against a municipal corporation. <em>Franklin v. Columbus </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 53, 719 N.E.2d 592, citing <em>Henry v. Akron </em>(1985), 27 Ohio App.3d 369, 27 OBR 465, 501 N.E.2d 659, and <em>Banks v. Oakwood </em>(Oct. 11, 1990), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 5725 and 58020, unreported, 1990 WL 151662. Because the city is a municipal corporation and no statutory authorization for punitive damages or attorney fees exists, the trial court erred. We therefore find the city\u2019s fourth assignment of error to be well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">VI. TRIAL PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">The city asserts that the trial court erred by conducting a separate \u201cdamages hearing\u201d after the trial on liability. This assignment has no merit because the latter hearing was merely a continuation of the trial in progress. Moreover, the determination to conduct separate hearings on the issues of liability and damages, pursuant to Civ.R. 42(B), is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Heidbreder v. Northampton Twp. Trustees </em>(1979), 64 Ohio App.2d 95, 18 O.O.3d 78, 411 N.E.2d 825. Although the trial court\u2019s holding separate hearings in this case is somewhat out of the ordinary, we find no abuse of discretion. Furthermore, the city has failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from the trial court\u2019s action because the city had the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>present evidence and cross-examine appellees\u2019 witnesses. Therefore, the city\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Based upon the foregoing, we hold that the city\u2019s acts or decisions relating to, or occurring on, its extraterritorial parks are entitled to the same immunity protection as those occurring within the city\u2019s borders. However, because we conclude that appellees proved an exception to the city\u2019s immunity, and that no nonliability defense applies, we affirm the trial court\u2019s award of compensatory damages. We reverse the award of punitive damages and attorney fees. We remand this case to the trial court for a judgment entry setting forth the award of compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b577-8\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Shannon, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b577-9\">Raymond E.
