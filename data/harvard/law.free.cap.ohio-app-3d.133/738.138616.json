The policy included uninsured motorists coverage. An endorsement was made to the policy on October 10, 1992, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-15\">\u201cIt is agreed that such insurance afforded by the policy shall not apply with respect to any automobile or its use while such automobile is being operated by the following designated individual: MICHAEL DICKSON.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-16\">Both Catherine and Michael Dickson signed the driver exclusion agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-17\">On July 22, 1996, Michael Dickson sustained serious injury when defendant Donna Schreiber allegedly failed to yield at a stop sign and struck his motorcycle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>at the intersection of Clover Avenue and Tyler Boulevard in Mentor, Ohio. On December 5, 1996, appellees filed a lawsuit in which Michael Dickson sought damages for personal injury, and his wife, Catherine Dickson, and their son, Kenneth Dickson, sought damages for loss of consortium. Appellees also sought a declaratory judgment that Donna Schreiber is an underinsured motorist and that appellees are entitled to underinsured motorists coverage under Catherine Dickson\u2019s policy with Motorists Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">On July 11, 1997, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on their declaratory judgment cause of action. Appellant responded to appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment by arguing that the named-driver exclusion included in Catherine Dickson\u2019s policy barred appellees from receiving underinsured motorists coverage for claims arising out of Michael Dickson\u2019s accident. On November 4, 1997, the trial court denied appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the grounds that their underinsured motorists coverage equalled Donna Schreiber\u2019s policy limits, and thus appellees were not entitled to underinsured motorists coverage. On November 12, 1997, appellees filed a motion to reconsider summary judgment. On December 22, 1997, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion for reconsideration and granted their motion for summary judgment against appellant, determining that appellees are entitled to underinsured motorists coverage because Donna Schreiber\u2019s policy only provides $50,000 of liability insurance to cover appellees\u2019 claims and appellees\u2019 policy contains $100,000 in underinsured motorists coverage. The trial court further determined that the named-driver exclusion did not apply to Michael Dickson, in this instance, because he was injured while riding a motorcycle, and the exclusion only referred to automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the grounds that the named driver exclusion contained in the Motorists Mutual Policy did not apply if the named driver was operating a motorcycle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">In appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error, it alleges that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of appellees on the grounds that the named-driver exclusion in Catherine Dickson\u2019s policy did not apply if the named-driver was operating a motorcycle. The named-driver exclusion provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">\u201cIt is agreed that such insurance afforded by the policy shall not apply with respect to any automobile or its use while such automobile is being operated by the following designated individual: MICHAEL DICKSON.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">Appellant did not define \u201cautomobile\u201d and the term \u201cautomobile\u201d does not unambiguously include a motorcycle. This case is similar to <em>Roy v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 368, 370, 8 OBR 481, 483, 457 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>344, 347, which held that a clause excluding \u201cnon-owned automobiles\u201d from coverage by an uninsured motorists provision of an insurance policy did not work to exclude nonowned motorcycles because the term \u201cautomobile\u201d is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\u201cAppellant had both the capacity and the opportunity to exclude from coverage liability incurred as the result of its named insured\u2019s operation of a motorcycle. This could have been accomplished either explicitly, by using the term \u2018motorcycle\u2019 in the policy in language indicating exclusion, or implicitly, by defining \u2018non-owned automobile\u2019 * * *. Instead, appellant chose to define \u2018non-owned automobile\u2019 in a manner in which it is not clear that a motorcycle was intended to be excluded from the meaning of its policy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Because the term \u201cautomobile\u201d is ambiguous in this context, the trial court properly construed this term strictly against Motorists Mutual. \u201c[P]olicies of insurance, which are in language selected by the insurer and which are reasonably open to different interpretations, will be construed most favorably for the insured.\u201d <em>Butche v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1962), 174 Ohio St. 144, 146, 21 O.O.2d 418, 420, 187 N.E.2d 20, 22. The trial court did not err by determining that the named-driver exclusion did not apply when Michael Dickson was operating a motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b775-10\">Ford, P.J., and Christley, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
