(\u201cBFI\u201d) under the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>a policy of liability insurance that Motorists Mutual issued to Speedi Delivery Service, Inc. (\u201cSpeedi\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Speedi is a freight hauler. It had a contract with BFI to transport trailers owned by BFI to various work sites, using tractors owned by Speedi and driven by Speedi employees. On March 15, 1995, Ralph Stephens, a Speedi driver, was injured in an accident while hauling a BFI trailer loaded with liquid lime.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Stephens filed a personal injury claim against BFI. In turn, BFI filed claims against Stephens, Speedi, and Speedi\u2019s insurer, Motorists Mutual. Subsequently, Motorists Mutual filed an action to determine its duties of coverage with respect to the various claims involved, which was joined to the action on the personal injury claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The declaratory judgment claim was referred to a magistrate, who found that the contract of insurance between Motorists Mutual and Speedi created coverage for BFI as an \u201cother insured\u201d pursuant to an omnibus provision in the policy, but that coverage of Stephens\u2019s claim against BFI was excluded by a clause barring coverage of claims by employees. Both Motorists Mutual and BFI filed objections. The trial court overruled the objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision as the basis of a summary judgment for Motorists Mutual on the issue of coverage. Subsequently, the trial court dismissed the other claims in the action without prejudice, pursuant to Civ.R. 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">BFI filed a notice of appeal. It presents a single assignment of error, arguing that the trial court erred when it applied the employee claims exception in the policy to bar coverage of Stephens\u2019s claim against BFI.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Motorists Mutual filed a notice of cross-appeal. It presents a single assignment of error, arguing that the trial court erred when it held that BFI was entitled to coverage as an \u201cother insured\u201d under the omnibus provision of Speedi\u2019s policy with Motorists Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Because the issue that BFI appeals depends on our determination of Motorist Mutual\u2019s cross-appeal, we will address the cross-appeal first.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Motorists Mutual\u2019s Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">The policy provides that Motorists Mutual \u201cwill pay all sums an \u2018insured\u2019 legally must pay\u201d as damages caused by bodily injury and \u201cresulting from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a covered auto.\u201d Section 11(A) of the policy sets up the obligation to provide liability coverage for the named insured and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-14\">\u201c1. WHO IS AN INSURED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-15\">\u201cThe following are \u2018insureds\u2019:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201ca. You for any covered \u2018auto.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">\u201cb. Anyone else while using with your permission a covered \u2018auto\u2019 you own, hire or borrow except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">\u201c(1) the owner or anyone else from whom you hire or borrow a covered \u2018auto.\u2019 This exception does not apply if the covered \u2018auto\u2019 is a \u2018trailer\u2019 connected to a covered \u2018auto\u2019 you own.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The magistrate decided that BFI was an <em>insured </em>when the accident occurred because BFI owned the trailer that was connected to a \u201ccovered auto\u201d owned by Speedi. The trial court agreed with that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Motorists Mutual argues that BFI is not an <em>insured </em>because its trailer is not a \u201ccovered auto\u201d under the policy\u2019s definition. In that regard, Motorists Mutual contends that 'the trailer was not \u201cin use\u201d by BFI when the accident occurred because it was under the control of Speedi and its employee, Stephens. Motorists Mutual refers us to several cases from other jurisdictions that have relied on that distinction to deny coverage. <em>Kolby v. Northwest Produce Co. </em>(Minn.App. 1993), 505 N.W.2d 648; <em>Protective Ins. Co. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. </em>(Ind.App. 1984), 467 N.E.2d 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">We find the cases that Motorists Mutual has cited of little help in resolving the issue concerned, which is whether BFI was \u201cusing\u201d a covered auto \u201chired or borrowed\u201d by Speedi. In resolving the issue of coverage that the question presents, we must look to the scope of the allegations in the underlying complaints, and any related matters outside those pleadings, to determine whether they \u201cstate a claim which is potentially or arguably within the policy coverage, or (whether) there is some doubt as to whether a theory of recovery under the policy coverage (has) been pleaded.\u201d <em>Willoughby Hills v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 177, 180, 9 OBR 463, 465-466, 459 N.E.2d 555, 558. In either event, \u201cthe insurer must accept defense of the claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">It is undisputed that Speedi hauled trailers owned by BFI to job sites designated by BFI under a contract for hire. In the complaint that he filed, Ralph Stephens, Speedi\u2019s driver, alleged that he was injured when the tractor/trailer rig he was driving overturned, that this occurred when the tandem wheel body broke loose from its frame and became dislodged from the trailer, that the trailer was defective, and that BFI was \u201cnegligent in [its] failure to test and inspect said trailer prior to using said trailer for hauling the liquid lime\u201d with which BFI had loaded the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">In the complaint that Motorists Mutual and Speedi filed against BFI, the plaintiffs alleged that the accident occurred \u201c[w]hile travelling to the work site on [March 15], 1995, and at the 1-75 northbound exit ramp to westbound 1-70, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>tandems to the trailer supplied by Defendant BFI broke [causing] the tractor, owned by Plaintiff Speedi, and the tanker to fall over thereby damaging same.\u201d Motorists Mutual and Speedi further alleged that \u201cBFI negligently maintained and/or negligently inspected and/or negligently supplied the trailer to Plaintiff Speedi thereby causing the accident described herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The foregoing allegations, if true, demonstrate that BFI loaded a tanker/trailer that it owned with liquid lime and, pursuant to its contract with Speedi, directed Speedi\u2019s employee, Stephens, to transport it to a job site designated by BFI. They further demonstrate that the accident from which Stephens\u2019s injuries arose proximately resulted from BFI\u2019s alleged failure to correct a functional defect on its trailer, which BFI was obligated to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The foregoing allegations state a claim for legal liability in BFI to Stephens that arise from a \u201cuse\u201d that Speedi made of its trailer, and which was potentially or arguably within the policy coverage. Therefore, the trial court correctly found that BFI was an insured because it was using a \u201ccovered auto\u201d hired by Speedi. <em>Willoughby Hills v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">That finding does not resolve the coverage question, however. The exception excludes coverage of claims against \u201c[t]he owner * * * from whom you hire or borrow a covered auto.\u201d That would exclude coverage for BFI on Stephens\u2019s claims because BFI owned the trailer that Speedi hired or borrowed. However, the section goes on to provide: \u201cThis exception does not apply if the covered \u2018auto\u2019 is a \u2018trailer\u2019 connected to a covered \u2018auto\u2019 you own.\u201d That is the very situation involved here: BFI owned the trailer that was connected to Speedi\u2019s tractor, which was itself a covered auto. Thus, the exception does not apply to bar coverage of Stephens\u2019s claim against BFI. Further, if any doubt existed about it, a trailer can be an \u201cauto\u201d covered for these purposes by the very terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Motorists Mutual\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">BFI\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">The magistrate decided that,-while BFI is an \u201cinsured\u201d entitled to coverage under the policy, any legal liability that BFI may have to Stephens on his claims for relief is excluded from that coverage because of an <em>employee </em>claims exception in the policy. The relevant provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">\u201cB. Exclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-12\">\u201cThis insurance does not apply to any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">\u201c4. EMPLOYEE INDEMNIFICATION AND EMPLOYERS LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u201c \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">\u201ca. An employee of the \u2018insured\u2019 arising out of and in the course of employment by the \u2018insured;\u2019 or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\u201cb. The spouse, child, parent, brother, or sister of that employee as a consequence of paragraph a. above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201cThis exclusion applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">\u201c(1) Whether the \u2018insured\u2019 may be liable as an employer or in any other capacity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">\u201c(2) To any obligation to share damages with or repay someone else who must pay damages because of the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">\u201cBut this exclusion does not apply to \u2018bodily injury* to domestic employees not entitled to workers compensation benefits or to liability assumed by the \u2018insured\u2019 under an \u2018insured contract.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">The magistrate reasoned that Stephens\u2019s claims against BFI are within the employee exception because the accident occurred during the course of Stephens\u2019s employment by Speedi, which required Stephens to haul liquid lime for BFI pursuant to its contract with Speedi. The magistrate thus found that the contract of hire created a form of vicarious employment of Stephens by BFI.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">BFI objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision. The trial court overruled the objection, but on a different theory. The court reasoned that construing the policy to provide coverage of BFI\u2019s liability to Stephens would unduly expand the coverage that the policy provides because BFI would then have the benefit of broader coverage than Speedi, the named insured, which was clearly within the employee exception with respect to any liability that Speedi might have to Stephens, its employee, arising from the same occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">The relations between the parties to a contract of insurance being contractual, the rules governing the construction and interpretation of contracts generally apply in construing a policy of insurance. <em>Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Pyle </em>(1886), 44 Ohio St. 19, 4 N.E. 465. An unambiguous insurance policy cannot be enlarged or diminished by judicial construction. <em>Kish v. Central Nat. Ins. Group </em>(1981) 67 Ohio St.2d 41, 21 O.O.3d 26, 424 N.E.2d 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">\u201cStated differently, the court has the duty to enforce insurance contracts as made by the parties, and not to rewrite or to distort, under the guise of judicial construction, contracts the terms of which are unambiguous, so long as they do not offend some rule of law or contravene public policy, since courts do not exercise a guardianship over contracting parties. The contract made by the parties will be enforced and no new or changed contract is to be arrived at either by ascribing finely drawn connotations to simple terms or by disregarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>simplicity or plainness of the terms used.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 57 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1985) 334, Insurance, Section 275.</p>\n<p id=\"A75V\">As in the case of contracts generally, it is the intention of the parties that controls the construction and interpretation of a policy of insurance. Where the terms of a policy clearly indicate the intention to provide coverage, its construction must be such as to effectuate rather than to defeat that intention. <em>Rankin v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1912), 86 Ohio St. 267, 99 N.E. 314. The rule of strict construction is especially applicable where an exception is contained in the policy, <em>Am. Financial Corp. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 171, 44 O.O.2d 147, 239 N.E.2d 33, the reason being that the insurance company selected the phrase to be construed and should have specifically excluded the risk if there was any doubt. <em>Burns v. Emp. Liab. Assur. Corp. </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 222, 12 O.O. 18, 16 N.E.2d 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The trial court\u2019s rationale for denying coverage for BFI\u2019s alleged liability to Stephens was that the coverage should correspond to the coverage that the policy affords to Speedi on its liability to Stephens, which is no coverage at all on account of the employee exclusion. That view misconstrues the duty of coverage that a policy of liability insurance creates.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u201cA policy of liability insurance imposes a duty on the insurer to defend and indemnify the insured against claims of third persons for injuries and losses that arise out of an insured risk, occurrence of which creates potential legal liability for the insured. The insurer\u2019s duty of \u2018coverage\u2019 is therefore determined in the first instance by the occurrence of a risk identified in the policy, not by the potential liability of the insured resulting from it. See 43 American Jurisprudence 2d (1982), Insurance, Section 703.\u201d <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Guillermin </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 547, 567, 671 N.E.2d 317, 330 (Grady, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Like the duty of coverage, the existence of an exception to that duty is determined by the occurrence of a risk identified by the exclusion, not by the potential liability of the insured arising from it. Therefore, the fact that the employee exclusion creates an exception to Motorists Mutual\u2019s duty to cover Speedi\u2019s liability to Stephens does not likewise determine that it has no duty to cover BFI\u2019s liability to Stephens. The \u201cseverability of interests\u201d clause at Section E of the policy states that \u201cthe coverage afforded applies separately to each insured seeking coverage or against whom a claim or suit is brought.\u201d This reflects the fact that multiple insureds whose coverage corresponds may be nevertheless subject to different risks, creating a different duty of coverage with respect to the liability of each and a different exception from that duty with respect to the liability of each.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Parties are free to enter into any contract the subject of which is not prohibited by law. Where there is an insurable interest, parties may contract for indemnification of its loss. Speedi may gain some commercial advantage by indemnifying its contractors against losses arising from their liability to Speedi\u2019s own employees. Speedi\u2019s interest in that regard is not defeated because Speedi, which benefits from the workers\u2019 compensation bar against civil liability, is not itself insured against the same loss. Therefore, Speedi may insure its contractors against such losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Having decided that Speedi may insure its contractors against losses arising from the claims of Speedi\u2019s employees, we must next determine whether the \u201cEmployee Indemnification and Employers Liability\u201d exclusion in the Motorists Mutual policy excludes coverage of BFI\u2019s alleged liability to Stephens. We have previously found that coverage generally exists for BFI as \u201can insured\u201d on the basis of the pleadings and the allegations therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The exclusion applies to bodily injury to \u201c[a]n employee of <em>the </em>\u2018insured\u2019 arising out of and in the course of employment by <em>the </em>\u2018insured.\u2019 \u201d The prepositional phrase \u201cof the insured\u201d modifies the word \u201cemployee\u201d to refer to one who is employed by the insured. \u201cThe\u201d is an indefinite article that precedes the noun \u201cinsured\u201d to refer to an insured whose employee suffers bodily injury \u201carising out and in the course of employment.\u201d The exception is thus limited to claims for bodily injury made by an employee against the insured who employs him. It does not apply to the same employee\u2019s claim against another insured by whom he is not employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Our view that the exception is limited to coverage of claims made against an insured by its own employee is consistent with the definition of the bodily injury involved. Injuries \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d are covered by workers\u2019 compensation. R.C. 4128.01(C). An employer who subscribes for that coverage is exempt from civil liability to the employee for the covered injury. Section 35, Article II, Ohio Constitution. Because the employer has no interest to insure with respect to such liability, a general policy of liability insurance will reasonably exclude coverage of it. However, the exemption from civil liability does not extend to anyone other than the employer. Therefore, an employee exclusion in the policy need not apply to any civil liability that anyone else may have to the same injured employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Motorists Mutual refers us to several decisions of other jurisdictions that have applied an employee exclusion to <em>\u201cany </em>insured\u201d covered by the policy, not to the claimant\u2019s employer alone. It also refers us to several decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. We believe that those Sixth Circuit decisions were correctly distinguished by the Court of Appeals of Franklin County in <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1964), 1 Ohio App.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>65, 30 O.O.2d 97, 203 N.E.2d 846. Further, the reasoning of that decision compels us to follow its precedent, as opposed to the several contrary decisions from other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We conclude that the employer exclusion in the policy of liability insurance that Motorist Mutual issued to Speedi provides coverage of the claims against BFI alleged in the pleadings herein. Therefore, BFI\u2019s assignment of error is sustained. Having sustained that assignment, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to the trial court on our mandate to enter a declaration that Motorists Mutual has a duty to defend and indemnify BFI under the policy of insurance that it issued to Speedi on claims arising from the accident of March 15,1995, involving Speedi\u2019s tractor and BFI\u2019s tanker/trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-7\">Brogan and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
