Plaintiffs sought public donations to help with the medical bills for their terminally ill son. In two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>separate articles, the PD criticized the couple for raising money when, in fact, a state program was paying the bills. Thereafter, plaintiffs brought a defamation action against the newspaper and the hospital. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendants. For the reasons that follow we find no merit to plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">This case begins with the tragic illness and death of plaintiffs\u2019 son, Zachary, who, at the age of eight months, was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma, a rare form of liver cancer. Zachary died of pneumoccocal meningitis almost a year later on January 1,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Because they did not have insurance, plaintiffs faced mounting medical bills during his illness. On the day of Zachary\u2019s diagnosis, plaintiffs met with Sheryl Cohen, the UH pediatric oncology social worker assigned to their case. She advised plaintiffs to apply to the Ohio Bureau of Children with Medical Handicaps (\u201cBCMH\u201d). In her deposition Amy Krems acknowledged that Sheryl Cohen advised her that once BCMH approval is obtained, \u201ceverything would be paid for.\u201d Cohen expressly explained to the Krems that BCMH is a state agency that provides financial coverage for specified periods of time. If BCMH coverage is approved, the health care provider bills BCMH directly and receives payment directly from BCMH. Once BCMH has paid the portion of the charge it approves, the health care provider may not bill the patient for the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The first approval letter was received on March 8,1995. The letter stated that plaintiffs were covered from January 30, 1995 to April 30, 1995. At this point, as instructed by Cohen, plaintiffs' sent the BCMH approval letter to all the health care providers that were sending them bills. A second approval letter, sent on July 26, 1995, extended coverage from January 30, 1995 to January 29, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">On August 22, 1995, plaintiffs met with Marge Mordarski, a financial counselor with UH, and gave her all the bills they received that were not billed to BCMH. Mordarski reassured plaintiffs that BCMH would assume responsibility for all the bills. She also encouraged plaintiffs to apply for Medicaid because Oscar Krems had recently lost his job in late July 1995. By October or November 1995, Medicaid became the primary payor for all of plaintiffs\u2019 related medical expenses, retroactive to August 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">During the summer of 1995, plaintiffs sought media help to raise money to help with their situation. In various flyers posted in public places, plaintiffs described their medical bills as \u201cskyrocketing.\u201d On July 30, 1995, plaintiffs issued a press release to local television stations and numerous newspapers. The release stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">\u201cIn addition, the Kremses\u2019 financial journey will continue on. Without a health insurance policy, doctors\u2019 fees, surgeries, hospital stays, chemotherapy and home treatment bills have put the family over $700,000.00 in debt. Fortunately, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Bureau of Children with Medical Handicaps will cover many hospital bills for this uninsured child. However, the Bureau covers only 90 days of hospital stays. Zachary is currently at 80 days and has many more treatments to go.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The release went on to ask the public to send donations to a fund established at the plaintiffs\u2019 church to aid with their \u201cgrowing debt.\u201d Additionally, plaintiffs distributed in public places leaflets which stated that the family had accrued over $700,000 in bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In response to the press release, two local TV stations, WKYC, Channel 3, and WJW, Channel 8, interviewed plaintiffs about their situation in August 1995. During the WJW interview, Oscar Krems estimated that the medical bills were well over $700,000 already and only part of their total medical bills were going to be covered. As a result of the press releases and publicity, plaintiffs received over $3,000 in donations.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">After the story, WJW\u2019s reporter faxed a copy of the press release to UH\u2019s Media Relations Coordinator, Janice Guhl. Guhl then met with UH\u2019s Government Affairs Director, Bernard Weems, and Modarski. They determined that plaintiffs did not owe the hospital anything and that plaintiffs were not in debt $700,000 for Zachary\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">. On August 22, 1995, Modarski then met with plaintiffs. She examined the bills that they had received and told them to direct the bills to BCMH. The outstanding bills for Zachary\u2019s care as of August 1995 totaled $80,119.42. Modarski assured plaintiffs that their balance would be zero because they would not be responsible for any of this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Thereafter, PD writers Laura Yee and Joan Mazzolini wrote an article (see Appendix) published on August 27, 1995, which chronicled plaintiffs\u2019 financial situation and pleas for help. Prior to the story, the reporters interviewed hospital officials and plaintiffs. The headline for this story stated, \u201cHospital says no money owed\u201d and \u201cFamily appealed to public for help.\u201d (The complete article is reproduced as an appendix to this opinion.) Moreover, on September 1, 1995, the editorial staff criticized the family in the weekly \u201cCheers &amp; Jeers\u201d column:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">\u201cJEERS ... to Oscar and Amy Krems of Lakewood, who tugged at the community\u2019s heartstrings with their appeals for money \u2014 700,000 they said \u2014 on behalf of their cancer-stricken baby. But Rainbow Babies and Childrens Hospital officials said the Kremses have no bills because they are covered by the state\u2019s Bureau of Children with Medical Handicaps. Such misguided campaigns give people with legitimate appeals a bad name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">After this column was published, ABC World News Tonight interviewed plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Plaintiffs filed suits against UH, Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s Hospital,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the PD. The cases were eventually consolidated and both defendants moved for summary judgment. In a comprehensive opinion, the trial court held, <em>inter alia, </em>as'follows: (1) the facts reported from the hospital to the PD were literally correct and contextually neutral, (2) the August 27, 1995 article contained no misstatements of fact, and (3) the \u201cCheers and Jeers\u201d column was a non-actionable expression of fact. Plaintiffs timely appeal, raising one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment when the evidence supported each element of plaintiffs\u2019 libel claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In this assignment, plaintiffs argue that they presented substantial evidence to support their libel claims against the defendants. Specifically, on appeal, plaintiffs argue that defendants committed libel by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">\u201c(1) implying the Kremses sought to sucker the public into donating money to a fund that was undertaken for their own personal benefit; (2) stating falsely the family owned [sic] no medical costs when in fact such costs were owed; (3) stating falsely that it had been explained to the family \u2018at the beginning and all through the process of Zachary\u2019s hospital stay\u2019 that \u2018[t]he cost of doctor and hospital procedures to the patient is zero\u2019; and (4) stating falsely that the Kremses had been assigned a billing counselor \u2018at the beginning of Zachary\u2019s treatment.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">After reviewing the articles and the evidentiary materials submitted, we find no merit to plaintiffs\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Under Ohio law, libel is defined as, \u201ca false and malicious publication made with the intent to injure a person\u2019s reputation or expose him to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, shame or disgrace, or affect him adversely in his trade or profession.\u201d <em>Thomas H. Maloney &amp; Sons, Inc. v. E.W. Scripps Co. </em>(1974), 43 Ohio App.2d 105, 72 O.O.2d 313, 334 N.E.2d 494. The elements of a libel action are falsity, defamation, publication, injury, and fault. <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789. See also, <em>Natl. Medic Serv. Corp. v. E.W. Scripps Co. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 752, 573 N.E.2d 1148, in which the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">\u201c[F]alsity is an essential element to a libel action; therefore, a true statement cannot provide the basis for such an action. <em>Driscoll v. Block </em>(1965), 3 Ohio App.2d 351, 32 O.O.2d 506, 210 N.E.2d 899. As Professor Prosser stated: \u2018It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>sufficient [in defending against a defamation action] to show that the imputation is substantially true, or as it is often put, to justify the \u201cgist,\u201d the \u201csting,\u201d or the substantial truth of the defamation.\u2019 Prosser, Law of Torts (4 Ed.1971) 798-799; accord <em>Cooper School of Art v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. </em>(May 8, 1986), Cuyahoga App. No. 50569, unreported, 1986 WL 5294. Thus, appellants\u2019 assertion that the challenged statements were defamatory fails when they failed to establish a prima facie case on the element of falsity, <em>ie., </em>when the record reveals that the published reports were fairly accurate or substantially true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755, 573 N.E.2d at 1150.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In the case at bar, plaintiffs have not established the material falsity of any statements made by the PD or UH. Plaintiffs argue it was false to report that plaintiffs had no medical and hospital costs when they did have outstanding bills at the time of the article \u2014 August 27, 1995. Paragraph four of the article states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">\u201cBut officials of Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s Hospital say the Kremses owe no money for Zachary\u2019s medical care. The officials say the medical and hospital costs have come to less than $100,000 \u2014 not the $700,000 the Kremses say they owe. In fact, the hospital and doctors will be reimbursed for Zachary\u2019s medical care by Ohio\u2019s Bureau of Children with Medical Handicaps.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">This statement was true because plaintiffs had applied and received BCMH coverage first in March and again in July 1995. This coverage was extended throughout 1995. Thus, they were not responsible for any outstanding bills in this matter. The remainder of paragraph four is also true because at the time the article was published the outstanding charges were approximately $80,000, not the $700,000 the plaintiffs claimed, and it is clear that BCMH had already granted coverage for the earlier bills submitted. Moreover, plaintiffs were properly advised that BCMH could be expected to extend the coverage for the remainder of the child\u2019s care.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, paragraph four of the article is not libelous.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Plaintiffs also contest paragraph five, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">\u201cThe cost of doctor and hospital procedures to the patient \u2018is zero,\u2019 said Janice Guhl, a spokeswoman for Rainbow. \u2018All of this has been explained to this family from the beginning and all through the process of Zachary\u2019s hospital stay.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">This statement is true. Plaintiffs admit that Cohen and Modarski told them that their bills would be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">Plaintiffs also contest the truth of paragraph twelve, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u201cBecause the Kremses had no insurance, Rainbow assigned them a billing counselor at the beginning of Zachary\u2019s treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">This statement also is true. On February 2, 1995, plaintiffs met with Sheryl Cohen, who advised the family about coverage of Zachary\u2019s expected medical bills. Cohen explained the BCMH coverage that plaintiffs later obtained. As a social worker, she counseled plaintiffs about the bills and thus could properly be described as a \u201cbilling counselor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Because the truth is an absolute defense to a defamation action, summary judgment was properly granted for defendants. In his well-written opinion granting summary judgment, Judge Curran noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">\u201cThis court is unable to discern any material misstatements of fact much less any inferentially false or defamatory references in the newspaper account; nor is there an expression of opinion which could be stretched into libel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">\u201cIn defending against the pending motion practice, plaintiffs\u2019 <em>[sic </em>] contend that hindsight is of \u2018no moment\u2019 because the newspaper account though evidently prophetically true was false when published. This Court disagrees with that proposition, because it tends to relegate truth to mere metaphysical sophistry. And this Court knows of no case standing for the proposition that a predicted portrayal as such and which [sic ] is known at the time of litigation to be accurate in the cold light of existing hindsight, should be actionable, even if recklessly laid out. But the totality of the circumstances surrounding the story fails to reveal any journalistic predictions. What it does reveal is a failure of disclosure \u2014 an essential failure \u2014 not by the press but by the Krems <em>[sic, </em>Kremses].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">In addition, plaintiffs argue that defendants committed libel by \u201cimplying\u201d that plaintiffs sought to \u201csucker\u201d the public into contributing. This argument fails. Ohio does not recognize libel through implied statements. <em>Ashcroft v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 359, 588 N.E.2d 280. Moreover, the article went out of its way to state that the hospital did not believe that the plaintiffs had a fraudulent purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">\u201cRainbow officials have not accused the Plaintiffs of raising money for personal use, though they are concerned that the family is misrepresenting the hospital in their plea for help. The hospital officials believe the parents might be overwhelmed by Zachary\u2019s illness and the cost of his care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">First, Ohio employs the \u201cinnocent construction\u201d rule, which requires that contested statements be given their nonactionable interpretation. <em>Yeager v. Local Union 20 </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 369, 6 OBR 421, 453 N.E.2d 666. Here, moreover, the article merely reports what the hospital officials said. We decline, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>therefore, to find any liability based on plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the article implied that plaintiffs intended to \u201csucker\u201d the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Plaintiffs finally argue that the PD\u2019s \u201cCheers and Jeers\u201d column characterized them as thieves perpetrating a fraud upon the public. This column, however, was an expression of opinion and, therefore, not actionable as defamation. <em>Vail v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 279, 649 N.E.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-8\">Blackmon, A.J., and Rocco, J., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Laura Yee and Joan Mazzolini, <em>Hospital Says No Money Owed: Family Appealed to Public for Help, </em>Clev. Plain Dealer, Aug. 27,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">\u201cOscar <em>and </em>Amy Krems, whose infant son is fighting a rare liver cancer, look like victims of an inadequate health care system.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">\u201cThe father worked full time, but the Lakewood family had no health insurance to cover what they said amounted to $700,000 in bills for operations, tests, chemotherapy and related procedures that 14-month-old Zachary has undergone in the last seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">\u201cSo the Kremses turned to the news media, aware that hard-luck stories can persuade the public to dig deep into its pockets and give. Nearly $3,500 has come in since two television stations broadcast their story earlier this month. A story on their case also appeared Thursday in a weekly newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">\u201cBut officials of Rainbow Babies and Childrens Hospital say the Kremses owe no money for Zachary\u2019s medical care. The officials say the medical and hospital costs have come to less than $100,000 \u2014 not the $700,000 the Kremses say they owe. In fact, the hospital and doctors will be reimbursed for Zachary\u2019s medical care by Ohio\u2019s Bureau of Children with Medical Handicaps.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-15\">\u201cThe cost of doctor and hospital procedures to the patient \u2018is zero,\u2019 said Janice Guhl, a spokeswoman for Rainbow. \u2018All of this has been explained to this family from the beginning and all through the process of Zachary\u2019s hospital stay.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b47-16\">\u201cThree fund-raisers</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201cRainbow doctors and administrators say this is the third time in less than two months that families have conducted public fund-raisers for bills of a Rainbow patient when the bills actually were already covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u201cRainbow officials have not accused the Kremses of raising money for personal use, though they are concerned that the family is misrepresenting the hospital in their plea for help. The hospital officials believe the parents might be overwhelmed by Zachary\u2019s illness and the cost of his care.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u201cBut at the boy\u2019s hospital room Friday, Amy Krems, 27, said, We\u2019re really upset that they are telling you that the bills have been paid when they haven\u2019t been paid.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u201c \u2018It\u2019s making it look like we\u2019re trying to rip people off, and we\u2019re not.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u201cRainbow officials say they are baffled by the Kremses\u2019 insistence that they have huge outstanding medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">\u201cIn questionable situations, \u2018it can be an honest mistake, or people can be dishonest,\u2019 said Dr. Stuart Youngner, chairman of the ethics committee at University Hospitals of Cleveland, which oversees Rainbow. \u2018The only thing the hospital 'can do is tell the truth when lies or mistakes are made, and to make those records open to scrutiny.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">\u201cBecause the Kremses had no insurance, Rainbow assigned them a billing counselor at the beginning of Zachary\u2019s treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">\u201cThe family applied and qualified for help from the Bureau of Children with Medical Handicaps, a state and federal program that helps families pay their children\u2019s medical bills. The bureau, which is under the authority of the Ohio Department of Health, often pays for medical care for children in families who make too much to qualify for Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">\u201cRainbow officials say the Kremses have been asked to pay only for nonmedical incidentals, such as a $44.37 telephone bill, which are not covered by the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">\u201cIt has been explained to the family, Guhl said, that bills are commonly sent to families automatically while doctors and hospitals wait for insurance or state reimbursement, but that the families don\u2019t have to pay them if they are covered.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">\u201cFamily fears bills</p>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">\u201cAmy Krems acknowledges that a Rainbow billing counselor told her last week that her bills were covered and took possession of the bills the family has received from doctors. Still, Krems said she fears the family might be held responsible for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-15\">\u201cThe hospital said it has sent statements, not bills, showing the amount owed by the bureau for their son\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201cThe family insists that no one has ever been clear that all the bills are covered and will .continue to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u201c \u201cWe don\u2019t know how much we have to pay,\u2019 said Oscar Krems, 29, as he kissed and bounced Zachary on his lap.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u201cHis wife added, \u2018Until I see a zero balance, I don\u2019t believe it. I would not go public unless we had to.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u201cBut hospital officials say they have told the Kremses that as long as they cooperate and continue to apply for state assistance, the bills will be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u201cBecause Oscar Krems was laid off late last month, hospital officials believe that the family will become eligible for Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">\u201cAmy Krems said the high cost of Zachary\u2019s care exacerbates her fear of not being able to pay other bills. Oscar Krems\u2019 weekly $295 unemployment check is barely enough to cover rent and utilities. They say they owe $24,000 on their credit cards, which have been charged to their limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">\u201cOnce Zachary\u2019s treatment at Rainbow is completed, his mother said, she plans to take him to the Preventative Medicine Group, a group of doctors who practice alternative nutritional medicine in Westlake. There is a fee of $700 to begin treatment, which would not be covered by the state bureau, she said.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">\u201cZachary, whose cancer is in remission, was at Rainbow this week for his sixth of eight cycles of chemotherapy. The baby has been in and out of the hospital since his cancer, hepatoblastoma, was diagnosed late January. Doctors successfully shrunk his tumor and were able to remove most of it. But there have been complications since the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">\u201c \u2018I\u2019m optimistic that he can be cured,\u2019 said Eric Kodish, Zachary\u2019s doctor. \u2018He\u2019s not at death\u2019s doorstep by any means, but I don\u2019t have a crystal ball.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">\u201cIf the chemotherapy is not enough, Zachary will need radiation therapy, Kodish said.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">\u201cKrems said she'is worried that their current hospital stay will use the last 10 days of the 90 days of inpatient coverage allotted by the bureau. She said she will apply for additional days.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-15\">\u201c \u2018The most we usually give is 90 days [in one calendar year], but we look at it on an individual basis,\u2019 said Dr. James Bryant, chief of the bureau. \u2018In cases that run over 90 days ... the bureau makes exceptions.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">\u201cCoverage at risk</p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">\u201cBryant cautioned that because the bureau is the \u2018payer of last resort,\u2019 families raising money could jeopardize their coverage. Last year, the bureau helped more than 35,000 Ohio children, paying more than $22 million for medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201cImploring the public for money to pay medical bills has become commonplace, and some medical ethicists say it is a sign of an ailing health system.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u201cVicki and Jay Berger of Mansfield turned to the community earlier this summer to raise $500,000 for their two sons\u2019 bone marrow transplants. They had insurance, but it would pay only $50,000 for the procedures. The family raised $1.6 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u201cBut relying on the charity of others poses problems. The less fortunate, who aren\u2019t as adept at fund raising, can face bankruptcy or a lifetime of bills. In the most tragic cases, people die before raising enough for an organ transplant or other procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u201cAnd goodwill can be exploited. The most publicized case of misuse of money earmarked for medical bills occurred two years ago in Illinois, in the separation of Siamese twins who were joined at the chest and shared a heart. Their father admitted taking $8,000 for cocaine and other personal uses from public gifts meant for his daughters\u2019 care, according to wire service reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u201c \u2018You\u2019re talking about a lot of money,\u2019 said Ed Beer, uncle of the Berger boys and director of the fund-raising effort. T could see where it would be very easy to get caught up in that.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">\u201cLast month, one family in Lorain County went public, saying they needed $200,000 to pay for their child\u2019s surgery, even though private insurance had covered most of the bill, which totaled $60,000, according to Rainbow officials. The fund-raising effort ceased after the child\u2019s doctor contacted the family about the discrepancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">\u201cNo controls by banks</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">\u201cOfficials at area banks say that there are procedures for establishing charity accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">\u201cTom Ross, executive vice president of Mechanics Savings Bank in Mansfield, said money \u2018flowed here in bucketfuls\u2019 for the Berger boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">\u201c \u2018But we don\u2019t have any control over it,\u2019 Ross said.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-14\">\u201cThe state attorney general\u2019s office said the issue falls into a gray area.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-15\">\u201c \u2018We\u2019re concerned about the charitable dollars going to where they\u2019re intended to go,\u2019 said Susan Misc., public information officer at the attorney general\u2019s office. She said state law requires people to register with the charitable foundation section of the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-16\">\u201c \u2018But it\u2019s not our office\u2019s intention to go after sick people and make them register,\u2019 she said. \u2018If we receive complaints that people are giving money and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the payments are going to fly to Las Vegas to gamble, we have investigators that will look into that.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u201cAfter the Kremses went public with their plea for money, Rainbow doctors and administrators took the issue to their ethics committee. They decided to establish a temporary committee to determine the role the hospital should play in families\u2019 fund-raising efforts. But Younger said the responsibility for ensuring that families are truly in need lies with the news media.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u201cEd Beer, uncle of the boys who need bone marrow transplants, said the media asked the right questions when it came to his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u201c \u2018The media began to ask legitimate questions after we reached our mark [of $500,000],\u2019 Beer said. \u2018They began asking, \u201cNow what are you going to do with the rest of the money?\u201d \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">\u201cWhat they did was set up a trust fund with nonfamily members as directors to oversee the money. Once the boys\u2019 medical bills are all paid, excess money will go to other Ohio children with the same genetic disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD, Beers said.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\u201cChurch has accounts</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">\u2018When the couple decided to ask the public for help, they approached Faith Lutheran Church in Lakewood. The church was already involved in raising funds for another local child, 9-year-old Katie Slater, who needs a third liver transplant.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">\u201cFunds raised for Katie are deposited in the church account, and the church then writes checks to the hospital or other health-care provider for Katie, not to the Slaters, said the Rev. Richard Schluep, the church\u2019s pastor.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">\u201c \u2018We wanted to ensure the [sic] that the money goes for what people intended,\u2019 he said.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">\u201cIn the Krems case, however, the family told the church that while most of their medical bills were being paid by the state agency, they had a lot of other medical-related expenses, Schluep said. So the church did not set up the fund to write the checks. The pastor said on Thursday that the $8,500 in public contributions had not yet been given to the family and that he planned to discuss the control of the funds with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">\u201c \u2018They said they had some expensive formula they had to buy that cost $200 or $300 a month,\u2019 Schluep said. The family is buying the supplemental drink Pedialyte, which sells for about $3 a bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">\u201cThe Kremses are comforted by the public\u2019s response. Besides the money, good wishes have been sent to the family. One elderly woman did a nine-hour novena for Zachary, Amy Krems said.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u201c \u2018There are so many good people/ she said. T just can\u2019t believe how caring the world can be.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u201cOnce Zachary is well, the Kremses said, they want to help others.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u201c \u2018We really want good things to come out of this. We realize what is important ... family and friends/ Amy Krems said. \u2018Our goal is to have a farm, raise crops, give to orphanages. We want to help people.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-11\">.
