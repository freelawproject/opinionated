It is not enough to show <em>probability </em>of in jury, \u2014 it must be proved : 2 Daniel on IS!eg. Ins. 545 (notes 1, 2, and cases cited); <em>Syracuse R. R. Co. v. Collins, </em>57 N.

He did his business with the Chelsea Savings Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">On the eighth day of August, 1885, at the stock-yards in ithat portion of the city of Detroit called Springwells, the plaintiff sold to, defendant a number of sheep, for $131.60, and received in payment defendant\u2019s check on Yincent J. Scott\u2019s Banking Office. Scott was a private banker, doing business in the city of Detroit. The parties differ as to what was said at the time the cheek was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The plaintiff testifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u201cWe stepped into the office there, and Mr. Roe made this bill; and he says to me, \u2018You want a check for this ? \u2019 And I said, \u2018 Yes.\u2019 He said, \u2018How do you want that check made payable?\u2019 I said, \u2018I want it payable to order, because I wantt ot ake it home.\u2019 He immediately says : \u2018 All right; if you think my check is not good, go down to the bank and have it certified.\u2019 \u2018 Of course,\u2019 I said, \u2018 it is not necessary to do that. Everybody here knows you, and they all tell me you are good.\u2019 And so he wrote me the check for $131.60. When I got it I inquired of several there, and among the rest was Mr. Sly, a drover, if Mr. Roe was good, and they all told me that M\u00cdr. Roe was A No. 1; so I didn\u2019t think it was necessary to have the check certified, and I put the check in my pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>Wait a moment. Let me call your attention to that transaction. Was anything said to you by Mr. Roe, or by him to you, with reference to your being bothered by currency ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u201c <em>A. </em>I gave him to understand, of course, that I didn\u2019t want to be bothered with currency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>State what he said, as near as you can give it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">\u201c <em>A. </em>I says to him, 1 How much more convenient it- is to do business through the banks than to be bothered with currency.\u2019 Of course, I don\u2019t know whether he made any reply to that at all. I made that remark to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The defendant testified with regard to the transaction as. follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>I call your attention' to the time you gave this cheek to Mr. Holmes. He gave his testimony as to what conversation you had about the check when he said he wanted to-take it home, and the question I put to him was whether you didn\u2019t say to him if he was going to do that he had better get it certified, or get New York Exchange. What is the fact as to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I spoke to Mr. Holmes, and asked him, \u2018How will' yon have this check made,\u2019 \u2014to his order, or bearer ; and he said r \u2018You can make it to my order. I think I will take it home, if I can strike this train coming out here.\u2019 I said \u2018 If you are going to take this home, you can either get it certified or get a New York-draft; that is what you want, to do if you are going to take it home.\u2019 And Mr. Taylor Heard the conversation, too.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">After receiving the check, which was given between 8 and 9 o\u2019clock in the forenoon, the plaintiff went to the depot of the Michigan Central Railroad, where he arrived at about 11 O\u2019clock, where he remained until ab^g^l^jihiloek in the afternoon before taking the train for home. He had-plenty of time, had he been so disposed, to have presented the check at Scott\u2019s bank for payment or certification before the departure of the train.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">He arrived home in Chelsea about 4 o\u2019clock, and deposited the check, with other funds belonging to him, in the Chelsea Savings Bank the same evening. This was on Saturday evening. The Chel\u00e1ea Savings Bank forwarded the check to its correspondent in Detroit by depositing it in the post-office at Chelsea the same evening. The next regular mail from Chelsea to Detroit would be on Monday morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">The check reached the correspondent of the savings bank, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>which was the Mechanics\u2019 Bank, on Monday, the tenth day of August, at about 1 o\u2019clock and thirty minutes in the afternoon ; and on the afternoon of the next day the Mechanics\u2019 Bank presented the check at the banking office of Yincent J. Scott, and demanded payment, which was refused. Yin-cent J. Scott failed on the afternoon of August 10, and his bank closed its doors at 4 o\u2019clock p. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">. The defendant had sufficient funds in Scott\u2019s bank to pay the check, and had it been presented for payment at any time prior to 4 o\u2019clock of August 10 it would have been paid. The cheek was duly protested, and was taken up by the plaintiff, and this action brought upon the check to recover the amount thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The defense is that the check was not presented in a reasonable time, and, because of- plaintiff\u2019s negligence, the defendant is discharged from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The law is well settled' that if the person who receives the check,\" and the banker on whom it is drawn, are in the same place, the check-must, in the absence of special circumstances, be presented the same day, or, at latest, the day after, it is received: <em>Simpson v. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>44 Cal. 139; <em>Cawein v. Browinski, </em>6 Bush, 457; <em>Schoolfield v. Moon, </em>9 Heisk. 171; <em>Alexander v. Burchfield, </em>7 Man. &amp; G. (49 E. C. L.) 1061; <em>Boddington v. Schlencker, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Adol. 752; <em>Moule v. Brown, </em>4 Bing. N. C. 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">If, however, the person\u2019 who receives the check, and the-banker on whom it is drawn, are in different places, in the absence of special circumstances the check must be forwarded for presentment on the day after it is received, at the latest; and the agent to whom it is forwarded must, in like manner, present it, at the latest, on the day after he receives it: <em>Hare v. </em>Henty, 30 Law J. C. P. 302; <em>Prideaux v. Criddle, </em>L. R. 4 Q. B. 455; <em>Griffin v. Kemp, </em>46 Ind. 176; <em>Woodruff v. Plant, </em>41 Conn. 344; <em>Burkhalter v. Second National Bank, </em>42 N. Y. 538; <em>Bond v. Warden, </em>1 Colly. 583; <em>Firth v. Brooks, </em>4 Law T. (N. S.) 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Presentment within the time above stated is only necessary to charge the drawer when the banker has become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\u25a0insolvent or failed between the time when the check was received and the time it should have been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The rule of diligence does not require the presentment to \u2022be made at any particular period within the time limited by the law as a reasonable time; consequently the payee or holder of the check does not lose his right to recover by the stoppage of the bank within the prescribed period, provided the check is presented, though subsequent to the stoppage, within the period : Grant, Bank. 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In this ease the bank upon which the check was drawn, and the person receiving it, were in the city of Detroit, and, in the absence of special circumstances, it should have been presented on Monday, August 10, at latest. The plaintiff claims there were special circumstances which excused presentment within that time, and he bases this assumption upon the plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Nothing is plainer than that the time, may be extended by the assent of the drawer, express or implied. If the plaintiff\u2019s version of the affair is the true one, there was an implied assent to an extension of time; for if the defendant assented to plaintiff\u2019s taking the check home with him to Chelsea, he assented to its being forwarded from that place in the ordinary mode, which would bring it within the second principle above stated, and plaintiff would have had the whole \u2022of Tuesday in which to present the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">On the other hand, if the defendant\u2019s version is believed, then Monday was the latest day upon which it could be presented ; for, according to his statement, he consented to no delay, but, on the contrary, what he said plainly implied that he refused to remain responsible if plaintiff saw fit to take the cheek home. The evidence upon this point should have been submitted to the jury, under proper instructions applicable to the testimony given by each of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\"><em>We </em>agree with the learned judge who presided at the trial that the clearing-house, and the method of conducting business through it, had no bearing upon the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">. It follows that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-10\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
