The motion was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The* respondent company thereupon filed its answer to the petition, showing why it should not be granted, which was also overruled by the court; and commissioners under the statute were appointed, who met, and, after taking testimony in the case and inspecting the premises, found and reported to the court that it was necessary for the petitioner to take the said real estate for public use, viz., for' the use of its railroad for a right of way and crossing, and fixed the damages and compensation to be made therefor, which report on motion was confirmed, against the objections of counsel for respondent written and filed in the case, on the eighteenth day of December, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The land' described and condemned in the petition under the order of the court was a part of the respondent company\u2019s right of way, and at a place where the respondent\u2019s track was built upon an embankment fourteen feet above the general level of the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The proceedings in the probate court are brought before us for review by writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Two main grounds are relied upon by respondent\u2019s counsel to show that these proceedings cannot be sustained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">1. That the' probate'Court acquired no jurisdiction under the petition. :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>2. That the commissioners erred in their measure' of damages and compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-3\">Section 3331, How. Stat., reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\">\u201c In case any railroad company is unable to agree for the purchase of any real estate, property, or franchises required for the purpose of its incorporation, it shall have the right to acquire the title to the same in the manner arid by the special proceeding prescribed in this act; but there shall be no power, except for crossing, to take the track or rights of way of any other railroad company without the consent of said railroad company, except as is hereinafter provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Section 3323, How. Stat., it being \u00a7 9 in the original act, contains 9 subdivisions in describing the general powers and stating the liabilities and restrictions of railroad companies; and the sixth subdivision, in mentioning the powers, says the company is authorized\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">\u201c To cross, join, and unite its railroads with any other railroad now or hereafter constructed, under any law whatever, at any point on its route, and upon the grounds of such other railroad now or hereafter constructed, with the necessary turnouts, sidings, and switch\u00e9s, and other accommodations and conveniences in furtherance of the objects of its connections ; and to make all such business arrangements, as said companies may agree upon. And every company whose railroad shall be intersected by any other railroad shall unite with the owners of such other railroads in forming such intersections and connections, and grant facilities for the same, as hereinafter provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Section 36 of the General Eailroad Law of 1873 \u2014 being How.

S. R. R. Co. v. Grand Rapids &amp; I. R. R. Co., </em>35 Mich. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Mr. Justice Marston, in giving the opinion of the Court in that case, uses the following very forcible language in speaking of the character and property right of the company whose road was to be crossed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">\u201cA repeal of the law under which the corporation was organized would not vest the title to its property in the public. In so far as the corporation is a common carrier, the Legislature has undoubted power to control and regulate it; but in so far as its property is concerned, property taken by it for use in the building and operating its road, so long, at least, as such property is used by the corporation for such purposes, is as.sacredly guarded and protected under our constitution, and is as much beyond the reach or power of the Legislature, as is the property of an individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">\u201c Whatever the right or title of the corporation may be in such lands, whether a mere easement or something greater, whether it may by some be considered public property and by others private, call it by what name we will, practically,- in order for the company to fully enjoy its rights therein, the use must not only be permanent in its nature, at least so long as the road is operated, but it must be exclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">\u201cFrom the very nature*of the construction and operation of railroads', the public cannot use their road in the usual or ordinary manner of using a common public highway. Neither the State nor any of its departments, or municipalities; have or claim any interest in the property or franchises of the company. They neither pay nor contribute towards the purchase of the right of way, or to keeping it in proper repair afterwards. All this is done by the company itself and through its efforts, and the right thus acquired and paid for by the company is as much its property, and of value to it, as would be' a like right, or interest if owned by an individual. \u25a0 - .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">\u201cIn justice, therefore, the corporation should have as clear a right to. compensation for an injury sustained, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>consequence of an appropriation or use of its property by another without its consent, as an individual would.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-3\">If this is sound doctrine, and I recognize it as such, then the same legal proceedings must be had in this case as in the condemnation of private property for public purposes in other eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Impressed, undoubtedly, with this view of the case, the Legislature, in 1883 (Law-s of 1883, Act 174, \u00a7 36), amended the section under which the decision I have just quoted was made, which section as amended, and under which the petitioner has sought to bring the proceedings in this case, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201cAny railroad company desiring to make the crossing or connection mentioned in subdivision six of section nine of this article, after having acquired the right thereto by purchase or condemnation in the same manner as prescribed by the- act for obtaining title to real estate or other property, shall give written notice to the superintendent or assistant superintendent of the company or companies whose road or roads it desires to cross or connect with, of the time when and the place where it desires to make such crossing or connection ; and if said company cannot agree with such other company as to the manner of making such crossing, whether at grade or otherwise, the same shall be determined by a board consisting of the Attorney General, Secretary of State, and Commissioner of Railroads, who shall have power to and shall decide the manner of crossing, and the proportion of cost which each company shall pay for making and for maintaining the same; but the proportion of expense for maintaining the same may be reviewed at any time by said board on .application of either, company, and the proportion of expense again determined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">\u201c Provided, That in determining the manner of crossing the board shall always provide that one road shall pass over the other where the same can be done without injustice to either company.\u201d \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Has the petitioner done so ? and, if it has, is the section of the law proceeded under, as it now stands, constitutional ?</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">\u25a0 As we have shown, it is no longer.in doubt in this State, if it ever was, that the property of a railroad company may. be taken for public use whenever the necessities of the pub-; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>lie require it, to an extent not absolutely necessary to successfully carry out the object and purposes of the franchises granted to the company, and which are in their nature public ; and the land occupied by the company as its right of way may be taken by the State under its power of eminent domain, subject to the single limitation mentioned, to the same extent as the land of any private citizen, for either the use of another railway company or for a public highway. <em>Petition of Rochester Water </em>Commissioners, 66 N. Y. 418; <em>Petition of Boston &amp; Albany R. R. Co., </em>53 Id. 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The section of the amendment of 1883 we are now called upon to consider is numbered, as in the old statute, 36. It provides that after the company desiring to make the crossing of another company\u2019s right of way has secured the right, either by purchase or condemnation, it shall notify the other company of the time and place when and where it desires to make the connection and crossing, and if the two companies cannot agree as to the manner of making the crossing, whether at grade, or above or under the track crossed, then the matter shall be left to the decision of a board consisting of the Attorney General, Secretary of State, and Railroad Commissioner, and who shall also determine the cost each company shall pay for making and maintaining the same. The proportion, however, for maintaining may be subsequently reviewed and modified by the board upon the application of either company.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">It will be noticed that the mode and manner of condemnation are the same as in other cases when resort to such proceedings is to be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The necessity of <em>taking </em>and <em>using </em>the real estate, prop, erty, and franchises required, and the damages or compensation which ought to be made, in a case of condemnation, must be determined by three commissioners or a jury. This may be done under the provisions of this section. Art. 18, . \u00a7 2, Const.; Act 174, \u00a7 36, Laws of 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The section requires the crossing road to be constructed either- ovbr\u00f3runder' the oth\u00e9r :road&gt; wlfere it \u201c can be done' without-injustice to either company,\u201d and whether it shall or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>shall not be so constructed, and whether over or under, is to be left to the board created by the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\">I can see no objection to this provision; nor to the provision that after the crossing is constructed said board shall determine (if not agreed upon by the parties) in what proportion the expense for maintaining the roads at the point of crossing shall be borne by each company.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">But I can find no authority for compelling the company whose road is crossed to pay any part of. the expense of mak- \u2022 ing or constructing the crossing. Certainly it is not for its interest to have, its property thus used,, and while the company, in accepting its franchise, must be regarded as having done so upon the condition that its road might be thus crossed upon being paid reasonable compensation therefor, there can be no presumption that it ever consented to pay for the privilege of being thus injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">\u2022 I know of no law or principle which will compel one company to build and maintain a railroad track for another, or to furnish the money necessary for that purpose; and to the extent that this section of the statute requires this to be done in this class of cases, it-is repugnant to the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The provision of the section which requires- that the company whose road is crossed shall bear some proportion of the expense of keeping the crossing in repair after it is made can only be justified by the necessities of the case growing out of the connection of the two tracks, for the reason that no repairs can be made at the point of crossing which will not extend to both tracks; and the extent of such expense, required to be borne by the company whose track is crossed, should always be limited, as near as may be, to what would have been necessary to keep the respondent\u2019s track in repair at the crossing had the same not been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">This rule should be observed whether the grossing is made on, above, or below grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">It is true that section 36 provides, in case of a disagreement between the parties-interested as to the manner the crossing may be made, it shall be determined by the State officers after condemnation has been had. And it is said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>-such .being<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.the' fact,' the commissioners or \"-jury,'in making condemnation and \u2019assessing the-damages or compensation provided for, cannot take into consideration all the .elements of damage for the want of knowledge in what manner the \u2022crossing will be made; whether such crossing is to be at grade, or under or above therespondent\u2019s track.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">But under a proper petition, and with proper instructions by the court to the commissioners or the jury as to their duty in the premises, I apprehend no difficulty will be experienced upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">If, at the time the damages or compensation are assessed, it is not known in what manner the proposed crossing is to be made, it may be submitted to the commissioners or to the jury to find what the damages or compensation should be in either of the three modes which may be adopted in making the crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">No such mode of procedure was, however, taken in this -case, but, on the contrary, when evidence w\u00e1s offered by the respondent tending to show the different grounds of damage for which it sought compensation in consequence of the \u2022crossing, it was objected to by counsel for petitioner on the ground that all damages in the premises were to be determined by the board created, by the section, and the jury took this view of the case, and only gave the value of the land \u25a0condemned as the respondent\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Any additional expense created in the ordinary use of respondent\u2019s road, or any other injury or damage to its track, right of way, or franchise, occasioned by the crossing, \u2022and which may properly be considered as the natural, necessary, and approximate cause thereof, should be allowed the respondent in cases of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The petition in this case is made by the Toledo, Ann Arbor &amp; North Michigan Railway Company, by James M. Ashley, Jr., one of its directors, and after averring its cor. porate existence, which had been recognized by the proper \u25a0State officers, and its intention to- construct and complete its road from Toledo, Ohio, to St. Louis, Michigan ; that it had 101 miles constructed and in operation; that it had made and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>filed a survey of its proposed Toad\" thrb\u2019ugh the county of Livingston, which it has designated on a\u2019map and filed with the survey, and that it has located its road according to such survey, \u2014 then states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-3\">\u201cTour petitioner further shows that it seeks to acquire' title by special proceedings under this petition to the following described real estate and property situated in said county, of Livingston, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">\u201c A piece of land described as follows : Beginning at a, point 2,277 feet south, 56\u00b0 4' east, from a point 671 feet north from the quarter-post on the east side of sec. No. 1, in T. 2 N., of R. 3 E., on the line between the township of Marion and the township of Genoa, in said county of Livingston ; thence south, 56\u00b0 4' east, 66 feet; thence south, 33\u00b0 56'west, 100 feet; thence north, 56\u00b0 4' west, 66 feet; thence north, 33\u00b0 56' east, 100 feet, to the place of beginning, and being a strip of land 66 feet wide, a plat and map of which description is hereto attached and made a part of this petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201c That the stakes standing and placed in said parcel or strip of land above described mark the center line of said, route of said proposed railroad, and are in the center line of said above-described parcel or strip of land so proposed to be taken, and, for the purpose of .further description of said proposed parcel of land, the said map and survey so filed in the office of the said register of deeds is made a part of this petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201c That the said real estate, land, and property are required for the purpose of constructing, operating, and repairing said railroad and its appurtenances, and that the taking of said real estate, land, and property is necessary for public use; and that the said company has not been able to acquire title' to said property, land, and real estate, for the reason that it has not been able to agree with the owner of said described parcel of land herein described, the Detroit, Lansing <em>&amp; </em>Northern Railroad Company, as to the price thereof ; that it refuses to grant and convey the same for the purposes herein set forth, except on such terms and conditions as jour petitioner deems unjust and unreasonable, and greatly to the loss, detriment, and injury of your petitioner, and at an exorbitant price therefor, and at times refuses to grant and convey the same at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The remainder of the petition is unimportant, though in the usual form and properly verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Responden t\u2019s-counsel claims' that-' the- petition,.is insufficient ; that it shows no effort to obtain, by agreement with respondent, the property before, taking proceedings for condemnation ; that it seeks, by the petition, to obtain greater rights in the respondent\u2019s property and franchises than the law allows in condemnation proceedings; that it does not properly describe the right it seeks, to condemn.,</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">I think the respondent\u2019s objections t.o the; petition .in this, case are well founded, and must prevail, within the decisions of our own Court. <em>Chicago &amp; M. L. S. R. R. Co. v. Sanford, 28 </em>Mich. 427; <em>Mansfield, Coldwater &amp; L. M. R. R. Co. v. Clark, </em>Id. 524; <em>Laue v. Saginaw City, </em>53 Id. 443. , See, also, Dill. Mun. Corp. \u00a7 605 (470).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">It will be seen, in above quotations, the statute provides' that, <em>u </em>in case any railroad company is unable to agree for the purchase of any real estate, property, or franchises required for the purpose of its incorporation,\u201d it may then resort to proceedings for condemnation. How. Stat. \u00a7 3331.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The effort to agree must be a <em>bona fide </em>one, showing an attempt to purchase, by treaty between the parties, the property and franchises described in the petition, and a failure so to do, before other proceedings, can, be taken. This is jurisdictional, and must appear on the face of the petition. It does not so appear. <em>Clay v. Pennoyer Creek Imp. Co., </em>34 Mich. 204; <em>Chicago &amp; M. L. S. R. R. Co. v. Sanford, </em>23 Id. 427; Mills, Em. Dom. \u00a7 107; Cooley, Const. Lim. 528; <em>State v. Hudson Term. Ry. Co., </em>46 N. J. L. 289; <em>Spofford v. Bucksport &amp; B. R. R. Co., </em>66 Me. 44; <em>Smith v. Chicago &amp; W. I. R. R. Co., </em>105 Ill. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The petitioner asks to have condemned more than the statute authorizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">It seeks for a condemnation of the <em>title </em>to the land in the right of way sought to be obtained for the purpose of making the crossing. At most the petitioner could only obtain the right to cross the respondent\u2019s road with its track and cars, and whatever was incident and necessary to the crossing. How. Stab. \u00a7 3323, subd. 6; Act 174, \u00a7 36, Laws of 1883; <em>Grand Rapids, N. &amp; L. S. R. R. Co. v. Grand Rapids &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>I. R. R. Co., 35 </em>Mich. 265; <em>State, v. Hudson Term. Ry. Co., </em>16 N. J. L. 289; <em>Stone v. Commercial Ry. Co., </em>4 Myl. <em>&amp; </em>C. 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\">- It fails to describe the rights and franchises it may condemn, under the statute, or that petitioner wishes to condemn. It has a, right to secure a crossing for its road-bed and cars, and make the necessary connection with the other company\u2019s track for this purpose; and it may also secure the right to cross the respondent\u2019s road with side tracks, and obtain the use of its right of way for the location of switches, provided'such use is not i neon sis teiit' with the use of the road under the respondent\u2019s franchise. These rights', however, are \u25a0 not\" described in the 'petitiori, nor\u2019are they asked to be condemned. The right to the title to sixty-six feet in length of the respondent\u2019s right of way is the property described in the petition, and nothing else: Such a description in the petition for the purpose of obtaining a right to cross another railroad is fatally defective. <em>Grand Rapids, N. &amp; L.
