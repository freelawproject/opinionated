Stat. \u00a7 9151.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">This statute was passed by the Legislature prior to the-national banking system, and could not, therefore, have-special reference to the national legislation creating that system, however clearly the crime of the respondent may be described in the statute. Rev. Stat. 1838, p. 630, \u00a7 27; Rev.. Stat. 1846, p. 666, \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">At the time the alleged act of embezzlement was committed the respondent was in the bank, and in its service, as-clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The question raised in this case is: The federal government having declared the act charged against this respondent a criminal offense, and provided for the apprehension, trial, and conviction of the offender under its laws, had the State \u2022court any jurisdiction, concurrent or otherwise, to deal with \u2022the respondent under the State statute making the same act \u25a0criminal, and providing for its punishment ? The learned \u2022counsel for the respondent claim that the jurisdiction of \u25a0the federal court in the case is complete and exclusive; that the offense charged in the information is for the violation of a federal law; and that the punishment therefor has. become fixed and established, and the whole subject has been covered by the legislation of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The Constitution of the United States provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\"><em>\u201c </em>This constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of- any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d Const. U. S. Art. 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The statute passed by Congress punishing the offense \u2022charged in the information is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201cEvery president, director, cashier, teller, clerk, or agent \u25a0of any association, who embezzles, abstracts, or willfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds, or credits of the association ; or who, without authority from the directors, issues or puts in circulation any of the notes of the association; or who, without such authority, issues or puts forth any certificate of deposit, draws any order or bill of exchange, makes any acceptance, signs any note, bond, draft, bill of exchange, mortgage, judgment, or decree; or who makes any false \u2022entry in any book, report, or statement of the association, with intent, in either case, to injure or defraud the association, or any other company, body politic or corporate, or \u00a1any individual person, or to deceive any officer of the association, or any agent appointed to examine the affairs of any such association; and every person who, with like intent, aids or abets any officer, clerk, or agent in any violation of this section, \u2014 shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than ten.\u201d Eev. Stat. TJ. S. \u00a7 5209.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">An examination of this statute, I think, must convince any one that the offense -described in this information is clearly-defined therein, and falls within the scope of the act, and within the jurisdiction of the federal court, and, if that jurisdiction is exclusive in the case, but little remains to be-said, \u2014 if it is, the conviction cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Is the jurisdiction concurrent with that of the State, is-the only remaining question.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Section 711 of chapter 12 of the Eevised Statutes of the United States provides that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">\u201c The jurisdiction vested in the courts of the United States in the cases and proceedings hereinafter mentioned shall be exclusive of the courts of the several states. First, of all crimes and offenses cognizable under the authority of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The other clauses of the section need not be here given, as none of them relate to criminal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Congress, by law, created the national banking system, and provided for its internal workings, and prescribed a punishment for the offense charged against the respondent. Eev. Stat. U. S. tit. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">It seems to me, clearly, the case is one falling within the paragraph of section 711 above quoted, and that by the federal law itself the jurisdiction of the State is expressly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">Chancellor Kent, in his Commentaries, in concluding his-discussion of the matter, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-12\">\u201cIn judicial matters the concurrent jurisdiction of the state tribunals depends altogether upon the pleasure of Congress, and may be revoked and extinguished whenever they think proper, in every case in which the subject-matter can constitutionally be made cognizable in the federal courts and without an express provision to the contrary, the state courts will retain a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases where they had jurisdiction originally over the subject-matter. \u201d' 1 Kent, Comm. 400.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>And there are other authorities to the same effect. <em>Delafield v. State, </em>2 Hill, 159; <em>Houston v. Moore, </em>5 Wheat. 22; <em>Harlan v. People, </em>1 Doug. (Mich.) 207; <em>Snoddy v. Howard, </em>51 Ind. 411; <em>Hendrick's Case, </em>5 Leigh, 713; <em>Com. v. Hall, </em>97 Mass. 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">It is also held that in eases to which the jurisdiction of the state courts might extend, in the absence of any action by Congress, where Congress does assume jurisdiction, its control then becomes paramount and exclusive. <em>The Moses Taylor, </em>4 Wall. 411; <em>Ex parte Bridges, </em>2 Woods (U. S.), 428; <em>Ex parte Houghton, </em>7 Fed. Rep. 657; <em>Brown v. U. S., </em>14 Amer. Law Reg. 566; <em>Sturges v. Crowninshield, </em>4 Wheat. 139; <em>Prigg v. Com., </em>16 Pet. 539; <em>Martin v. Hunter, </em>1 Wheat. 304; <em>Houston v. Moore, </em>5 Id. 1; <em>State v. Pike, </em>15 N. H. 83; <em>State v. Adams, </em>4 Blackf. 146; <em>Com. v. Fuller, </em>8 Metc. 313; <em>Com. v. Tenney, </em>97 Mass. 50; <em>Com. v. Felton, </em>101 Id. 204; <em>People v. Kelly, </em>38 Cal. 145; 3 Story, Const. Law, 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\"><em>Com. v. Felton </em>states the conclusion of the matter in that case in language quite applicable to the present. The respondent was charged in that case with being an accessory to an embezzlement by an officer of a' national bank. In delivering the opinion of the court Mr. Justice Ames said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">\u201c The difficulty in the way of holding the defendant upon the present indictment is that the act of Congress has taken the crime of the principal out of our jurisdiction, and our courts cannot deal with him upon that charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">As the ease comes to us upon this record, I do not think the judgment should be allowed to stand. The circuit court was without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">The judgment must be reversed and prisoner discharged.</p>\n<judges id=\"b461-11\">Campbell, C. J., and Champlin, J., concurred. Morse, J., concurred in the result.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
