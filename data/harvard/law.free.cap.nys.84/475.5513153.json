The proof discloses that sweeping the sidewalk was among the duties of this servant, and therefore the question whether or not the law imposed a duty upon the owner of the premises to have this work performed is immaterial. It suffices that this was a duty of the servant, and, whether imposed by the employer from personal taste or for some other reason, the obligation arising from the relation of master and servant remained the same. While the defendant did not direct the use of water, the servant made use of it, not in the course of a departure from her duties, but simply because she saw other servants do the same thing and to facilitate the cleaning. Pier general duty being to sweep, and the' object of sweeping being to clean, the use of water for that object, and conOededly to no other end, was within the scope of the employment, under well-settled rules.
