Subsequently the defendant appeared, and moved to vacate such attachment. This motion was made upon an order to show cause and the affidavits of the defendant\u2019s secretary and the defendant\u2019s attorney. When that motion came on to be heard, counsel for the plaintiff stated in open court that the action had been discontinued before the appearance of the defendant, whereupon an order was entered, without reciting the filing of any papers, but reciting that \u201cthe plaintiff appearing, and by way of preliminary objection making it known to the court that the above-entitled action had been discontinued before the appearance of the defendant by order entered herein on the 23d day of March, 1903,\u201d upon motion of the attorney for the plaintiff, ordered, that the effect of the said order of discontinuance be declared to be that the said attachment is vacated and annulled. That order having been entered, the defendant moved upon notice for a resettlement thereof, based upon an affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney stating that the original motion to vacate the attachment was made upon an order to show cause and two affidavits; that the motion was argued at Special Term, and, after the defendant\u2019s counsel had concluded the argument, the plaintiff stated that the action had been discontinued ex parte on March 23, 1903, and thereupon the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to grant the motion; that, after some discussion, a memorandum was indorsed upon the papers: \u201cMotion granted. No costs. Settle order on notice.\u201d Subsequently the court entered an order which declared the effect of an order of discontinuance upon defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">The defendant was entitled to have the papers upon which the motion was made recited in the order. Rule 3 of the general rules of practice provides that, when any order is entered, all the papers used or read on the motion on either side shall be specified in the order, and shall be filed with the clerk, unless already on file, or otherwise ordered by the court, or the order may be set aside as irregular. If it had appeared that the action had been discontinued before the defendant had appeared, such a discontinuance would, in effect, vacate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the attachment, and the defendant whose property was subject to a levy under the attachment was entitled to have a formal order entered vacating it. Corn Exchange Bank v. Bossio, 8 App. Div. 306, 40 N. Y. Supp. 994. He made a motion to have the attachment vacated, and upon that motion an order was made. He was entitled to have the motion papers recited in the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The order denying motion to resettle order is reversed, and the case sent back to the justice to resettle order by reciting papers upon which the application to him was made, with $10 costs and disburse-, ments of this appeal to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
