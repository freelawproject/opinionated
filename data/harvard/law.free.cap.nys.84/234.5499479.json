He was driving slowly. He had his horses over the west track, onto the east track, when he looked again, and saw the car half a block away. Before he could get the hiiid part of his wagon over the west track, the car struck the wagon, and caused the injuries complained of. The evidence was such that the question of the negligence of defendant\u2019s servant in charge of the car and of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was a proper one for the jury. The charge of the learned justice was a correct statement of the law applicable to the case. We can find no reason for disturbing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-15\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-16\">FREEDMAN, P..J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b258-18\">MacLEAN, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"A2f\">The plaintiff, driving an empty two-horse stone truck easterly through mth street, was struck on Second avenue by a south-bound car of the defendant, and in this action charged his injuries upon the defendant. That he looked and saw the car before he got upon its track is clear, but not his direct testimony to where and when. Upon his cross-examination he testified that he saw the car at 112th street as soon as he came out from the house line; that the distance from the first rail to the edge of the street was 43 feet, and he saw the car when he commenced to drive the 43 feet; that his horses were walking, and the car was coming extremely fast, and he kept right on, watching it all the time, and if the motorman did not stop the car he knew he would get struck. The collision occurring at a point where the parties had similar rights and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>similar\" d\u00fcties, the plaintiff might not impose greater duties upon the defendant, or assume for himself superior rights, or recover when the fault of the defendant but equals his own. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
