Municipal Courts\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Claims ex Lege.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b951-5\">An action against an executor by a husband for expenses incurred in the sepulture of his wife, since it arises ex lege, is not within any of the classes over which the Municipal Court has jurisdiction under Laws 1902. pp. 1487-1489, c. 580, tit. 1, \u00a7 1, subds. 1-19.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b951-6\">6. Same\u2014Implied Contracts\u2014Quasi Contracts.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b951-7\">A quasi contract is not an implied contract, within the meaning of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1487, c. 580, tit. 1, \u00a7 1, subd. 1), giving that court jurisdiction of actions for breach of contract, express or implied.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b951-8\">Appeal from Municipal Court, Borough of Manhattan, Seventh District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b951-9\">Action by Charles Pache to recover the reasonable cost of his deceased wife\u2019s sepulture, paid by him before administration was assumed, against Bertha Oppenheim, as executrix, etc., of Eliza Pache, deceased.

Lucas v. Hessen, 13 Daly, 347; Patterson v. Patterson, 59 N. Y. 574, 17 Am. Rep. 384. Unquestionably, the decent sepulture of his wife\u2019s remains is among the husband\u2019s obligations. Patterson v. Patterson, supra; Foley v. Phelps, 1 App. Div. 551, 37 N. Y. Supp. 471; 8 Am. &amp; Eng. of Law, 838; Schouler\u2019s Husband &amp; Wife, 3412. But the absolute duty, at common law, of the husband to supply his wife with necessaries, which was grounded in the fact that coverture denuded the wife of all means (Schouler\u2019s Husband &amp; Wife, 147 et seq., 164 et seq., 167 et seq.), has, since the changes in the law which now preserve the wife\u2019s estate free from the control of her husband, been so far modified that inter sese the husband must supply his wife with necessaries only to the extent that her own means are inadequate for that purpose. Accordingly it has been held that the husband may recover the- reasonable cost of his wife\u2019s sepulture paid by him, out of her estate. McCue v. Garvey, 14 Hun, 562; Freeman v. Coit, 27.Hun, 447. The allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>\u201cthat the defendant is the duly qualified and acting executrix of the estate of said Eliza Pache, deceased, by the due consideration and order of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of the county of New York,\u201d while inartificial, inferentially sets forth that the decedent left a last will, that it was duly admitted to probate, that the defendant was therein named as executrix, and that she was duly appointed and qualified as such. Section 1824 of the Code of Civil Procedure dispenses with the necessity of pleading the existence of assets in an action against an executor or administrator in his representative capacity. The complaint was therefore not insufficient in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">But we conclude that the court below was without jurisdiction of the subject of the action. That an action, upon a state of facts such as is here presented, may be maintained against an executor or administrator, as such, was ruled by the Appellate Division of the First Department in Patterson v. Buchanan, 40 App. Div. 493, 58 N. Y. Supp. 179; the court placing its decision, not upon any express or implied contract with either the decedent or his personal representative, but upon the ground that the charge upon the estate arose ex lege. See, also, Riley v. Waller, 22 Misc. Rep. 63, 48 N. Y. Supp. 535. That being so, the present action does not come within any of the classes of actions of which the Municipal Court has jurisdiction. Laws 1902, pp. 1487-1489, c. 580, tit. 1, \u00a7 1, subds. 1-19. If it be contended that the action is ex quasi contractu, it comes within the ruling of this court (Harrington v. City of New York, 40 Misc. Rep. 165, 81 N. Y. Supp. 667) that a quasi contract is not an implied contract, within the meaning of the Municipal Court act (tit. 1, \u00a7 1, subd. 1). The judgment appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
