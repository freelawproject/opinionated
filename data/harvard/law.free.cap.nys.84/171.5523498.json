The answer of defendant Hyman admits the execution of a bond, \u201cbut denies that the only condition contained therein was that Adolph Hyman should pay to the plaintiff the sum of $200 within sixty days from the date thereof.\u201d The answer also denies that said defendant Hyman \u201cfailed to comply with the conditions of said bond, or that there is now due or owing to the plaintiff the sum of $200.\u201d The said answer further denies the plaintiff\u2019s allegation of a demand for payment, and a refusal thereof, and that no part of the sum of $200 has been paid. The answer of the defendant Eisler is identical with that of the said defendant Hyman, but the defendants appear by separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>attorneys. The plaintiff made a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which motion was granted, and from the order entered on said motion, and the judgment entered on said order, the defendants appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">A frivolous answer is one which denies no material allegation of the complaint, sets up no defense, and is'so manifestly insufficient on its face that a mere inspection, without any argument, will suffice to recognize its defects. Judgment for frivolousness cannot be given where parts of the answer are good, even if the rest be frivolous. Bank v. O\u2019Rorke, 6 Hun, 18; Hull v. Smith, 8 How. Prac. 149; Bank v. Kroder, 13 Misc. Rep. 192, 34 N. Y. Supp. 133; Crucible Co. v. Steelworks, 9 Abb. Prac. N. S. 195. The third paragraph of the complaint alleges that \u201cthe plaintiff has duly demanded the same [$200] from said defendants, but that no part thereof has been paid.\u201d The answers deny \u201cthe third allegation of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\u201d This seems to raise an issue as to the claim that no part of the $200 has been paid.. The answers also deny that defendant Hyman has failed to comply with the conditions of the bond, and they deny that $200 are due and owing from defendants to plaintiff. We think the court below fell into error in concluding that the answers denied no material allegation of the complaint, and were manifestly insufficient on their face.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The judgment and order are reversed, and the motion for judgment on the pleadings denied, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">FREEDMAN, P. J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">TRUAX, J. I concur in the result. The first paragraphs of the answers herein contain denials of a material' allegation of the con&gt; plaint. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
