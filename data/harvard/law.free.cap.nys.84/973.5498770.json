In March, 1903, the principal lease was surrendered, but one of the principal tenants continued to collect the rents from undertenants, at the landlord\u2019s request, and as his agent. The landlord\u2019s purpose, as expressed in his letter to the agent, was to conceal from the under-tenants the proposed tearing down of the building, and thus to preserve the tenancy as long as possible. Upon the evidence, there can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>be no room for dispute that the landlord, in legal effect, accepted the tenancy of this appellant, and that this tenancy was terminable only by service of the statutory five days\u2019 notice. The acceptance of monthly rent from the tenant in occupation was prima facie proof of the relation of landlord and tenant (Morris v. Niles, 12 Abb. Prac. 103; 7 McAdam on L. &amp; T. \u00a7 31) and for a monthly tenancy (Id. \u00a7 39)- There is nothing to rebut the inference of a tenancy as thus arising, and the landlord\u2019s writings, following the surrender of the principal lease, confirm the existence of this tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">A paper described as a notice to quit was offered in evidence for the landlord, after proof of service upon the tenant, but was for some reason excluded; and the record is destitute of proof that the notice essential to the termination of the monthly tenancy (Brien v. Romano, 27 Misc. Rep. 225, 57 N. Y. Supp. 750) was in fact given. The evidence submitted to the jury, therefore, could not justify the verdict, and the motion to dismiss upon this particular ground should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Final order reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
