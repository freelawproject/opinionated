The woman complains that, while walking thereon in the daytime, she fell and was injured by falling or slipping into a depression in the sidewalk which was about 15 feet wide. The testimony for the plaintiff shows that the depression, which was near the curb, was 4 feet long, 11 inches wide, 3\u00bd inches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>deep, and had existed for several years. I think that Hamilton v. City of Buffalo, 173 N. Y. 72, 65 N. E. 944, must control.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
