Upon the trial but two witnesses were called by the plaintiff\u2014himself and the contesting defendant\u2014and upon the conclusion of this testimony the justice dismissed the complaint for failure of proof. 'The ruling appears to be unassailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">From the testimony of both witnesses, it appeared that the plaintiff had entered into a contract with \u201cThe Richards Company\u201d for the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>formance of the work sued for, and, consistently with the theory of his contention that the contracting firm was composed of the defendants, the plaintiff testified to certain conversations had with, and directions received from, the defendants Stevens and Warren. His own testimony, however, was to the effect that he did not know of whom \u201cThe Richards Company\u201d was composed, and the defendant Warren, as a witness for the plaintiff, unequivocally denied his membership thereof. In view of this condition of the proof, the justice\u2019s conclusion that the action was not maintainable was obviously inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
