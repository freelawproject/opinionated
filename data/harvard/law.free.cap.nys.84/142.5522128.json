Concerning each of these matters the evidence was such as to warrant the jury in finding for either party. A letter written by the defendant Niles, especially if taken with the statement attributed to him, would imply that he had undertaken the proceedings on behalf, it is true, of the owners of the property, but under such circumstances that the procuring and submission of evidence relating to values was something for which he was personally to, and promised to, pay\u2014an inference supported by the well-known fact that proceedings of this sort are often, if not commonly, undertaken under arrangements contingent upon success, the attorneys stipulating to bear all the expenses, and look for their compensation and reimbursement solely from the amount of the award. It was not shown by the defendants, nor is it to be inferred from the evidence, that the names of the principals for whom they were acting were disclosed to the plaintiff, or that he had actual knowledge of their names, so as to absolve the agents from the liability assumed by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Judgment should be affirmed, with costs.
