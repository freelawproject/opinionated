We do not think the court below erred in admitting in evidence the mortgages, Friedman\u2019s affidavit attached to one of them, and his application on a fir-or tax certificate; and the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions thereto are not well taken. Judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
