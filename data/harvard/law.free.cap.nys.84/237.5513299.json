From judgments in favor of plaintiff in each case, and orders denying new trials, defendants appeal. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-14\">On March 24, 1900, plaintiff demised to defendants certain premises for five years, from April 1, 1900, at the yearly rent of $3,600, to be paid in equal monthly payments of $300 each in advance on the first day of each and every month during said term. The lease contained the following clause: \u201cThe last two months\u2019 rent of said premises, viz., $600, is paid in advance on the execution of this lease, as follows: $300 cash, and $300 by two notes of the parties of the second part of $150 each, payable in sixty and ninety days. In case this lease is terminated by a sale of said premises before five years from the 1st day of April, 1900, and said parties of the second part have paid in full all rent and surrendered possession of said premises, and otherwise performed all the covenants and agreements therein contained, the said $600 to be refunded to them.\u201d About May 22, 1900, defendants were dispossessed for nonpayment of the monthly installment due May 1st. Thereupon one of the above actions was brought for the rent due, and the other two on the notes, one for each note. In the action for rent the defendants set up the $300 paid plaintiff on account of the last two months\u2019 rent as a counterclaim, and in the other two actions the defendants claimed that by reason of the fact that they were dispossessed of the premises that the notes never became payable.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b261-15\">Argued before FREEDMAN, P.

The decision of the court was in short form, under section 1022 of the Code' of Civil Procedure, and no exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>were filed to such decision. This deprives this court of the power to review any questions of law or of fact. National Protective Ass\u2019n v. Cumming, 53 App. Div. 227, 65 N. Y. Supp. 946; Reiners v. Niederstein, 55 App. Div. 80, 67 N. Y. Supp. 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">But assuming that the defendants had filed exceptions to the de-r cisi\u00f3n of the court below, an examination of the evidence does not disclose any defense to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. By no reasonable construction of the clause in question in the lease can it be held that the $300 cash which was' set up as a counterclaim, and notes sued on, were deposited as security for the payment of rent. The contract between the parties was an entire one, and the defendants were required therein to perform \u201call the covenants and agreements\u201d upon their part. This they failed to do. They defaulted in payment of the rent due May 1, 1900, thereby depriving themselves of the enjoyment of the premises and violating the terms of the contract. None of the authorities cited by the defendants\u2019 attorney apply to the facts in this case. They have reference to cases where money has been deposited as security for rent, and not to a case, as here, where rent is paid in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Judgments affirmed, with costs of one appeal and disbursements in each case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b262-7\">MacLEAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7j\">I concur in the result, on the ground that the parties in their agreement stipulated the only condition upon which the \u201c$600\u201d was to.be refunded to the defendants, which condition was other than dispossession for nonpayment of rent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
