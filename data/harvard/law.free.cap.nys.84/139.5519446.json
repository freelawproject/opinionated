Too late! There is no evidence of any extension whatever by the defendant himself, and, granting proof of an extension by the third person, the Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Company, even with authority so to act, there is no evidence of such extension prior to April 1, 1902. Whatever, if any, extension there was by that company, was after that date, and was not with good and valuable consideration as alleged, and as the law requires. The direction of a verdict in favor of the plaintiff was therefore against the evidence and the law, and the judgment entered thereon must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
