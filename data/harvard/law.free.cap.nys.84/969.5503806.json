The action is brought to recover upon an assigned claim for broker\u2019s commission. The testimony of the plaintiff is to the effect that he secured the defendant\u2019s leasehold for sale, and offered it, at the price named by the defendant, to the party who subsequently became the purchaser. The evidence, however, fails to show that plaintiff\u2019s assignor was the procuring cause of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-16\">It appears that although the parties were originally brought together by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, still, at that time, the parties had not agreed upon'terms. Subsequently, and some weeks later, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>matter was taken up by another broker, who finally consummated the sale by bringing the parties to terms upon a basis other than that which was submitted originally to the plaintiff by the defendant, and by the plaintiff submitted to the purchaser. The efforts of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor were not crowned with success, and it was left to another broker to bring the transaction to a successful termination. As was said by Justice Finch in Sibbald v. B. J. Co., 83 N. Y. 378-383, 38 Am. Rep. 441, <em>\u201cA </em>broker is never entitled to commissions for unsuccessful efforts.\u201d The learned justice further says, \u201cIt matters not that, after his failure and the termination of his agency, what he had done proves of use and benefit to the principal.\u201d And so, in the present case, we are of the opinion that the plaintiff has failed to establish his right to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
