It appears that the plaintiff was disabled for a week and two days, and then went to work, and that while driving his horse the.horse became frightened and ran away, and the plaintiff jumped. The plaintiff then testified that he worked the two days following. He was then asked;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-16\">\u201cQ. And then did you do any work?

No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">There is no proof that plaintiff was hurt as the result of his jumping from his wagon when his horse ran away, and the court charged the jury that the plaintiff could only recover for \u201cthe direct conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>quences\u201d of the accident.
