The evidence of the plaintiff and his witnesses tended to show that the defendant entered and removed the plaintiff\u2019s property from a part of the building other than the \u201cstore floor,\u201d and it was for this unlawful act of the defendant that the plaintiff brought this action to recover damages. But it was a question of fact, and should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
