Upon her motion an order was granted at Special Term \u201cto pay to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys in said action the sum of $250 as and for their counsel fee therein.\u201d The order was entered April 9, 1901, and a certified copy served on the defendant May 10th thereafter. No part of the sum awarded was ever paid, and Mr. Stoddard died May 25, 1901. The plaintiff, who claims he alone of his firm represented the plaintiff in the separation action, presented a claim to the executors of Stoddard, deceased, for said sum of $250. The claim was rejected by the executors, who refused to refer the same, and this action followed to enforce the collection of the sum allowed by said order. The demurrer interposed on the ground that the complaint did not state a cause of action was overruled, with leave to answer in 20 days, and upon failure so to do the interlocutory judgment or order provided for judgment absolute in favor of the plaintiff, and such final judgment was thereafter entered, as no answer was served.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1039-14\">Argued before McLENNAN, P.

Poillon v. Poillon, 75 App. Div. 536, 78 N. Y. Supp. 323. That section permits, among other things, the court, in its discretion, during the pendency of the action, to make an order \u201crequiring the husband to pay any sum or sums of money necessary to enable the wife to carry on or defend the action.\u201d This is therefore a provisional remedy, dependent upon the pendency of the action, and, as the action abates with the death of the husband, its termination necessarily takes the order down with it. Johns v. Johns, 44 App. Div. 533, 60 N. Y. Supp. 865, affirmed on opinion below, 66 N. Y. 613, 59 N. E. 1124; Matter of Thrall, 12 App. Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>235, 42 N. Y. Supp. 439, affirmed on opinion below 153 N. Y. 645, 47 N. E. 1111; Field v. Field, 15 Abb. N. C. 435; Millady v. Stein, 19 Misc. Rep. 652, 44 N. Y. Supp. 408. In the Johns Case the plaintiff, in 1882, obtained a judgment of divorce dissolving the marriage relation, and requiring the defendant to pay to her $2,400 a year, in monthly installments, during her life. The husband complied with the decree until his death in February, 1898. The plaintiff commenced an action to make the judgment a charge upon his estate continuing during her lifetime. The trial court dismissed the complaint upon the ground that the judgment spent its force upon the decease of the husband, and the judgment of dismissal was affirmed on appeal. In the Matter of Thrall, supra, the action had been discontinued after the order was granted allowing alimony pendente lite, and the wife endeavored to enforce the same against the assignee for the benefit of the creditors of the husband to the date of the discontinuance of the action. The court denied her application, and the order was affirmed; the court saying at page 237, 12 App. Div., page 440, 42 N. Y. Supp.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-5\">\u201cAll intermediate, preliminary, and provisional orders necessarily fell when the action ceased to exist. It would have been the same had the complaint been dismissed as to the defendant, in which case it certainly could not be claimed that provisional remedies survive, although judgment had been rendered in favor of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">The disposition of the cases cited rests upon the proposition that the application is a statutory one, and the peculiar relief granted pending the application growing out of the cause of action is merely incidental to the cause of action itself. When the action is ended, the provisional remedies arising out of it terminate also. They are continued along in a pending suit as features of it, and not as independent proceedings. The -code provisions for the enforcement of an order of this kind as by sequestration of the property or by contempt proceedings are all in the action, and exist by virtue of its pendency. The payment of the money to the wife pursuant to section 1769 of the Code is \u201cto enable her to carry on or defend the action.\u201d It is an allowance for the purpose of enabling her to subpoena her witnesses, prepare for and meet the expenses of the trial, including payment of counsel. The money is expected to be used chiefly, at least, to pay necessary expenses accruing after the granting of the order. Beadleston v. Beadleston, 103 N. Y. 402, 8 N. E. 735; McCarthy v. McCarthy, 137 N. Y. 500, 33 N. E. 550. Issue was joined in this action February 13, 1901, and the order directing the husband to pay the $250 was made April 6th following, so that the ordinary expenses incident to the prosecution of the action had not then been incurred to any large extent. The learned court below sustained the order also upon the ground that the services rendered to the wife were necessary, to pay for which she could pledge her husband\u2019s credit, relying upon Naumer v. Gray, 28 App. Div. 529, 51 N. Y. Supp. 222, and the same case, 41 App. Div. 361, 58 N. Y. Supp. 476. It may be, after the discontinuance of the action of separation, so that the wife is received, back by her husband, and is thereafter supported and maintained by him, thus, in effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>ending the same successfully in her favor, that an action may lie by her attorney to recover the value of his services. This case, however, does not come within that principle. It is not an action for the value of the services rendered, but to enforce an order whose scope embraces services and expenditures necessary to the future prosecution of the action. The value of the work done by the plaintiff is not up for determination, nor can we say the value is fixed by the order, for it relates to services never performed. The cause of action set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint depends wholly upon the order for its vitality. If an order for alimony ends with the action, so also must the kindred order for the payment of money to carry it on lose its force when life departs from the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-3\">Another objection to the maintenance of this action is that the award pursuant to the section of the Code referred to is to the wife, and upon the assumption that she lacks the means to prepare for the trial. It is not an allowance to her attorneys, and for that reason this action ought not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\">The final judgment should be reversed, the interlocutory judgment or order set aside, with costs of this appeal, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to the plaintiff to plead over upon payment of said costs with the disbursements of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">So ordered. All concur except McLENNAN, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
