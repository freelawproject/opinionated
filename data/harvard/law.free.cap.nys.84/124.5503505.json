It came out upon the trial' that the defendant, a common carrier, had received three parcels, contents undisclosed, addressed for delivery to the plaintiffs, C. .O. D., with charges for $46.20, which parcels, when opened, were seen to contain goods cut up into the shape of, and to be manufactured into, coats, but which, according to the consignees there, (the plaintiffs here), had not been made up at all, but merely cut into the shape of coats, and would be called, in common parlance, \u201ccut goods.\u201d These cut goods or coats had been sent by the plaintiffs to working tailors to be made up, and -for some reason were, when still unmade up, returned to the plaintiffs, and subject to the unearned charges. After trial the learned justice found \u201cjudgment in favor of the plaintiffs for the possession of the property mentioned in the affidavit and complaint herein, if a delivery can be had, and, if such delivery cannot lie had, then for the sum of $330, as the assessed value of the said property.\u201d The marshal for some reason\u2014it is claimed at the instance and acting under the instructions of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2014 declined to take the three boxes tendered him by the National Express Company, and which were the identical boxes, with contents undisturbed, for the sole alleged reason that their contents did not consist of \u201ccoats\u201d made up, but were only parts of goods; and the marshal thereupon demanded the money value, and levied upon the property of the company. Thereupon the defendant, through his attorneys, moved for the amendment of the judgment by inserting therein in place \u00f3f \u201cthe property mentioned in the affidavit and complaint herein,\u201d the words, \u201cthe chattels replevied in this action being three boxes addressed to H. Monness and Son, 112-114 Bleecker street, New York City, containing parts, to wit, the sleeves, bodies, and linings of coats,\u201d which motion was granted after a hearing. This amended judgment the plaintiffs claim is a nullity, because the justice rendering it had no jurisdiction to amend it after five days from the date of the entry thereof, under section 254 of the municipal court act (Laws 1902, p. 1563, c. 580). But, if the justice had no jurisdiction to amend the judgment, the amendment may be considered as surplusage, leaving the judgment stand as originally entered, and which was so substantially correct that there was no excuse, except. a quibble, for the marshal\u2019s not taking what was tendered him. With this ruling the order appealed from may be reversed, without costs, leaving the judgment as originally entered as sufficient warrant for the process issued to the marshal to take the goods already tendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Order appealed from reversed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
