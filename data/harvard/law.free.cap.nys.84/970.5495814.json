The plaintiff claims that certain of his-merchandise was damaged by water which overflowed from a faucet attached to a dentist\u2019s chair in the premises occupied by the defendant. The defendant claims that error was committed by the court below in'its ruling on questions of evidence as follows: The plaintiff had given evidence as to the value of certain merchandise claimed by him to have been damaged. The following then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-16\">\u201cQ. What became of all these goods? A. I have them. Q. What are they worth? (Defendant\u2019s counsel objected as calling for a conclusion. The Court: Objection sustained.) Q. Are those goods worth as much now as they were before? (Defendant\u2019s Counsel: Objected to as incompetent and improper. The Court: Objection overruled. Exception.) A. No, sir. Q. They are not? A. No, sir. Q. Are they of any use to you at all? (Defendant\u2019s Counsel: Objected as incompetent, immaterial, and irrelevant. .The Court: Objection overruled. Exception.) A. No, sir. * * * Q. In all, you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>say the goods are not worth\u2014or you say that the goods are worth nothing to you. What damage did you sustain? (Defendant\u2019s counsel objected as calling for a conclusion. The Court: Objection overruled. Exception.) A. $228.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">In our opinion this evidence was clearly incompetent. It was immaterial whether the water damaged goods were of use to the plaintiff. The question was, what were the goods worth in the market in their damaged condition?</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
