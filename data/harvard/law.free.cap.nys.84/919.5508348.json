M. Van Name,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-17\">\u201cGeneral Manager.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-18\">There is practically no dispute but that the plaintiff drilled, blasted, and removed dirt, etc., and furnished sand and stone, to the amount of $1,533.50, at the agreed prices, and that the defendant paid to apply thereon $784.50. The defendant, however, set up as a counterclaim that the blasting and drilling to be done by the plaintiff were in connection with the building of an extension of a church situated in 166th street, which extension defendant had contracted to build; that by reason of the negligent, improper, unskillful, and careless manner\u2014and in violation of the ordinances of the city\u2014in which blasting was done, the rear wall of the church was damaged, and defendant was compelled thereby to tear down and rebuild said rear wall, to its damage of $1,600. There was testimony introduced on the part of the defendant from which the jury would have been justified in finding that the work done by the plaintiff was not done in accordance with the ordinances of the city'of New York in force at the time, and competent and material evidence as to the size and weight of the blasting charges used by plaintiff, the preparation of the holes for the charges, the weight put upon the blasts, and the effects of the blasts upon the walls of the church, was excluded by the court, upon objection by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and exception taken to the rulings by the defendant\u2019s counsel. Had the excluded testimony been admitted, there would have been a question of fact for the consideration of the jury upon the question of plaintiff\u2019s negligence, and a new trial must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"Azp\">Judgment reversed. New trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
