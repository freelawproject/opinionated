The necessity and materiality of this evidence for use upon the trial, and the fact of the agent\u2019s peculiar knowledge, sufficiently appear from the affidavits and from the circumstances of the case as disclosed by the complaint. The controversy arises between principal and agent, and in such a case the technical rules insisted upon by the appellants are to be relaxed in the interest of a full and fair disclosure. Whitman v. Keiley, 58 App. Div. 92, 95, 68 N. Y. Supp. 551. Within the authorities, these papers were sufficient to support the order for the defendants\u2019 examination. Com. Pub. Co. v. Beckwith, 57 App. Div. 574, 68 N. Y. Supp. 600; Insurance Press v. Montauk Fire Co., 70 App. Div. 50, 74 N. Y. Supp. 1093. And there appears to be no substantial merit in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
