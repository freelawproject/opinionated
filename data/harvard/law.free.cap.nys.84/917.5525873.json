The advantages possessed by the justice below in hearing the - testimony as given enters to some extent into the inquiry upon a review of his direction of a new trial after verdict (Lund v. Spencer, 42 App. Div. 543, 59 N. Y. Supp. 752), and the order is not to be disturbed unless actual and obvious injustice has resulted from this exercise of discretion at the trial (Id.). It appears to us that there was not only no injustice to the defendant in this case, but that the trial justice\u2019s discretion was quite commendably exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.
