This admission suffices prima facie for the regularity of the defendant\u2019s claim to possession, and, while it would appear that there was some contention as to the proper form of a paper purporting to be the judgment, the record before us does not present the contents of the paper; and we have no ground for holding, with the appellant, that the defendant\u2019s possession is founded upon proceedings which might be. assailed as irregular or void. Not only is it admitted that the execution was issued upon a \u201cjudgment rendered,\u201d- but the plaintiff\u2019s attorney seems to have admitted the fact of the \u201centry\u201d of-this judgment in. the course of his offer of the execution in evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>there is nothing before us to show any invalidity in the judgment. See Risk v. Uffelman, 7 Misc. Rep. 138, 27 N. Y. Supp. 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The defendant\u2019s possession being justified by the only proof submitted, so far as we may hold, the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
