The plaintiff\u2019s right of possession was therefore complete at the date of the alleged wrongful taking by the defendant, and the authorities relied upon in support of this appeal have no application. After default the mortgagor had no interest in the chattels which could be sold on execution against him (Leadbetter v. Leadbetter, 125 N. Y. 290, 26 N. E. 265, 21 Am. St. Rep. 738), and the conversion was certainly established. In view of the defendant\u2019s failure to produce the inventory of the property sold, the plaintiff\u2019s evidence of value,-taken with proof of the defend^ ant\u2019s admission that the goods covered by the mortgage were sold, suffices to support the finding of the amount of damages, and it would seem from the record that the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses on the issue of the identity of the goods were the more credible. The measure of damage was the value of the property irrespective of the mortgage debt,' the difference being the subject of an accounting between the parties to the mortgage. Bigelow v. Goble, 9 App. Div. 391, 397, 41 N. Y. Supp. 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
