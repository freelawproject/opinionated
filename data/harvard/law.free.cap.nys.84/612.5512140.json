The affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney, made after the bill was taxed, indicates only that a general objection to the taxation of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>costs was interposed. There is no statement of the grounds of objection. The record should show what items in the bill were objected to, and the grounds thereof, in respect to each item objected to. Lotti v.
