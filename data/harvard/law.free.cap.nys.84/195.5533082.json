More adjournments than amenities had been had by the respective counsel, until, having been passed for several successive days upon the day calendar because of the engagements of successive counsel of the plaintiffs, on February 26th the case was set to be tried on the following morning. During that day the defendant became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>so ill that he was obliged to keep to his bed, of which fact word was sent his attorney, who saw the physician, and received a verified certificate of the illness of defendant, and that to leave his house might endanger his life. On the evening of the same day, defendant\u2019s counsel, who had been informed of the defendant\u2019s inability to attend court, went with a priest and other persons to Albany to lay before'the Governor newly discovered evidence relating to a man under sentence of death, and who had been given a brief respite. Inexplicably, at least unexplained here, defendant\u2019s attorney asked an adjournment, on the following morning, only upon the ground of actual engagement of counsel before the executive\u2014not a reason enumerated in the rules of practice of this department. The adjournment was refused, and the default allowed. It goes without saying that, had he presented the verified certificate of the defendant\u2019s illness, the application would have been granted. These facts being presented and not contradicted, the motion to open the default was granted, without costs, and affirmed in a judicious exercise of discretion. None of the-cases cited sustain the appellants\u2019 contention respecting the affidavit of merits, not phrased exactly in the customary form, it is\u2019 true, but substantially meeting the requirements of the. rule under the revised procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The appeal is dismissed, with costs to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
