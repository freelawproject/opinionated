This was reversible error. Disregard of the duly established rule of the road would not necessarily constitute contributory negligence in the driver, but, if found, it would be a circumstance within the consideration of the jurors, as every man proceeding lawfully may rightfully assume that others will conform their conduct to the requirements of statute and 'regulations having the force of statute. Knupple v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., 84 N. Y. 488. Moreover, it was also error to exclude inquiry into the amount of the claim of the plaintiff\u2019s chief witness against the defendant. A witness may be cross-examined as to facts showing his favor towards the party calling him, the extent of his own interest in the case, and his bias, although the range of examination may be limited by the trial judge. For these errors the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
