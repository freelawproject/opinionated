Whether the statement introduced to show a settlement of accounts was inconsistent with the claim in suit depended upon the value of the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that this claim was not embraced within the account deemed by the parties to be adjusted, and was reserved from the settlement; and, while a point is made by the defendant of the plaintiff\u2019s \u201crepayment\u201d of loans made by the former without deducting the amount of this claim, it appears that the repayment was in the form of work, not cash, so the inference sought to be drawn is not cogent.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
