The relator has acted and is acting as superintendent of the penitentiary under a salary prescribed by statute, to which he is clearly entitled. He has not been removed by the commission, and, if the right of the commission to remove him be assumed for the argument, until he is removed he is entitled to full for services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"pATqY\">The order should therefore be affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
