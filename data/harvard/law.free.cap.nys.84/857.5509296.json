That these facts, notwithstanding the respondent\u2019s express refusal to accept the check in full discharge of any further demand, constituted an accord and satisfaction, and precluded him from any further recovery upon the account, was held in Fuller v. Kemp, 138 N. Y. 231, 33 N. E. 1034, 20 L. R. A. 785; and Jackson v. Volkening, 81 App. Div. 36, 80 N. Y. Supp. 1102. The rulings of the court below to the contrary, therefore, to which due exception was taken, present error, for which the judgment appealed from must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">Judgment reversed, and judgment ordered for defendant (appellant), with costs.
