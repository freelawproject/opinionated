J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdWl\">This action was brought to recover penalties prescribed for an alleged violation of the act commonly known as the \u201cForest, Fish and Game Laws\u201d (chapter 20, p. 22, Laws 1900). The complaint charges the defendant with having \u201cunlawfully, willfully, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>and knowingly possessed four quail during the close season for quail, contrary to the form of the statute in such cases made and provided.\u201d The section claimed to have been violated is section 28, which provides that \u201cquail shall not be sold or possessed during the close season,\u201d etc. The penalties imposed are one for $60, and an additional one for $25 for each bird or part of a bird taken or possessed in violation of the act, and also declaring the offending party guilty of a misdemeanor. The complaint in this action contained no allegation as to the nature of the business carried on by the defendants, nor was there any proof offered on the trial as to what kind of business the defendants were engaged in. The only proof adduced on the trial was that given by one John E. Overton, who was a state game constable, and who testified that he was entitled to receive one-half of the penalty collected, after expenses are deducted; and one Franklin N. Moore, who was in company with Overton at the time he testified the quail were eaten. This action being a qui tam action, the proof must be strict. \u201cEvery fact necessary to constitute the offense for which the recovery is sought must be averred, and no intendments are allowed in favor of the per7 son for whose benefit the suit is brought.\u201d Higgins v. Dakin, 86 Hun, 461, 33 N. Y. Supp. 890; People ex rel. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 72 Ill. App. 569. Wood\u2019s testimony is the most favorable of any given in the case to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. He'testifies that Overton and himself, with two young ladies, on the evening of the 18th of February, 1902, went into the defendants\u2019 place about half past 11. \u201cWe ordered quail from the waiter, and he said, T will have to see,\u2019 and he went back and spoke to some one in the rear of the place\u2014ostensibly the manager\u2014and afterwards he came back, and said it was all right, and he served us with four quail.\u201d The quail were eaten by the party, and this action was brought. This is the only testimony in the record that in any way points to defendants. It is admitted by the witnesses that they did not see either of the defendants about the place. Who the waiter or manager was does not appear, if in fact there was a manager at all, and the only proof in support of the complaint is that some one in the premises of the defendants called by the witnesses a \u201cwaiter\u201d served said witnesses with quail. This fails to show possession in fact in the defendants, and the decision of the trial justice in dismissing the complaint in view of the nature of this action upon the meager facts shown was correct. In the case cited by the appellant\u2014 People v. Buffalo Fish Co., 164 N. Y. 99, 58 N. E. 34, 52 L. R. A. 803, 79 Am. St. Rep. 622\u2014actual possession in the defendant was shown, and the court there held that the burden was cast upon the defendant of proving such possession was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b282-6\">GILDERSLEEVE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWb\">I concur in the opinion of the Presiding Justice. It cannot be said, except from inference, that defendants were proprietors of the business in which the waiter was employed who served the quail, nor that the waiter was employed by defendants. There is no proof that any of the defendants were present at the time the quail were served. Upon the proof offered, the court could not deny the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint without assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>by inference that which the plaintiff was bound to establish by direct and conclusive proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b283-6\">TRUAX, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AMo\">I am as fond of quail, in season and out of season, \u00e1 la broche, au laurier, aux petits pois, au grat\u00edn, aux laitues, en cronstades, \u00e1 V Anglaise, aux truffes, \u00e1 la poile, \u00e1 la cendre, aux ecrerisses, vous la ceudre, au salficon, en compote, au basilic, aspic, galantine, chandfroid, bisque of quail, pate chand, tourte de quails, or any other way, as is either one of my associates, but I cannot concur in the conclusions reached by them. It is alleged in the complaint in this action, and admitted by the answer, that the defendants were engaged in business at 761 and 763 Sixth avenue in this city. The evidence shows that the business carried on there was that of a restaurant. On the trial the witnesses called it a restaurant, and it was frequently referred to as the premises of the defendants and as Mr. Dunston\u2019s restaurant. The evidence shows that, quail were purchased on the premises mentioned in the complaint from a waiter who was employed in the restaurant. This evidence was not disputed by the defendants, and but one conclusion can be drawn from the evidence, and that is that the defendants had quail in their possession on the day testified to by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
