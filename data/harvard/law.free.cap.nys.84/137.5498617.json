He asked me for the August rent. I told him, under the circumstances, I did not intend to pay any more rent, as he had not fulfilled his contract. He said, \u2018You better give me possession of the premises,\u2019 and I said I would as soon as I could make it convenient to get out. * * * I made my arrangements as fast as I could, and I did get out in the'month of August. Mr. Ewing [plaintiff] gave me instructions to surrender the key to the janitor. I did surrender the key to the janitor on the 29th or 30th of August.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-20\">Under this evidence, the court should have left the question of surrender and acceptance to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-21\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
