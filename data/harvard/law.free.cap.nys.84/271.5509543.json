Three were to the exclusion, upon the plaintiff\u2019s redirect, of questions calling for testimony he had already given; three others were to permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>ting a witness to explain on his redirect what he had said on his cross; another was to the court\u2019s refusal to charge that the rights of the plaintiff and his truck and the defendant\u2019s car were equal on Second avenue, which, as the collision was on a block between the streets, would have been contrary to settled law (Fleckenstein v. Railroad Co., 105 N. Y. 656, 11 N. E. 951); another, to a negative conclusion of law, applicable only to a situation not shown in the evidence; still another, to using the words \u201cif imprudent\u201d in a paraphrase of the familiar doctrine as to contributory negligence, which had been charged more than once in more customary form; and lastly to referring to a police officer as the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s witness,\u201d which in that form occurs nowhere in the charge but only that \u201cthe plaintiff himself put upon the stand a policeman,\u201d and that was fact. Each of the rulings and remarks adverted to was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
