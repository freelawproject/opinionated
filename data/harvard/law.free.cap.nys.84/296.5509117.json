Western Union Telegraph Co., 156 N. Y. 75, 78, 50 N. E. 500, 66 Am. St. Rep. 537. That the defendant Williams was the son-in-law of his codefendant, or that after the collision the latter stated that the horse or wagon, or both, belonged to his sonrin-law, or that the son-in-law, the day after the accident, said, \u201cI am very sorry that it happened, and if he wouldn\u2019t ask too much, I would settle it in a decent way,\u201d even if in particular undenied, was clearly insufficient to bring him within the- application of the rule, in the face of the sworn testimony of the two defendants, not otherwise impeached or contradicted, that Pontin was the owner of the horse, had borrowed the wagon, and at the time of the accident was not in the employment of his son-in-law, but was driving on his own account, favoring another. The judgment against the defendant Williams must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">Judgment against defendant Williams reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
