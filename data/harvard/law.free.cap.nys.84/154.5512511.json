Prior thereto, and March 7th, the plaintiff received a letter from the defendant\u2014a registered letter\u2014countermanding the order. In this, its action for the purchase price, judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>court below \u201cfollowing the decision of Ideal Cash Register Company against Frank S. Zunino, decided November, 1902, by the Appellate Term,'\"\u2019 and the defendant appeals, contending no liability because no contract. He is right, for his statement that he would not countermand, being without consideration, was not binding, and acceptance or acts tending thereto by the plaintiff, subsequent to the revocation of the order, were unavailing and ineffectual. The case of Ideal Cash Register Co. v. Zunino, 39 Misc. Rep. 311, 79 N. Y. Supp. 504, is distinguishable, in that the order there given was accepted by the plaintiff, and was treated as a contract by the parties; the defendant contending that the plaintiff had mistaken its remedy, not that it had no remedy. The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Judgment reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
