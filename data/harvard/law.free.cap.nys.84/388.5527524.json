The husband is liable for actual necessaries furnished to his wife, unless he has made adequate provision for her maintenance, even though they are living separate. Hatch v. Leonard, 165 N. Y. 435-438, 59 N. E. 270. As long as the marriage relation continues, the obligation of the husband to support his wife remains. In this case the defendant left his wife\u2014it may be, for reasons which amply justified his departure. She is still his wife, however. He declined to maintain her in his own household, and must make necessary provision for her elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">The plaintiff had previously rendered services to the wife on the faith of the payment by the husband. These services were adjusted by a compromise and payment, and the defendant then informed the plaintiff \u201cthat he would not be responsible for any further services which the plaintiff might render\u201d the wife. The services in controversy were performed after this notification, and the defendant urges that circumstance as a reason why he is not liable. This position would be impregnable if he had provided suitable medical attendance for her, or given her the means to procure it. A husband living separate from his wife may determine in a large measure in what way his credit is to be pledged, and in what manner the marital duty of providing for his wife is to be fulfilled. If, however, he forbid one from running an account against him for necessaries furnished for.his wife, in order to make the prohibition effective he must otherwise supply her needs, or permit her to. pledge his credit elsewhere. He must perform the obligation in some fair way. In the present case he directed 'the plaintiff to abstain 'from performing services concededly necessary for his wife, but made no other provision for her for this necessity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>He endeavored to be relieved wholly from the liability resting upon him. This he may not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The plaintiff is entitled to judgment for $50, and interest from December 1, 1902, besides costs and disbursements of the action. All concur; WILLIAMS, J., in result only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
