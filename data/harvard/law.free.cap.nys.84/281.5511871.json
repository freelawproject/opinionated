Inability to account for an article is not enough. Nor is there proof that it was stolen or wrongfully taken from their \u25a0 possession. The defendant exhibited some title to the chattel by him \u2014testimony to its purchase in midsummer from a person, whom he named. Judgment was rendered that the defendant recover the property mentioned, or, in the event of nondelivery, the sum of $6o, as the assessed value of the property. The award of $6o was error, there being no evidence of its value \"beyond the price paid by the defendant for the machine, and so the judgment must be modified by striking therefrom such sum in the alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Judgment modified by striking out such sum in the alternative, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs.
