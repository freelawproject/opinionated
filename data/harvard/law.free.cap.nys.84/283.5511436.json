Rod and defendant firm, and the assignment of Rod\u2019s claims to the plaintiff. The answer of the defendants, among other things, denies these, allegations. At the trial the plaintiff clearly failed to establish the statement of either of the accounts sued upon within the rules applicable to such a cause of action, and the complaint was properly dismissed at the close of his case. But the dismissal should not have been upon .the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">Judgment modified by striking out the words \u201cupon the merits thereof,\u201d and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs to either party upon the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
