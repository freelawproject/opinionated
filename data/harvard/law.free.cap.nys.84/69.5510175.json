The action is to recover $5,000, of which the plaintiff alleges he was defrauded through a conspiracy entered into between the defendants. In the complaint he alleges, among other things, that the defendant machine company, \u201cby and through its officers, agents, and servants, did * * * conspire\u201d to defraud him. If by this it is intended to restate what in another place is alleged\u2014\u25a0 that the officers referred to were these defendants\u2014then it will be easy for the plaintiff to so state; and if there are other officers and agents of the company whom it is claimed took part in the conspiracy, then the appellant is entitled to have their names given. So, too, with respect to the allegations which the plaintiff makes that the false and fraudulent statements and representations were made to him \u201cor his duly-authorized agent or agents,\u201d the defendant is entitled to know the names of such agent or agents, to the end that he may not be surprised upon the 'trial as to the identity of the persons to whom it is claimed the representations were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">Except in these two respects, the application was properly denied. The order accordingly should be modified by requiring the plaintiff to furnish these particulars, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-17\">Order modified, as stated in opinion, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
