The agreement is somewhat peculiar. The appellant leased to the respondent for a period of years a certain plot of ground accurately described, with an option of purchase, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\">\u201cAnd it is mutually agreed between the above-named parties as follows: That the said lessee shall have the privilege of purchasing said premises and the land of the said lessor adjoining on the east at a price not to exceed $3,000 at any time during the term of this lease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The demised premises and the land adjoining on the east comprised together a single plot of ground of the uniform depth of 125 feet, acquired by the appellant by deed from her husband. The leased part was a little less than half of the lot, and the circumstances left no room for doubt about the identity of the land \u201cadjoining on the east.\u201d The language used clearly indicates the intention of the parties to include all the land of the lessor adjoining the demised premises on the east, and the extrinsic evidence showing the unity of the plot necessarily served to render the description definite and certain. Such evidence was competent. See, upon both propositions, Fish v. Hubbard\u2019s Adm\u2019rs, 21 Wend. 651; Richards v. Edick, 17 Barb. 260; Tallman v. Franklin, 14 N. Y. 584; Thayer v. Finton, 108 N. Y. 394, 15 N. E. 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The agreement on the part of the respondent to hire and pay rent for the demised premises is a sufficient consideration for the option of purchase as to the adjoining land as well as to the land directly covered by the lease. The inference is that the respondent would not have leased the land and have become bound for the rent without receiving the privilege of purchasing the entire tract. The ambiguity as to the purchase price is more apparent than real. The right to purchase at the full sum' of $3,000 is absolute, and that amount has been tendered and is required to be paid by the terms of the judgment, less only the amount of a specific lien upon the property duly acquired by the respondent as tenant under the terms of a prior judgment in foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The other points raised by the \u2022 appellant do not seem to require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
