The evidence justified a finding to the contrary, supported, also, by the actual custom of these parties in their dealings; The pleadings being oral, the failure to demand interest in the complaint does not affect the plaintiff\u2019s rights, and, while an item of interest is not stated in the bill of particulars, there was no error in the allowance of interest as a matter of substantial justice. It appears, however, that a very material mistake was made in the computation upon which the judgment was founded. Th.e item of commissions at per cent, on sales of $13,110.53 is actually $983.29,. but the justice has accepted the plaintiff\u2019s statement that the computation results in $1,083.31. Obviously, the recovery so far cannot be supported, but, the other items being correct, the judgment will be affirmed, if properly reduced. The reduction, with the proportionate interest allowed, should be $105.84. If the .respondent consents- to a modifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>tion to this extent, the judgment will be affirmed, with <em>costs; </em>otherwise judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
