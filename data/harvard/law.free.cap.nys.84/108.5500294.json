Wh\u00e9n a 'few feet west of the westerly intersection of Fulton street with Hudson avenue, the driver turned to take a diagonal course across from that point to the northeast corner of those two streets. At the time the wagon -was turning upon its new course one of the defendant\u2019s cars was approaching from the east on the northerly track, as the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses say, at a speed much greater than is usual, and was at that time, according to their evidence, some eight or ten feet east of the easterly crosswalk at the junction of these two streets. Upon the westerly crosswalk, a distance of 46 feet from the easterly crosswalk, the rear wheel of the conveyance in which the plaintiff was riding was struck by this car. In an effort to save himself from hurt, the plaintiff jumped from the wagon towards the west an instant before it was struck by the car, but the collision threw the wagon upon him, and he was injured. At the end of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant rested without offering any evidence, and the court directed a verdict in its favor, from which direction, and from an order deny-ing plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, he appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">We think this case should have been submitted to the jury. From the map which is in evidence we may fairly assume that Hudson and Flatbush avenues, in the borough of Brooklyn, comprise what has been termed a continuous line of traffic. It is true that their direction is not identical, but it is within a few degrees, and, although the \u25a0 opening of Hudson avenue into Fulton street is not directly opposite the head of Flatbush avenue, yet the most westerly point of the east line of Flatbush avenue is directly south of the most easterly point \u2022of the western curb of Hudson avenue, and, as to that rule of law which holds that street railroad companies and other users of streets have equal rights at their intersection, this location must be held to be such an intersection. The case is similar to Brozek v. Steinway Railway Co., 23 App. Div. 623, 48 N. Y. Supp. 345, where it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>held that Honeywell street was a practical continuation of Blackwell street, and Bresky v. Third Avenue R. R. Co., 16 App. Div. 83, 45 N. Y. Supp. 108, where Roosevelt street, in the borough of Manhattan, and Baxter street, were held to be practically continuous. Under the doctrine of these cases the accident to this plaintiff occurred at a street crossing, and the law applicable to such a state of facts must control. The parties had equal rights, and each was bound to respect those of the other. It is established by the evidence that no effort was made to stop defendant\u2019s car, although it was going at a greater rate of speed than usual, until it had traversed one-half of the distance between the two crosswalks opposite the respective sidewalks of Hudson avenue. Although the car was 70 feet from the plaintiff at the time his wagon started to turn across the northerly track, the defendant\u2019s agents made no attempt to stop it until it had approached to within 25 feet of plaintiff\u2019s conveyance, too late to avoid the accident. These facts, having regard to the physical situation, presented the defendant\u2019s negligence as a question for the jury\u2019s determination, and to direct a verdict against the plaintiff was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">But it is urged that the law applicable to intersecting streets has no bearing upon the rights of the parties in this case, inasmuch as the plaintiff had not come through Flatbush avenue at all, but was at all times in Fulton street, where the collision occurred. I cannot believe \u25a0 such reasoning to be sound. The plaintiff was within the general area of a street crossing, where the rights of users of that territory were equal, and it should not concern us in what manner he came into the place or from what direction he approached it. In his lawful use of the highway he found himself there, and it cannot, in my opinion, be held to be the law that on one day if he came into the place from Flatbush avenue he had more comprehensive rights and' privileges than on a day following, should he enter by way of Fulton street. The boundaries of an intersection of streets enclose a spot peculiar to the law, in that no paramount rights are known there, and no limitation of this doctrine should be indulged against a class of individuals or vehicles that enter from any particular point. -</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">A reference, again, to the map in evidence shows that had the plaintiff been proceeding in the usual manner northwesterly along the right side of Flatbush avenue, across Fulton street, and into the right side of Hudson avenue, his course would have been not widely different from that actually traveled by plaintiff from the point in the east-bound track of the defendant\u2019s road where, on the day of the accident, he turned northeasterly, and pointed for the northeastern curb of Hudson avenue and Fulton street. Had such been his course of travel, he would have crossed the west-bound track in Fulton str\u00e9et within about 10 feet from the point in that track where he did actually cross. This analysis of the directions and distances seems, of itself, quite sufficient to refute the argument that the law of intersecting streets is inapplicable to the facts of this case. But, if not, suppose that a stranger had been, on the day of the collision, traveling from Flatbush avenue into Hudson avenue along the route indicated above, and had been a few feet in advance of the plaintiff, they would both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>have been proceeding in the same general direction, the latter crossing the west-bound track at a point about io feet west of that where the other crossed. And suppose, further, that defendant\u2019s motorman, approaching from the east, had seen both and the direction from which each came; if the position I take is fallacious, he might properly have said, \u201cThat stranger, although but a few feet from the plaintiff, both within the area of these intersecting streets, is entitled to the benefit of the rule allowing no one paramount rights in this place, for he came out of the intersecting street; but, as against the plaintiff, my car has the better right here, for he turned into this district from Fulton street.\u201d The point of ingress should not be held to affect the rights of those who have occasion to use such intersections of streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial ordered, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">HIRSGHBERG, J., concurs.
