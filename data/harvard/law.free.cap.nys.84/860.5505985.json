Notwithstanding such dismissal the defendants proceeded to trial, and testimony in support of the allegations set up in the counterclaim was given as a defense to plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action and upon the question of fact thus litigated by the parties the trial court found in favor of the plaintiffs. We find no reason for disturbing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
