J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQqA\">The affirmance of a judgment after the first argument of the appeal was placed upon the ground that there was sufficient before the justice to warrant the determination that the truck belonged to the defendants whose name it bore. It was probably assumed that the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses had testified, as was claimed in respondent\u2019s brief, that the name on the truck was \u201cFarrell, Hopper &amp; Co.\u201d It has now been pointed out that, according to the testimony of said witnesses, the name was \u201cFarrell Rubber Co.\u201d The appeal must be considered and determined on the testimony contained in the return, which 'the trial justice to whom it was referred back declined to amend, and according to the return the name was \u201cFarrell Rubber Co.\u201d The question cannot be determined upon affidavits. That being so, the evidence, as it stands, is insufficient to show that any one of the three defendants had any ownership or interest in the truck that caused the alleged injury, or any connection with the truck driver. But, even if it could be assumed that the witnesses intended to testify that the name on the truck was \u201cFarrell, Hopper &amp; Co.,\u201d there is great doubt whether the plaintiff sufficiently showed that at the time of the accident the driver of the truck was engaged in any business of the defendants, and that all the defendants were partners.
