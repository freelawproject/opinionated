This was denied by the trial court. Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 166 (Laws 1902, p. 1542, c. 580), provides \u201cthat the court must, upon application, allow a pleading to be amended at any time, if substantial justice will be promoted thereby.\u201d This proposed amendment should have been granted, upon such terms, however, as the court might deem proper. The defense sought to be interposed has sometimes been termed an unconscionable one, and not to be encouraged, but it is a legal one nevertheless, and if proven no recovery can be had. The judgment must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Judgment reversed. New trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
