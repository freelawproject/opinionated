J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adk\">The appeal in these proceedings attacks the sufficiency of the allegations in the petition upon the ground that it fails to comply with section 2235 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in that it fails properly to describe the \u201cinterest therein of the petitioner\u201d in the demised premises. The petition contains only the averment that \u201cthe petitioner is the lessee, and that as such he is the landlord of the demised premises.\u201d Section 2235, supra, requires that the applicant shall present a petition \u201cdescribing the premises and the interest therein of the petitioner, stating the facts.\u201d Under that section there is now no distinction regarding the description of the petitioner\u2019s interest in the premises, whether the proceedings are ' founded upon forcible entry and detainer, for nonpayment of rent, or for a holding over. Engel, Heller Co. v. Elias Brewing Co., 37 Misc. Rep. 480, 75 N. Y. Supp. 1080. It was held in the above-cited case that the mere allegation that the petitioner \u201cis the landlord\u201d was not sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the Municipal Court in proceedings of this character; neither does the additional statement contained in the petition that the petitioner is \u201cthe lessee of the demised premises,\u201d etc., strengthen the respondent\u2019s position nor cure its defective statements. Nothing is shown by such averment that he is entitled thereby to the possession of the premises, and it is merely an allegation of an interest in the premises, but not a description of the petitioner\u2019s interest. Fuchs v. Cohen (Com. PI.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 236. In Fox v. Held, 24 Misc. Rep. 184, 52 N. Y. Supp. 724, it was held that the word \u201clessee\u201d is merely descriptio personae, and may be regarded as surplusage. At the most, until a further statement of facts, it would only mean that the petitioner was\u2019 a tenant, and in the absence of further explanation would not confer upon him a right to institute these proceedings. The court below was without jurisdiction to make a final order in the premises?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Objection to jurisdiction can be raised at any time. Cram v. Dietrich, 38 Misc. Rep. 791, 78 N. Y. Supp. 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Final order reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">GILDERSLEEVE, J., concurs.</p>\n<author id=\"b253-11\">TRUAX, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7Sn\">I do not concur. Section 2235 of the Code of Civil Procedure says that an application for the removal of a person from real property, as prescribed in title 2 of chapter 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, may be made by the landlord of the demised premises, and that \u201cthe applicant must present to the judge * * * a written petition * * * describing the interest therein\u201d of the petitioner. The petition in this case describes the petitioner as the \u201clandlord\u201d of the demised premises. This is, I think, a sufficient description of the interest of the petitioner in the premises mentioned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the petition, and is the description required by the above-mentioned section of the Code. In fact, the petitioner has used the .very word, .\u201clandlord,\u201d required by the Code in describing his interest in the premises of which possession is claimed. A landlord is the person whose lands are occupied, and, when the petitioner herein said that he was the landlord, he in effect said that he was the person whose lands were occupied.1 I am unable to reconcile Fox v. Held, 24 Misc. Rep. 184, 52 N. Y. Supp. 724, and Engle-Heller Co. v. Henry Elias Brewing Co., 37 Misc. Rep. 480, 75 N. Y. Supp. 1080. Moreover, the tenant, Demetrius Kaziz, admitted in his answer that he had entered into an agreement (of leasing) \u201cwith George W. Loft, the landlord of the premises mentioned and described in the petition.\u201d This admission concludes the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">To my opinion, the order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
