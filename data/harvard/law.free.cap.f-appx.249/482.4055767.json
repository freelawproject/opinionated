McCaul, Jr., pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm, which had traveled in interstate commerce, after having been previously convicted of attempted burglary and three counts of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e)(1). Finding that McCaul\u2019s prior convictions subjected him to enhanced sentencing as an armed career criminal, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to the statutory minimum of 15 years in prison. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4. On appeal, McCaul argues for the first time that the three robbery convictions, arising from robberies that occurred on the same day, should not be counted as separate predicate offenses for enhancement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-16\">We find no plain error in the court\u2019s treatment of the robbery convictions. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>481 F.3d 1029, 1034 (8th Cir.2007) (failure to raise issue at sentencing results in plain-error review on appeal); <em>United States v. Deroo, </em>304 F.3d 824, 828 (8th Cir.2002) (\u201cCrimes occurring even minutes apart can qualify ... if they have different victims and are committed in different locations.\u201d); <em>United States v. Hamell, </em>3 F.3d 1187, 1191 (8th Cir.1993) (two assaults committed within minutes of each other were separate and distinct criminal episodes); <em>see also, e.g., United States v. Green, </em>967 F.2d 459, 462 (10th Cir.1992) (declining to depart from holding that two burglaries occurring on same date at different times and different places constitute separate criminal episodes).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-20\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-17\">. The Honorable Laurie Smith Camp, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
