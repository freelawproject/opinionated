To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing purely legal issues de novo, <em>see Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 975 (9th Cir.2006), we dismiss the petition for review in part, grant it in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-20\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that Balvane-da Contreras failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003). Balvaneda Contreras\u2019 contention that the agency violated his due process rights by disregarding his evidence of hardship does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Tjradi-tional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-21\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period. The BIA\u2019s streamlined order changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla, </em>463 F.3d at 981, we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the agency for reinstatement of the 60-day voluntary departure period.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b692-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
