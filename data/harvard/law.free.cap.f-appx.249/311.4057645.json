On appeal, Ledbettter alleges that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance for failing to argue at sentencing previously filed objections to his presentence report. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-23\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal, unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). Rather, to allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance generally should be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). We find that ineffective assistance of counsel is not conclusively established on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-24\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
