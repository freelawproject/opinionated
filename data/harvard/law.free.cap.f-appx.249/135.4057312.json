After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b162-20\">Because Gutierrez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we first review the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-21\">A. Events of February 8 and 9, 2005</p>\n<p id=\"b162-22\">Gutierrez is married to Tiffany Hines, a soldier in the United States Army. In February 2005, Gutierrez, Hines and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>seven-month old daughter, C.G., lived in military housing on Fort Gordon, a military base near Augusta, Georgia. Gutierrez watched C.G. during the day while his wife was at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">On February 8, 2005, Hines came home from work at lunchtime and noticed that C.G. was quiet and not as active as she normally was. C.G. also cried when Hines picked her up. Gutierrez told Hines that C.G. \u201cwas just sore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The next morning Hines noticed that C.G.\u2019s arm was swollen and had a disagreement with Gutierrez over whether they should take C.G. to the hospital. Gutierrez convinced Hines to wait to see if the swelling would subside.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">During the day, Gutierrez asked a neighbor, Lee Anna Sayers, if she would babysit C.G. for an hour while he helped another neighbor move. Sayers agreed. Before Gutierrez left, he told Sayers that C.G.\u2019s arm was injured as a result of a bug bite and that he had already taken C.G. to a doctor. Gutierrez advised Sayers to leave C.G. in her car seat and try not to touch the arm because it was irritated.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">After Gutierrez left, Sayers noticed that the bottle Gutierrez had provided was dirty and that the formula inside it was \u201cchunky\u201d at the bottom as if it had been refilled without first being cleaned. Sayers emptied the bottle, cleaned it and filled it with fresh formula. In addition, C.G.\u2019s car seat and blanket were dirty and smelled like old formula and \u201cspit up.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When Sayers took C.G. out of the car seat, Sayers noticed that C.G.\u2019s arm was swollen to more than twice the size of her other arm. C.G. became very upset when Sayers touched her elbow. Gutierrez returned for C.G. approximately four hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">That evening, Gutierrez and Hines brought C.G. to the emergency room at Eisenhower Army Medical Center at Fort Gordon. Dr. Ivey Shuman diagnosed C.G. with a fracture in her right arm above the elbow and referred her to an orthopedist. Gutierrez explained to Dr. Shuman that he had placed C.G. in a car seat on a couch and C.G. had fallen over. Gutierrez also offered this explanation to his wife for the first time. Dr. Shuman was concerned about C.G.\u2019s injury because it was not consistent with a fall and suspected that the injury may have been the result of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">Once C.G. was admitted to the hospital, she was examined by Dr. Jason Lanham, the chief resident for inpatient services. Gutierrez told Dr. Lanham that he had placed C.G. unrestrained in a car seat on a sofa about three feet off the ground. Gutierrez said that he left the room for a moment, heard C.G. crying and returned to find C.G. on the ground. When Dr. Lanham obtained C.G.\u2019s history from her parents, they indicated that there had been no past injuries or illnesses. However, after reviewing x-rays, Dr. Lanham discovered a break in C.G.\u2019s left clavicle that was healing, which meant that it did not occur at the same time as the break in C.G.\u2019s right elbow. Gutierrez told Dr. Lanham that, on another occasion three weeks earlier, C.G. \u201cwas in a car seat unrestrained on the sofa and had fallen out of the car seat on to the floor.\u201d Dr. Lan-ham opined that C.G.\u2019.s injuries were the result of abuse rather than an accidental fall given the type and locations of the fractures and C.G.\u2019s young age.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Dr. Thomas Gibson, the chief of pediatric orthopedic surgery, performed surgery to repair C.G.\u2019s broken bone in her right arm. According to Dr. Gibson, the three fractures most highly suggestive of child abuse are fractures to the humerus, clavicle and ribs, all of which C.G. sustained. Dr. Gibson opined that C.G.\u2019s injuries were the result of abuse because they would not be caused by the fall described by Gutierrez.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Dr. Clarence Joe, a radiologist, reviewed C.G.\u2019s x-rays. Dr. Joe noted a healing clavicle fracture, two rib fractures and two fractures in C.G.\u2019s right arm. One of C.G.\u2019s arm fractures, an oblique fracture of the proximal humerus, was the result of a twisting motion. The other arm fracture was a horizontal fracture of the distal humerus, which was caused by a direct blow. The rib fractures were more likely caused by pressing a finger into the rib rather than from a fall. Based on C.G.\u2019s having suffered multiple fractures that were in different stages of healing, Dr. Joe opined that the injuries were an indication of child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">B. Interviews on February 10 &amp; 11, 2005</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">On the evening of February 10, Sergeant Vanessa Kahn of the Fort Gordon Military Police (\u201cMP\u201d) received a call from emergency room physicians reporting possible child abuse. Sergeant Kahn met Gutierrez and Hines at the hospital and then directed Gutierrez to meet her at the military police investigator\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">At 1:30 a.m. that same evening, Sergeant Kahn advised Gutierrez of his <em>Miranda, </em>rights, interviewed Gutierrez and then took his written statement. In his statement, Gutierrez averred that on February 8, he had placed C.G. in her car seat but forgot to place the safety restraint around her. Gutierrez placed the car seat on the couch and then ran to the kitchen to turn off the stove. Gutierrez heard a crash, and C.G. began to cry. Gutierrez ran to the living room and found C.G. laying on the floor with her car seat on top of her. When Gutierrez picked C.G. up, she stopped crying and went to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The following afternoon, Gutierrez was interviewed by Agent Brian Wilhelm, an investigator with the Criminal Investigation Division (\u201cCID\u201d) at Fort Gordon. After Agent Wilhelm advised Gutierrez of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Gutierrez said that C.G. had fallen out of her car seat, off the couch, and onto the floor of their home. Gutierrez admitted that he sometimes got angry and yelled and that he had punched holes in the walls of his residence. Gutierrez stated that he got frustrated being a first-time father and \u201chad some anger management problems.\u201d Gutierrez admitted turning music up loud so he would not hear C.G. cry.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Agent Wilhelm asked Gutierrez if he had mentioned C.G.\u2019s arm injury to any neighbors, and Gutierrez said he had not. Agent Wilhelm then advised Gutierrez that he had already spoken with Sayers and that Gutierrez had told Sayers that C.G.\u2019s arm was swollen from a bug bite. Gutierrez admitted that he had lied to Agent Wilhelm and then terminated the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Another CID investigator, Edward Lee Harris, went to Gutierrez\u2019s residence on February 10 and took photographs of, among other things, the sofa from which Gutierrez claimed C.G. had fallen. Harris estimated that the seat of the sofa was a little less than a foot off the ground. According to Harris, the residence was dirty and had a foul smell. Harris also observed a number of patched holes in a door and the walls and a damaged door frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Hospital staff also notified Jessica Car-raballo, an investigator with the Department of Children and Family Services, who came to the hospital to conduct an investigation. Carraballo interviewed Gutierrez, who told Carraballo that C.G.\u2019s arm was injured at home when she fell from her car seat, off the sofa and onto the floor. Gutierrez said that he picked C.G. up and held her until she stopped crying and that he had not noticed any injury at that time. Later that day, however, a neighbor who was caring for C.G. pointed out to Gutierrez that C.G. had a bruised arm. Gutierrez then waited for his wife to come home from work to take C.G. to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">C. Indictment and Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Gutierrez was indicted by a grand jury for: (1) assault on C.G. resulting in serious bodily injury, namely fracturing her right arm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(6) (Count One); (2) willfully depriving C.G. of necessary sustenance to the extent that her well-being was jeopardized, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 13 and O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-70(a) (Count Two); (3) maliciously causing C.G. excessive physical and mental pain by failing to seek immediate and necessary medical attention for injuries suffered to C.G.\u2019s right arm (Count Three) and for injuries to C.G.\u2019s ribs and clavicle (Count Four), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 13 and O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-70(b). Gutierrez pled not guilty. After a trial, the jury found Gutierrez guilty on all four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Gutierrez filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the government had failed to prove that Gutierrez was responsible for C.G.\u2019s injuries or that the offenses had occurred on land subject to federal jurisdiction, i.e., Fort Gordon. The district court denied the motion, concluding that the jury\u2019s verdict was supported by the evidence. Gutierrez filed a motion to arrest the judgment, arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction over him because the government had failed to prove that the offenses occurred at Fort Gordon. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">The district court sentenced Gutierrez to 84 months\u2019 imprisonment. Gutierrez timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ArB\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">Gutierrez does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on the three counts of cruelty to a child. Instead, Gutierrez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence only as to the assault count as to C.G.\u2019s arm fractures.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">To convict under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113, the government must establish that the individual \u201cassaulted\u201d another person in the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>197 F.3d 1091, 1096 (11th Cir.1999). Gutierrez was charged with assault under \u00a7 113(a)(6), which provides that an \u201cassault\u201d that results in \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d is punished by \u201cimprisonment for not more than ten years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 113 does not define \u201cassault,\u201d but this Court has given the term its common law meaning. <em>Williams, </em>197 F.3d at 1096. Further, we have concluded that an \u201cassault\u201d within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the meaning of \u00a7 113 includes a common law battery defined as a willful, offensive touching, regardless of the intent to do physical harm. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Here, we first conclude that there is ample evidence to support Gutierrez\u2019s assault conviction. Gutierrez not only was taking care of C.G. immediately before his wife discovered the baby\u2019s swollen arm, but was reluctant to take C.G. to the hospital. Gutierrez did not dispute that C.G. had the charged broken arm, but gave different explanations for the injury before and during the investigation. Specifically, Gutierrez told his wife that C.G. was merely sore, told his neighbor that C.G. had suffered a bug bite and told doctors and investigators that C.G. had fallen out of the car seat on the couch and onto the floor. Expert testimony by doctors indicated that C.G.\u2019s arm fractures were the result of a direct blow and a twisting motion and were inconsistent with the explanation Gutierrez had given them. Doctors also testified that they believed C.G.\u2019s injury was due to abuse given the nature of the injury and C.G.\u2019s very young age. This evidence considered cumulatively was sufficient for a jury to conclude that Gutierrez caused C.G.\u2019s arm fractures.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Additionally, there is no merit to Gutierrez\u2019s claim that the government failed to show territorial jurisdiction. Although territorial jurisdiction is an essential element of the offense, the government must establish the location of a criminal activity only by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>United States v. Bowers, </em>660 F.2d 527, 531 (5th Cir.1981) (concluding that the government established subject matter jurisdiction by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant abused her child on a military base).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties stipulated that Fort Gordon was subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on the evidence presented, a reasonable jury could also find by a preponderance of the evidence that the assault occurred in Gutierrez\u2019s home on Fort Gordon military base. Therefore, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction and properly denied Gutierrez\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal and motion to arrest the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">B. Statement to Sergeant Kahn</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Gutierrez argues that the district court erred when it refused to hold a <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing before admitting his written statement taken by Sergeant Kahn.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">Under <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>\u201c[a] defendant objecting to the admission of a confession is entitled to a fair hearing in which both the underlying factual issues and the vol-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>untariness of his confession are actually and reliably determined.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 380, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 1783, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964). Such a hearing, to be conducted outside the presence of the jury, \u201cis constitutionally mandated for a defendant who timely urges that his confession is inadmissible because not voluntarily given.\u201d <em>United States v. Davidson, </em>768 F.2d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.1985). However, we will not remedy a district court\u2019s failure to hold a <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing unless the defendant \u201callege[s] <em>facts </em>which would, if proven true, indicate the involuntariness of his confession.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Here, Gutierrez failed to allege facts indicating that his statement given to Sergeant Kahn was involuntary. After the return of the superseding indictment, Gutierrez filed a motion to suppress stating that, \u201c[sjince discovery and defense investigation are still incomplete, the Defendant files this Motion in general form to preserve h[is] right to challenge the legality of any search or seizure of evidence that the Government might introduce against hi[m] at trial as well as any statements.\u201d The district court later directed Gutierrez to particularize his suppression motion within ten days or a hearing would not be scheduled on his suppression motion. Gutierrez did not file a more particularized motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">At trial, Gutierrez objected to the admission of the statement during the government\u2019s direct examination of Sergeant Kahn. Specifically, Gutierrez\u2019s counsel stated that \u201cif they are going to attempt to introduce this statement I will ask that we have a <em>Jacksmi v. Denno </em>hearing before it is introduced before the jury.\u201d Gutierrez\u2019s counsel did not articulate the basis for suppression or identify any facts suggesting that Gutierrez\u2019s statement was involuntary. After the district court denied Gutierrez\u2019s impromptu request for a <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing, Gutierrez renewed his objection, but did not argue that the statement was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In addition, none of the evidence presented at trial indicates that Gutierrez\u2019s statement was involuntary. Sergeant Kahn met with Gutierrez at the hospital and directed him to meet her at the military police statement to give a statement. Gutierrez drove himself to the military police station, completed his statement within a half hour, and was irritated but cooperative. The interview took place in an office within the military police station with only Sergeant Kahn present. An MP patrolled the halls outside as a security measure. Sergeant Kahn advised Gutierrez of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, including his right to remain silent. Gutierrez then executed a <em>Miranda </em>waiver, which also advised him that he could remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Sergeant Kahn reviewed Gutierrez\u2019s version of events with him a couple of times and then asked Gutierrez to write it down on the narrative portion of the statement form. Gutierrez did so. Sergeant Kahn then completed the question and answer portion of the statement form. Gutierrez was permitted to verify the questions and answers and initialed each to show that he agreed with the answers Sergeant Kahn had written. The affidavit portion of the statement, which Gutierrez signed, avers that Gutierrez was not threatened or forced to give a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">On appeal, the only fact Gutierrez points to in support of his claim that he was entitled to a <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing is that Sergeant Kahn admitted on cross examination that during the interview Gutierrez was not free to leave the military police station. The mere fact that Gutierrez was in police custody when he gave his statement does not, alone, establish coercion. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1296 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that a finding of involuntariness under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause requires as a prerequisite coercive government conduct such as \u201csubjecting the accused to an exhaustingly long interrogation, the application of physical force or the threat to do so, or the making of a promise that induces the confession\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). On this record, we cannot say the district court erred in denying Gutierrez\u2019s request for a <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">C. Motion for a Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Gutierrez contends that testimony elicited by the government about his decision to terminate his interview with Agent Wilhelm impermissibly commented on Gutierrez\u2019s decision to invoke his right to remain silent. According to Gutierrez, the district court should have granted his motion for a mistrial after this testimony was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">During trial, Agent Wilhelm was cross-examined vigorously about his failure to take notes or otherwise record his interview with Gutierrez. When first asked why he had not taken notes, Agent Wilhelm responded, \u201cGenerally what we [at CID] do is we ask the suspect to type up a narrative which in this case the interview ended before we had a chance to do that.\u201d Later, when defense counsel pressed Agent Wilhelm about his failure to record important aspects of Gutierrez\u2019s interview, Agent Wilhelm responded, \u201cAs I said under the normal procedure we have a typed narrative recounting his facts of the case and in this case we didn\u2019t get to that point because he terminated the interview.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">During redirect examination, the government asked Agent Wilhelm whether it was his normal procedure to obtain a written statement from a suspect he had interviewed. Gutierrez\u2019s counsel objected, and the district court stated that it would allow the question and suggested that the matter be addressed at the next opportunity without the jury present. The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">Q. When you are interviewing someone do they have the right to terminate that interview before giving you that written statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">Q. Is that what happened in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alu-dedup-0\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">At the next break, outside the presence of the jury, Gutierrez objected to the government referring to Gutierrez\u2019s voluntarily terminating the interview and moved for a mistrial. The district court concluded that Gutierrez\u2019s cross-examination had invited the testimony, overruled the objection and denied the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">Under <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>a prosecutor\u2019s \u201cuse for impeachment purposes of [a defendant\u2019s] silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, violate[s] the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d 426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). However, not every mention of a defendant\u2019s post-Mmmda. silence is a <em>Doyle </em>violation. <em>See United States v. Stubbs, </em>944 F.2d 828, 834-35 (11th Cir. 1991). Rather, a <em>Doyle </em>violation occurs when \u201cthe statement was manifestly intended or was of such character that a jury would naturally and necessarily take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>it to be a comment on the failure of an accused to testify.\u201d <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir. 1999). \u201cThe question is not whether the jury possibly or even probably would view the remark in this manner, but whether the jury <em>necessarily </em>would have done so.\u201d <em>United States v. Knowles, </em>66 F.3d 1146, 1163 (11th Cir.1995) (quotation marks omitted). The district court must consider the remark in context to determine the prosecutor\u2019s motive and the impact upon the jury. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Given the context in which the testimony was elicited, we conclude that there was no <em>Doyle </em>violation. Agent Wilhelm\u2019s testimony that Gutierrez terminated the interview was elicited twice by Gutierrez\u2019s own counsel during cross-examination without any objection. Gutierrez\u2019s counsel effectively impeached Agent Wilhelm by inferring that Agent Wilhelm had been negligent at best and possibly underhanded in failing to take notes during the interview. The government\u2019s questions on redirect were intended to rehabilitate Agent Wilhelm by clarifying that Agent Wilhelm had acted in accordance with CID policy during the interview, and that the failure to memorialize the interview in writing was not the result of either negligence or some nefarious plan, but because Gutierrez ended the interview before that could happen. <em>See United States v. Rodriquez-Cardenas, </em>866 F.2d 390, 394 (11th Cir.1989) (explaining that a prosecutor may use redirect examination \u201cto rebut false impressions that arise from cross-examination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">In sum, it does not appear from the record that the government\u2019s purpose was to comment upon Gutierrez\u2019s decision to invoke his right to remain silent. Nor can we say that the government\u2019s questions and Agent Wilhelm\u2019s answers on redirect were \u201cof such a character\u201d that the jury <em>necessarily </em>would have taken them to be a comment on Gutierrez\u2019s decision to invoke his right to remain silent. Therefore, the district court properly denied Gutierrez\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">D. Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Finally, Gutierrez contends that the district court erred in giving a supplemental jury instruction on the meaning of the term \u201cintentional assault.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">During the initial jury charge, the district court instructed the jury on the elements of an assault under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(6). Specifically, the district court explained, among other things, that the government was required to prove these three elements of an assault under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(6): (1) that Gutierrez intentionally assaulted C.G.; (2) that Gutierrez intentionally assaulted C.G. within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States; and (3) that, as a result of the assault, C.G. suffered a serious bodily injury. After retiring to deliberate, the jury sent a note to the district court stating, \u201cNeed judge to define \u2018intentional assault\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>page twelve of instructions.\u201d The parties agreed that the jury was probably confused by the fact that a \u00a7 113(a) assault encompasses the common law concepts of both assault and battery and agreed that the district court should clarify this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The jury was brought into the courtroom. The district court first reminded the jury of its earlier charge and advised the jury not to consider any part of the instructions as more important than other parts. The district court then reread the instructions regarding a \u00a7 113(a)(6) offense and the definition of the words \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cwilfully.\u201d The district court next explained the common law concepts of assault and battery, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">What does assault mean? ...</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">Under the English common law there were the two related concepts that I am sure you have heard many, many times and perhaps you\u2019ve wondered what exactly it was and I am going to explain it to you. What I\u2019m talking about is assault and batter[y] and very commonly these terms are used together, in conjunction with each other and almost meaning the same thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">An assault, generally, is to put someone in fear of being harmed. You can do that lunging at someone, charging at someone, pointing a gun at someone or something like that. I use those only as examples of the concept.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">Now, a battery is the extension or the culmination of an assault. A battery is the actual unlawful touching of someone. It can be something as minor [as] a simple touching. It can be a touching in an inappropriate place. Or a battery might be a touching or a blow sufficient to produce a serious bodily injury. So, you can say that a battery always includes an assault, but that an assault is or may be the preamble of a battery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">The district court also explained how these common law concepts applied in a \u00a7 113(a) offense, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">Now, I don\u2019t want to try to dissect the federal law or tell you exactly what the purposes of the Congress were, but I will tell you that this concept of assault in federal law goes back a long way and it is my belief, \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you this is the law, but it is my belief \u2014 that the people that wrote the federal statute were trying to simplify it and trying to say basically we are distinguishing between assault and battery. We are carrying that common law distinction into the federal juris prudence [sic]. We are going to use just one word and we are going to use assault. If you think the attempt toward simplification has created confusion that is your business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">My point right now is that in the federal law assault and battery are the same thing. A battery being a completed assault, if you would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">An individual may commit an assault either by an intentional and voluntary act which does injury to another person or an intentional voluntary act which is a threat to do it. So, the definition of assault is broader in the law in the federal sector than is involved in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">The district court then explained that the government\u2019s case involved an alleged completed assault that produced an actual injury, rather than just a threat of injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-14\">Quite clearly under the evidence, under the argument and under the theory of [the] Government\u2019s case the prosecution is alleging in the indictment and has argued not that the Defendant Gutierrez put baby [C.G.] in fear of an injury[.] [T]o the contrary the theory of the Government\u2019s case is that conduct of the defendant actually produced an injury to the child. So, here in this case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>theory of the Government, the allegations and the argument, is that the child was actually injured as a result of this alleged assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">\"While one might commit an assault under federal law by threatening an injury if the individual has at the same time the apparent present ability to produce an injury that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. Quite clearly and simply the Government argues and its theory of the case is that the conduct of the Defendant Gutierrez actually produced an injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Finally, the district repeated the instruction relating to the three elements of a \u00a7 113(a)(6) offense. After a sidebar, the district court reminded the jury not to single out any of his instructions as having special significance and reiterated that the term \u201cintentional\u201d meant a purposeful act and did not require the government to prove that the defendant intended all the consequences resulting from the act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">Members of the jury, I\u2019m not going to tell you again that you should not single out any one of my instructions alone as having any special significance or any one of my instructions alone as stating the law, but I will tell you with respect to this concept of intentional, which is one of the words you focused on in your question, it is not necessary that the Government prove that the defendant intended all of the consequences that might flow from an act. It is only necessary that the Government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did the act or the thing which the law forbids on purpose. That it was done intentionally and not as a result of a mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">After the jury left the courtroom, Gutierrez objected \u201cto that portion of the charge that dealt with the proof offered by the Government\u201d and \u201cto the last part of the charge dealing with the intent to cause harm to the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">On appeal, Gutierrez argues that the district court erred in giving the supplemental instruction by: (1) misstating the law of \u201cassault\u201d; and (2) interjecting the judge\u2019s opinions about the Government\u2019s theory of the case. With regard to the first argument, we conclude that the district court did not misstate the law on the meaning of \u201cintentional assault.\u201d Although \u00a7 113 does not define \u201cassault,\u201d this Court has given the term its common law meaning and has concluded that assault can be \u201ca battery, an attempted battery, or an act that puts another in reasonable apprehension of receiving immediate bodily harm.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>197 F.3d at 1096. Furthermore, a \u00a7 113 assault by battery includes the \u201cleast touching of another\u2019s person wilfully\u201d and does not require an intent to do bodily harm. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">We also do not agree that the district court\u2019s comments \u201chad the effect of inferring to the jury that the Government had established its burden of proof in the case.\u201d The district court\u2019s supplemental instruction explained the multiple concepts encompassed within the term \u201cassault\u201d under \u00a7 113. The district court\u2019s clarification as to the government\u2019s theory of the case merely advised the jury that it need not consider the other definitions of assault because the government had proceeded only on the theory that an assault by battery had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-9\">. Two other neighbors, who had watched C.G. for Gutierrez on occasion, also testified at trial. These neighbors stated that when Gutierrez would drop C.G. off, he would often fail to provide any supplies such as a bottle or diapers. In addition, C.G. and her clothes were very dirty and smelled of sour milk. One neighbor described Gutierrez providing a bottle that had mold growing in the formula.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\">.
