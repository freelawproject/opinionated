Smith\u2019s vehicle was impounded and inventoried when he was unable to provide proof of insurance following a valid traffic stop. We see no error in the district court\u2019s implicit finding that the vehicle inventory occurred before Smith\u2019s arrest and the discovery of contraband on his person. <em>See United States v. Castene-da, </em>951 F.2d 44, 48 (5th Cir.1992). We agree with the district court that the im-poundment of Smith\u2019s vehicle was proper under Louisiana law and that the procedure used to inventory the vehicle was acceptable. <em>See Fields v. State, </em>714 So.2d 1244, 1250-56 (La.1998); <em>United States v. Lage, </em>183 F.3d 374, 380 (5th Cir.1999). We likewise agree that the relevant issue is the good-faith nature of the search rather than the exactness with which non-incriminating items were documented. <em>See United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701, 704 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
