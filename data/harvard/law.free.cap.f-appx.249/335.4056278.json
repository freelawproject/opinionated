He was sentenced to serve 174 months in prison. De La Cruz appeals his conviction, asserting it is invalid because evidence regarding cocaine was admitted at his trial. As the evidence of De La Cruz\u2019s guilt was overwhelming, any error that occurred in connection with the admission of the disputed evidence was harmless. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>40 F.3d 95, 99 n. 11 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>354 F.3d 390, 396 (5th Cir.2003). De La Cruz also claims that his indictment was constructively amended. This contention is unavailing, because the record does not show that the jury was \u201cpermitted to convict on an alternative basis permitted by the statute but not charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>See United States v. Daniels, </em>252 F.3d 411, 413 (5th Cir.2001). The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b361-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
