Horn denying Chen\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xiong Chen, </em>No. A98 347 581 (B.I.A. Oct. 25, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 347 581 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 6, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-16\">Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision and further supplemented it, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review agency findings of fact under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-17\">The agency reasonably denied Chen\u2019s asylum application based on his claim that he was persecuted for violating China\u2019s family planning policy. To the extent that Chen argues he is <em>per se </em>eligible for relief under INA \u00a7 601(a) based on his then-f\u00edanc\u00e9e\u2019s forced abortion, such argument is foreclosed in our circuit by our decision in <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-18\">Furthermore, while it could be argued that Chen engaged in \u201cother resistance\u201d by arguing with family planning officials and trying to prevent them from taking his then-f\u00edanc\u00e9e in order to perform an abortion, he did not demonstrate that he suffered harm amounting to past persecution or that officials would single him out for future persecution on account of that resistance. <em>See Matter of S-L-L-, </em>24 I &amp; N Dec. 1, 10 (BIA 2006); <em>see also Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-19\">Furthermore, the agency reasonably denied Chen\u2019s religious persecution claim because he failed to demonstrate that he would continue to practice his newly adopted Christian faith in China and, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>assuming that he would, that he would be individually targeted for harm on that basis. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii). Thus, Chen\u2019s claimed fear of future persecution based on his religion was \u201cspeculative at best.\u201d <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005). To the extent that Chen refers to documents that were never submitted to the BIA, we decline to consider them. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A)' (\u201c[T]he court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Because Chen was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief where those claims were based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Additionally, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Chen failed to meet his burden of proof for CAT relief on the basis of his alleged illegal departure from China. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that general evidence \u201cthat any individual detainee in China may be subjected to repressive conditions in prison\u201d is insufficient to compel a finding that a specific alien would more likely than not be tortured).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
