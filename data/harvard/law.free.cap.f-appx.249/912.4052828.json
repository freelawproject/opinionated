Sept. 22, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A79 318 727 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 4, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">Where, as here, the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). An alien must demonstrate \u201cby clear and convincing evidence\u201d that he filed his application for asylum within one year after the date of his \u201carrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). As the government points out, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum application was untimely under section 1158(a)(2)(B). Although this Court retains jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Nikocevic challenges only the IJ\u2019s factual determination that he testified inconsistently about when he last entered the United States and that he provided no other corroboration to definitively establish the date of his arrival. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s decision to pretermit Nikocevic\u2019s asylum application as untimely and dismiss the petition for review to that extent. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 331 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">Nikocevie did not raise either his withholding of removal or CAT claims in his brief to this Court. Accordingly, we deem those claims waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Finally, we note that even if Nikocevie had addressed these claims, the agency\u2019s denial of relief was amply supported by evidence of changed country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">For the foregoing reasons the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
