Nov. 15, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 97 738 932 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Apr. 14, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>When, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without issuing an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">As a preliminary matter, when deciding a claim for asylum and related relief, the agency must determine whether an applicant\u2019s testimony is credible, followed by whether the applicant has met his or her burden of proof. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 290 (2d Cir.2000). The testimony of an applicant may be, but is not always, sufficient to sustain her burden where it is credible and detailed. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(a), 208.16(b). <em>See also Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In this case, the IJ declined to make an adverse credibility finding, stating that there was no \u201csmoking gun\u201d in Jiang\u2019s case to \u201cdefinitively indicate\u201d that she was not being truthful. The IJ instead decided that Jiang\u2019s testimony alone could not satisfy her burden of proof. As the IJ correctly observed, Jiang\u2019s testimony was \u201cvery vague and unspecific,\u201d especially with respect to the date Jiang saw a private physician to determine whether she was pregnant, and the date she received a notice to report for an abortion. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 152 (2d Cir.2003), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). Additionally, the IJ reasonably relied on an inconsistency between Jiang\u2019s testimony that the government notice ordered her to report for an intrauterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d) insertion, and the notice itself, which did not reference any IUD insertion. Because these inconsistencies were material to Jiang\u2019s claim, they cast doubt on the reliability of her testimony. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">The record also supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Jiang failed other-wise to sustain her burden of proof. For instance, the IJ reasonably relied upon the difference between Jiang\u2019s assertion that Chinese officials gave her a certificate after her forced abortion, and the 2004 State Department report indicating that this type of document was issued by hospitals in China upon a patient\u2019s request following a voluntary abortion. <em>See Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006). Furthermore, the IJ reasonably gave the letter from Jiang\u2019s mother \u201cvery little weight\u201d when he found that it failed to corroborate Jiang\u2019s claim by not referencing the visits to her home by government officials. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341-12 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Although the IJ\u2019s expectation of additional evidence \u2014 such as a statement from Jiang\u2019s boyfriend and photographs from the banquet celebrating their engagement \u2014 may not have been reasonable because such evidence may not have been material, this case need not be remanded on that basis. It can be \u201cconfidently predict[ed]\u201d that the same conclusion would have been reached, absent any error, based on the IJ\u2019s non-erroneous credibility and burden of proof findings. <em>See id. </em>at 338-40 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Thus, to the extent that Jiang\u2019s claims rested on the same factual predicate, because Jiang was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on her claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, Jiang failed to challenge the agency\u2019s denial of her request for relief under the CAT and therefore any argument based on her illegal departure from China is waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b881-7\">. An IJ's findings regarding a lack of corroboration are analyzed differently depending on whether the applicant has been deemed credible. <em>See Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 290. Where an IJ does not make an adverse credibility finding but calls into question an applicant's testimony, it is unclear whether the IJ is required specifically to identify the missing pieces of evidence or show that they were reasonably available before finding that their absence prevented the applicant from meeting her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>burden of proof. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 341 (holding that these steps are not required when the applicant is not otherwise credible). Nevertheless, because the denial of relief in this case was supported by substantial evidence without regard to the IJ's finding on a lack of corroboration, we need not decide this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
