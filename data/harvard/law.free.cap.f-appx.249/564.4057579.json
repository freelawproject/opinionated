Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We have jurisdiction over Amatuni\u2019s remaining claims under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility finding and will uphold the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir. 2003). We deny the petition as to the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of asylum based on an adverse credibility determination. The IJ specifically and cogently identified discrepancies in Amatuni\u2019s testimony that went to the heart of his claim. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cAn adverse credibility ruling will be upheld so long as identified discrepancies go to the heart of [the] asylum claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Because Amatuni failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Faralt v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Amatuni\u2019s CAT claim also fails because it is based on the same testimony that the BIA and IJ found not credible, and Ama-tuni points to no other evidence that he could claim the BIA and IJ should have considered. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b590-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
