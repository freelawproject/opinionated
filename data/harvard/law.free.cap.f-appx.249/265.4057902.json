We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-20\">Arias pled guilty to reentering the United States illegally \u2014 having been deported on aggravated felony charges \u2014 without first obtaining the express permission of the United States Attorney General. The district court sentenced Arias to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment (the minimum Guidelines sentence), 27 months of which were to run concurrently with Arias\u2019s narcotics conviction in New York State Supreme Court. Arias appeals the sentence as being both procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the remaining 30 months are to be served consecutively with his state court sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-21\">Procedural Reasonableness. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 252, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a three-step sentencing procedure: (1) determine the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range, (2) consider whether a departure from the Guidelines range is appropriate, and (3) consider the Guidelines range along with the factors listed at 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u00a7 8553(a). <em>See United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Arias argues that remand to the district court is necessary for consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in light of his life story, family situation, and medical problems. But Arias has provided no reason to believe that Judge Rakoff failed to consider those factors below. \u201c[W]e presume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged [the] duty to consider the statutory factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006). The record plainly reflects that the district court considered both Arias\u2019s particular situation and the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors in its sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Substantive Reasonableness. \u201cReasonableness review does not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge. Rather, the standard is akin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. Arias received the minimum Guidelines sentence. Although we have not presumed that a Guidelines sentence is reasonable, we have recognized that \u201cin the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We cannot conclude that this case falls outside the overwhelming majority, or that it is substantively unreasonable for a criminal defendant to serve an incremental term in respect of an incremental offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
