Horn denying Jiang\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xian Zhong Jiang, </em>No. A 95 687 550 (B.I.A. Dec. 15, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A 95 687 550 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Apr. 27, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">When the BIA does not adopt the decision of the IJ to any extent, this Court reviews only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004) (overruled on other grounds). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">The IJ did not find Petitioner credible. The BIA, instead, assumed Petitioner\u2019s credibility but determined that he had shown neither past persecution nor a well-founded fear of future persecution. Petitioner asserts that, in making these determinations, the BIA engaged in impermissible de novo review of the IJ\u2019s factual findings. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (\u201cThe Board will not engage in de novo review of findings of fact determined by an immigration judge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">The Government has moved that this matter be remanded to the BIA so that it may address the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Without determining whether or not the BIA did engage in impermissible de novo fact-finding, we agree that a remand is appropriate. <em>See Ren v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 446, 448 (7th Cir.2006) (\u201cRemanding an agency proceeding in lieu of determining the merits of the challenge to it [has been] commended by the Supreme Court .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED and the Government\u2019s motion to remand is GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
