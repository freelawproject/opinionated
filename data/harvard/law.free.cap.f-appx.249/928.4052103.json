DeFonzo denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. <em>In re Xiu Gui Liu, </em>No. A77 316 728 (B.I.A. Feb. 22, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A 77 316 728 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 7, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-17\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. See <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found in those circumstances where the decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-18\">As a preliminary matter, to the extent that Liu attempts to reargue the merits of the underlying order of removal, that decision is not before this Court. Only the BIA\u2019s February 2007 decision denying the motion to re-open is before us. That is the only decision from which a petition for review was timely filed. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-19\">The IJ properly denied Liu\u2019s motion to reopen because he failed to state \u201cthe new facts that [would] be proven at a hearing ... if the motion [were] granted.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B). As the IJ properly noted, Liu simply restated in his motion the claim he originally set forth in the application for relief that he withdrew. Additionally, the only evidence that Liu submitted to support his motion, his mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>riage certificate, is not new evidence because it predates his hearing on the merits. <em>See id. </em>Thus, even construing broadly Liu\u2019s <em>pro se </em>submissions, we find no reason to disturb the BIA\u2019s February 2007 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
