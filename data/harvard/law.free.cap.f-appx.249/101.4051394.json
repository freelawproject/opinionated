On appeal, Garcia-Olave contends the district court erred at sentencing by denying him a mitigating-role reduction. In particular, Garcia-Olave argues the Sentencing Guidelines did not preclude him from receiving a mitigating-role reduction, and the district court should have compared his role to the roles of the participants in the larger conspiracy who evaded arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-23\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, a district court must calculate the Guidelines range correctly and must consider it when determining a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a finding of fact, which we review for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-24\">Section 3B1.2 of the Guidelines permits a mitigating-role adjustment to the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>cable Guidelines range for a defendant who is substantially less culpable than the average participant due to a minor or mitigating role. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 3. The defendant bears the burden of establishing that his or her role was minimal or minor by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In determining whether a defendant meets the burden of demonstrating a mitigating role, a district court examines (1) the defendant\u2019s role based on the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable, and (2) the defendant\u2019s role in comparison to the other participants. <em>Id. </em>at 940. The district court may consider any and all facts probative of the defendant\u2019s role. <em>Id. </em>at 943. In the drug courier context, relevant facts include, but are not limited to: the amount of drugs, their fair market value, the amount of money to be paid to the courier, and the role in the distribution. <em>Id. </em>at 945. The defendant must establish that he played a minor role in the conduct for which he has been found guilty and not just a minor role in the larger conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 941-942, 944. Therefore, the district court may only assess a defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to \u201cother participants in the relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. That is those who are \u201cidentifiable or discernable from the evidence,\u201d and \u201cwho were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In this case, the record shows that Garcia-Olave was held accountable for 4,000 kilograms of cocaine and admitted to expecting to receive more than $10,000 for his services. The record demonstrates he played an active role in protecting the large amount of cocaine. In addition, Garcia-Olave did not introduce any evidence of the roles played by the other nine crew members. Based on the amount of cocaine, Garcia-Olaves\u2019 role in protecting it, and the lack of evidence comparing his role to the roles of the other nine crew members, we cannot say the district court erred in finding Garcia-Olave did not have a mitigating or minor role deserving of an adjustment to his advisory Guidelines range. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939, 944. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
