We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms without an opinion, we review directly the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The IJ offered specific and cogent reasons for his adverse credibility determination based on the implausibility of Karape-tyan\u2019s lack of knowledge of her political party and of her testimony that the Armenian government would have opposed her party, which go to the heart of Kara-petyan\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1257-58 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Li, </em>378 F.3d at 964 (concluding that, as long as one of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of an asylum claim, we will accept the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In the absence of credible evidence, Ka-rapetyan has failed to show eligibility for asylum or withholding. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Because Karapetyan\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same facts that the IJ found to be not credible, and Karapetyan points to no other evidence that the IJ should have considered, she has failed to establish eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b629-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
