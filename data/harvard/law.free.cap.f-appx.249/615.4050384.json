To the extent that we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">When, as here, the BIA affirms without an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc), and we deny the petition in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the harm Manalu suffered did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-18 (9th Cir.2003). Furthermore, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Manalu failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution, because she failed to demonstrate the requisite individualized risk of persecution. <em>Cf. Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Because Manalu did not demonstrate eligibility for asylum, she necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 673 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Manalu\u2019s CAT claim, because she failed to exhaust the claim before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-15\">Manalu finally contends that the IJ erred in excluding certain documentary evidence for lack of proper authentication. However, Manalu has failed to demonstrate that any error resulted in prejudice. <em>See Khan v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1143, 1144 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> phjg disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
