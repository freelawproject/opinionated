We will deny the petition and affirm the BIA\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-22\">Huang, a native and citizen of China, entered the United States without valid travel documentation on December 22, 1994. On December 27, 1994, he was placed in exclusion proceedings by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which filed a Notice to Applicant for Admission with the Immigration Court: the INS charged Huang with inadmissibility for his lack of a valid entry or travel documentation. Huang filed an application for political asylum on January 12,1995. At a hearing before an Immigration Judge on February 6, 1996, Huang conceded his inadmissibility, but renewed his request for asylum, and also sought withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. He testified he feared future persecution in China because (1) he wanted to have more than one child but would be prevented from doing so by China\u2019s coercive population control policies, and (2) he was a practicing Christian.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ denied Huang\u2019s requests for relief and ordered his exclusion and removal from the United States. The IJ found Huang had failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, because (1) he was unmarried and childless and (2) it was unclear what consequences he would face for practicing Christianity in China, particularly as he conceded his churchgoing Christian siblings had not been harmed since his departure. Huang appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, which agreed he had failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution and dismissed the appeal on February 28, 1998, affirming the order of exclusion and removal. But Huang never left the United States. On December 10, 1999, he married Jianyan Zheng, and the couple now has two children born in the United States: a son born in 2000 and a daughter born in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">On March 3, 2006, Huang filed a \u201cMotion to File Successive Asylum Application Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4\u201d with the BIA, citing the birth of his two children as changed personal circumstances entitling him to asylum. Because of these changed circumstances, he contended, he was allowed to file a successive asylum application beyond the normal application deadline of one year from an alien\u2019s arrival in the United States, established by section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). Section 208(a)(2)(D) of the INA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">An application for asylum of an alien may be considered, notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (C), if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified in subparagraph (B). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Regulations implementing INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), in turn, define \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d to include \u201c[c]hanges in the applicant\u2019s circumstances that materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum, including changes in applicable U.S. law and activities the applicant becomes involved in outside the country of feared persecution that place the applicant at risk.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4)(B) (2007).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">More importantly, Huang contended, the fact that his changed personal circumstances put him within the purview of INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4)(B) also meant that he was <em>not </em>required to file a motion to reopen his immigration proceedings. INA \u00a7 240 generally requires that such motions to reopen be filed with the BIA \u201cwithin 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), but waives the deadline for motions to reopen that rely on evidence of \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) (2007) (establishing substantially identical standard). This deadline waiver for purposes of a motion to reopen obviously applies to a narrower range of situations (specifically, changed country conditions) than that covered by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4)(B)\u2019s definition of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d for purposes of successive asylum petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The BIA rejected Huang\u2019s argument. It found INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D)\u2019s waiver of the one-year asylum application deadline in cases involving \u201cchanged circumstances which materially affect the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>cant\u2019s eligibility for asylum\u201d did not apply to successive applications by aliens already under a final administrative order of exclusion or removal. Rather, the BIA found aliens already under a final administrative order of exclusion or removal are bound by INA \u00a7 240\u2019s filing deadline for motions to reopen. Finding Huang\u2019s filing to be a motion to reopen, it held that the birth of children in the United States did not constitute changed conditions sufficient to waive INA \u00a7 240\u2019s ninety-day filing deadline, and denied his motion as untimely. Huang timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The BIA had jurisdiction over Huang\u2019s motion to reopen under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c). We have jurisdiction over his timely petition for review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">BIA fact-finding is reviewed for substantial evidence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). \u201cThis Court reviews the BIA\u2019s legal determinations de novo, subject to the principles of deference articulated in <em>Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).\u201d <em>Briseno-Flores v. Attorney Gen., </em>492 F.3d 226, 228 (3d Cir.2007). <em>Chevron </em>established a two-step process for judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of statutes: if the unambiguous intent of Congress is clear from the text of the statute, then the court and the agency must give it effect; but if the statute is silent or ambiguous, \u201cthe question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. In the latter situation, where Congress has explicitly or implicitly left a gap in the statute for the agency to fill, the agency\u2019s \u201clegislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Ultimately, a court \u201cmay not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have held \u201cthat the BIA should be accorded <em>Chevron </em>deference for its interpretations of the immigration laws.\u201d <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 221, 224 (3d Cir.2004). Moreover, \u201c[i]t is well settled that a court must afford substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations.\u201d <em>Mercy Home Health v. Leavitt, </em>436 F.3d 370, 377 (3d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, </em>512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Motions to reopen are granted \u201conly under compelling circumstances.\u201d <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 561 (3d Cir.2004). The Supreme Court has noted the Attorney General has broad discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen, and they are \u201cdisfavored.... This is especially true in a deportation proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Accordingly, we review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, and will only disturb the BIA\u2019s decision if it is arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to the law. <em>Guo, </em>386 F.3d at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">Huang contends the statutory and regulatory provisions for successive asylum petitions are wholly separate from, and independent of, those for motions to reopen. As an alien whose personal circumstances have allegedly changed such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>that he now has a well-founded fear of future persecution should he be removed to China, he contends he is entitled to file a successive petition for asylum now, more than eight years after the BIA affirmed his order of exclusion and removal. The government contends aliens who are under a final administrative order of exclusion or removal (as Huang is) must file a motion to reopen their immigration proceedings as a pre-requisite to filing a successive asylum petition. We find the government\u2019s conclusion is neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Huang\u2019s argument chiefly relies on the history of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4, which defines \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d for purposes of INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D). In its proposed form, the regulation stated \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d referred to \u201ccircumstances materially affecting the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum that have arisen ... since the denial of the last asylum application by the alien.\u201d Asylum Procedures, 62 Fed.Reg. 444, 463 (proposed Jan. 3, 1997) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(2)). The proposed rule specified that \u201c[c]hanged circumstances arising after the denial of the application but before the alien\u2019s departure or removal from the United States shall only be considered as part of a motion to reopen.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>By its plain language, this last provision would seem to have applied to Huang: aliens whose applications for asylum had been denied and who were under a final administrative order of exclusion or removal would have been required to file a motion to reopen when changed circumstances had arisen that materially affected their eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">But in the final version of the regulation, the language about motions to reopen was omitted from the definition of \u201cchanged circumstances.\u201d <em>Compare id. with </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4) (1998). Explaining the change, the INS stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">Because of inconsistency between the formulation of changed circumstances in [INA] section 208(a)(2)(D) and the formulation in [INA] section 240(c)(5)(ii) ..., which permits an alien to file a motion to reopen beyond the time limit normally applicable to such a motion, the Department has decided to drop the requirement that, for purposes of the prohibition in [INA] section 208(a)(2)(C), such exception may only be raised through a motion to reopen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Asylum Procedures, 62 Fed.Reg. 10,312, 10,316 (Mar. 6, 2007). Huang contends \u201c[t]his language could not be more clear on its face: an alien seeking to [file] a successive and untimely asylum application based upon materially changed personal circumstances need not reopen his prior asylum application pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2 to apply for this relief.\u201d Huang Br. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">In denying his motion, the BIA stated Huang was still required to file a motion to reopen: notwithstanding 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4, \u201c[t]he reopening restrictions [of INA \u00a7 240 and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2] are additional limitations on the ability of aliens to use either asylum or withholding claims as a means of reopening final[] orders of exclusion, deportation, or removal.\u201d <em>In re Hai Huang, </em>No. A73-476-699, at 2 (BIA May 19, 2006). INA \u00a7 208 and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4\u2019s provisions on successive asylum applications, it added, \u201care separate from, and apply principally at an earlier stage of the proceedings than, the 90-day reopening provisions.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Elaborating, the BIA stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">An alien who has completed his or her proceedings before an [IJ], and possibly the [BIA], and has not departed once reopening time has expired, is not in the same position as one who has only missed the 1-year deadline or whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>earlier claim was denied in an order that has not ripened into a final order of removal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><em>Id. </em>The BIA quoted <em>Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 274 (2d Cir.2006), in which the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen that relied on the birth of children in the United States, and in the process distinguished between asylum applications and motions to reopen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">When considering the initial application of an asylum-seeker who has had more than one child at the time of his initial application and may, therefore, be subject to forcible sterilization in his country of citizenship, the BIA has the discretionary authority either to grant the petition based upon the evidence presented or to find that the petitioner has failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. It is quite a different situation, however, where a petitioner is seeking to reopen his asylum case due to circumstances entirely of his own making after being ordered to leave the United States. In such a situation, it would be ironic, indeed, if petitioners ... who have remained in the United States illegally following an order of deportation ... were permitted to have a second and third bite at the apple simply because they managed to marry and have children while evading authorities. This apparent gaming of the system in an effort to avoid deportation is not tolerated by the existing regulatory scheme. The law is clear that a petitioner must show changed country conditions in order to exceed the 90-day filing requirement for seeking to reopen removal proceedings. A self-induced change in personal circumstances cannot suffice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\"><em>Wang, </em>437 F.3d at 274 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">We find the logic of <em>Wang </em>equally applicable to successive asylum applications such as Huang\u2019s: an alien who has ignored his final administrative order of removal for more than eight years cannot then short-circuit INA \u00a7 240 and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2\u2019s procedural requirements for motions to reopen by couching his request for relief as a successive asylum petition on the basis of changed personal circumstances under INA \u00a7 208 and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.8. Absent a showing of changed circumstances in China, Huang is bound by the ninety-day deadline for filing a motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">As the government notes, Congress \u201chas not directly spoken to the specific issue of whether an alien with a final administrative order is required to file a motion to reopen his proceedings in conjunction with an untimely or successive asylum application.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 10. Congress has expressly delegated to the Attorney General the duty to establish procedures for considering asylum applications, and we cannot say the BIA\u2019s requirement that an alien under a final administrative order of exclusion or removal must file a motion to reopen is an arbitrary or capricious interpretation of the immigration laws. This interpretation was set forth in a recent decision from the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 758, 759-60 (7th Cir. 2007) (holding, where alien under final removal order sought leave to file successive asylum application on basis of two American-born children, that procedural requirements for motions to reopen \u201cgovern!], and so the petition for review must be denied\u201d). <em>But see Haddad v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 515, 518-19 (6th Cir.2006) (stating, where denial of alien\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely was affirmed but alien had never filed her own application for asylum because she was listed as a dependent on her then-husband\u2019s application, that changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>personal circumstance of divorce might allow alien to file asylum application under INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D)); <em>Guan v. BIA </em>345 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.2003) (per curiam) (stating in dicta that alien, the denial of whose motion to reopen as untimely was affirmed, might still be able to file a successive asylum application under INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D) on the basis of changed personal circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The BIA\u2019s interpretation here is consistent with related regulations. <em>See, e.g., 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 </em>1208.4(b)(3)(ii) (2007) (requiring that an alien who files his first asylum application only after the conclusion of exclusion or removal proceedings must do so \u201cin conjunction with a motion to reopen pursuant to 8 CFR part 1003.2 where applicable [that] reasonably explain[s] the failure to request asylum prior to the completion of the proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Further, accepting Huang\u2019s argument that he may file a successive asylum application here could, as the government contends, render superfluous INA \u00a7 240 and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2\u2019s requirement that motions to reopen be filed within ninety days absent changed country conditions: as noted, the definition of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d for purposes of successive asylum applications is more expansive than that for purposes of motion to reopen; and aliens for whom the avenue of a motion to reopen is properly foreclosed could nonetheless style their requests for relief as successive asylum applications to be considered under the more permissive standard. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d at 760 (\u201cThe distinction that [INA \u00a7 240] ... makes between changed country conditions and changed personal conditions is sensible, since the alien can manipulate the latter but not the former.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Finally, the regulatory history of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4)(B) is not unambiguous. The INS did not state that the procedural requirements for motions to reopen were being displaced by those for successive asylum applications in cases involving changed personal circumstances. Rather, it explained that the language about motions to reopen was dropped from the final version of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4) because the definition of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d in reopening differs from that in successive asylum applications. <em>See </em>62 Fed.Reg. at 10,316; <em>see also Chen v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d at 760 (stating \u201c[t]here is no conflict\u201d between the separate regimes for motions to reopen and successive asylum applications as currently written).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Having determined the BIA properly construed Huang\u2019s March 3, 2006, filing as a motion to reopen his immigration proceedings, we next consider whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion as untimely. We conclude it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">Huang\u2019s motion was filed more than eight years after the BIA affirmed his order of exclusion and removal. The BIA found the birth of two children in the United States did not constitute \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered\u201d as required by INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) to waive the ninety-day deadline for motions to reopen. We agree that Huang\u2019s changed personal circumstances are distinct from changed circumstances arising in China. Thus we agree with the Courts of Appeals for the Second and Seventh Circuits, which have held that changed personal circumstances do not fall under this exception. <em>See Wang, </em>437 F.3d at 274; <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 405, 407 (7th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Furthermore, Huang has failed to demonstrate changed circumstances in China to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>reopening his asylum proceedings. Although Huang provides some evidence showing China\u2019s enforcement of its coercive population control policies,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he fails to show any changed circumstances regarding these policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We will deny the petition and affirm the BIA\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-17\">. The principal evidence supporting Huang's motion (aside from his children\u2019s birth) is an affidavit, dated 2003, from a specialist on Chinese demographic developments and population policy, John Aird. But the \"oft-cited Aird affidavit,\u201d <em>Wang, </em>437 F.3d at 275, has been significantly undermined. The BIA in <em>In re C-C-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 899 (2006), convincingly argued against further reliance on the Aird affidavit where petitioners for asylum contend they will be subject to persecution in the form of forced abortion or sterilization in China for having foreign-born children. Aird (who retired from the Census Bureau more than twenty years ago and died in October 2005) based his affidavit not on personal knowledge, but on documents mainly from the 1980s and 1990s that are in conflict with a more recent 2005 State Department report on conditions in China. <em>Id. </em>at 901-02. Further, the Aird affidavit \"only briefly discusses\u201d a 2004 State Department report \"as it relates to citizens returning to China with foreign-born children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 901; <em>see also Wang, </em>437 F.3d at 275, 274 (noting the Aird affidavit had been submitted in more than 200 cases since 1993, and rejecting reliance on it where the affidavit \"was not prepared specifically for petitioner and is not particularized as to his circumstances\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
