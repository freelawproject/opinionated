Roth argues that substantial evidence does not support the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) determination that no evidentiary weight should be given to an opinion by a treating physician, Dr. Kazi, regarding Roth\u2019s physical limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-23\">We review the ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford, v. Comm\u2019r, </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Even if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1158-59 (internal citation and quotation omitted). In conducting this review, we may not reweigh the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>or substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ. <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990). However, we review the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Lewis v. Barnhart, </em>285 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">If a treating physician\u2019s opinion on the nature and severity of a claimant\u2019s impairments is well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record, the ALJ must give it controlling weight. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). If the treating physician\u2019s opinion is not entitled to controlling weight, we have held that \u201cthe testimony of a treating physician must be given substantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159 (quoting <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997)). Further, we have found good cause and discounted a treating physician\u2019s report when the report \u201cis not accompanied by objective medical evidence or is wholly conclusory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 583-84 (11th Cir.1991)). Additionally, there is good cause where the treating physician\u2019s opinions are inconsistent with their own medical records. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Dr. Kazi\u2019s opinion was not and should not be assigned substantial weight because it was inconsistent with the record as a whole and not supported by the doctor\u2019s own medical records. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
