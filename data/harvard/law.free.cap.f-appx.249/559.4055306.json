We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review questions of law de novo. <em>See Lin v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 979, 981 (9th Cir.2007). We grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The IJ erred in concluding that Barra-gan-Juarez was ineligible to file a motion to reopen removal proceedings on the ground that he departed the United States after he was ordered removed in absentia. <em>See id. </em>at 982 (holding that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) does not preclude jurisdiction over motions to reopen filed by petitioners who had been lawfully removed after the completion of immigration proceedings and then reentered illegally).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The IJ also erred in determining that the original removal order was automatically reinstated upon Barragan-Juarez\u2019s illegal reentry into the United States. <em>See id. </em>at 982-83 (noting that before the prior order can be reinstated, an immigration officer must comply with the requirements set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.8).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Accordingly, we remand to the BIA with instructions to remand to the IJ for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\"> xhis disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
