R. Civ. P. 56(f). <em>Margolis v. Ryan, </em>140 F.3d 850, 853 (9th Cir.1998) (district court may implicitly deny a Rule 56(f) motion). Generally, a district court errs in denying such a request \u201cif the movant can show how allowing <em>additional </em>discovery would have precluded summary judgment.\u201d <em>Qualls v. Blue Cross of Cal., Inc., </em>22 F.3d 839, 844 (9th Cir.1994). \u201cSummary denial is especially inappropriate where the material sought is also the subject of outstanding discovery requests.\u201d <em>VISA Int\u2019l Serv. Ass\u2019n v. Bankcard Holders of Am., </em>784 F.2d 1472, 1475 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">The district court\u2019s ruling appears to be based on the ground that plaintiffs had \u201cadduced no evidence that they endeavor to perform the same functions\u201d as the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs here filed a timely response to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In that response, plaintiffs requested further discovery and identified the specific information they sought that would preclude summary judgment. Specifically, plaintiffs sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>depositions of the defendants\u2019 witnesses to determine \u201cthe specific \u2018things\u2019 each defendant did in distributing and selling the AbTronic.\u201d Such information was crucial to establish that plaintiffs and defendants did, in fact, \u201cendeavor to perform the same functions\u201d for purposes of establishing competitor standing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These requests for depositions were outstanding at the time the district court granted summary-judgment. Thus, \u201c[i]t was error for the trial court to have granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment without first having determined the merits of plaintiffs pending discovery motion.\u201d <em>Garrett v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>818 F.2d 1515, 1519 (9th Cir.1987). In light of this error, we reverse the district court\u2019s implicit Rule 56(f) ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Because we conclude that the district court should not have granted summary judgment without allowing the plaintiffs to conduct further discovery, we vacate the court\u2019s order granting defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The district court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action for interference with prospective economic advantage and conspiracy to interfere with prospective economic advantage pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6). In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that defendants interfered with the \u201crelationship between Plaintiffs and potential consumers.\u201d The tort of interference with prospective economic advantage does not, however, protect mere \u201cpotential\u201d relationships \u2014 which are \u201cat most a hope for an economic relationship and a desire for a future benefit.\u201d <em>Westside Ctr. Assocs. v. Safeway Stores 23, Inc., </em>42 Cal.App.4th 507, 527, 49 Cal. Rptr.2d 793. One of the elements of the tort of interference with prospective economic advantage is \u201can existing relationship with an identifiable buyer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because plaintiffs do not identify any such existing economic relationship that has been disrupted, they fail to state a claim for either interference with prospective economic advantage or conspiracy to interfere with prospective economic advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Because we reverse the district court in part, we vacate and remand the grant of attorneys\u2019 fees to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">REVERSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b567-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-11\">. The district court granted defendants\u2019 alternative motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) and for summary judgment. Because \"matters outside the pleadings [were] presented to and not excluded by the court,\" we consider the district court's ruling to be the grant of a motion for summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-17\">. To the extent the district court granted the summary judgment motion on the alternate ground that plaintiffs had \"not adduced any evidence that they sell any competitive product in the United States,\" the court erred, because there is undisputed evidence that BMR Neurotech sold the Flex in the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b568-6\">. On this incomplete record, we do not reach the issue whether the district court was correct in ruling that plaintiffs must endeavor to do the same things as the defendants in order to establish competitor standing under the Lanham Act and substantially congruent state law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
