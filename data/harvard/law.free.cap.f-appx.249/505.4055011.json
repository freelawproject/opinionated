Roberds (\u201cRo-berds\u201d), Roderick Williams, and Byron Williams for offenses arising from a criminal conspiracy to transport to and distribute drugs in Anchorage, Alaska. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AGcy\">\n<em>Byron Williams</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Byron Williams appeals his convictions of drug conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)-(C), maintaining drug-involved premises in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2), (b), possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and two counts of attempted possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B)(C). We reject Byron Williams\u2019 claim that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred his prosecution of all but the drug conspiracy charge. It has long been established that \u201ca substantive crime and a conspiracy to commit that crime are not the \u2018same of-fence\u2019 for double jeopardy purposes.\u201d <em>United States v. Felix, </em>508 U.S. 378, 389, 112 S.Ct. 1377, 118 L.Ed.2d 25 (1992); <em>see United States v. Wylie, </em>625 F.2d 1371, 1381-82 (9th Cir.1980). Nor was Byron Williams subjected to multiple punishments in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause as he attempted or conspired to violate the drug laws on two or more separate occasions. <em>See United States v. McQuisten, </em>795 F.2d 858, 868 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">\n<em>Roderick Williams</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">Roderick Williams appeals his convictions of drug conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)-(C) and maintaining drug-involved premises in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1), (b). We reject his claims that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of either offense and that he was unconstitutionally sentenced on the basis of conduct for which he was acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">Drug paraphernalia and residue seized from Roderick Williams\u2019 apartment and the testimony of co-conspirators that Roderick Williams sold cocaine out of his apartment, picked up cocaine to be distributed from Byron Williams, and came to the airport to pick up a drug courier are sufficient to sustain his conviction on both counts. <em>See United States v. Delgado, </em>357 F.3d 1061, 1068-70 (9th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Basinger, </em>60 F.3d 1400, 1404-06 (9th Cir.1995). This Court has held that it does not violate the Sixth Amendment to sentence defendants based on conduct for which they were acquitted. <em>United States v. Mercado, </em>474 F.3d 654, 657-58 (9th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">\n<em>Paula M. Roberds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">Roberds appeals her conviction of maintaining drug-involved premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1), (b). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that she possessed the essential <em>mens rea </em>element of the crime. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Section 856(a)(1) requires that the government prove that Roberds\u2019 purpose in maintaining her apartment was to manufacture, distribute, or use a controlled substance. <em>United States v. Tamez, </em>941 F.2d 770, 774 (9th Cir.1991). The government presented ample evidence that Roberds knew that Roderick Williams was manufacturing, distributing, and using drugs in the apartment they shared and some evidence that she knowingly assisted him in carrying out a drag transaction on the street. However, the government did not present any evidence of Roberds\u2019 purpose in maintaining the apartment, which furnished shelter to herself and to her child. <em>See </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02(2)(a)(i) (2006). That she knew what was going on cannot sustain beyond a reasonable doubt the inference that to help Williams\u2019 drug business was a purpose in her renting the apartment. <em>See United States v. Verners, </em>53 F.3d 291, 297 (10th Cir.1995). No doubt, it served his ends. No doubt she permitted the drug business to continue apparently without objection on her part. But no rational jury on the evidence presented could have concluded that the government had proved on her part a criminal purpose as required by \u00a7 856(a)(1): \u201c[I]t shall be unlawful to \u2014 (1) knowingly open, lease, rent, use, or maintain any place ... for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The government did produce in evidence a notebook whose first page contained a paragraph purporting to be written by Ro-berds, in which the writer stated that she had \u201clyed to the police about the incedent because I was drinking, emotional, and angry because roderick was cheating on me.\u201d On the face of it, this paragraph looks like something she had done herself or Roderick had done himself or forced Roberds to do to create some sort of alibi for Roderick. The government produced no evidence that it was in Roberds\u2019 handwriting. A \u201cFood List\u201d that is on the third page appears to be in a different hand. The fifth page begins, \u201cHi my name is Paula Roberds and I am practicing my cursive hand writing....\u201d Examples follow on this page and a subsequent one. Several pages later these notations appear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">25.8 1050 Full</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjA\">26.6 550 half</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai3\">26.5 300 seven</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQU\">_ 170 ball</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"akt-dedup-1\">78.9 1.7 teen 100</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">After a large number of blank pages in the second section of the three-subject notebook, there are four sentences about chil-draising. The next page is devoted to \u201cStuff to do to Doupfien,\u201d apparently an enemy, and \u201cStuff to do for my baby.\u201d Hundreds of blank pages follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">In closing argument, the prosecutor made a throwaway reference to the notebook, carefully avoiding any claim that the government had established the hand that wrote the drug notations on one page of it. A jury could guess that Roberds kept a \u201cdrug ledger.\u201d The guess would have been a leap far beyond the evidence before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">We AFFIRM the convictions of Byron Williams and Roderick Williams, and REVERSE Paula M. Roberds\u2019 conviction of maintaining drug-involved premises in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1), (b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b533-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>WALLACE, Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting:</author>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">I agree with the majority\u2019s affirmance of the convictions of Byron Williams and Roderick Williams. But I would also affirm Paula Roberds\u2019 conviction. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a rational trier of fact could have found that Roberds maintained, at least in part, a drug-involved premises in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In addition to evidence that Roberds was fully aware that Williams was manufacturing, distributing, and using drugs in the apartment that they shared, there are two additional pieces of evidence that a rational jury could have relied on to conclude that Roberds possessed the requisite <em>mens rea </em>for her conviction. First, the government presented testimony that Ro-berds drove a vehicle during what the jury could find to be a drug transaction; when searched, the vehicle yielded an open, cash-filled purse believed to belong to Ro-berds. Although her participation in that drug transaction does not directly prove that she maintained her apartment for drug-related purposes, in a light most favorable to the government it supports an inference the jury could properly draw that she was involved and, together with the evidence found in the apartment itself, that she had, as one purpose of maintaining her apartment, the facilitation of Williams\u2019 drug business.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Second, reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the government, a rational jury could have concluded that the notebook in evidence belonged to Roberds and that the list of drug quantities and prices was in her handwriting. The notebook begins, \u201cI Paula Roberds.\u201d The majority speculates it may not be in her handwriting but the jury can make a different finding and, reviewing in a light most favorable not to the majority\u2019s view but to the government, it did. This suggests at least some active participation in the drug business going on in her apartment and a rational jury could have concluded that Roberds was not merely a passive observer, but that she actively participated in Roderick Williams\u2019 drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">The statute does not require that Ro-berds\u2019 <em>sole </em>purpose in maintaining the apartment was to manufacture, distribute, or use a controlled substance. <em>See United States v. Tamez, </em>941 F.2d 770, 773-74 (9th Cir.1991). That one of her purposes in maintaining the apartment was to facilitate the sale of drugs could have been inferred by a rational jury based on the evidence presented, and I would affirm Roberds\u2019 conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
