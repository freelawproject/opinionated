Sept. 19, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A79 682 442 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 6, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-17\">As a threshold matter, we must reject the Government\u2019s contention that Chen failed to exhaust the issues raised in his petition. Chen\u2019s brief to the BIA argued that he had \u201ctestified clearly and consistently ... and the [IJ] failed to analyze his testimony as such.\u201d The omitted detail would not \u201cconstitute [ ] a ground, in and of itself, on which an IJ\u2019s denial of [relief] may be based.\u201d <em>See Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117-18 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-18\">As to the merits, when the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. I.N.S., </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. I.N.S., </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled on other grounds, Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-19\">Applying this standard, we conclude the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding rested on significant inconsistencies between Chen\u2019s testimony and a letter he submitted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>IJ, purportedly on behalf of the Shaman Christian Church, a government-registered church in China. The letter states Chen \u201cbecame a Christian believer in 1997,\u201d an assertion the IJ found was inconsistent with Chen\u2019s earlier testimony that he first began attending the Shaman Christian Church when he was an infant and had been baptized when he was three or four years old. Furthermore, although he denied that the letter was a forgery, Chen\u2019s claim to have requested it at the suggestion of his former attorney is belied by the date of the letter, which preceded the attorney\u2019s representation. Chen tried to explain the inconsistencies, but a reasonable fact-finder would not have been compelled to credit his explanations, and the IJ acted reasonably in not doing so. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Moreover, contrary to Chen\u2019s argument, the letter was not merely an ancillary matter, but went to the heart of his claim that he faced persecution because he was a Christian. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308-09. The IJ sought other evidence that would corroborate Chen\u2019s religious practices. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 290 (2d Cir.2000) (observing that \u201ccorroborating evidence (or an explanation for its absence) may be required if it would reasonably be expected, even where the applicant\u2019s testimony is credible\u201d). After observing that Chen had not, as promised, submitted an updated letter from his current church, the IJ permissibly weighed that against Chen\u2019s overall credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">To be sure, the IJ\u2019s decision is not a model of clarity in all respects. But taken as a whole, we conclude that it was supported by substantial evidence and provided a valid basis for the denial of asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See SecaidaRosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307; <em>Paul v. Gonzales, 444 </em>F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). As such, we do not reach the alternative rationale offered for the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b947-13\">. Because Chen failed to raise his CAT claim in his brief, we deem that claim waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
