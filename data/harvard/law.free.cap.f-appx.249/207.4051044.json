Specifically, Jones challenges his 77-month prison sentence, which represents the low end of the 77-to-96 month Sentencing Guidelines range determined on the basis of an adjusted offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of VI.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jones submits that the district court erred in (1) effectively treating the Guidelines as mandatory by concluding that it was not empowered to impose a non-Guidelines sentence based on a judicial finding that ammunition possession by a convicted felon was, by its nature, a less serious offense than firearm possession; and (2) failing to recognize that category VI overstated the seriousness of his prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In the aftermath of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review challenged sentences only for \u201cunreasonableness,\u201d a concept that embodies both the term of the sentence and the procedures employed in fixing it, <em>see United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006); <em>accord United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 131-32 (2d Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Florez, </em>447 F.3d 145, 157 (2d Cir.2006). In so doing, we do not \u201csubsti-tut[e] ... our judgment for that of the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27. \u201cRather, the standard of our review is more akin to abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Florez, </em>447 F.3d at 158 (internal quotation marks omitted). In applying this standard of review to this case, we assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">1. <em>The District Court Did Not Treat the Guidelines as Mandatory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Jones submits that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court erroneously interpreted this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), to make the Guide-: lines mandatory. Alternatively, he contends that the district court proeedurally erred in concluding that the non-Guidelines factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) had to cut \u201cvery strongly\u201d in a defendant\u2019s favor to support a non-Guidelines sentence. Neither argument is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">The district court did not construe <em>Crosby </em>to make the Guidelines mandatory; it observed only that <em>Crosby </em>cautioned against an assumption that <em>Booker </em>restored district courts\u2019 \u201cpreguidelines discretion.\u201d Sentencing Tr. at 9. This is correct. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-473, Title II \u00a7\u00a7 211-38, 98 Stat. 1987 (1984), in an effort to minimize perceived unwarranted sentencing disparities, establishes a list of seven factors, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), that a district judge must now consider in imposing sentence. While <em>Booker </em>excised from the Sentencing Reform Act those provisions that made the Guidelines mandatory, it left in place the mandate for consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors in the imposition of sentences. <em>See generally United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d at 107-14. To this extent, the <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing discretion of district courts does not equate <em>to </em>the discretion exercised prior to the Sentencing Reform Act and the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Among the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that must be considered are the sentencing range specified by the Guidelines in a given case as well as any relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4), (5). The critical guideline in this ease is 2K2.1, which provides for a base offense level of 24 if a defendant convicted of at least two prior violent or drug felonies possesses either ammunition or a firearm. Jones submits that the district court erred in concluding that it was precluded from drawing a sentencing distinction between these proscribed items, treating ammunition possession more leniently than firearm possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In fact, the district court concluded only that it could not \u201ccarve out a whole class of offenses in the guideline range\u201d on the ground that it disagreed with Congress\u2019s decision to criminalize ammunition possession by prior felons the same as firearm possession. Sentencing Tr. at 9. Although defense counsel explained that the \u201ccarve-out\u201d would be \u201cunder the guidelines\u201d rather than the statute, the distinction does not further his argument. <em>Id. </em>at 11. We \u201cview as inherently suspect a non-Guidelines sentence that rests primarily upon factors that are not unique or personal to a particular defendant....\u201d <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d at 133. That suspicion is particularly aroused when the factor at issue, as in this case, involves a categorical assessment of the seriousness of a particular offense. As we observed in <em>United States v. Anati, </em>while the seriousness of the offense is a sentencing factor that must be considered pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), according a district court wide discretion to impose a non-Guidelines sentence \u201cbecause of a personal view that the Sentencing Commission has undervalued [or overvalued] the seriousness of the offense risks a major inroad on the judge\u2019s obligation to consider the applicable guideline, as required by section 3553(a)(4), and also risks creating the sort of unwarranted disparity among defendants that the Guidelines attempt to minimize,\u201d 457 F.3d 233, 237-38 (2d Cir.2006). Thus, we have suggested that \u201cthe tension between these considerations\u201d can best be adjusted \u201cby restricting the judge\u2019s discretion to act on the basis of a personal view as to the seriousness of the type of offense the defendant has committed while permitting some discretion to enhance (or mitigate) because of the particular circumstances of a defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238. In short, the district court here correctly concluded that the categorical Guidelines \u201ccarve-out\u201d proposed by the defense for ammunition possession by a convicted felon was outside the scope of its proper sentencing discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>we observed that \u201c[a] non-Guidelines sentence that a district court imposes in reliance on factors incompatible with the Commission\u2019s policy statements may be deemed substantively unreasonable in the absence of persuasive explanation as to why the sentence actually comports with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d 452 F.3d at 134. In this case, the district court could not identify any such explanation in the record before it. To the contrary, it found: \u201cThe other individualized sentencing factors set forth in the statute do not cut in [Jones\u2019s] favor. They cut against him.\u201d Sentencing Tr. at 15. In light of this conclusive finding that the non-Guidelines \u00a7 3553(a) fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>tors actually cut against Jones, any conceivable error in the court\u2019s reference to a sentence it might impose if the factors cut \u201cvery strongly\u201d in Jones\u2019s favor was plainly harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\n<em>2. The District Court Did Not Err in Considering Jones\u2019s Criminal History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Jones further submits that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court erred by failing \u201cto take into due consideration the \u2018history and characteristics of the defendant\u2019 \u201d when calculating his criminal history. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 22 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)). Specifically, he contends that the district court \u201cshould have given some deference to the nature of the subject offenses and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d to conclude that a criminal history category of VI overstated his dangerousness. <em>Id. </em>at 23. We find no error. The district court recognized its obligation to consider Jones\u2019s history and characteristics pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Nevertheless, it noted Jones\u2019s \u201csubstantial criminal record\u201d and concluded that his personal history and characteristics \u201ccut against him.\u201d Sentencing Tr. at 17, 15. This conclusion was well within the district court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In sum, we reject Jones\u2019s procedural challenges to the reasonableness of his sentence as without merit. The judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, dated September 22, 2005, and entered on October 3, 2005, is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\">. Jones does not challenge this Guidelines calculation. To the extent the government initially argued that this court lacks jurisdiction to review a sentence falling within a defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range, that argument is now foreclosed by our holding in <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
