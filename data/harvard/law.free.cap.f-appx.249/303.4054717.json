We previously dismissed Alvarez\u2019s direct appeal as untimely filed. Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the district court abused its discretion in failing to find excusable neglect in denying Alvarez\u2019s motion to file a notice of appeal out of time. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-23\">Alvarez\u2019s judgment was entered on August 1, 2006. The time period for Alvarez to file a notice of appeal expired on August 15, 2006. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b), 26(a). Alvarez filed his pro se notice of appeal at the earliest on October 28, 2006. He filed a motion for extension of time to file notice of appeal on December 13, 2006, arguing that his attorney did not file an appeal as he requested. The court denied the motion by order entered December 21, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-24\">The district court may grant an extension of time up to thirty days after the expiration of the appeal period, if there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>a finding of good cause or excusable neglect. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). The district court only has authority, however, \u201cto extend the time to file a notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(b).\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). The time periods presented in Rule 4(b) are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 196 (4th Cir.1991). As the notice of appeal and motion for extension of time in this case were filed well outside the excusable neglect period provided in Rule 4(b)(4), the district court had no jurisdiction to grant the extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Alvarez\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file his notice of appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This court requires that counsel inform Alvarez, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Alvarez requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Alvarez. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\"> In his <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel also raises substantive claims pertaining to Alvarez's conviction and sentence. On review of an <em>Anders </em>appeal, we typically review the record in the case for any meritorious issues. Having already dismissed Alvarez's appeal as untimely filed and finding no error in the court\u2019s order denying his motion to extend time to file a notice of appeal, in this case, we do not reach the merits of Alvarez\u2019s substantive claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
