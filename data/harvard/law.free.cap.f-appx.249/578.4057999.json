To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">We review factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>See Aruta v. INS, </em>80 F.3d 1389, 1393 (9th Cir.1996). The IJ properly sustained the charge against Delgado by relying on the record of deportable/inad-missible alien (\u201c1-213\u201d). <em>See Espinoza v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 308, 310 (9th Cir.1995) (holding the government met its burden of proving removability where it submitted an authenticated, reliable 1-213, in which the individual conceded alienage). Delgado failed to present evidence that the I-213 is unreliable, or independently establish his entry was by means of lawful admission. <em>See id; see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (an individual in removal proceedings has the burden to show \u201cthe time, place, and manner of his entry into the United States\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-16\">We lack jurisdiction to review Delgado\u2019s remaining contentions because he failed to raise them before the BIA and thereby did not exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b605-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
