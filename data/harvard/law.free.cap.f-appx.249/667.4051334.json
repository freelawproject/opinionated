We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review <em>de novo, United States v. Ritchie, </em>342 F.3d 903, 906 (9th Cir.2003), and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-28\">On summary judgment, <em>see Ritchie, </em>342 F.3d at 909, the district court ruled that Jaroch was not entitled to monetary damages because he did not come forward with reliable evidence of the value of his property. We disagree. In compli-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>anee with the district court\u2019s order, Jaroch submitted competent evidence of the value of the property. The Government never submitted any evidence to the district court about the value of the property. We therefore conclude that the district court erred when it failed to award Jaroch the $2,500 he declared in a sworn statement that the property was worth. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the district court to enter judgment in favor of Jaroch.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s orders denying Jaroch\u2019s motion to waive the fine and his request to participate in the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Inmate Financial Responsibility Program because he has not filed a notice of appeal from either of these orders. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) (requiring that a notice of appeal \u201cdesignate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed\u201d); <em>Whitaker v. Garcetti, </em>486 F.3d 572, 585 (9th Cir.2007). We reject Jaroch\u2019s contention that the fact he is proceeding <em>pro se </em>exempts him from the requirement that he timely file a notice of appeal from these orders. <em>See Malone v. Avenenti, </em>850 F.2d 569, 573 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED for entry of judgment in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Judge Rawlinson would remand this case to the district court for submission of additional evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b693-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
