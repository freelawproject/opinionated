We review for substantial evidence, <em>Singh v. Ilchert, </em>63 F.3d 1501, 1506 (9th Cir.1995), and we dismiss in part, grant and remand in part, and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determination that Singh\u2019s asylum application was untimely, or whether changed circumstances excused the untimely filing, because it is based on disputed facts. <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650, 656-57 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition as to Singh\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-25\">We have jurisdiction over the remaining claims under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Because the \u201cBIA\u2019s decision is silent on the issue of credibility, despite [the] IJ\u2019s explicit adverse credibility finding, we ... presume that the BIA found [Singh] to be credible.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>Krotova v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 1080, 1084 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s finding that Singh failed to show that the harm he experienced occurred on account of a protected ground, because Singh established that his second and third arrests were motivated, at least in part, by a protected ground. <em>See Singh, </em>63 F.3d at 1509.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Because the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s past persecution finding is not supported by substantial evidence, <em>see id., </em>and a finding of past persecution gives rise to a presumption of eligibility for withholding of removal, <em>see Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1115 (9th Cir.2000), we grant the petition for review with regard to Singh\u2019s claim for withholding of removal, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Because Singh failed to show that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if removed to India, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part, GRANTED and REMANDED in part, and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b628-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
