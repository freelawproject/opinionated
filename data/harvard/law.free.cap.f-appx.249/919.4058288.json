Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 8, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The sole contention in the petition is that it was an abuse of discretion for the IJ to deny Mokbil\u2019s application for a continuance while an appeal was pending on the denial of his 1-130 application. By letter dated September 12, 2007, Mokbil informed this Court that he is \u201cno longer married.\u201d As both petitioner and respondent agree, the termination of the marriage renders the issue moot and compels us to dismiss. <em>See New York City Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys. v. Dole Food Co., </em>969 F.2d 1430, 1433 (2d Cir.1992) (\u201cA moot action ... must be dismissed, even if the case was live at the outset but later events rendered it moot on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED as moot. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
