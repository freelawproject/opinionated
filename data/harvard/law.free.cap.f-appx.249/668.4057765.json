We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-17\">This Court reviews de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings, such as ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001). Ordinarily, the BIA will not consider an ineffective assistance of counsel claim absent compliance with the <em>Lozada </em>requirements. See <em>Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), <em>affd, </em>857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir.1988). Although we do not strictly enforce the <em>Lozada </em>requirements, \u201cwe have never excused a petitioner\u2019s failure to provide an affidavit where, as here, the facts underlying the petitioner\u2019s claim were not plain on the face of the administrative record.\u201d <em>Reyes, </em>358 F.3d at 597 (internal quotations omitted). Petitioners did not submit an affidavit to support their claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Additionally, it is not plain from the face of the record that they received ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, the BIA did not err in rejecting Petitioners\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-18\">Petitioners did not raise them equitable estoppel claim before the BIA and therefore it is not exhausted. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1); <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-19\">Lastly, Petitioners assert that both the IJ and the BIA issued a \u201cboilerplate\u201d opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ion which is insufficient for us to conduct our review. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, 58 </em>F.3d 1425, 1430 (9th Cir.1995). However, the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s respective opinions indicate that each gave Petitioners\u2019 application the required individual determination and reasoned explanations for their decisions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Petition for Review DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b695-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
