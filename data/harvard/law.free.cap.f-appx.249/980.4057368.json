Because of the Board\u2019s summary affirmance, the immigration judge\u2019s decision serves as the final agency determination. <em>Lin-Jian v. Gonzales, </em>489 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2007); see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-22\">Anagho challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that his testimony was not credible and that he otherwise failed to meet his burden of proving eligibility for asylum. We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and we uphold credibility determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-23\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding and the ruling that Anagho failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on a protected ground, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2007) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, as Anagho cannot sustain his burden on the asylum claim, he cannot establish entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum-even though the facts that must be proved are the same-an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3) [(2000)].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Anagho also alleges that the Board erred in denying him protection under the Convention Against Torture. To qualify for this protection, a petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(e)(2) (2007). Anagho failed to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Accordingly, we deny Anagho\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
