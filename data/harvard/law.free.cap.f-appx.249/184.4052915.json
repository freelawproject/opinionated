(\u201cMitchell\u201d) brought suit against Intel in the United State District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging a number of Intel\u2019s products infringe Claim 1 of the '154 patent. In construing the claims, the district court adopted the claim construction of District Judge Susan Illston of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. <em>Claim Construction Opinion; see, Maurice Mitchell v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., </em>No. C 01-0295 SI (N.D.Cal. Jan. 29, 2002). Specifically, the district court construed \u201cfirst switch means,\u201d \u201csecond switch means,\u201d and \u201cmeans for causing\u201d as means-plus-function limitations governed by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, If 6. <em>Id. </em>The district court then determined that the '154 patent specification did not disclose structure for the \u201cswitch means\u201d limitations and the \u201cmeans for causing\u201d limitation. <em>Opinion. </em>As a result, the district court found Claim 1 of the '154 patent indefinite and therefore invalid as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment without deference, drawing all justifiable inferences in favor of the nonmovant. <em>Genentech, Inc. v. Amgen, Inc., </em>289 F.3d 761, 767 (Fed.Cir. 2002). Claim construction is a matter of law that this court reviews without deference. <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1456 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc); <em>Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>52 F.3d 967, 979 (Fed.Cir. 1995), <em>affd, </em>517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996). \u201cThe review of indefiniteness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, paragraph 2, proceeds as a question of law without deference.\u201d <em>SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp., </em>403 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">\u201cA patent issued from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) bears the presumption of validity under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282. An accused infringer, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>fore, must prove patent invalidity under the clear and convincing evidentiary standard.\u201d <em>Metabolite Labs., Inc. v. Lab. Corp. of Am. Holdings, </em>370 F.3d 1354, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2004). Specifically, \u201c[t]he claims as granted are accompanied by a presumption of validity based on compliance with, inter alia, \u00a7 112 H 2.\u201d <em>S3 Inc. v. NVIDIA Corp., </em>259 F.3d 1364, 1367 (Fed. Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">As stated in \u00a7 112 1\u00cd 2, \u201c[t]he specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\u201d Claims \u201cparticularly point[ ] out and distinctly claim[]\u201d the invention when one of ordinary skill in the art would understand the scope of the invention when the claims are read in conjunction with the specification. <em>Default Proof Credit Card Sys., Inc. v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., </em>412 F.3d 1291, 1298 (Fed.Cir.2005); 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 \u00b6 2. But, if an applicant \u201cemploys means-plus-function language in a claim, one must set forth in the specification an adequate disclosure showing what is meant by that language.\u201d <em>In re Donaldson, </em>16 F.3d 1189, 1195 (Fed.Cir.1994) (en banc); 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 116. Therefore, \u201c[i]f there is no structure in the specification corresponding to the means-plus-function limitation in the claims, the claim will be found invalid as indefinite.\u201d <em>Biomedino, LLC v. Waters Technologies Corp., </em>490 F.3d 946, 950 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The district court found that \u201cmeans for causing\u201d was a means-plus-function limitation without any descriptive corresponding structure within the specification. The only possible structure corresponding to the claimed function appears at Col.24 1.67 to Col.25 1. 56. <em>Opinion, </em>slip op. at 8. The district court then determined this passage did not contain any structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">As illustrated by the claim language in limitation 13, the \u201cmeans for causing\u201d controls the first and second switch means. In other words, the \u201cmeans for causing\u201d would need a structure (i.e., device or driver) to control the function of the switch means. Mitchell contends that the '154 patent specification contains an adequate disclosure corresponding to the \u201cmeans for causing\u201d limitation to satisfy \u00a7 112 It 2. Mitchell argues that the district court incorrectly limited the corresponding structure to the disclosure at Col.24 1.67 to Col.25 1.56 when the following additional passages also disclose structure: Col.15, 11.40-56; Col.19, line 34 to Col.20, line 5; Col. 13, 11.11-19; Col.7, 11.37-44; Col.44, 11.21-46; Col.89, 11.14-19; Col.90, 11.16-30; and Col.16,11.48-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Like the district court, however, this court discerns little, if any, structure for \u201cmeans for causing\u201d in the specification and no disclosed link between that purported structure and the claimed function. This court also credits the district court\u2019s finding that Mitchell\u2019s counsel admitted during the summary judgment hearing that the Col.24 1.67 to Col.25 1.56 passage does not include any structure linked to the claimed function. <em>Maurice Mitchell Innovations v. Intel Corp., </em>2:04cv450, slip op. at 35 (E.D.Tex. Sept. 28, 2006) (Transcript of Pretrial and Motion Hearing). Beyond that passage, however, this court finds no specific structure disclosed anywhere in the specification to carry out the \u201cmeans for causing\u201d function.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Mitchell also offers another source of structure for the claimed means. The specification refers to the MCS6520 Peripheral Interface Adaptor (\u201cPIA\u201d). '154 Patent col.15 11.40-55. The MCS6520 is a complex integrated circuit (i.e., chip) containing numerous individual circuits which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>functions as an interface between a microprocessor and peripheral devices such as printers, displays and the like. Mitchell contends that the MCS6520 contains tristate circuitry or tri-state drivers and that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the tri-state structure in the MCS6520 to be capable of performing the \u201cmeans for causing\u201d function.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">While the MCS6520 may contain tristate or driver type circuits, the specification does not identify the tri-state circuits in the MCS6520 as the structure to carry out the \u201cmeans for causing\u201d limitation. The mere mention of a complicated integrated circuit, comprised of hundreds if not thousands of circuits, is much too broad to sufficiently indicate the precise \u201cmeans for causing\u201d structure to a person of ordinary skill in the art. <em>See Med. Instrumentation &amp; Diagnostics Corp. v. Elekta AB, </em>344 F.3d 1205, 1212 (Fed.Cir. 2003) (\u201cIt is important to determine whether one of skill in the art would understand the specification itself to disclose the structure, not simply whether that person would be capable of implementing that structure.\u201d). In other words, as the district court noted, the MCS6520 is both too broad and not linked to the \u201cmeans for causing\u201d limitation. <em>Opinion, </em>slip op. at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Mitchell also attempts to identify structure in a variety of generalized passages in the specification. This court has examined these passages and finds no specific structure. Mitchell only states that \u201c[t]hese passages are additional disclosures of the details of the structure, readily apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.\u201d In effect, Mitchell merely references various passages in the specification without providing any information to show structure corresponding to \u201cmeans for causing.\u201d Mitchell appeal's to be arguing that a person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to ascertain the corresponding structure by combining a variety of passages in the specification with their knowledge of the art. However, \u201cin order for a claim to meet the particularity requirement of H 2, the corresponding structure(s) of a means-plus-function limitation must be disclosed in the written description in such a manner that one skilled in the art will know and understand what structure corresponds to the means limitation.\u201d <em>Atmel Corp. v. Info. Storage Devices, Inc., </em>198 F.3d 1374, 1382 (Fed.Cir.1999). Thus, the statute requires more than just the possibility that an artisan of ordinary skill may be able to figure out the corresponding structure. The quid pro quo for using a means-plus-function limitation requires specificity in reciting structure and linking that structure to the limitation. <em>Id. </em>Mitchell does not carry out its part of the quid pro quo bargain. This court sustains the finding that claim 1 is indefinite under U.S.C. \u00a7 112,112.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">This court need not reach the \u201cswitch means\u201d and \u201cpath configuring means\u201d limitations because the district court\u2019s decision can be affirmed solely on the \u201cmeans for causing\u201d limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Because the district court correctly construed the claim term \u201cmeans for causing\u201d as a means-plus-function limitation under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, H 6 and correctly found the specification did not contain any corresponding structure for this limitation, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
