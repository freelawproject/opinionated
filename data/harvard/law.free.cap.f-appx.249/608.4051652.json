We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Where, as here, the BIA affirms without an opinion, we review directly the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Taslimi filed her asylum application within a reasonable time after her changed circumstances. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4)(ii); <em>see also Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 657-58 (9th Cir. 2007) (per curiam). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review as to Taslimi\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">Taslimi contends that the IJ erred in granting withholding of removal, entering an order of removal, and denying voluntary departure. We lack jurisdiction to consider an IJ\u2019s decision concerning voluntary departure. <em>See Galeana-Mendoza v. Gonzales, </em>465 F.3d 1054, 1056 n. 5 (9th Cir.2006). Moreover, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s grant of withholding of removal and entry of an order of removal was appropriate because withholding of removal prevents Taslimi from being removed to Iran, but does not prevent her from being removed to a third country. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.16(f); <em>see also Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 917, 933 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, Taslimi\u2019s contention is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b635-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
