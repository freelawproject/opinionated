On appeal, Berumen argues that the district court erred at sentencing by finding that his prior Georgia conviction for entering an automobile with intent to commit a theft or other felony, a violation of O.C.GA. \u00a7 16-8-18, was an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Pope, </em>461 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2006). The meaning of an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), is a question subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See United States v. Ayala-Gomez, 255 </em>F.3d 1314, 1316 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">Section 2L1.2(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a base offense level of eight if a defendant is an alien convicted of unlawfully reentering the United States. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) states: \u201cIf the defendant was previously deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after ... a conviction for an aggravated felony, increase by 8 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). The application notes define \u201caggravated felony\u201d as having the same meaning as given to that term in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 3(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101, in turn, includes in the definition of aggravated felony \u201ca <em>theft offense </em>(including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year\u201d and also includes an <em>attempt </em>or conspiracy to commit such an offense. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G), (U) (emphasis added). Because Congress did not define the term \u201ctheft offense,\u201d courts define the term in \u201cthe generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States.\u201d <em>See Taylor v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number><em>States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (interpreting the term \u201cburglary\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)); <em>see also Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1353 (11th Cir.2005) (in the context of reviewing a decision by the Bureau of Immigration Appeals, noting that a theft offense was a \u201ctaking of property\u201d with \u201cintent to deprive the owner of the rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.\u201d (quotations omitted)). We have recognized that the \u201cbasic elements of an attempt are (1) an intent to engage in criminal conduct and (2) conduct constituting a substantial step towards the commission of the substantive offense which strongly corroborates the defendant\u2019s criminal intent.\u201d <em>United States v. Collins, </em>779 F.2d 1520, 1533 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The Supreme Court has held that, in determining whether a prior state offense qualifies as a predicate offense in a criminal enhancement statute, courts generally must \u201clook only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (footnote omitted). If the statutory definition of the prior offense includes additional conduct that does not meet the elements of the generic offense in the enhancement statute, then sentencing courts can look at the charging documents and jury instructions to the show that the defendant was actually convicted of the generic offense. <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The Court extended its holding in <em>Taylor </em>to convictions following guilty pleas. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 19, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The Georgia statute under which Beru-men was convicted provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5E\">If any person shall enter any automobile or other motor vehicle with the intent to commit a theft or a felony, he shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than five years, or, in the discretion of the trial judge, as for a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a6u-dedup-0\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-8-18. For federal sentencing purposes, the term of imprisonment imposed \u201cis deemed to include the period of incarceration or confinement ordered by a court of law regardless of any suspension of the imposition or execution of that imprisonment or sentence in whole or in part.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(48)(B). In <em>Ayala-Gomez, </em>in which we reviewed an enhancement for an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l), we held that the meaning of \u201csuspension\u201d in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(48)(B) was the meaning under federal law, and that the term of imprisonment was the term \u201cformally imposed, rather than the period the court actually ordered the defendant to serve.\u201d <em>Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Here, the Georgia statute and charging document establish that Berumen was convicted of entering an automobile with the intent to commit a theft. By entering the automobile, Berumen performed a substantial step toward a theft. Therefore, Berumen\u2019s prior offense was an attempted theft offense, within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) and (U). <em>See Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 598, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143; <em>Collins, </em>779 F.2d at 1533. Moreover, the Georgia court formally imposed a sentence of one year. <em>See Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d at 1319. Put simply, the district court did not err in determining that Berumen\u2019s pri- or offense was an aggravated felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 3(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"A_K\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
