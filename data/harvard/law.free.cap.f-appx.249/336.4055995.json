In the light of our court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir.2007), Rangel\u2019s assertion is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-21\">Citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Rangel challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Our court has held this issue \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate\u201d. <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
