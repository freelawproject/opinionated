Nelson, denying her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Chun Hui Liu, </em>A95 959 545 (B.I.A. Mar. 28, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 959 545 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 8, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-21\">Where, as here, the BIA issues an opinion that agrees with the IJ\u2019s decision and emphasizes particular aspects of it, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s decisions. <em>Ming Xia Chen v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394-95 (2d Cir. 2005)). We review the agency\u2019s factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); see, <em>e.g., Belortaja v. Gonzales </em>484 F.3d 619, 623 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Manzur v. U.S. Dep't Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Here, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The IJ based her finding in part on Liu\u2019s inability to recount facts out of chronological order. After testifying that she had been in hiding at her aunt\u2019s house for almost two months while authorities looked for her in relation to her husband\u2019s public opposition to the family planning policy, Liu went on to relate that she went into hiding at her aunt\u2019s house a second time after she made public statements against the Chinese government. When Liu then was asked why she first went into hiding at her aunt\u2019s house, Liu sat in silence for a long time and eventually answered that she could not remember. The IJ suggested that Liu\u2019s demeanor reflected a lack of confidence in recounting her story, and that this undermined her credibility. The Court affords \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the IJ\u2019s assessment of a witness\u2019 demeanor, which is \u201cvirtually always evaluated subjectively and intuitively\u201d and is therefore peculiarly within the IJ\u2019s province to assess. <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006); <em>accord Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2005). Nothing in the record compels a finding contrary to the IJ\u2019s assessment of demeanor in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The IJ also noted that: (1) the November 2003 prenatal record arising from Liu\u2019s alleged third pregnancy in the United States contained no indication that Liu had been pregnant a second time in China and that the pregnancy had been aborted; and (2) Liu\u2019s husband did not mention the alleged abortion in his initial asylum application. We generally will not disturb adverse credibility determinations that are based on \u201cspecific examples in the record of inconsistent statements ... about matters material to [an applicant\u2019s] claim of persecution, or on contradictory evidence or inherently improbable testimony regarding such matters.\u201d <em>Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 <em>F.3d </em>66, 74 (2d Cir.2004)). Here, the inconsistencies go to the heart of Liu\u2019s persecution claim, as they cast doubt on whether her abortion ever occurred. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003) (inconsistencies must be substantial and material to asylum claim to support an adverse credibility determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">With respect to the first discrepancy, Liu explained that the interpreter neglected to translate her statement to her doctor that she had undergone a forced abortion. The IJ rejected this explanation as it appeared Liu was otherwise able to provide her medical history and Liu made an insufficient effort to contact the interpreter \u2014 a friend \u2014 for corroboration. With respect to the second discrepancy, Liu\u2019s husband explained that his attorney had advised him to omit information about Liu\u2019s forced abortion from his asylum application. The IJ rejected this explanation because Liu\u2019s husband had not reported his attorney\u2019s malpractice. While these explanations perhaps were plausible, a reasonable fact-finder would not have been compelled to credit them. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 77, 80-81. The IJ therefore did not err in declining to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Accordingly, even without the IJ\u2019s additional credibility findings \u2014 some of which were not entirely error-free \u2014 the adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. We can confidently predict the same decision would be reached were the petition remanded. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Liu\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility finding in this case necessarily precludes success on her claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). To the extent that Liu\u2019s claim for CAT relief was based on the same factual predicate, the denial of that relief was proper as well. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005). Although Liu initially based her CAT claim on the allegation that she would be forcibly sterilized for having two children and punished for hiring a smuggler to help her depart China illegally, she did not raise these claims in her brief to this Court. Accordingly, they are waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
