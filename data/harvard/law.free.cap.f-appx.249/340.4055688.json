Williams, </em>747 So.2d 1256 (La.App. 2d Cir.1999). In May 2003, Hughes filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition in the district court. The district court dismissed the petition as untimely. The court concluded that because Hughes did not file a timely writ application in the Louisiana Supreme Court, none of his subsequent filings tolled the limitations period and, thus, his petition was not filed within one year as required under the AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Hughes was granted a certificate of ap-pealability on the issue whether the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely. The Respondent was directed to address, inter alia, the effect of an extension letter from the Louisiana Supreme Court, submitted by Hughes, on the timeliness of Hughes\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. We review the district court\u2019s determination that Hughes\u2019s petition was untimely <em>de novo. See Melancon v. Kaylo, </em>259 F.3d 401, 404 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Under La. Sup.Ct. R. X, \u00a7 5(a), a petitioner must file a writ application in the Louisiana Supreme Court \u201cwithin thirty days of the mailing of the notice of the original judgment of the court of appeal.\u201d The Rule also provides that \u201cNo extension of time therefor will be granted.\u201d However, the Respondent now concedes that extensions are \u201cin fact granted,\u201d and this \u201cis apparently done routinely, possibly pursuant to Louisiana Supreme Court Rule[ ] X, Section 5(b).\u201d The Respondent also concedes that because Hughes had been granted an extension by the Louisiana Supreme Court, his \u00a7 2254 petition is timely, and the matter should be remanded to the district court for review on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Hughes has demonstrated that the district court erred in concluding that his petition was untimely. Accordingly, we VACATE the judgment and REMAND the case to the district court for a determination of the merits of his petition. <em>See Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
