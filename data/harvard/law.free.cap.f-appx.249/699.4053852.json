Appellant Jimmie Defenbaugh presents two challenges to the Commissioner\u2019s denial of his application for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability benefits. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-23\">First, Appellant asserts that the administrative law judge (ALJ) improperly rejected the conclusions of a 2003 functional capacity evaluation conducted at a Veterans Administration (VA) medical center in finding Appellant\u2019s residual functional capacity and in posing a hypothetical to a vocational expert based on that finding. We conclude that the ALJ properly rejected the conclusions of the VA functional capacity evaluation because the physical limitations described in that evaluation were not attributable to \u201ca medically determinable impairment or a combination of such impairments\u201d within the meaning of the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929(b); SSR 96-8p. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination of Appellant\u2019s residual functional capacity, and the ALJ properly propounded a hypothetical to a vocational expert based on that residual functional capacity. <em>See Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1101 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-24\">Second, Appellant asserts that the ALJ improperly relied on vocational expert testimony to conclude that Appellant could perform the job of park worker and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>fore, that Appellant was not disabled at step five of the five-step sequential evaluation process. <em>See Tackett, </em>180 F.3d at 1099; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(v). We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s reliance on vocational expert testimony to find that Appellant was not disabled at step five was proper. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that the requirements of a park worker as described in the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>are consistent with Appellant\u2019s residual functional capacity. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, Dictionary of Occupational Titles 406.687-010 (4th ed. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the Commissioner\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s application for SSI disability benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
