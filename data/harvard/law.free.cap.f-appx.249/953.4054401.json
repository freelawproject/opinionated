The District Court determined that Mackey was not being punished excessively because his placement in the SHU was due to a 2005 misconduct and his refusal to participate in the SMU program, rather than the \u201cincident on 10-9-03.\u201d This conclusion was based upon an exhibit attached to the complaint, which contradicted allegations made in the complaint. The exhibit, a letter from National Appeals Administrator Harrell Watts, states that Mackey\u2019s last incident of misconduct occurred on June 30, 2005, and that Mackey\u2019s refusal to participate in the SMU program warranted his placement in the SHU at USP-Lewisburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Mackey timely appealed from the District Court\u2019s order. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our standard of review is plenary. <em>See Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Mackey argues that his placement in the SMU program at USP-Lewisburg violated his constitutional rights. As we have explained, a protected liberty interest can arise either from the Due Process Clause itself or from state law. <em>Asquith v. Department of Corrections, </em>186 F.3d 407, 409 (3d Cir.1999). No liberty interest arising from the Due Process Clause is implicated here because the conditions of confinement to which Mackey was subjected were within the sentence imposed upon him and did not otherwise violate the Constitution. <em>See Fraise v. Terhune, </em>283 F.3d 506, 522 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">The question then is whether Mackey was deprived of any state-created liberty interest. To implicate such an interest, a placement in restricted housing must impose an \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Placement in a restricted housing program will not be considered an atypical and significant hardship if it is what a prisoner \u201cmay reasonably expect to encounter as a result of his or her conviction.\u201d <em>Asquith v. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>186 F.3d 407, 412 (3d Cir.1999). Mackey contends that he was placed in the SMU from May 17, 2004, to October 3, 2005. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2. Inmates in the program are restricted to five hours of recreation per week, three showers per week, and one telephone call in a thirty-day period. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 8.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These conditions do not impose an atypical and significant hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life, and Mackey has not been deprived of a protected liberty interest by his placement in the SMU program. <em>See Fraise, </em>283 F.3d at 522-23 (prisoner\u2019s placement in special management unit did not impose atypical and significant hardship).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Mackey\u2019s placement in the SHU at USP-Lewisburg also was within \u201cthe ordinary incidents of prison life\u201d and thus did not violate his constitutional rights. <em>See Torres v. Fauver, </em>292 F.3d 141, 150-51 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Griffin v. Vaughn, </em>112 F.3d 703, 706-08 (3d Cir.1997). Mackey\u2019s refusal to participate in the SMU program at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>USP-Lewisburg resulted in his receiving incident reports which, in turn, caused his placement in the SHU. Although Mackey contends that he was being punished for an incident that occurred in 2003 at USP-Pollock, documents that Mackey submitted to the District Court show that Mackey\u2019s refusal to participate in the SMU program and his latest misconduct, which occurred in June 2005, led to his placement in the SHU.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-16\">. At the time he filed his complaint, Mackey was an inmate at USP-Lewisburg in Pennsylvania.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b979-17\">. <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b979-27\">. Although Mackey titled his complaint as arising under the Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act (FELA), the FELA creates a cause of action for tort claims by injured railway workers and is inapplicable here. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b980-6\">. As described in the first exhibit to Appellant's complaint, and clarified by Appellee in his brief, the SMU program is designed to teach inmates self-discipline and social values, and to facilitate their ability to co-exist with other inmates. An inmate who follows the program will complete it in twelve to eighteen months. Progress in the program results in a decrease in restrictions and, ultimately, a return to the general population. An inmate\u2019s failure to comply with the program results in greater restrictions and increased duration of the program.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
