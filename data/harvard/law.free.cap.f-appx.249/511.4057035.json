To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Guerrero failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">We also lack jurisdiction to review Guerrero\u2019s contention that the IJ erred in denying his request for a continuance, because he failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (court lacks jurisdiction to review claims that could have been, but were not, exhausted in administrative proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">We agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the performance by former counsel did not result in prejudice to Guerrero, and thus his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003) (to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must demonstrate prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
