Mata contends that the district court infringed his Sixth Amendment rights and erred by sentencing him based on its own factual findings. Mata also challenges the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. These arguments are foreclosed. See <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-23\">Mata argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not give sufficient weight to certain sentencing factors. Mata has failed to show error in connection with his sentence, which was the result of- a downward departure imposed in accordance with the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706-07 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-24\">Mata has shown no error in connection with the district court\u2019s judgment. Consequently, that judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary af-firmance, dismissal of the appeal, or an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
