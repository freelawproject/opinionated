We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm in part; and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-26\">We raised <em>sua sponte </em>our jurisdiction over Pryce\u2019s appeal of D.C. Case No. CR-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>02-01207-PA (\u201cCase 1207\u201d) in light of Pryce\u2019s failure to list Case 1207 on his notice of appeal. We find, based on the record before us and in light of the liberal construction given to notices of appeal filed by <em>pro se </em>defendants, that Pryce intended to appeal, and that we therefore have jurisdiction over the appeal of, both Case 1207 and D.C. Case No. CR-02-01206-PA. <em>See S.M. v. J.K., </em>262 F.3d 914, 922 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The government complied with its obligations under the plea agreement as well as its general obligation to make a good faith evaluation of Pryce\u2019s assistance as of the date of sentencing. <em>See United States v. Quach, </em>302 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir. 2002); <em>United States v. Burrows, </em>36 F.3d 875, 884 (9th Cir.1994). Pryce\u2019s waiver of his appeal rights is enforceable and precludes his challenges to his sentence of incarceration. <em>United States v. Nunez, </em>223 F.3d 956, 958 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The record on appeal is not sufficiently developed to permit review and determination of Pryce\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We therefore decline to address this claim. <em>See United States v. Ross, </em>206 F.3d 896, 900 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The district court\u2019s restitution order includes fees and costs paid by the Avakian, Valdecantos, Humber, and Rodeo Canon estates to Pryce\u2019s law firm. We reverse this portion of the restitution order and remand to the district court for consideration of whether all fees and costs paid to the firm should be included in the restitution order because of fraud in the inception of the firm\u2019s appointment or some other theory, or whether, instead, only \u201cunearned\u201d fees should be included in the restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The district court\u2019s restitution order also required Pryce to sell the Tarzana residence to satisfy Pryce\u2019s restitution obligation. We reverse this portion of the restitution order and remand to the district court for a determination of who owned or controlled the residence at the time of sentencing, and, if the residence was not owned or controlled by Pryce, whether the residence is nonetheless subject to the district court\u2019s order because of a fraudulent conveyance or some other theory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">We reject as without merit all other claims raised by Pryce in relation to the district court\u2019s restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">. Pryce\u2019s counsel informed this Court during oral argument that the Tarzana residence has been foreclosed upon and that approximately $65,000 in excess proceeds from the foreclosure sale are being held in trust. If the district court\u2019s order requiring the residence to be sold to satisfy Pryce\u2019s restitution obligation was not erroneous, these excess proceeds are subject to the court\u2019s order and must there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>fore be turned over to the government for application to Pryce's restitution obligation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
