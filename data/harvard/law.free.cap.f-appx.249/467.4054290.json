The district court sentenced him to a prison term of 235 months, which was at the very bottom of the guidelines range. On appeal, Yarbrough\u2019s principal argument is that a sentence within the guidelines range should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness. Alternatively, he argues that the sentence imposed in this case was not reasonable. In light of <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and because we are convinced that the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed a reasonable sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">After he was arrested in an undercover sting operation, Yarbrough pleaded guilty to distributing five grams or more of crack cocaine, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The probation officer calculated a base offense level of 36 and then deducted three levels for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 33. The probation officer also calculated a criminal history category of VI, yielding a guidelines imprisonment range of 235 to 293 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">At sentencing, Yarbrough\u2019s attorney argued that the court should \u201ctake into account\u201d that Yarbrough \u201cdid provide cooperation\u201d to the government, though he acknowledged that \u201cthe government holds all the cards\u201d concerning \u201cwhether they\u2019re going to make a 5K1 type motion or Rule 35 motion.\u201d Counsel for the government informed the court that the information Yarbrough provided \u201cunfortunately was not useful,\u201d thus the government declined to exercise its discretion to file a motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">The district court sentenced Yarbrough to 235 month\u2019s imprisonment, reasoning that a sentence at the bottom of the range was \u201csufficient to hold [him] accountable\u201d for his conduct and protect the community. The court observed that he had shown a \u201ccomplete lack of concern for the rights or safety of anybody around [him]\u201d by committing traffic offenses, abusing the mother of his children, and selling drugs. The court further noted that Yarbrough was \u201cdangerous to the community\u201d and that his criminal history category \u201cdoes not overstate the likelihood that [he] will reoffend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">On appeal, Yarbrough primarily argues that his within-guidelines sentence should not be presumed reasonable because, he contends, the presumption imposes an improper burden on sentencing courts to justify sentences outside the guidelines, thus effectively maintaining the mandatory sentencing regime that was found to be unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). But Yarbrough\u2019s challenge to the presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). His sentence fell within the properly calculated guidelines range; therefore we presume the sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gama-Gonzalez, </em>469 F.3d 1109, 1110 (7th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606, 607-08 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Yarbrough next contends that his sentence is unreasonable. He seems to contend that the court erred in denying him a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. But this is factually incorrect. The record is clear that Yarbrough received the three-level reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Yarbrough also argues that the district court erred in declining to press the government to request a sentence reduction for substantial assistance. But Yarbrough has no viable argument that the court erred in not relying on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 to reduce his sentence. A sentencing court has no power to reduce a sentence under that guideline unless the government first makes a motion. <em>See United States v. Artley, </em>489 F.3d 813, 819 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Burrell, </em>963 F.2d 976, 984-85 (7th Cir.1992). The government\u2019s decision not to file a substantial assistance motion will be upheld unless it was based on an unconstitutional motive or is not rationally related to any legitimate government purpose. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>458 F.3d 603, 604-05 (7th Cir.2006). Yarbrough has never asserted that the prosecution harbored any impermissible motive for declining to seek a \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction. Nor was it irrational for the government to decline to seek the reduction, given its determination that Yar-brough did not provide useful information.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
