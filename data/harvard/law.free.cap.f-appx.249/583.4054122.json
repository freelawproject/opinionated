Hart Union High School District (\u201cHart\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming in part and reversing in part the July 2003 decision of the Special Education Hearing Office (\u201cSEHO\u201d). The district court found that Hart failed to properly implement Aja Termine\u2019s individualized education program (\u201cIEP\u201d) upon her enrollment in October 2001 and denied Aja a free and public education (\u201cFAPE\u201d) for all periods between October 3, 2001 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and July 3, 2002. Hart also appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal as moot of Hart\u2019s complaint against the Termines as to the separate January 2004 SEHO decision. The Termines cross-appeal the district court\u2019s judgment, contending that it should have designated Westmark School (\u201cWest-mark\u201d) as Aja\u2019s stay put placement. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The Individual with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq., </em>defines a FAPE, in part, as \u201cspecial education and related services that ... are provided in conformity with the [IEP].\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(8)(D) (2001-02). The IDEA provides parents of a child with a disability the \u201copportunity to present complaints \u2022with respect to any matter relating to ... the provision of a [FAPE] to such child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1415(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>See Gregory K. v. Longview Sch. Dist., </em>811 F.2d 1307, 1310 (9th Cir. 1987). The district court did not err in finding that Hart failed to properly implement Aja\u2019s Glendale IEP upon her enrollment in October 2001, or that Hart failed to provide Aja with a FAPE for each of the three contested periods: (1) October 3-18, 2001; (2) October 18-November 2, 2001; and (3) November 2, 2001-July 3, 2002. As to the first period, upon Aja\u2019s transfer, Hart was required to <em>\u201cimmediately </em>provide! ] an interim placement [for Aja] for a period not to exceed 30 days.\u201d Cal. Educ.Code \u00a7 56325(a) (2001) (emphasis added). Because Hart did not even make an interim placement offer to Aja until October 18, 2001, it denied Aja a FAPE for the first period.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">As to the period between October 18, 2001 and November 2, 2001, Aja\u2019s interim placement offer was not \u201cin conformity with .... [her] existing [IEP], implemented to the extent possible within existing resources,\u201d <em>id. </em>Despite Hart\u2019s ability to place Aja in Westmark, as evidenced by its then existing contracts with the school, Hart\u2019s proposed interim placement provided that Aja spend 32 percent of her time in general education, even though her Glendale IEP provided that Aja spend no time in general education. <em>See Ms. S. ex rel G. v. Vashon Island Sch. Dist., </em>337 F.3d 1115, 1134 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Knight v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>877 F.2d 1025, 1028 (D.C.Cir.1989). Thus, Hart materially failed to implement Aja\u2019s Glendale IEP and denied her a FAPE, in violation of the IDEA. <em>See Van Duyn v. Baker Sch. Dist., </em>502 F.3d 811, 822 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that \u201ca <em>material </em>failure to implement an IEP violates the IDEA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">As to the third period, Hart was required, but failed, to conduct an IEP meeting and make a final placement offer to Aja. <em>See </em>Cal. Educ.Code \u00a7 56325(b). Hart was under this obligation whether or not Aja\u2019s mother chose to participate. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 56325(b), 56341.5(g). Thus, Hart failed to properly implement Aja\u2019s Glendale IEP and denied her a FAPE from November 2, 2001 to July 3, 2002 as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Nor did the district court err by requiring Hart to reimburse Aja for a portion of her Westmark tuition from October 3, 2001 through July 3, 2002. \u201c[A] court ... may require [a school district] to reimburse [private education expenses] if the court ... finds that the [school district] had not made FAPE available to the child in a timely manner ... and that the private placement is appropriate.\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.403(c) (2001); <em>see also Sch. Comm. of the Town of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>471 U.S. 359, 369-70, 105 S.Ct. 1996, 85 L.Ed.2d 385 (1985); <em>Longview Sch. Dist., </em>811 F.2d at 1315. Reimbursement may be denied or reduced if the court finds that a parent acted unreasonably. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.403(d)(3). Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Hart denied Aja a FAPE for each of the three contested periods; because placement was appropriate at Westmark; and because Aja\u2019s mother was uncooperative to the point where she contributed to the delay in Aja\u2019s assessment and the delay and ultimate failure to hold an IEP meeting, we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hart reimburse Aja for only half of her expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The district court properly declined to specifically designate Westmark as Aja\u2019s stay put placement, <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (2001-02), during the period from October 3, 2001 to July 3, 2002. Although Westmark was an appropriate placement, it was not the only interim placement that would have satisfied California Education Code section 56325(a) and served as an appropriate stay put. <em>See Vashon Island Sch. Dist., </em>337 F.3d at 1133-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Finally, the district court did not err in granting the Termines\u2019s motion to dismiss as moot Hart\u2019s appeal of SEHO\u2019s January 2004 decision. <em>See City of Erie v. Pap\u2019s A.M., </em>529 U.S. 277, 287, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 146 L.Ed.2d 265 (2000) (\u201cA case is moot when the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)). Hart repeatedly admitted that Westmark was the appropriate stay put placement for the 2002-2003 school year, and that it would continue to fund Aja\u2019s placement at Westmark. Thus, despite Hart\u2019s assertions to the contrary, the issue of financial responsibility for Westmark from July 3, 2002, the date of the first SEHO decision, to January 29, 2004, when the SEHO issued its second decision, is moot. That the attorney\u2019s fees issue was still outstanding is insufficient to keep the district court from finding Hart\u2019s claims moot. <em>United States v. Ford, </em>650 F.2d <em>1141, 1143-44 </em>(9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b611-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
