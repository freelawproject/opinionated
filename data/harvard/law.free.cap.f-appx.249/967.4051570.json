He was sentenced as a career offender to a term of 262 months imprisonment. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2005). In this appeal, Foote contends that he was improperly sentenced as a career offender, that this court\u2019s standard of review for criminal sentences is an unconstitutional return to mandatory guideline sentencing, and that the district court erroneously believed that it lacked authority to impose a sentence below the guideline range based in part on the disparity in sentences for crack and cocaine offenses. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">Foote first asserts that his 1995 North Carolina conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute was not a felony conviction, as the term is used in \u00a7 4B1.1, because the maximum sentence he could have received under North Carolina\u2019s structured sentencing scheme was 10-12 months. The offense is a Class H felony, <em>see </em>N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 90-95(a)(l), (b)(1) (2005), and the maximum sentence is twenty-five to thirty months imprisonment. N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(c), (d) (2005). A \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d is defined in Application Note 1 to USSG \u00a7 4B 1.2 as a state or federal offense \u201cpunishable by death or imprisonment exceeding one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-14\">In <em>United States v. Jones, </em>195 F.3d 205, 206-07 (4th Cir.1999), this court held that \u201ca prior North Carolina conviction was for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year if <em>any </em>defendant charged with that crime could receive a sentence of more than one year.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), this court reaffirmed its holding. <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246-47 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-15\">Foote acknowledges <em>Harp, </em>but argues that <em>Harp </em>cannot stand in light of <em>Blakely, United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007). As noted, <em>Harp </em>specifically held that <em>Blakely </em>did not affect this court\u2019s prior holding in <em>Jones. </em>Moreover, <em>Harp </em>was argued and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>decided after the opinion in <em>Booker </em>issued. Finally, <em>Cunningham </em>does not provide any basis for revisiting the issue. It held that California\u2019s determinate sentencing law violated the Sixth Amendment by \u201cassign[ing] to the trial judge, not to the jury, authority to find the facts that expose a defendant to an elevated \u2018upper term\u2019 sentence.\u201d 127 S.Ct. at 860. However, we noted in <em>Harp </em>that \u201cNorth Carolina courts have already concluded that the state sentencing regime can accommodate the process that <em>Blakely </em>demands.\u201d <em>Harp, </em>406 F.3d at 247 (citing <em>State v. Harris, </em>166 N.C.App. 386, 602 S.E.2d 697, 702 (2004), <em>holding aff'd, </em>360 N.C. 145, 622 S.E.2d 615, 620 (2005)). In any case, \u201ca panel of this court cannot overrule, explicitly or implicitly, the precedent set by a prior panel of this court. Only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can do that.\u201d <em>Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., </em>315 F.3d 264, 271-72 n. 2 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Foote\u2019s challenge to this court\u2019s decisions which accord a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within a properly calculated advisory guideline range is foreclosed by <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Last, Foote asserts that the district court erred in refusing to sentence him below the guideline range because of the disparity between cocaine and crack sentences. This court has held that, after <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court cannot vary from the advisory sentencing guideline range by substituting its own crack-to-powder cocaine ratio for the 100:1 ratio established by Congress. <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 633-34 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W.(U.S. June 20, 2006) (No. 05-11659). Although Foote suggests that we should reconsider the holding in <em>Eura, </em>we will not do so for the reasons previously explained. <em>See Scotts Co., </em>315 F.3d at 271-72 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
