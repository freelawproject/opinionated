To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion, <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Ochoa-Ortuno\u2019s September 20, 2005 motion to reconsider as untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2) (motions to reconsider must generally be filed within thirty days of the agency decision). Consequently, we do not reach Ochoa-Ortuno\u2019s contentions that the motion should have been granted on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to invoke its authority to reconsider <em>sua sponte </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that \u201cthe decision of the BIA whether to invoke its <em>sua sponte </em>authority is committed to its unfettered discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b540-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
