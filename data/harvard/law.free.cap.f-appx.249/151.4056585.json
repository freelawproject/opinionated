Adeduntan appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants, Athens Regional Medical Center, Athens Vascular Surgery, P.C., and a number of their individual employees (1) on his ten federal and state law claims, and (2) on Athens Regional\u2019s counterclaim for contractual attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">The defendants moved to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the court has yet to decide the amount of attorney\u2019s fees owed to Athens Regional under the contract between it and Adedun-tan, which served as the basis for a counterclaim by Athens Regional against him. According to the defendants (the other defendants have joined the motion to dismiss), because the district court has not resolved the issue of the amount of fees owed by Adeduntan to Athens Regional, which is part and parcel of the merits of the counterclaim, summary judgment for the defendants on the other issues and claims is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d that can be appealed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Where there is a question as to our appellate jurisdiction, we have an obligation to review it before we turn to the merits of the appeal. See <em>Main Drug, Inc. v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Inc., </em>475 F.3d 1228, 1229 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">Section 1291 provides the general rule that we have \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This is the most common basis for our appellate jurisdiction, and it is the jurisdictional hook relied on by Adeduntan in this appeal. He does not cite any other basis for our jurisdiction, <em>cf. id. </em>\u00a7 1292, and we haven\u2019t found any that would arguably apply here. Jurisdiction to hear the merits of Adeduntan\u2019s appeal therefore hinges on whether the district court\u2019s summary judgment for the defendants, reserving the amount of fees owed to Athens Regional as a result of its contract counterclaim, is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d under \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">\u201cAt common law,\u201d the rule was that \u201cattorney\u2019s fees were regarded as an element of \u2018costs\u2019 awarded to the prevailing party, which are not generally treated as part of the merits judgment.\u201d <em>Budinich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., </em>486 U.S. 196, 200, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 1721, 100 L.Ed.2d 178 (1988) (citation omitted). Since an attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ney\u2019s fees award was not considered part of the merits of the case, the absence of a fee award from the judgment for the winning party did not render that judgment non-final, precluding an immediate appeal by the losing party under \u00a7 1291. <em>See id. </em>at 200-01,108 S.Ct. at 1721.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">However, there is an exception to the common law rule that an attorney\u2019s fees award is not part of the merits of the case and does not render the judgment non-final. The exception applies where \u201cthe attorney\u2019s fees are an integral part of the merits of the case and the scope of relief.\u201d <em>Ierna v. Arthur Murray Int\u2019l Inc., </em>833 F.2d 1472, 1475 (11th Cir.1987) (citing <em>Holmes v. J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co., </em>682 F.2d 1143, 1146 (5th Cir.1982)). In such cases, the attorney\u2019s fees \u201ccannot be characterized as costs or as collateral and them determination is a part of any final, appealable judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in cases where attorney\u2019s fees are an integral part of the merits of a claim or counterclaim, the district court\u2019s judgment disposing of all other claims does not become final, and we lack appellate jurisdiction, until all the fee issues are decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Our case law supports the defendants\u2019 position that the attorney\u2019s fees due Athens Regional as part of its counterclaim against Adeduntan are an integral part of the merits of this case because they were awarded to Athens Regional based on a contract between it and Adeduntan. In <em>lerna, </em>where the contract between the parties provided that the \u201cprevailing party in the arbitration shall be awarded, in addition to any other relief granted, all of its costs and expenses of any such arbitration proceeding, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">When the parties contractually provide for attorneys\u2019 fees, the award is an integral part of the merits of the case.... Because the parties provided in their agreement for costs and expenses to be awarded to the prevailing party, the award is integral to the merits. The district court\u2019s order, therefore, did not become final and appealable until the court calculated the final award of costs and expenses to appellees as prevailing parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">833 F.2d at 1476. Likewise, in <em>Brandon, Jones, Sandall, Zeide, Kohn, Chalal &amp; Musso, P.A. v. MedPartners, Inc., </em>312 F.3d 1349 (11th Cir.2002), we reiterated the rule \u201c[i]n this Circuit\u201d that \u201ca request for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to a contractual clause is considered a substantive issue; and an order that leaves a substantive fees issue pending cannot be \u2018final.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">In this case, there is no dispute that Athens Regional\u2019s counterclaim for attorney\u2019s fees was based on a contract between it and Adeduntan. The \u201cConsent and Release\u201d form that he signed in exchange for his appointment to the medical staff at Athens Regional provided: \u201cIf ... I institute action against the Hospital ... and do not prevail, I agree to reimburse the Hospital ... for any and all costs incurred in defending such legal action, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d The district court granted summary judgment to Athens Regional on its counterclaim for fees based on the contract insofar as entitlement is concerned. The court, however, concluded that it could not determine from the record as it then stood the amount of fees due and that a hearing would be necessary for that reason. Adeduntan filed his notice of appeal before the district court held a hearing on the fees issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">We are aware that the Supreme Court said in <em>Budinich </em>that \u201c[cjourts and liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>gants are best served by the bright-line rule, which accords with traditional understanding, that a decision on the merits is a \u2018final decision\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 1291 whether or not there remains for adjudication a request for attorney\u2019s fees attributable to the case.\u201d 486 U.S. at 202-03, 108 S.Ct. at 1722, 108 S.Ct. 1717. And we are aware that this Court has said of <em>Budinich </em>that \u201cthe Supreme Court held that both the imposition and the amount of attorney\u2019s fees are always collateral to the merits of an action.\u201d <em>Fluor Constructors, Inc. v. Reich, </em>111 F.3d 94, 96 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also LaChance v. Duffy\u2019s Draft House, Inc., </em>146 F.3d 832, 837 (11th Cir.1998) (stating that <em>Budinich </em>\u201cheld that attorney\u2019s fees is always a collateral issue\u201d). Adeduntan contends that <em>Budinich </em>and our two opinions characterizing it mean that the exception to the attorney\u2019s-fees-as-collateral-issue for fees awarded based on a contract has been undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">While we are sympathetic to Adedun-tan\u2019s position, we as a panel cannot adopt it. <em>Budinich, Fluor, </em>and <em>LaChance </em>were all cases where the attorney\u2019s fees were awarded by the courts based on a prevailing party statute, rather than as part of the contract. <em>Budinich, </em>486 U.S. at 197, 108 S.Ct. at 1719 (awarded based on Colorado statute which gave fees to prevailing party in any employment compensation case); <em>Fluor, </em>111 F.3d at 95 (fees requested pursuant to attorney\u2019s fees provision in Energy Reorganization Act of 1974); <em>La-Chance, </em>146 F.3d at 833 (ADA case). The facts of those three cases could not have presented, and did not present, the issue of whether the amount of attorney\u2019s fees due to be awarded pursuant to a contract is a substantive issue, which would, if left open, render the judgment non-final for \u00a7 1291 purposes. As a result, those three decisions could not have decided the eon-tract-fees-as-a-merits-decision issue because their facts did not present that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Decisions, even Supreme Court decisions, can make law only to the extent of their facts; all else is dicta. <em>See Watts v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>316 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cWhatever their opinions say, judicial decisions cannot make law beyond the facts of the cases in which those decisions are announced.\u201d); <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1321 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (\u201cThe holdings of a prior decision can reach only as far as the facts and circumstances presented to the Court in the case which produced that decision.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). The only previous cases that have squarely presented the contract-attorney\u2019s-fees-final-judgment issue to this Court were <em>lema </em>and <em>MedPartners. </em>In both of them this Court held that \u201ca request for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to a contractual clause is considered a substantive fees issue; and an order that leaves a substantive issue pending cannot be \u2018final.\u2019 \u201d <em>MedPartners, </em>312 F.3d at 1355 (citing <em>Ierna, </em>833 F.2d at 1476).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">It could be argued that the holding of the <em>lema </em>decision was undermined by the sweeping language in the later decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Budinich, </em>even though that case did not squarely present the issue as to contractual attorney\u2019s fees. However, in addition to the principle, which we have just discussed, that holdings are limited to the issues actually presented by the particulars of a case, there is also the fact that <em>MedPartners, </em>which reiterated our holding in <em>lema, </em>came after <em>Budinich, </em>not before it. Therefore, <em>Med-Partners </em>establishes the law of this circuit on the issue in the post <em>-Budinich </em>era. For better or for worse, whether wrong or right, <em>MedPartners </em>is binding panel precedent that we must follow until this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>sitting en banc, or the Supreme Court, decides otherwise in a case that presents the contract-attorney\u2019s-fees issue. <em>See United States v. Steele, </em>147 F.3d 1316, 1317-18 (11th Cir.1998) (en banc).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Until that happens, this appeal is controlled by <em>MedPartners </em>and <em>lema. </em>And under those two decisions Adeduntan\u2019s appeal is due to be dismissed as premature. Of course, he may file another one after the district court enters an order determining the amount of fees owed. At that time the district court\u2019s judgment will be \u201cfinal\u201d and appealable under \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">. We are aware that the <em>MedPartners </em>decision did not explicitly address the argument that <em>Budinich </em>undermined the holding of <em>lema. </em>However, we have held a number of times that a prior panel precedent cannot be circumvented or ignored on the basis of arguments not made to, or factors not considered by, the prior panel. <em>See, e.g., Saxton v. ACF Indus., </em>239 F.3d 1209, 1215 (11th Cir.2001) (\"that holding [of the earlier panel] is the law of this Circuit regardless of what might have happened had other arguments been made to the panel that decided the issue first\") (citation omitted); <em>Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1302-03 (11th Cir.2001) (categorically rejecting an \"overlooked reason\u201d exception to the prior precedent rule); <em>Turner v. Beneficial Corp., </em>236 F.3d 643, 650 (11th Cir.2000) (\"Nor is the operation of the rule dependent upon the skill of the attorneys or wisdom of the judges involved with the prior decision-upon what was argued or considered.\u201d); <em>Cohen v. Office Depot, Inc., </em>204 F.3d 1069, 1076 (11th Cir.2000) (same); <em>United States v. Bas-caro, </em>742 F.2d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201c[T]he mere act of proffering additional reasons not expressly considered previously ... will not open the door to reconsideration of the question by a second panel.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-22\">.
