We previously vacated his sentence and remanded for the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to give further consideration to applying an enhancement for sophisticated laundering under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(8). <em>See United States v. Pizano, </em>421 F.3d 707, 733-34 (8th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>546 U.S. 1204, 126 S.Ct. 1409, 164 L.Ed.2d 108 (2006). On remand, the district court applied the enhancement and sentenced Piza-no below the resulting advisory Guidelines range to 420 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. On appeal, his counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and he has filed a pro se supplemental brief. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-20\">First, it did not violate the Sixth Amendment for the district court to engage in judicial fact-finding at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence within an advisory Guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Sandoval-Rodriguez, </em>452 F.3d 984, 990-91 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>- U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 600, 166 L.Ed.2d 445 (2006). Second, the district court properly understood and complied with this court\u2019s instructions to revisit the sophisticated-laundering enhancement by applying the correct legal standard. <em>See Pizano, </em>421 F.3d at 733-34. Third, Pizano has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable, i.e., that the district court failed to consider a relevant factor that should have received significant weight, gave significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or considered only the appropriate factors but committed a clear error of judgment in weighing those factors. <em>See United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1004 (8th Cir. 2005). Finally, after reviewing the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75,109 S.Ct. 346,102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we conclude that there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we deny Pizano\u2019s motion for the appointment of new counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-17\">.
