We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-22\">Carvajal-Osorio\u2019s contention regarding the continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), as well as his contention that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) based on non-jury fact-finding regarding his prior conviction are both foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Beng-Salazar, </em>452 F.3d 1088, 1091 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Weiland, </em>420 F.3d 1062, 1080 n. 16 (9th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Quintana-Quintana, </em>383 F.3d 1052,1053 (9th Cir.2004) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-23\">Carvajal-Osorio next contends that the district court impermissibly double counted his prior conviction in order to increase his sentence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-24\">We have previously determined that using a prior conviction as a basis for a sentencing enhancement and in calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history score is not impermissible double counting. <em>See United States v. Luna-Herrera, </em>149 F.3d 1054, 1055-56 (9th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Blanco-Gallegos, </em>188 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir.1999) (stating that it was not error for the district court to increase an offense level by 16 levels, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), based on a conviction for possession of a controlled substance for sale and also be given three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>criminal history points for that same conviction); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>136 F.3d 653, 654-55 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Finally, we determine that the 57-month sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Plouffe, </em>445 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2314, 164 L.Ed.2d 832 (2006); <em>see also United States v. Knows His Gun, </em>438 F.3d 913, 918 (9th Cir.2006) (stating that the district court is not required to address every section 3553 factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">In accordance with <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>222 F.3d 1057, 1062 (9th Cir. 2000), we remand the case to the district court with instructions that it delete from the judgment the incorrect reference to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See United States v. Herrera-Blanco, </em>232 F.3d 715, 719 (9th Cir.2000) (remanding sua sponte to delete the reference to \u00a7 1326(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
