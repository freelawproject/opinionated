Boyd, Jr. (\u201cBoyd\u201d) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of his constitutional rights by the Chief of Police of Stone Mountain, Georgia, Chancy H. Troutman; the Mayor of the City of Stone Mountain, Gary Peet; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>and the City of Stone Mountain (collectively \u201cthe defendants\u201d). Boyd\u2019s complaint alleged violations of his rights to due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment; malicious prosecution; and violations of his rights to free speech and free association under the First Amendment. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that Boyd abandoned his due process and malicious prosecution claims, and that Boyd\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim for relief on the remaining claims. Boyd appeals the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of judgment on the pleadings. <em>Hardy v. Regions Mortgage, Inc., </em>449 F.3d 1357, 1359 (11th Cir.2006). We take as true the facts alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Id. </em>The complaint\u2019s allegations must plausibly suggest that the defendant has a right to relief, raising that possibility above a \u201cspeculative level\u201d; if they do not, the plaintiffs complaint should be dismissed. <em>See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 1973 n. 14, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (retiring the often-criticized \u201cno set of facts\u201d language previously used to describe the motion to dismiss standard and determining that because plaintiffs had \u201cnot nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, their complaint must be dismissed\u201d for failure to state a claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">As an initial matter, the district court dismissed Boyd\u2019s due process and malicious prosecution claims because it held that Boyd abandoned those claims by failing to address them in his response brief to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. However, at the motion to dismiss stage, the scope of a court\u2019s review must be limited to the four corners of the complaint. <em>St. George v. Pinellas County, </em>285 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2002). Accordingly, in considering the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, the district court erred by going beyond the face of the complaint. Boyd did not abandon his due process and malicious prosecution claims by failing to adequately address them in his response brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">The appropriate inquiry at this stage of the litigation should have been whether the allegations of the complaint plausibly indicate that Boyd has a claim for relief. We find that he has not stated a claim for relief as to any cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">\n<em>A. Due Process Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">We have previously stated that \u201ca procedural due process violation is not complete unless and until the State fails to provide due process.\u201d <em>McKinney v. Patz, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1557 (11th Cir.1994) (internal quotations omitted). Accordingly, \u201conly when the state refuses to provide a process suffici\u00e9nt to remedy the procedural deprivation does a constitutional violation actionable under section 1983 arise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Boyd\u2019s complaint does not allege that the city has failed to provide an adequate remedy to the alleged violation of his rights. <em>See Tinney v. Shores, </em>77 F.3d 378, 382 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam). In fact, Boyd\u2019s complaint acknowledges that he had a hearing before the DeKalb Personnel Board, which he appealed to Superior Court of DeKalb County. Accordingly, we cannot say that Boyd\u2019s complaint states a plausible claim for a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">\n<em>B. Malicious Prosecution Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">\u201cTo establish a federal malicious prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must prove (1) the elements of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>mon law tort of malicious prosecution, and (2) a violation of [his] Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures.\u201d Kin<em>gsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1234 (11th Cir.2004). The elements of malicious prosecution under Georgia law are \u201c(1) [a] prosecution for a criminal offense; (2) instigated without probable cause; (3) with malice; (4) under a valid warrant, accusation or summons; (5) which has terminated favorably to the plaintiff; and (6) has caused damage to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Blackford, </em>264 Ga. 612, 449 S.E.2d 293, 294 (1994); <em>see also </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-7-40. Boyd\u2019s complaint fails to allege either the existence of any criminal proceedings, or a termination of such proceedings in his favor. Accordingly, he has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\n<em>C. Equal Protection Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u201c[T]o properly plead an equal protection claim, a plaintiff need only allege that through state action, similarly situated persons have been treated disparately.\u201d <em>Thigpen v. Bibb County, </em>223 F.3d 1231, 1237 (11th Cir.2000), abrogated on other grounds by <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002). Boyd\u2019s complaint does not allege any similarly situated person or group with whom we can compare him in determining whether he was treated disparately. The district court properly dismissed Boyd\u2019s equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\n<em>D. First Amendment Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The district court construed Boyd\u2019s complaint as alleging violations of his right to free speech and his right to free association under the First Amendment. The thrust of Boyd\u2019s argument seems to be that he was retaliated against for reporting police misconduct and unremedied criminal activity, and for associating with a city council member. To state a claim for retaliation for exercising their First Amendment rights a plaintiff must establish that: (1) the speech or act was constitutionally protected; (2) the defendant\u2019s retaliatory conduct adversely affected the protected speech; and (3) a causal connection existed between the retaliatory conduct and the adverse effect on speech. <em>Bennett v. Hendrix, </em>423 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). The same three-pronged analysis applies to the employment context: plaintiff must have suffered an adverse employment action on account of protected speech. <em>See Brochu v. City of Riviera Beach, </em>304 F.3d 1144, 1155 (11th Cir.2002) (analyzing a retaliation claim under Title VII); <em>Stavropoulos v. Firestone, </em>361 F.3d 610, 620 (11th Cir.2004) (concluding that a court may apply Title VII standards to First Amendment retaliation claims). Boyd\u2019s complaint does not establish a causal connection between any conduct of the defendants and any protected speech. Boyd does not allege that he was fired because he had been speaking out about police misconduct or inaction. Further, he does not allege any adverse action taken against him on account of his association with the city council member. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Boyd\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Because Boyd\u2019s complaint does not plausibly state a claim for relief as to any cause of action, the district court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
