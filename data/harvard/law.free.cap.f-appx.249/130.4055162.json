On appeal, he argues the following: (1) The traffic stop and frisk violated Jackson\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights; (2) Jackson\u2019s statements in the subsequent interrogation were made involuntarily; (3) the district court abused its discretion in the way it responded to a jury question; (4) the jury based Jackson\u2019s conviction on insufficient evidence; and (5) Jackson received ineffective assistance of counsel. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">While standing in the street one afternoon, Officer Brown witnessed Jackson, a convicted felon, drive by without wearing his seatbelt. Having spoken with him on prior occasions, Brown recognized Jackson and knew he was wanted for questioning in a murder investigation. Brown pulled Jackson\u2019s car over and called for backup. Officer Debnam arrived at the scene and the officers asked Jackson to step out of the car. Debnam then frisked Jackson and felt an elongated object, found to be a bag marijuana. The officers arrested Jackson, and performed a search of his car. Officer Brown recovered a fully-loaded revolver from underneath the driver\u2019s seat. Jackson moved to suppress the evidence obtained during this search, arguing that the officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The district court dismissed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-19\">Back at the station, after being read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Sergeant Izzo and Detective Hunt interviewed Jackson for nearly two hours that afternoon, questioning him about the gun and the ongoing murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>investigation. When asked about the incident earlier that afternoon, Jackson stated, \u201cthe reason I had that gun ... I had it for protection ... right to bear arms, you know.\u201d On the day before trial, Jackson moved to suppress these statements, claiming that they were obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. The district court dismissed the motion as untimely, as well as on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Jackson also claims that the district court improperly responded to a jury question. The parties stipulated to each element of the offense, except the scienter requirement. Accordingly, Jackson defended the merits solely on the ground that, as he was driving a former girlfriend\u2019s car and his fingerprints were not on the gun, he lacked knowledge as to the existence of the firearm. During its deliberations, the jury asked the judge a hypothetical question regarding the legal standard for \u201cknowledge.\u201d The judge responded: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, you\u2019ve got all of the evidence. You\u2019ve got the stipulations. We\u2019re not talking about theoretical stuff. You have a question to answer. Answer it.\u201d Jackson claims this response was an abuse of discretion and that he is therefore entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Jackson further asserts the defense of ineffective assistance by his current attorney. Jackson claims the district court\u2019s refusal to allow his counsel to withdraw was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">A. <em>The Stop and Frisk</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>180 F.3d 1237, 1240 (11th Cir.1999) (citing <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>894 F.2d 1245, 1254 (11th Cir.1990)). We accept the district court\u2019s factual findings as true unless the findings are shown to be clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201call facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below.\u201d <em>United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2000) (citing <em>United States v. Magluta, </em>44 F.3d 1530, 1536 (11th Cir. 1995)). On the other hand, the district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts is reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d by government officials, and its protections extend to \u201cbrief investigatory stops of persons or vehicles.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 9, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). A decision to stop a vehicle is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment where an officer has probable cause to believe that a traffic violation occurred. <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>172 F.3d 775, 778 (11th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">Jackson was not wearing a seat-belt, a traffic violation under Georgia law. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 40-8-76.1. Jackson argues that his failure to wear a seatbelt was a pretext for Officer Brown\u2019s allegedly illegitimate motive in stopping his car: to investigate Jackson\u2019s connection with a pending murder investigation. Pretext or not, this argument fails. As the Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Whren, </em>the constitutional reasonableness of a traffic stop does not depend on an officer\u2019s actual motivations. 517 U.S. at 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769; <em>Miller v. Harget, </em>458 F.3d 1251, 1260 (11th Cir. 2006), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2429, 167 L.Ed.2d 1130 (2007) (\u201cIt is well-settled that an officer\u2019s subjective motivations do not affect whether probable cause existed.\u201d (citing <em>Whren, </em>517 U.S. at 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769)).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Routine traffic stops are governed by the reasonable suspicion standard set forth in <em>Terry. </em>An individual may be frisked where the officer reasonably believes he poses a danger. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868; <em>United States v. Purcell, </em>236 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir. 2001) (in routine traffic stops, officers may take reasonable steps to protect their safety, including a protective search of the driver). The officers stated that Jackson was unduly sweating and glancing around nervously. Nervous behavior is a \u201cpertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>231 F.3d 750, 756 (11th Cir.2000). Furthermore, Officer Brown knew that Jackson was wanted for questioning regarding a violent crime. Under the circumstances, the officers were reasonably concerned for their safety, and a frisk of Jackson was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Upon finding the marijuana and arresting Jackson, the officers had full authority to search the vehicle. <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981) (when an officer has made a lawful arrest of a vehicle\u2019s occupant, he may contemporaneously search the vehicle). Because the arrest was lawful, Officer Brown\u2019s search of the passenger area and recovery of the firearm from underneath the driver\u2019s seat did not violate Jackson\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">B. <em>The Interrogation</em></p>\n<p id=\"ASs\">Jackson argues that the statements he made in his post-arrest interrogation were not given voluntarily. He claims that the statements should be suppressed because the officers obtained them through false representations about the benefits of participating in the interrogation. He also argues that the interrogation continued despite his attempts to end it and that he was sleep-deprived.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jackson filed a motion to suppress this interrogation the day before trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">The standards of review for a denial of a motion to suppress are set out above. The standard for evaluating the voluntariness of a confession is whether a person \u201c \u2018made an independent and informed choice of his own free will, possessing the capability to do so, his will not being overborne by the pressures and circumstances swirling around him.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCoy v. Newsome, </em>953 F.2d 1252, 1263 (11th Cir.1992) (per cu-riam) (quoting <em>Moore v. Dugger, </em>856 F.2d 129, 132 (11th Cir.1988)). Voluntariness is measured by the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>We look to such factors as whether the defendant was subjected to \u201can exhaustingly long interrogation,\u201d whether the interrogators applied physical force to the defendant or threatened to do so, and whether the interrogators made promises to induce the defendant\u2019s statements. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1295-96 (11th Cir.2005), cert <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 748, 166 L.Ed.2d 579 (2006) (citing <em>United States v. Mendoza-Cecelia, </em>963 F.2d 1467, 1475 (11th Cir.1992)). On the other hand, the Supreme Court has stated that depriving a suspect of sleep during an interrogation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>a significant factor in finding a confession involuntary. <em>Ashcraft v. Tennessee, </em>322 U.S. 143, 153-54, 64 S.Ct. 921, 88 L.Ed. 1192 (1944) (finding a compelled confession where suspect was held and questioned for 36 hours without sleep).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Jackson\u2019s statements concerning the firearm were made voluntarily. First, the interrogation was not \u201cexhaustingly long,\u201d nor was Jackson subject to sleep-deprivation: he was interviewed for less than two hours. Second, Jackson provides no evidence that the police used physical force or tricks during the interrogation. Third, during the interview, the police specifically told Jackson that they could not make him any promises. As nothing in the record supports the contention that Jackson\u2019s statements were made involuntarily, the district court did not err in denying Jackson\u2019s motion to suppress on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">C. <em>The Judge\u2019s Response to the Jury Question</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Jackson argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to address the jury\u2019s hypothetical question about the legal standard for \u201cknowledge.\u201d Jackson claims that the district court discredited his sole defense \u2014 lack of intent\u2014 by stating to the jury, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about theoretical stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">We review a court\u2019s response to a jury question for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>935 F.2d 1212, 1222 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in its response to the jury\u2019s question. The jury had copies of adequate, legally accurate instructions regarding the elements of the offense. The district court simply refused to answer a hypothetical question and instead pointed the jury to the evidence and stipulations. In light of its original detailed instructions that accurately presented the substantive law, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to directly answer a jury\u2019s hypothetical question.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">D. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>United States v. Futrell, </em>209 F.3d 1286, 1288 (11th Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (citing <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir. 1999)). The evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the government, and we draw all \u201creasonable inferences and credibility determinations in favor of the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1299 (11th Cir.2000) (citing <em>United States v. Toler, </em>144 F.3d 1423, 1428 (11th Cir.1998)). A guilty verdict must stand \u201cunless no trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>53 F.3d 1198, 1202 (11th Cir.1995) (citing <em>United States v. Battle, </em>892 F.2d 992, 998 (11th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">To establish possession of a firearm by a felon under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must prove that \u201c \u2018the defendant was (1) in knowing possession of a firearm, (2) a convicted felon, and (3) that the firearm affected interstate commerce.\u2019 \u201d <em>U.S. v. Glover, </em>431 F.3d 744, 748 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (quoting <em>United States v. Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398, 402 n. 4 (11th Cir.1996)). Jackson concedes the second and third elements and argues that there is insufficient evidence to prove that he knowingly possessed the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">From the evidence, a reasonable juror could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Jackson knowingly possessed the firearm. Officer Brown found the gun underneath the driver\u2019s seat of a car that Jackson was driving. Furthei'more, Jackson implicitly admitted possessing the firearm by stating: \u201cthe reason I had that gun ... I had it for protection ... right to bear arms, you know.\u201d Viewing these facts in a light most favorable to the government, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the evidence is sufficient to support Jackson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">E. <em>Ineffective Assistance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Jackson, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>argues on appeal that his current counsel was ineffective. Because claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are best presented in a collateral attack via a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion rather than on direct appeal, we decline to consider these claims. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 508, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">For the above reasons, the district court properly dismissed Jackson\u2019s motions to suppress the evidence gathered during his stop and frisk, and his statements made during interrogation; the district court did not abuse its discretion in its response to a jury question; and sufficient evidence supported Jackson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">. Jackson acknowledges that after being read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, an individual must unambiguously request counsel to invoke Fifth Amendment protections. The district court only allowed into evidence the portion of his interview occurring before Jackson unequivocally invoked his right to counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-13\">. The district court alternatively dismissed this motion as untimely. However, Jackson did not receive a copy of the videotaped interrogation until after the deadline to file pretrial motions. Therefore, as we find the dismissal was proper on the merits, we will not address these alternative grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
