We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Pineda Alcazar did not establish past persecution because the harm he suffered did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995). Pineda Alcazar\u2019s claim of a well-founded fear of future persecution fails because it is based on civil strife and widespread random violence, and any harm to his father is unrelated to his claim. <em>See Rostomian v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 1088, 1089 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also Arriaga-Barrientos v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 411, 414 (9th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we deny Pineda Alcazar\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">Because Pineda Alcazar failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 673 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">Pineda Alcazar\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s adoption and affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision is a violation of due process also fails. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). The BIA expressly stated that it relied on the IJ\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned decision as to Pineda Alcazar\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims as required. <em>See Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
