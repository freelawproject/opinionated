We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 asylum claim. The record does not compel the conclusion that any harm Kahachatryan suffered was on account of a political opinion, rather than as a result of the criminal actions of a few maverick government officials. <em>See Grava v. INS, </em>205 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that the \u201csalient question\u201d is whether the petitioner\u2019s opposition to corruption was \u201cdirected toward a governing institution, or only against individuals whose corruption was aberrational\u201d). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 asylum claim is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Because petitioners failed to establish eligibility for asylum, they necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 673 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Petitioners failed to establish a CAT claim because they did not show that it was more likely than not that they would be tortured if they returned to Armenia. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283-84 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b584-26\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
