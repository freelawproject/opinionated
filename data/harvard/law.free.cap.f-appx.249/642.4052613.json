Berkeley, </em>433 F.3d 1253, 1256 (9th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>moving party, \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and \u201cthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see also Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>363 F.3d 916, 921-22 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The Fourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures of \u201ctheir persons, houses, papers, and effects.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. \u201cA \u2018seizure\u2019 of property ... occurs when \u2018there is some meaningful interference with an individual\u2019s possessory interests in that property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Soldal v. Cook County, </em>506 U.S. 56, 61, 113 S.Ct. 538, 121 L.Ed.2d 450 (1992) (quoting <em>United States v. Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The district court recited this test but failed to apply it. The district court ruled that Plaintiffs were not dispossessed of any property, but failed to address the mixed factual and legal issue whether Plaintiffs even had a possessory interest in the business premises. Moreover, the parties disagreed whether the police officers ordered Plaintiffs to leave the premises. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, a reasonable finder of fact could determine that the police officers\u2019 order to the Plaintiffs to vacate the premises constituted meaningful interference with a possessory interest. <em>See Sol-dal, </em>506 U.S. at 61-69, 113 S.Ct. 538. Therefore, the district court erred in ruling there were no disputed issues of material fact as to whether the police officers seized Plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The district court noted that it had found no precedent holding that the specific police action at issue here constituted a seizure of property within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. However, the lack of precedent does not relieve a court of its responsibility to apply Constitutional principles to the legal and factual dispute before it. At \u201cthis point neither the district court nor the parties have devoted sufficient attention to the elucidation and resolution of these issues to permit us to deem a grant of summary judgment appropriate.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Plumbers and Steamfitters Local Union No. 38 v. C.W. Roen Constr. Co., </em>183 F.3d 1088, 1095 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Under <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), the district court must address the question whether the officers\u2019 conduct violated Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights before considering whether any such constitutional rights were clearly established. This includes determining not only whether a seizure occurred but whether the seizure was unreasonable. <em>See Soldal, </em>506 U.S. at 61-62, 113 S.Ct. 538. Therefore, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
