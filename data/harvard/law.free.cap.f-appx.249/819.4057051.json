Lloyd appeals from a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, No. DE-0842-05-0042-I-4, sustaining the denial by the Department of the Interior of his request for special retirement benefits as a law enforcement officer or firefighter in connection with his employment by the National Park Service between October 11, 1998, and July 14, 2001. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Mr. Lloyd claims that under the Federal Employees Retirement System (\u201cFERS\u201d) he is entitled to special retirement benefits based on his service in two positions he held while he was employed at Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado. The first position was that of Office Automation Clerk, GS-0025-05, and the second was that of Park Ranger (General), GS-0025-05/07. The position descriptions for those positions have not been officially approved for primary law enforcement officer or firefighter retirement credit. Accordingly, the issue in this case is whether the duties Mr. Lloyd actually performed while employed in those positions satisfy the statutory definitions of law enforcement officer or firefighter. <em>See Watson v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>262 F.3d 1292, 1295-96 (Fed.Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">To qualify as a law enforcement officer for purposes of the statutory enhanced retirement benefits, the employee\u2019s \u201cprimary duties\u201d must involve the \u201cinvestigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States\u201d or \u201cthe protection of officials of the United States against threats to personal safety.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8401(17). By regulation, an employee is not considered a \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d within the meaning of the statute if the employee\u2019s primary duties are confined to \u201cmaintaining order, protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than those who are suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>262 F.3d at 1298 (citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 842.802). To qualify as a firefighter, the employee\u2019s duties must be \u201cprimarily to perform work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8401(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">For purposes of those definitions, \u201cprimary duties\u201d are those duties that (1) \u201care paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position; [ (2) ] [o]ccupy a substantial portion of the individual\u2019s working time over a typical work cycle; and [ (3) ] [a]re assigned on a regular and recurring basis.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>262 F.3d at 1298 (citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 842.802). \u201cDuties that are of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature cannot be considered \u2018primary\u2019 even if they meet the substantial portion of time criterion.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 842.802. In general, if an employee spends at least 50 percent of his time performing certain duties, those duties are his primary duties. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">After the Department of the Interior denied Mr. Lloyd\u2019s request to be given special retirement credit, he sought review of that decision by the Merit Systems Protection Board. The administrative judge who was assigned to the case determined that Mr. Lloyd\u2019s primary duties during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>relevant time period consisted of maintaining law and order and protecting life and property; his primary duties did not involve investigating, apprehending, or detaining criminals. Accordingly, the administrative judge concluded that Mr. Lloyd\u2019s position fit within the category of jobs explicitly excluded from enhanced retirement benefits by 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 842.802. In addition, the administrative judge found that Mr. Lloyd\u2019s primary duties did not involve the control or extinguishment of fires. The administrative judge therefore affirmed the Department of the Interior\u2019s denial of Mr. Lloyd\u2019s request for special retirement benefits, either as a law enforcement officer or as a firefighter. When Mr. Lloyd did not seek review of the administrative judge\u2019s decision by the full Board, that decision became the final decision of the Board. Mr. Lloyd then petitioned for review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">1. Mr. Lloyd first challenges the Board\u2019s characterization of his primary duties. The determination that his primary duties for the pertinent time period involved maintaining law and order and protecting life and property, and not investigating, apprehending, and detaining criminals, is a question of fact reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Watson, </em>262 F.3d at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The parties agree that Mr. Lloyd performed the same duties throughout the time period at issue, regardless of the title and official description of his position. Substantial evidence supports the administrative judge\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Lloyd\u2019s primary duties during that time were maintaining law and order and protecting life and property. The administrative judge reviewed testimony by Mr. Lloyd and his witnesses, his performance plans, his case incident reports, and his personal logs for his case incidents. All that evidence indicates that the large majority of Mr. Lloyd\u2019s work involved activities such as visitor assistance with motor vehicle problems, issuing citations for speeding and traffic violations, responding to alarms, providing medical assistance, monitoring camping activities, and providing security to the park grounds, facilities, and cultural resources. Based on that evidence, the administrative judge reasonably concluded that Mr. Lloyd\u2019s primary duties did not involve investigating, apprehending, and detaining criminals, but instead involved maintaining law and order and protecting life and property. As such, Mr. Lloyd did not meet the statutory definition of a law enforcement officer during the time period at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Contrary to Mr. Lloyd\u2019s contention, the administrative judge did not ignore evidence in reaching that conclusion. She noted that Mr. Lloyd carried a weapon, was occasionally the first responder to a more serious crime, and had, at certain times, performed particular law enforcement functions. However, the administrative judge found those responsibilities to be \u201cincidental to his primary responsibility of [inspection and] protection of the park property, its wildlife, and its visitors.\u201d The record supports that conclusion. Since duties of an incidental or temporary nature are not primary, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.902, the facts to which Mr. Lloyd points do not alter the nature of his primary duties. Because Mr. Lloyd spent most of his time during the period at issue maintaining law and order and protecting life and property, he falls within the category of employees who are excluded by regulation from eligibility for enhanced law enforcement officer benefits. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 842.802.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Mr. Lloyd notes that he was granted law enforcement officer credit for the position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>he held immediately prior to the positions that are at issue in this case. He argues that he continued to perform the same duties throughout and that the positions at issue in this case must therefore also merit law enforcement officer credit. Mr. Lloyd, however, was granted coverage for his time in his prior position based on the official description of that position, not the duties he performed during that period. For that reason, he may have been accorded law enforcement credit even though his actual duties during that time did not constitute law enforcement duties as defined by the pertinent statute and regulations. Based on the evidence as to Mr. Lloyd\u2019s actual duties in the two contested positions during the period at issue, the administrative judge\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">2. Mr. Lloyd argues that the administrative judge improperly focused on the position descriptions for the two positions he held during the time period at issue. He argues that she thereby deprived him of the opportunity to show that his actual duties qualified him for the claimed benefits, as is permissible under <em>Watson, </em>262 F.3d at 1296. The administrative judge\u2019s opinion, however, does not support that contention. As noted above, the administrative judge based her decision on the evidence of Mr. Lloyd\u2019s actual duties during the period at issue. Although she quoted portions of one position description in an introduction to a discussion of that position and elsewhere made some references to the duties Mr. Lloyd carried out in a prior position, she did not rely on the official position description of any position for her final conclusions. We therefore reject Mr. Lloyd\u2019s argument that the administrative judge improperly relied on official position descriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">3. Last, Mr. Lloyd argues that the administrative judge misapprehended the law regarding how firefighting service credit can be combined with law enforcement officer service credit. The administrative judge found, and Mr. Lloyd now admits, that his firefighting duties were incidental to his other duties. On appeal, Mr. Lloyd argues that the time he spent fighting fires, combined with the time he spent in covered law enforcement activities, is sufficient to demonstrate that the majority of his duties constituted activities meant to be accorded enhanced retirement credit. He contends that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8412(d)(2) requires that he be accorded special retirement benefits under those circumstances. Section 8412(d)(2) provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">An employee who is separated from the service ... after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service as a law enforcement officer, member of the Capitol Police or Supreme Court Police, firefighter, or nuclear materials courier, or any combination of such service totaling at least 20 years, is entitled to an annuity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Mr. Lloyd argues that the phrase \u201cor any combination of such service totaling at least 20 years\u201d allows him to aggregate any firefighting duties and any law enforcement duties he was responsible for while in a single position. The statutory language, however, does not support Mr. Lloyd\u2019s construction. Section 8412(d)(2) requires 20 years of \u201cservice as\u201d an employee in one of the specified categories or a combination of \u201csuch service\u201d totaling 20 years. The phrase \u201csuch service\u201d refers to \u201cservice as a law enforcement officer,\u201d firefighter, or other listed employee. Accordingly, the phrase at issue is meant to allow an employee to combine time spent in multiple positions, each of which qualifies under one of the enumerated categories. It is not intended to enable an employee to create a new, unlisted category made up of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>some combination of the duties of positions falling within the enumerated categories. Because the premise of Mr. Lloyd\u2019s argument is incorrect, his argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Even if 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8412(d)(2) allowed Mr. Lloyd to aggregate duties as he wishes, Mr. Lloyd\u2019s supervisor testified that firefighting was not a requirement of Mr. Lloyd\u2019s job. He further testified that he expected Mr. Lloyd to fight fires only because Mr. Lloyd had shown an interest in doing so. As such, it does not appear that Mr. Lloyd actually had any official duty to fight fires; he therefore would not have any service to combine with his law enforcement duties even if combining law enforcement and firefighting duties were allowed under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Because substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that Mr. Lloyd\u2019s primary duties did not involve activities for which he is entitled to enhanced retirement benefits, and because the Board did not misconstrue or misapply the governing statutory and regulatory provisions, we uphold the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
