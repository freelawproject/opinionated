Lamb denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yun Yan Lin, </em>No. A98 354 606 (B.I.A. Mar. 22, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A98 354 606 (Im-mig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 23, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-14\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds, emphasizes particular aspects of the decision, we \u201creview both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions \u2014 or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-15\">Here, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Both the BIA and IJ correctly noted that, while Lin testified that her father was beaten more than once by authorities who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>came looking for her, the beatings were not mentioned either in Lin\u2019s asylum application or her father\u2019s letter of support. This discrepancy between Lin\u2019s testimony and the record evidence was material to her asylum claim. If credited, evidence regarding the alleged beatings would have helped establish that the Chinese government was actively searching for Lin due to her association with the underground church and that her fear of persecution was subjectively and objectively reasonable. See <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Lin explained that her father did not mention the beatings in his letter because he did not want Lin to know about them. She testified that she did not mention the beatings in her asylum application, which specifically asks whether family or close friends have experienced harm, because she \u201cneglected\u201d to do so. Although these are plausible explanations for the omissions, a reasonable fact-finder could have declined to accept them. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir. 2003). Accordingly, the agency did not err in finding that this discrepancy undermined Lin\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The BIA and IJ also pointed to the fact that Lin never testified to her alleged \u201cblacklisting,\u201d despite including it in her asylum application, or mentioned that police had distributed her photograph in an attempt to track her down, as a friend claimed in a letter of support. These discrepancies were each material to Lin\u2019s asylum claim, and the IJ properly relied on them in making her adverse credibility finding. <em>See Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-07 (2d Cir.2006) (IJ may rely upon the cumulative impact of discrepancies and omissions in rendering a credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Finally, the IJ pointed to two instances in which Lin failed to present adequate corroborating evidence, which reasonably was available to her, in support of her testimony. First, Lin failed to provide any corroboration of her attendance at a Catholic church in New York City. Second, she provided no documentary evidence that her friend in China ever was sentenced to prison. Lin\u2019s failure adequately to corroborate her testimony bore on her credibility because the absence of corroboration rendered her unable to rehabilitate testimony that already had been called into question. See <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">In sum, substantial evidence in the record, considered in the aggregate, supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding and the resulting determination that Lin failed to establish her eligibility for asylum. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cAlthough the BIA did not parse the two means of establishing refugee status, its adverse credibility determination necessarily precluded finding that [the applicant] had demonstrated that he had suffered persecution in the past, and that [he] subjectively feared that he would be harmed in the future.\u201d). The agency\u2019s evaluation was not flawless, but remand is not required in this case where it can be confidently predicted that the agency would adhere to the same decision upon remand, after correcting for any flaws. <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">In addition, because Lin\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief were premised on the same factual basis as her asylum claim, the adverse credibility determination necessarily precludes success on those claims as well. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>pleted our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
