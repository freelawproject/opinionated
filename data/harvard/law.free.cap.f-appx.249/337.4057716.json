Anderson appeals the 188-month sentence imposed by the district court following his guilty plea to being a felon in possession of firearms. The district court sentenced Anderson as an armed career offender pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 based on Anderson\u2019s previous Wisconsin burglary convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-16\">Anderson argues that the district court erred in subjecting him to an enhanced sentence as an armed career offender based on the recitation of the facts of his Wisconsin burglary convictions set forth in the Presentence Report and the documents of record pertaining to the convictions, which include the Wisconsin criminal complaints. The Government argues that the enhancement should be upheld because, as to three of Anderson\u2019s burglary convictions, the judgment of conviction establishes that Anderson pleaded guilty to an offense identical to \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d as defined by <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-17\">A district court\u2019s decision whether a defendant\u2019s three previous convictions were for violent felonies as defined by \u00a7 924(e) must be made in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted. <em>See United States v. </em>Vid-<em>aure, </em>861 F.2d 1337, 1340 (5th Cir.1988). The record contains judgments of conviction that show that Anderson was convicted on three separate occasions of violating Wis. Stat. \u00a7 943.10(lm)(a), which criminalizes the entry of \u201cany building or dwelling\u201d where entry is made \u201cwithout the consent of the person in lawful possession and with intent to steal or commit a felony in such place.\u201d Because the Wisconsin statute under which Anderson was thrice convicted conforms to <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>definition of generic burglary, the district court did not err in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>sentencing Anderson as an armed career offender pursuant to \u00a7 924(e) and \u00a7 4B1.4. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Cortez, </em>988 F.2d 1408, 1411-12 &amp; n. 20 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">To the extent that Anderson contends that the district court violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and the Constitution by making the determination that his prior offenses were violent felonies, his argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. White, </em>465 F.3d 250, 251 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>437 F.3d 450, 451 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006). Anderson\u2019s contention that the district court was required to find the facts underlying the sentencing enhancement beyond a reasonable doubt is also unavailing. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 798 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2884, 165 L.Ed.2d 908 (2006). Anderson has not shown that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence as an armed career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Anderson also contends that the district court erred in determining that an enhancement was warranted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(B)(5). We need not address the merits of this argument because the district court\u2019s determination regarding the \u00a7 2K2.1(B)(5) enhancement did not affect Anderson\u2019s total offense level, which was determined through application of the armed career offender guideline. <em>See United States v. El-Zoubi, </em>993 F.2d 442, 451 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
