Nelson, which denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jian Quan Chen, </em>No. A73 595 700 (B.I.A. Nov. 9, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A73 595 700 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 15, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-21\">As an initial matter, contrary to the government\u2019s argument, we have jurisdiction to review Chen\u2019s claims. Where, as here, the BIA considers a claim despite the applicant\u2019s failure to raise it, the claim is considered exhausted and may be reviewed by this Court. <em>See Xian Tuan Ye v. DHS, </em>446 F.3d 289, 296-97 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-22\">Where the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review both decisions. <em>Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Here, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. Chen\u2019s omission of a significant fact \u2014 his wife\u2019s alleged forced abortion\u2014 from his asylum application and asylum interview provided a sufficient basis upon which the agency could conclude that he was not credible. <em>See Cheng Tong Wang v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 451, 453-54 (2d Cir. 2006) (upholding agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination where applicant failed to mention his wife\u2019s forced sterilization despite the fact that his claim for asylum was based on his failure to comply with China\u2019s family planning policy). Although the agency could have accepted Chen\u2019s explanation for this omission, the agency was not compelled to make that finding, particularly given the fact that Chen specifically asserted in his application and interview that he did not have problems with family planning authorities until five years after the forced abortion allegedly occurred. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, the IJ reasonably decided to give little weight to the abortion certificate submitted into evidence because the record indicates that it was not authenticated. <em>See Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 263 (2d Cir. 2007) .</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Because Chen failed to establish a credible well-founded fear of future persecution and because the only evidence of a threat to his life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination as to Chen\u2019s asylum claim necessarily precludes any success on his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); <em>Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006). Further, because Chen failed to challenge the agency\u2019s denial of his relief under the CAT, any such argument is waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
