We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-22\">Plaintiffs Patricia Fattman and her husband Lewis Fattman brought suit to recover damages sustained in a motor vehicle accident with a vehicle driven by Defendant John Bear. A jury returned a verdict for Plaintiffs and awarded $25,000 to Patricia Fattman but none for Lewis Fattman. Plaintiffs filed a motion for new trial on the following grounds: inadequacy of the damage award, verdict against the weight of the evidence, compromise verdict, and refusal by the trial court to permit testimony by Patricia Fattman regarding accommodations enabling her to continue her employment. The District Court denied the motion and Plaintiffs appealed, challenging only the \u201cexcluded\u201d testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-23\">The appeal involves Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s direct examination of Patricia Fattman.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Counsel attempted to elicit testimony on accommodations provided to Mrs. Fattman by her employer, but the District Court sustained objections as leading and/or assuming facts not in evidence. Without eliciting the sought for testimony, counsel moved on to a different topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>Pryer v. C.O. 3 Slavic, 251 </em>F.3d 448, 453 (3d Cir.2001). We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, <em>Moyer v. United Dominion Industries, Inc., </em>473 F. 3d 532, 542 (3d Cir.2007), but even an erroneous ruling necessitates a new trial only if the ruling affects \u201ca substantial right of the party.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 103(a). Harmless error occurs when \u201cit is highly probable that the error did not affect the result.\u201d <em>Hill v. Reederei F. Laeisz G.M.B.H., Rostock, </em>435 F.3d 404, 420 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Here the District Court ruled the questions asked on direct examination were leading and assumed facts not in evidence. \u201cLeading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 611(c). As the Advisory Committee Notes state, \u201c[a]n almost total unwillingness to reverse for infractions [regarding leading questions] has been manifested by appellate courts\u201d because \u201c[t]he matter clearly falls within the area of control by the judge over the mode and order of interrogation and presentation....\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 611 advisory committee notes; <em>see also </em>1 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 6 (6th ed.2006) (\u201cThe allow-ability of leading questions is discretionary, and the judge\u2019s action will not be reversed unless it contributed to an unfair trial.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-16\">A leading question \u201csuggests the answer to the person being interrogated.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>906 (8th ed.2004). Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked, \u201cMrs. Fattman, what accommodations, if any, were made to your job, because of your condition?\u201d But prior to this line of questioning, there was no evidence of accommodations on the record. Therefore, the trial judge could, in his discretion, find such questions suggested the answer Mr. McDonald sought, that Patricia Fattman\u2019s employer provided accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-17\">The trial judge did not foreclose questioning on the matter. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel continued to ask a similar form of question after the first objection was sustained. The trial judge told counsel, \u201cI know what to ask her,\u201d and \u201cYou might ask her what she did.\u201d These statements welcomed further attempts to ask non-leading questions, but counsel chose to move on to a different topic. Patricia Fattman did testify about the medication she took following the accident, the effect it had on her ability to concentrate and the amount of work she missed following the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>The trial judge did not commit error in sustaining objections to Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s questions. Because the trial judge committed no error, we need not address whether an erroneous trial court ruling has affected Plaintiffs\u2019 substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-11\">. The following exchange between Plaintiffs' counsel, Patricia Fattman, Mr. Lewbart\u2014 counsel for Defendants \u2014 and the Court provides the relevant testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">Mr. McDonald: Were any accommodations recommended for you to have you do your job, because of the injuries and the pain that you had?</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">[Mrs. Fattman]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">Mr. Lewbart: Objection The Court: What\u2019s the basis of the objection? Mr. Lewbart: It assumes facts not in evidence, your Honor and there\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s no evidence that \u2014 we\u2019ve been provided with to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">The Court: Also, leading the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">Mr. Lewbart: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">The Court: The objection is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-18\">Mr. McDonald: Mrs. Fattman, what accommodations, if any, were made to your job, because of your condition?</p>\n<p id=\"b983-19\">Mr. Lewbart: Same objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-24\">The Court: Objection sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"akl-dedup-0\">(Pause.)</p>\n<p id=\"AGM\">The Court: Keep trying, Mr. McDonald.</p>\n<p id=\"a9f-dedup-0\">Mr. McDonald: Well, your Honor, I'm trying to \u2014 I\u2019m trying to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AGuO\">The Court: I understand.</p>\n<p id=\"AkU\">Mr. McDonald: Job accommodations \u2014 I'm not leading her in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"ATo\">The Court: Yes, you are.</p>\n<p id=\"amk-dedup-1\">Mr. McDonald: She's not going to be able to testify as to what accommodations they tried to make to her job?</p>\n<p id=\"ahu-dedup-0\">The Court: Just ask the questions and we'll go on.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqqs\">Mr. McDonald: All right. Mrs. Fattman, without burdening the Court in any attempt to ask you a proper question, what accommodations, if any, were made to your job, because of your condition?</p>\n<p id=\"A4c\">Mr. Lewbart: Same objection, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"a0h-dedup-0\">Mr. McDonald: Any my \u2014 my response is that it's not \u2014 it's not leading, it\u2019s an accommo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>dation that she experienced with respect to her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">The Court: Objection sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">Mr. McDonald: Your Honor, just for the record, can I have the basis of \u2014 of the Court\u2019s-ruling in that regard?</p>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">The Court: Well, don\u2019t show any anger at the rulings, Mr. McDonald.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">Mr. McDonald: Oh, no, no, your Honor. I just wanted to know, so I don\u2019t ask the question wrong again.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-14\">The Court: I can\u2019t try it for you.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-18\">Mr. McDonald: All right, I \u2014 but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AYBg\">The Court: I know what to ask her.</p>\n<p id=\"A5ut\">Mr. McDonald: All right, I \u2014 I just wanted to know what the \u2014 what the object \u2014 what the basis of the ruling is, so I don\u2019t question her and continue to do this improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"AD4\">The Court: The same as we expressed before. Objection \u2014 and the reason is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"azq-dedup-0\">Mr. McDonald: All right. Let's move on\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"A9S\">The Court: You might ask her what she did.</p>\n<p id=\"Abc\">Mr. McDonald: Okay, all right. Mrs. Fatt-man, let's \u2014 let\u2019s move to a different topic.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
