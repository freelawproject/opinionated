We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility finding and will uphold the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-15\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of asylum based on an adverse credibility finding. Petitioners\u2019 testimony and asylum application were inconsistent with an organization\u2019s mission statement as to whether the organization was run by the state or private entities and whether the organization had a religious affiliation. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cAn adverse credibility ruling will be upheld so long as identified discrepancies go to the heart of [the] asylum claim.\u201d). Petitioners also failed to testify about threats made to family members and the beating of a family member subsequent to their departure from Armenia, despite relying on these events to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution in their asylum application. <em>See id. </em>at 962-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-16\">Because petitioners failed to establish eligibility for asylum, they necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-17\">Petitioners failed to show that the IJ\u2019s refusal to grant their motion for a continuance prejudiced their case, such that the outcome of the proceedings would have been affected. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b597-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
