We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny in part and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-23\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that petitioner failed to demonstrate past persecution. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 970-71 (9th Cir.1998). Substantial evidence further supports the IJ\u2019s finding that petitioner failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, because she failed to demonstrate the requisite individualized risk of persecution. <em>Cf Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, petitioner\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-24\">Because petitioner cannot meet her burden to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, she necessarily fails to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>moval. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 673 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">We decline to consider the IJ\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s CAT claim because petitioner did not raise the issue in her opening brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256,1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the BIA to reinstate the 60-day voluntary departure period.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Petitioner\u2019s motion to stay voluntary departure is granted because, pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir. 2004), petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. This stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b696-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
