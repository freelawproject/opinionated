We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the procedural history, facts, and relevant issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-18\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) we may review sentences allegedly \u201cimposed in violation of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006). We examine <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines, and we evaluate its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir.2006). \u201cWe review both Guidelines and non-Guidelines sentences for reasonableness,\u201d <em>United States v. Pereira, </em>465 F.3d 515, 519 (2d Cir.2006), without applying \u201cany <em>per se </em>rules as to the reasonableness of every sentence within an applicable guideline or the unreasonableness of every sentence outside an applicable guideline,\u201d <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>(2d Cir.2005). We characterize reasonableness review as \u201cakin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. While a sentence may be unreasonable if the sentencing court has failed to comply with procedural requirements when imposing the sentence, <em>United States v. Giovanelli, </em>464 F.3d 346, 355 (2d Cir. 2006), no such error occurred here. The sentencing judge took notice of the presentence report and the recommended Guidelines, considered defense counsel\u2019s arguments in favor of a non-custodial sentence, and concluded that, \u201cunder all the circumstances,\u201d including a weighing of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, a sentence at the low end of the recommended Guidelines range (ten months), with a special accommodation so that Santiago would be imprisoned for only five months, was appropriate. This process fully comports with \u201cthe thorough adversarial testing contemplated by federal sentencing procedure.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We have reviewed all of Santiago\u2019s arguments, and we find them without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
