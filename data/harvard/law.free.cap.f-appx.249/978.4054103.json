The district court sentenced New-comb to 180 months\u2019 incarceration, five years supervised release, and assessed a $100 fine. On appeal, Newcomb\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising for review the issue of whether the district court erred by not sentencing Newcomb to less than 180 months\u2019 incarceration. New-comb was advised of the right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-26\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. However, <em>Booker </em>\u201cdid nothing to alter the rule that judges cannot depart below a statutorily provided minimum sentence\u201d except upon the Government\u2019s motion on the basis of substantial assistance. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>862 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>546 U.S. 916, 126 S.Ct. 288, 163 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). For a defendant, like Newcomb, who is found guilty of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(e), the minimum term of incarceration required to be imposed is 180 months. The district court sentenced Newcomb to the mandatory minimum penalty. The district court did not have the legal authority to impose any less time, and thus did not err by declining to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Newcomb\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Newcomb, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Newcomb requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Newcomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
