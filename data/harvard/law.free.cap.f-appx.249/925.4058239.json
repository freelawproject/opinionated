D\u2019Angelo denying Petitioners\u2019 application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Petrit Vrenozi, Arta Vrenozi, Andi Vrenozi &amp; Sindi Vrenozi </em>Nos. A95 449 872/873/874/875 (B.I.A. July 12, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>Nos. A95 449 872/873/874/875 (Immig. Ct. Hartford Sept. 16, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-20\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. Twu<em>m, v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201ccon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>elusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed, <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005), unless we can confidently predict that, in spite of deficiencies in the adverse credibility determination, it would be futile to remand because the IJ would adhere to its original decision, <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 836-40 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Here the IJ denied Petitioners\u2019 claims after finding Petrit Vrenozi (\u201cVrenozi\u201d) not credible, based on implausible statements, internal inconsistencies in his testimony, and general demeanor. Ordinarily we will not disturb adverse credibility determinations that are based on \u201cspecific examples in the record of inconsistent statements ... about matters material to [an applicant\u2019s] claim of persecution, or on contradictory evidence or inherently improbable testimony regarding such matters.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). An IJ\u2019s assessment of demeanor is also entitled to particular deference. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). However an adverse credibility determination must not be based on flawed reasoning or bald speculation. <em>Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168-69 (2d Cir.2007). And \u201cit is also error for an IJ to find an applicant\u2019s testimony inconsistent without first raising the putative discrepancies during asylum proceedings so that the petitioner has a chance to provide what may be satisfactory explanations for the supposed problem.\u201d <em>Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, </em>439 F.3d 111, 122 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 152 (2d Cir.2003) (suggesting that where an applicant gives \u201cspare\u201d testimony and the fact-finder wonders whether the testimony is fabricated, the fact-finder may \u201cprobe for incidental details, seeking to draw out inconsistencies that would support a finding of lack of credibility\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">In this case, the IJ made seven specific findings in support of his adverse credibility determination, apart from his observations about Vrenozi\u2019s demeanor. Two findings were erroneous because they simply misconstrued the record. First, Vrenozi\u2019s testimony regarding Democratic Party membership cards did not, as the IJ stated, contradict the testimony of Petitioners\u2019 expert witness. Second, contrary to the IJ\u2019s finding, there was evidence in the record that Vrenozi was, in fact, threatened at his business. (According to the IJ, the absence of such evidence undercut Vrenozi\u2019s claim that persecution awaited him on his return to Albania). A third finding \u2014 that Vrenozi was evasive and vague as to a particular set of threats by the Albanian Secret Service \u2014 was improper because upon probing, Vrenozi did elaborate on and clarify his earlier testimony. A fourth finding \u2014 that given the Vrenozis\u2019 wealth it was implausible that they would not relocate after receiving threats \u2014 was purely speculative. The three other findings were based on seemingly implausible or inconsistent statements by Vrenozi, none of which the IJ asked Vrenozi to explain or clarify. We do not, of course, \u201chypothesize excuses for the inconsistencies\u201d that the IJ found; our review is simply \u201cmeant to ensure that credibility findings are based upon neither a misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice.\u201d <em>Zhou </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number><em>Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The IJ did properly note some inconsistencies and implausibilities in Vrenozi\u2019s testimony, but in light of the IJ\u2019s numerous erroneous findings, we cannot confidently predict that, based only on the IJ\u2019s error-free findings, the agency would reach the same conclusion about adverse credibility on remand. <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 401 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, we remand consideration of Petitioners\u2019 asylum claim to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Petitioners have not, however, meaningfully challenged the agency\u2019s denial of their withholding of removal and GAT claims in their brief to this Court. Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). As to these claims, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY in part and GRANT in part the petition for review, AFFIRM in part and VACATE in part the BIA\u2019s decision, and REMAND the case to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this order. Any pending motion for stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
