Parks appeals, arguing the district court erred in (1) applying the preponderance of the evidence standard, rather than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, to determine whether Parks\u2019s prior convictions qualify as crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses, and (2) concluding Parks\u2019s escape conviction qualifies as a crime of violence. We disagree. \u201cDetermining whether a prior conviction is a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 for \u00a7 4B1.2 purposes is a question of law, not a question of fact found by the judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Bockes, </em>447 F.3d 1090, 1093 n. 4 (8th Cir. 2006). A district court need not apply the beyond a reasonable doubt standard to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (\u201cAny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (emphasis added). Parks\u2019s escape conviction qualifies as a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Nation, </em>243 F.3d 467, 472 (8th Cir.2001) (holding \u201cescape is categorically a crime of violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">We affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\">. The Honorable E.
