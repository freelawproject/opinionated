We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility finding and will uphold the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of asylum based on an adverse credibility finding. Singh\u2019 testimony was inconsistent with his asylum application and an FBI arrest report regarding whether he was in the United States or in India in 1993. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-63 (9th Cir. 2004). His testimony was also inconsistent with his asylum application regarding whether he joined the Akali Dal Mann party on April 13, 1993, or April 13, 1994, after he left the United States. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Because Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Singh\u2019s CAT claim also fails because it is based on the same testimony that the IJ and BIA found not credible, and Singh points to no other evidence that he could claim the IJ and BIA should have considered. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">Because Singh was not an asylee at the time he appeared before the IJ, he was not eligible for adjustment of status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159(b)(3). Accordingly, the IJ did not err in declining to adjudicate Singh\u2019s adjustment of status application.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b592-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
