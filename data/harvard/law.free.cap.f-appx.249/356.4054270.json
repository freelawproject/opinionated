Lopez argues that the district court\u2019s written judgment of revocation conflicts with its oral pronouncement of sentence. The Government agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Lopez pleaded true to violating the terms of his supervised release by leaving the judicial district without permission, and at both the revocation hearing and at sentencing, the district court revoked his release based solely on that violation, not the two other charges alleged in the revocation petition that Lopez committed new state and federal drug offenses. However, the written judgment erroneously reflects that Lopez was adjudicated guilty on all of the allegations in the petition. Additionally, in its oral pronouncement of sentence, the district court ordered that the 18-month sentence imposed be served concurrently to any future sentence on the pending drug charges. The written judgment does not reflect that the 18-month sentence is to be served concurrently with any future sentence in Lopez\u2019s pending Mississippi drug case. Therefore, because the language of the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence conflicts with its written judgment, the case is remanded for the district court to amend the written judgment to conform to the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence. <em>See United States v. </em>Martinez, 250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
