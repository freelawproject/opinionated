Jun. 23, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A 18 709 922 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 16, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 and counsel\u2019s familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, and the scope of the issues presented by this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">Vukel conceded at oral argument that our recent decision in <em>Maiwand v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 101, 105-07 (2d Cir.2007), forecloses his argument on appeal that he cannot be removed unless his refugee status is first terminated in accordance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1157(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">With respect to Vukel\u2019s CAT claim, we are without jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision to the extent that Vukel \u201cessentially disputes the correctness of an IJ\u2019s fact-finding.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. Gonzales, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Maiwand, </em>501 F.3d at 104-05. To the extent that Vukel challenges the IJ\u2019s application of facts to the standard of proof required under the CAT regulations, we find the challenge to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-15\">As for Vukel\u2019s contention that the IJ erred in shifting the burden of production away from the government, we note that the district court\u2019s order does not explicitly require that the government produce anything, and in any event the record shows that the government did in fact produce documentary evidence of country conditions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">With respect to Vukel\u2019s argument that his hearing violated due process, we are again without jurisdiction to hear his claim to the extent that it, in substance, \u201cquarrels over the correctness of ... factual findings.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 329. We conclude that Vukel waived any objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>tion to the two maps the IJ introduced into evidence at the hearing when counsel answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question whether he had any objection to their admission. <em>See In re Mirash Vukel, </em>No. A 18 709 922 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 16, 2004), Tr. of Sept. 23, 2003 Hearing at 79. Moreover, Vukel does not challenge the accuracy of the maps. The IJ\u2019s use of the maps was \u201cfundamentally fair, fairness in this context being closely related to the reliability and trustworthiness of the evidence.\u201d <em>Zerrei v. Gonzales, </em>471 F.3d 342, 346 (2d Cir.2006) (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Finally, Vukel\u2019s contention that the IJ \u201ctook on the role as a prosecutor for the INS,\u201d in this case is meritless. The IJ may have played an active role in asking questions to develop the record, but there is no showing of bias or one-sidedness on the part of the I J.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review of the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals is hereby DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
