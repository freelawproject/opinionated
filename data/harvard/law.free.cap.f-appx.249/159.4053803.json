In determining whether Petitioner\u2019s authority to dispense controlled substances should be revoked, the DEA is required to consider the following factors to determine if continued certification is against the public interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-22\">(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-23\">(2) The applicant\u2019s experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-24\">(3) The applicant\u2019s conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-25\">(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(f). The DEA held that factors 1 and 3 supported Petitioner, and factors 2 and 4 weighed against her. Finally, the DEA held that factor 5 also weighed against Petitioner, since she did not acknowledge any wrongdoing. Balancing the factors and according \u201cdispositive\u201d weight to factor 5, the DEA concluded that Petitioner\u2019s certificate should be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In considering Petitioner\u2019s experience in dispensing controlled substances under factor 2, the DEA identified only four visits by three undercover \u201cpatients,\u201d who were all attempting to make a case against her. The DEA failed to consider Petitioner\u2019s experience with twelve patients whose medical charts were seized by the DEA, or with thousands of other patients. In short, the DEA did not consider any of Petitioner\u2019s positive experience in dispensing controlled substances. This is an arbitrary and unfair analysis of Petitioner\u2019s experience. We vacate the order of the DEA Deputy Administrator and remand the case for reconsideration of this factor, where the DEA should pay particular attention to the entire corpus of Petitioner\u2019s record in dispensing controlled substances, not only the experience of undercover officers. The five factors should accordingly be re-balanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">ORDER VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO RESPONDENT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
