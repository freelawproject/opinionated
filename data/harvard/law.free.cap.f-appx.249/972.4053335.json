We previously granted a certificate of appealability as to Rashaad\u2019s claim that his attorney provided ineffective assistance, resulting in Rashaad being denied the right to testify in his defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After receiving additional briefing on this issue, we now vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-23\">A criminal defendant has a fundamental constitutional right to testify on his or her own behalf at trial. <em>United States v. Mid-gett, </em>342 F.3d 321, 325 (4th Cir.2003). This right, derived from various constitutional provisions, \u201creaches beyond the criminal trial.\u201d <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 51 n. 9, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987); <em>Reinert v. Larkins, </em>379 F.3d 76, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>95 (3d Cir.2004) (considering habeas petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on his contention that his counsel violated his constitutional right to testify at a pre-trial suppression hearing). A defendant\u2019s waiver of this right, like that of any other constitutional right, is \u201cpersonal\u201d and must be made voluntarily and knowingly. <em>Sexton v. French, </em>163 F.3d 874, 881 (4th Cir.1998); <em>Brown v. Artuz, </em>124 F.3d 73, 77-78 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion and the accompanying sworn affidavit, Rashaad claimed counsel was ineffective when he failed to advise Rashaad of his right to testify at the pre-trial hearing on his motion to dismiss the indictment, which was predicated on the immunity agreement into which Ra-shaad had entered with the Government. In his affidavit, Rashaad asserted that, had he properly been advised and allowed to testify, he would have provided testimony refuting the Government\u2019s evidence establishing Rashaad\u2019s breach of the immunity agreement. The Government did not file a response to Rashaad\u2019s motion. The district court summarily dismissed the claim, finding Rashaad had not established his attorney had failed to advise him of his right to testify at trial. The court, however, did not address Rashaad\u2019s claim that he had not been advised regarding his right to testify at the pre-trial hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Unless it is clear from the pleadings, files, and records that the prisoner is not entitled to relief, \u00a7 2255 makes an eviden-tiary hearing mandatory. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Raines v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 526, 529 (4th Cir.1970). The district court may expand the record to include letters, documents, and affidavits. <em>Raines, </em>423 F.2d at 529-30. A district court\u2019s decision as to whether a hearing is mandatory under \u00a7 2255 and whether petitioner\u2019s presence is required at the hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 530 (citing <em>Machibroda v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962)). Notwithstanding the court\u2019s ability to expand the record and its wide discretion in the matter, \u201c[t]here will remain, however, a category of petitions, usually involving credibility, that will require an evidentiary hearing in open court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), in order to prove ineffective assistance of counsel based on his claim that his attorney prevented him from exercising his right to testify at the pre-trial hearing, Rashaad must show both that his attorney violated his right to testify and that his testimony had a \u201creasonable probability\u201d of changing the outcome. In denying \u00a7 2255 relief on this issue, the district court construed Rashaad\u2019s claim as asserting Rashaad had been denied his right to testify at trial \u2014 not at the pre-trial hearing. This overly narrow construction of Rashaad\u2019s claim, coupled with the fact that Rashaad\u2019s affidavit stands unrefuted on the record,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> leads us to conclude the district court\u2019s order as to this issue must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">We vacate the district court\u2019s order denying relief on Rashaad\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective because he prevented Rashaad from testifying at the pre-trial hearing, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We deny Rashaad\u2019s motion for default judgment. We dispense with oral argument because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b998-14\">. We denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed Rashaad\u2019s appeal as to his remaining claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b999-7\">. Although far from clear, it appears plausible that, had Rashaad been permitted to testify at the pre-trial hearing on the motion to dismiss and had he testified in conformity with the facts averred in his affidavit, the result of the hearing might have been different. However, as the district court has yet to consider this issue, our present disposition should not be construed as an indication that we have formulated any view regarding the appropriate outcome of the proceedings on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
