(ChexSystems), a Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA). Lang alleged that the banks failed to investigate the claimed inaccuracies after they were notified of the errors, and thereby violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b). He appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The FCRA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b), sets forth the duties of those who furnish credit information. Under that statute, after a furnisher (such as a bank) receives notice from a CRA that a consumer disputes the \u201ccompleteness or accuracy of information\u201d that the furnisher gave the CRA, the fur-nisher must conduct a reasonable investigation and report the results of the investigation back to the CRA. <em>See Westra v. Credit Control, </em>409 F.3d 825, 827 (7th Cir. 2005); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681i(a)(2), 1681s-2(b)(l)(A)-(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In evaluating whether Lang\u2019s complaint states a claim under this statute, we of course take as true the complaint\u2019s well-pleaded factual allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in Lang\u2019s favor. <em>See Brown v. Budz, </em>398 F.3d 904, 907 (7th Cir.2005). We also may consider any additional allegations in Lang\u2019s briefs to the district court or on appeal so long as those allegations are consistent with the complaint. <em>See Help at Home, Inc. v. Med. Capital, L.L.C., </em>260 F.3d 748, 752-53 (7th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, Washington Mutual and Lang agree that we may also consider the in-court oral clarification Lang made about his claims against Washington Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">From these sources we glean the following allegations: ChexSystems reported to Lang that both Washington Mutual and TCF had provided it with information about accounts that Lang once had with them. ChexSystems also told Lang that it had \u201cno information\u201d about whether Lang currently had a debt with Washington Mutual. Lang responded to ChexSystems that the information both banks had provided to ChexSystems was incorrect. He said specifically that Washington Mutual knew that he had \u201cpaid the bank\u201d any money he owed, so ChexSystems should have been able to acquire \u201cinformation\u201d reflecting no current debt with Washington Mutual. After Lang notified ChexSys-tems of these errors, ChexSystems notified Washington Mutual of Lang\u2019s dispute. (Lang did not expressly allege whether ChexSystems notified TCF of his disputes with the information TCF reported about him). Neither bank corrected the alleged misinformation, even after Lang sent them letters informing them of the errors in the information they had reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">The defendants each moved to dismiss Lang\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), but the banks took different approaches to their motions. Washington Mutual argued that Lang pleaded himself out of court by alleging that he had \u201cpaid the bank.\u201d According to Washington Mutual, it had reported Lang for overdrafts, and Lang\u2019s statement that he had \u201cpaid the bank\u201d indicated that Lang once owed Washington Mutual money, rendering the information in Lang\u2019s credit report accurate. TCF, in contrast, argued that Lang\u2019s claims against it should be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>missed because Lang failed to allege specifically that ChexSystems had notified TCF of Lang\u2019s complaints. Without this allegation, said TCF, the plaintiff had not properly alleged that TCF\u2019s duty to investigate under \u00a7 1681s \u2014 2(b) was activated. The district court granted TCF\u2019s and Washington Mutual\u2019s motions to dismiss on the ground urged by TCF: that Lang did not allege that ChexSystems had notified either bank of his dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">On review we begin with the claim against TCF. TCF urges us to affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal on the ground that Lang failed to allege that ChexSys-tems notified TCF of Lang\u2019s dispute; TCF insists that \u00a7 1681s-2(b) requires it to investigate a consumer complaint only after a CRA notifies it of the consumer\u2019s dispute, so the missing allegation dooms Lang\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In general when a plaintiff brings a claim in federal court, he need only provide enough \u201cdetail to give the defendant \u2018fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,\u2019 \u201d and, through his allegations show that it is plausible, rather than merely speculative, that he is entitled to relief. <em>EEOC v. Concentra Health Care Servs., Inc., </em>496 F.3d 773, 776-77 (7th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (further citations omitted)). Even after the Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>Bell Atlantic </em>case, complaints in federal courts need only satisfy a notice pleading standard. <em>Airborne Beepers &amp; Video, Inc. v. AT &amp; T Mobility LLC, </em>499 F.3d 663, 667-68 (7th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007)). We have distinguished notice pleading from, evidentiary proof by stressing that \u201c[f]acts that substantiate the claim ultimately must be put into evidence, but the rule \u2018plaintiff needs to prove Fact Y\u2019 does not imply \u2018plaintiff must allege Fact Y at the outset.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vincent v. City Colleges of Chicago, </em>485 F.3d 919, 923-924 (7th Cir.2007). Further, we have admonished that \u201c[a]ny district judge (for that matter, any defendant) tempted to write \u2018this complaint is deficient because it does not contain ... \u2019 should stop and think: What rule of law <em>requires </em>a complaint to contain that allegation?\u201d <em>Doe v. Smith, </em>429 F.3d 706, 708 (7th Cir.2005) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which requires heightened pleading for a subcategory of claims such as fraud, <em>see Vincent, </em>485 F.3d at 925, can provide such a rule of law. But TCF does not argue that Rule 9(b) applies in this case. Indeed, \u201cnotification\u201d is not on the list of items that must be pleaded with particularity under that rule. <em>Bell Atlantic, </em>for its part, requires only that the complaint provide \u201cfair notice\u201d of a plaintiffs claims and that recovery be \u201cplausible.\u201d 127 S.Ct. at 1964. Lang\u2019s allegations meet those requirements. He asserts that he told ChexSystems (a CRA) that TCF furnished false information, that TCF refused to investigate or correct the false report even after learning of the asserted error, and that it thereby violated the FCRA. Even TCF does not argue that these allegations did not provide it with fair notice of Lang\u2019s claim or that, when the allegations are assumed to be true, recovery is implausible. Finally, there is a practical reason why Lang should not be required to allege that ChexSystems notified TCF of the error. The FCRA does not require a CRA to tell a <em>consumer </em>when it notifies a <em>furnisher of information </em>about the consumer\u2019s dispute. As a result a consumer may not, at the time of filing a complaint, be in a position to allege that notification. TCF may have a compelling argument for summary judgment if it can demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>undisputably that a CRA did not notify it of Lang\u2019s dispute, but at this point Lang\u2019s recovery under the FCRA is <em>plausible, </em>which is all that notice pleading requires, see <em>Bell Atl, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1974. Accordingly the complaint is sufficient as to TCF.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Washington Mutual properly concedes that the district court erred in dismissing Lang\u2019s claims against it on the basis of Lang\u2019s supposed failure to plead that ChexSystems apprised it of the dispute. But it argues that we may affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal on the basis of the argument it pursued in the district court \u2014 that Lang pleaded himself out of court by saying that he \u201cpaid the bank.\u201d Lang complains that the report is inaccurate, not because of its indication of previous indebtedness, but because the report asserted that ChexSystems had \u201cno information\u201d about whether Lang currently owed Washington Mutual money. Lang says that Washington Mutual had information that Lang did not owe it money and should have reported that information to ChexSystems. Lang therefore did not plead himself out of court on his FCRA claim against Washington Mutual by saying that he \u201cpaid the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lang\u2019s claims against TCF and Washington Mutual and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\">. The district court refused to consider the additional facts Lang included in his response to Washington Mutual\u2019s motion to dismiss, saying \"the Court appropriately considers only the complaint, not new assertions made in a party's brief\u201d in deciding whether to dismiss the complaint. The district court, however, should have considered the additional allegations that were consistent with Lang's complaint. <em>See Help at Home, Inc., </em>260 F.3d at 752-53.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
