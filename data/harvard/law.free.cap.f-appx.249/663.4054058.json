We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of the waiver for substantial evidence, Oro<em>peza-Wong v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1135, 1147 (9th Cir.2005), and we review purely legal issues de novo, <em>see Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 975 (9th Cir.2006). We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Although Punogin provided evidence that a child was born during his marriage, he provided no documents to show commingling of funds or co-habitation, and he failed to provide any third-party testimony or affidavits proving the bona fides of the marriage. Substantial evidence therefore supports the agency\u2019s determination that Punogin did not enter into the marriage in good faith. <em>See Oropeza-Wong, </em>406 F.3d at 1148 (upholding the denial of a waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(c)(4)(B)); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 216.4(a)(5) (stating application for waiver shall be accompanied by documentation showing that the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of evading immigration laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Punogin\u2019s remaining contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period. The BIA\u2019s streamlined order changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla, </em>463 F.3d at 981, we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the agency for reinstatement of the 60-day voluntary departure period. Punogin\u2019s counsel is cautioned that his opening brief does not meet this court\u2019s standards. <em>See generally </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28; 9th Cir. R. 28-2.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b689-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
