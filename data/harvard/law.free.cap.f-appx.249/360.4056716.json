He contends that the district court clearly erred when it enhanced his offense level for possession of a firearm pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(4)(C) (2005) because it was not foreseeable that his co-conspirators would have possessed firearms during the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The district court\u2019s determination that it was reasonably foreseeable that Rodriguez\u2019s co-conspirators possessed firearms during the conspiracy was plausible in light of the record read as a whole. Although there was no direct evidence that Rodriguez knew his co-conspirators possessed firearms, there was sufficient evidence from which the district court could infer that it was reasonably foreseeable that his co-conspirators possessed firearms. <em>See United States v. Gaytan, </em>74 F.3d 545, 559 (5th Cir.1996). Therefore, the district court did not clearly err when it enhanced Rodriguez\u2019s offense level for possession of a firearm pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(4)(C). <em>See United States v. Charon, </em>442 F.3d 881, 887 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 260, 166 L.Ed.2d 202 (2006). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
