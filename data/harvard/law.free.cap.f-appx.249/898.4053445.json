Feb. 23, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 75 961 703 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 28, 1998) and (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 14, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, <em>ie., </em>\u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Here, the IJ found that Cao\u2019s written asylum application, where he indicated that his political activities required him to \u201cshuttle back and forth\u201d from Beijing to Tienjing \u201cmany times,\u201d was inconsistent with his testimony that he visited Beijing only twice during his involvement with the pro-democracy student movement. Because that inconsistency concerned a matter central to Cao\u2019s claim \u2014 that he was a leader in the pro-democracy student movement \u2014 it was substantial when measured against the record as a whole. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The IJ also noted three additional inconsistencies between Cao\u2019s testimony and his documentary evidence: (1) although he claimed to be unemployed, Cao\u2019s passport, issued in Beijing, indicated that he was a professional manager; (2) Cao obtained a B-l business visa from the American consulate, which is consistent with the professional designation on his passport, and inconsistent with his testimony that he was homeless for eight years; and (3) the country profile indicated that, if Cao was indeed a student activist leader, he would not have been able to leave the country so easily. While these inconsistencies were arguably less central to Cao\u2019s claim, combined with the IJ\u2019s additional credibility findings, the IJ properly deemed them consequential. <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, although Cao offered explanations for these inconsistencies, a reasonable factfin-der would not be compelled to credit them. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d </em>77, 80 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">The IJ\u2019s credibility determination was also supported by his finding that portions of Cao\u2019s testimony were implausible and that some of his testimony lacked specificity. The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was amply supported by the record as a whole and provided a proper basis for the agency\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. Insofar as Cao\u2019s CAT claim was based on the same factual predicate as his asylum and withholding of removal claims, the adverse credibility finding is dispositive of that claim as well. <em>See Xue Hong Yang, </em>426 F.3d at 523. To the extent that the IJ addressed Cao\u2019s CAT claim assuming his credibility, she did not err in finding that he presented insufficient evidence of a likelihood of torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(c), 1208.17; <em>Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 168 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
