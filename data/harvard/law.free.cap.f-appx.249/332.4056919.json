The gist of Drake\u2019s suit is that, despite his prior felony conviction, the district court should restore his right to legally possess a firearm. Drake was convicted of a federal felony in 1990. His restoration of his civil rights by the governor of Louisiana does not entitle him to possess a firearm. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(g); <em>Beecham v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 368, 114 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>1669,128 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). An administrative procedure has been provided for relief from the firearm disability, but Drake has not sought relief. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c). The court has no jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Bean, </em>537 U.S. 71, 123 S.Ct. 584, 154 L.Ed.2d 483 (2002). To the extent Drake makes other claims over which the court might have jurisdiction, they have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
