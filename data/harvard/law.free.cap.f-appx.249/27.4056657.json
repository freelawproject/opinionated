HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b54-18\">In May 2003 DIRECTV, Inc. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas against William Turner and other defendants, seeking damages and injunctive relief under several federal statutes, including the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 521 <em>et seq., </em>and the Electronic Communications Policy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510 <em>et seq. </em>The complaint alleged that Mr. Turner had illegally used and distributed devices designed to intercept and decrypt DIRECTV\u2019s satellite signal, permitting free viewing of DIRECTV\u2019s television programming. After a bench trial the district court found that Mr. Turner had accessed DIRECTV\u2019s programming in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511, but that he had not distributed devices in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(e)(4). It awarded damages of $10,000 under 47 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u00a7 605(e)(3)(C)(i)(II) and injunctive relief under \u00a7 605(e)(3)(B)(i). The court entered judgment against Mr. Turner on July 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Mr. Turner filed a notice of appeal on December 22, 2006, but because unresolved claims remained against at least one other defendant, there was no final judgment until the court granted Rule 54(b) certification on June 18, 2007. <em>See D &amp; H Marketers, Inc. v. Freedom Oil &amp; Gas, Inc., </em>744 F.2d 1443, 1444 (10th Cir.1984) (\u201cJurisdiction to consider an appeal is not discretionary but is circumscribed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, which has consistently been held to require the termination of all matters <em>as to all patties and causes of action </em>before an appeal may be taken.\u201d (emphasis added)). We now have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Lewis v. B.F. Goodrich Co., </em>850 F.2d 641, 645 (10th Cir.1988). Finding no merit to Mr. Turner\u2019s arguments, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Mr. Turner raises six issues on appeal. First, he argues that the district court should not have denied his motion for sanctions in response to a motion filed by DIRECTV. But he never filed a motion for sanctions before the district court, so there is nothing for him to appeal on this issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Second, Mr. Turner argues that his motion for summary judgment should have been granted because (1) there was no \u201cactual evidence\u201d that he intercepted DIRECTV\u2019S signal, Aplt. Br. at 1; and (2) he lacked the \u201crequisite [Knowledge and materials\u201d for such interception, <em>id. </em>But \u201cthe denial of summary judgment based on factual disputes is not properly reviewable on an appeal from a final judgment entered after trial.\u201d <em>Haberman v. Hartford Ins. Group, </em>443 F.3d 1257, 1264 (10th Cir.2006). If Mr. Turner means instead to argue that the evidence at trial was insufficient to sustain the judgment against him, we cannot address this issue because he has not included a trial transcript in the record on appeal. <em>See Sanjuan v. IBP, Inc., </em>275 F.3d 1290, 1298 n. 3 (10th Cir.2002) (\u201c\u2018When sufficiency of the evidence is raised, the entire relevant trial transcript must be provided.\u2019 10th Cir. R. 10.1(A)(1)(a).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">Third, Mr. Turner argues that the district court should have granted his motions for dismissal and judgment on the evidence because DIRECTV is a system for \u201caeronautical communications,\u201d and it is not unlawful to intercept signals from such systems. Aplt. Br. at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted). But he cites no motions in which he raised this issue below, and we can find none. (The only motion to dismiss that he filed does not raise this issue.) Accordingly, the issue is forfeited. <em>See Parker v. Scott, </em>394 F.3d 1302, 1309 n. 1 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">Fourth, Mr. Turner contends that he cannot be liable under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(e)(3)(A), which provides a private right of action to a \u201cperson aggrieved.\u201d He makes two arguments: One argument is that DIRECTV was not a \u201cperson aggrieved,\u201d within the statutory definition of that term in \u00a7 605(d)(6). But Mr. Turner does not cite any portion of the record where he raised this issue below, and we have found none. Accordingly, we need not address this argument. <em>See Parker, </em>394 F.3d at 1309 n. 1. Mr. Turner\u2019s other argument is that he was not a member of the class civilly liable for violations of \u00a7 605. But on appeal and below he has raised this argument only with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>violations of \u00a7 605(e)(4). Mr. Turner, however, was held liable only for \u2022violations of \u00a7 605(a) (interception and use); the district court ruled that he had not violated \u00a7 605(e)(4) (distribution). This argument therefore is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Fifth, Mr. Turner contends that the district court erred in excluding evidence of his financial hardship before assessing damages. Again, however, he does not cite, and we cannot find, any indication in the record that he ever sought to introduce such evidence. He also argues that the court misconstrued 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520 by treating damages under that section as mandatory when they are in fact discretionary. But the court explicitly stated that \u00a7 2520 \u201cprovides] for <em>discretionary </em>statutory damages of $100 a day or $10,000 per violation.\u201d R. Doc. 453 (Mem. &amp; Order, July 13, 2006, 2006 WL 2522630) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Sixth, Mr. Turner asserts that the evidence failed to establish that he was not authorized to intercept DIRECTV\u2019s signal. In the absence of a trial transcript, however, we cannot review this assertion. <em>See Sanjuan, </em>275 F.3d at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">To the extent that Mr. Turner\u2019s reply brief raises issues not addressed in his opening brief, we decline to consider them. <em>See Coleman v. B-G Maint. Mgmt. of Colo., Inc., </em>108 F.3d 1199, 1205 (10th Cir. 1997) (\u201cIssues not raised in the opening brief are deemed abandoned or waived.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Accordingly we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment. We also DENY as moot Mr. Turner\u2019s \u201cMotion to Dismiss Appel-lee[\u2019s] Motion to Dismiss Appeal for Lack of Jurisdiction,\u201d and we DISMISS his May 14, 2007, motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b54-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-8\">. This and several other issues Mr. Turner raises are inapposite to his case, having apparently been drawn from a brief filed by another defendant against DIRECTV in a separate trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
