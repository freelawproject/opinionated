We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of jurisdiction, <em>Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir.2007), and review the denial of a motion to remand for abuse of discretion, <em>Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 523 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-17\">Gutierrez moved to terminate his proceedings, arguing that the Notice to Appear was jurisdictionally deficient because the issuing official\u2019s signature and title were unclear. The BIA properly rejected the argument. <em>See Kohli, </em>473 F.3d at 1068-70 (holding that an IJ\u2019s denial of a motion to terminate proceedings due to a defective NTA did not violate due process because no prejudice was shown).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-18\">Contrary to Gutierrez\u2019s contention, the BIA provided an adequate explanation for denying his motion to remand. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1430 (9th Cir.1995). The BIA concluded that the absence of a transcript for March 3, 2004 resulted in no prejudice, where the merits hearing took place on a later date. <em>See Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b579-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
