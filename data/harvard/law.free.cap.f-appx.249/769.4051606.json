The Board of Immigration Appeals held, at least in an alternative holding, that petitioner\u2019s claims for relief failed because petitioner had failed to establish that he was a victim of past persecution on a protected ground. We need not address whether or not the single assault suffered by petitioner at the hands of FARC might have been sufficiently severe to rise to the level of persecution, had petitioner proved the protected ground aspect. We do conclude, however, that the record does not compel a result contrary to the finding of the BIA that petitioner failed to establish the protected ground element. The record does not compel a finding that FARC\u2019s assault on petitioner, when he rose to defend his wife, was based upon either petitioner\u2019s own political opinion, or an imputed political opinion attributed to petitioner by FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">With respect to petitioner\u2019s claim of a well founded fear of future persecution, we readily conclude that the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to that of the BIA, especially in light of petitioner\u2019s divorced status from his wife, who was the focus of FARC\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
