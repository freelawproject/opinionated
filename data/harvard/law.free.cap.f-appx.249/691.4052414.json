Keisler is substituted for his predecessor, Alberto R. Gonzales, as Acting Attorney General of the United States, pursuant to Fed.

We dismiss her petition on the asylum claim for lack of jurisdiction, and deny the petition on withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The BIA held that Luvumbu was ineligible to apply for asylum because she failed to establish that she had filed an asylum application within one year of entering the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination of this historical fact. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(8); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 649-50 (9th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The BIA determined that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings were not clearly erroneous. The BIA\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence, including evidence that documents submitted by Luvumbu to support her claims had been altered and discrepancies between Luvumbu\u2019s testimony and her brother\u2019s detailed letters regarding key events. <em>See Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 742 n. 7 (9th Cir. 2007); <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). Therefore, the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s determination that Luvumbu did not qualify for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Luvumbu waived her claim that the IJ failed to address her eligibility for CAT relief separately because she raised it for the first time in her reply brief. \u201c[T]he general rule is that appellants cannot raise a new issue for the first time in their reply briefs.\u201d <em>Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">Although the IJ showed frustration during Luvumbu\u2019s hearing, Luvumbu was able to testify and fully present her claims. Therefore, the IJ\u2019s questioning in this case did not \u201crise to the level of a due process violation.\u201d <em>See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1072 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A9t\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
