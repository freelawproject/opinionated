We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility finding and will uphold the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of asylum based on an adverse credibility finding. Ji\u2019s testimony was internally inconsistent in regard to whether he read the contents of a letter that the police attempted to force him to sign. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-63 (9th Cir.2004). In the absence of credible testimony, Ji also failed to provide sufficient corroborating evidence in support of claims of past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">Because Ji failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">Ji\u2019s CAT claim also fails because it is based on the same testimony that the IJ and BIA found not credible, and Ji points to no other evidence that he could claim the IJ and BIA should have considered. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b589-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
