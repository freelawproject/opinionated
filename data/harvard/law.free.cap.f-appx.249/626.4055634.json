INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b652-25\">Defendant Max Clark Tanner was convicted, following a jury trial, of conspiracy to commit securities, mail, and wire fraud in connection with the purchase and sale of securities, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2000), along with substantive counts of securities fraud (one count), mail fraud (four counts), wire fraud (eight counts), money laundering (twenty counts), filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>false tax returns (two counts), and tax evasion (one count). The district court sentenced Defendant to 96 months\u2019 incarceration. This court affirmed the convictions, but remanded for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), without addressing the Government\u2019s argument that the district court had incorrectly calculated the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Tanner, </em>121 Fed. Appx. 213 (9th Cir.2005). On remand, the district court imposed the same sentence. The Government appeals the sentence. We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">II. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The district court declined to impose a two-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice. (EOR 867-68.) The district court also rejected Probation\u2019s recommendation of a multiple group enhancement, a two-level increase. (EOR 868.) After consideration of enhancements, but before consideration of a downward departure, the district court determined Defendant\u2019s offense level to be 32. (EOR 908-09.) The district court departed downward three levels, to level 29, on its finding that Defendant\u2019s conduct was outside the money laundering heartland. (EOR 909.) Level 29 corresponded to a range of 87-108 months.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">On remand, the district court stated: [T]he Court is not convinced that it would have issued a sentence different from that which was actually imposed given the totality of the circumstances of the case. While the Ninth Circuit did withdraw its finding that they could not find my sentencing decisions unreasonable and they sent it back to me for <em>Ameline </em>purposes, I do not find any reason to \u2014 to change the sentence that was imposed. In looking at the situation with Mr. Tanner, I felt that the amount of time that he was sentenced to, 96 months, was completely adequate and reasonable and complied with all of the sentencing factors of the federal sentencing statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">(EOR 1016.) Based on the remand instructions, the district court answered the question posed by this court in light of <em>Booker. </em>We now review whether the district court correctly calculated the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">The prior appeal was decided soon after <em>Booker, </em>when procedures for handling <em>post-Booker </em>sentences were unclear. <em>See Tanner, </em>121 Fed.Appx. 213. Since then, the court has decided what such procedures should be. <em>See United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269 (9th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). We must decide whether the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range, and if we find \u201cthat the sentence resulted from an incorrect application of the Sentencing Guidelines, and further that the error in application was not harmless,\u201d we will remand for resentencing. <em>Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d at 1279. We continue to review \u201cthe district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts of this case for abuse of discretion, and the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Kimbrew, </em>406 F.3d 1149, 1151 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">We conclude that the district court erred in calculating the guidelines sentence by refusing to apply the obstruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>and grouping enhancements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of our conclusions, we remand for resentenc-ing, without addressing the issue of reasonableness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">\n<em>A. The Sentencing Guidelines Calculation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">1. <em>The Obstruction Ruling </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 states, \u201cIf (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.\u201d In its ruling denying this enhancement, the district court referenced three acts: Defendant\u2019s instructing Kevin Ruggiero, co-conspirator Dennis Evans, and his tax return preparer, Ronald Drake, to lie. The district court found that \u201cthe effect of the suggested answers to the IRS and to investigatory bodies was minimal at most.\u201d (EOR 867-68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The Government argues that the district court erred in not applying this enhancement. Specifically, the Government argues that Defendant instructed Ruggiero to testify falsely during his SEC deposition. Also, the Government states that Defendant attempted to unlawfully influence Evans\u2019s statements in his IRS interview. Finally, the Government notes that Drake testified that Defendant instructed him to create a false explanation for his amended tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">\n<em>(a) Ruggiero and Evans</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">The district court accepted Defendant\u2019s argument that for the obstruction enhancement to be based on his instruction to Evans to lie, the Government must demonstrate that Evans\u2019s false statements to investigators <em>actually and significantly </em>impeded the investigation. The Government, however, correctly argues that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, Application Note 4(g) does not apply to Defendant\u2019s lies to law enforcement. In <em>United States v. Collins, </em>90 F.3d 1420, 1429-30 (9th Cir.1996), this court held that where a defendant instructs others to provide false statements to law enforcement officers, the correct application of \u00a7 3C1.1 is not under Application Note 4(g) but Note 4(a). Under 4(a), \u201cit does not matter that, in the end, [the defendant\u2019s] unlawful influence scheme fooled no one, he still obstructed justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1430 (analyzing the Application Notes to \u00a7 3C1.1 under the old numbering system, when what are now Notes 4(a) and 4(g) were 3(a) and 3(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Defendant\u2019s instruction to Ruggiero to lie to the SEC also warranted the enhancement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, Application Note 4(b), covers attempts to promote perjury, which does not require that the obstructive conduct affect the investigation. <em>See United States v. Magana-Guerrero, </em>80 F.3d 398, 401 (9th Cir.1996) (analyzing the Application Notes to \u00a7 3C1.1 under the old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>numbering system, when what are now Notes 4(a) and 4(g) were 3(a) and 3(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\n<em>(b) Ronald Drake</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Defendant filed a 1997 return that reported he had no taxable income. (Trial Transcript, \u201cTestimony of Ronald Drake and Thomas Warren,\u201d 11/05/01 at 10.) After a search warrant was executed on his office, Defendant filed an amended return that reported $767,000 in income. <em>(Id. </em>at 19.) Defendant included a narrative statement, written by Drake. The narrative stated that the amended return was initiated prior to execution of the search warrant and that the amended return was not completed until after the search because of scheduling conflicts. <em>(Id. </em>at 20-24.) Defendant\u2019s actual 1997 income was over $3.6 million. (PSR 21.) Drake testified that Defendant told him to create the false explanation for the amended return so \u201cthat it would appear better to the IRS.\u201d (Trial Transcript, \u201cTestimony of Ronald Drake and Thomas Warren,\u201d 11/05/01 at 23.) Defendant was convicted of filing a false 1997 return. (Count 36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">\u201cImpermissible double counting occurs only when \u2018one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of another part of the Guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Alexander, 48 </em>F.3d 1477, 1492 (9th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Reese, </em>2 F.3d 870, 895 (9th Cir.1993)). The applicable guidelines are U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2T1.1 and 2T4.1. Here, Defendant influencing Drake to create a false explanation involved an action separate from tax fraud. Defendant enlisted Drake to obstruct discovery of his tax fraud by the IRS. This obstruction is \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the \u201cobstruction of the collection of revenue.\u201d <em>United States v. Sabino, </em>307 F.3d 446, 451 (6th Cir.2002). Concerning this enhancement, the district court misconstrued the guidelines and abused its discretion in applying the sentencing guidelines to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">2. <em>The Group Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">In its initial ruling, the district court found that the Maid Aide stock fraud offenses and the tax offenses were part of a continuous course of criminal activity and grouped all 37 counts into a single group. (EOR 868.) The district court declined to apply the two-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4. The Government contends that the district court erred in grouping all 37 counts into one group.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">The district court indicated that it based its ruling on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d), which states that grouping is appropriate \u201c[w]hen the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss, the quantity of a substance involved, or some other measure of aggregate harm, or if the offense behavior is ongoing or continuous in nature.\u201d But this provision does not authorize the grouping of the money laundering and tax counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">First, the Maid Aide stock fraud offenses and the tax offenses were not part of a single continuous course of criminal activity. The stock fraud offenses encompassed Defendant\u2019s involvement in the telemarketing fraud involving Ruggiero and a boiler room of brokers. (EOR 894.) The tax offenses were discrete events, based on Defendant\u2019s individual filing of false tax returns. (PSR 13.) Second, two of the three tax offenses (Counts 35 and 36) did not involve the Maid Aide fraud, but involved Defendant\u2019s failure to report and pay tax on legal source income received in 1996 and 1997. <em>(Id.) </em>Section 3D1.2 permits the grouping of closely related counts. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>104 F.3d 1149, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). But here, of the $10,029,908 in unreported income that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the subject of Counts 35, 36, and 37, only $2,158,208 related to the Maid Aide fraud. The two offenses should not have been grouped.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">\n<em>B. Harmless Error Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Defendant contends that any errors in the computation of the guideline sentence are harmless. A district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines \u201cis subject to harmless error analysis, and no remand is required if \u2018the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>121 F.3d 510, 513-14 (9th Cir. 1997) (quoting <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1120, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992)). \u201cIf the party defending the sentence persuades the court of appeals that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the erroneous factor, then a remand is not required.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>503 U.S. at 203, 112 S.Ct. at 1121. While the issue is not free of doubt, Defendant has not carried his burden to demonstrate that \u201cit is more probable than not\u201d that the district court\u2019s errors in computing the guideline sentence did not affect selection of the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Flores, </em>418 F.3d 1093, 1099 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence is vacated, and we remand to the district court for resentencing following a computation of the guideline sentence consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\">. The Government also argues that the district court erred at the resentencing hearing by stating that the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement for being a leader or organizer \u201cprobably would not be applied now.\u201d (EOR 1031.) But, the district court did not recalculate the guideline sentence at the resentencing hearing. Hence, this enhancement remained a part of the guideline calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-13\">. We construe the Government's challenge to the district court's <em>pre-Booker </em>downward departure as part of its challenge to the overall reasonableness of the sentence. <em>See United States v. Mohamed, </em>459 F.3d 979, 986-87 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
