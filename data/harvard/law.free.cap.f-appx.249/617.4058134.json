We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-16\">First, we reject Eudave-Mendez\u2019s claim that the subsequent expungement of her California conviction, for violating Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11366.5(a), prevents the Government from removing her on the basis of it. It is true that <em>Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 728 (9th Cir.2000) and <em>Garberding v. INS, </em>30 F.3d 1187 (9th Cir.1994), stand for the proposition that the Government cannot, for immigration purposes, distinguish between one who has received relief under a state rehabilitation statute, as opposed to the Federal First Offender Act (FFOA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3607, solely \u201cbecause of the breadth of [her state\u2019s] expungement statute, not because of what she did,\u201d <em>Garberding, </em>30 F.3d at 1191 (citation omitted). That is, \u201cpersons who received the benefit of a state expungement law [are] <em>not </em>subject to deportation as long as they <em>could </em>have received the benefit of the [FFOA] if they had been prosecuted under federal law.\u201d <em>Lujan-Armendariz, </em>222 F.3d at 738. Yet Eudave-Mendez\u2019s section 11366.5(a) conviction has no apparent similarity to the only federal drug crime for which the FFOA provides relief \u2014 simple possession \u2014 and she has not even attempted to argue any such similarity or that she would have received relief under the FFOA had she been prosecuted under federal law. Thus this argument fails. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>Dillingham v. INS, </em>267 F.3d 996, 1006 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cIn <em>Paredes-Urrestarazu [v. INS, </em>36 F.3d 801 (9th Cir.1994) ], we recognized the converse rule that persons found guilty of a drug offense who could not have benefited from the FFOA were not entitled to receive favorable immigration treatment, even if they qualified for rehabilitation under state law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We do, however, find merit in the second of Eudave-Mendez\u2019s arguments, that the BIA erred in holding that her conviction for violating Cal. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code \u00a7 11366.5(a) was categorically an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), because all behavior prohibited by section 11366.5(a) would also have constituted a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2). Although section 11366.5(a) and \u00a7 856(a)(2) are very similar, they differ in one important respect: the mens rea requirement for section 11366.5(a) is only \u201cknowingly,\u201d while for \u00a7 856(a)(2) it is \u201cknowingly and intentionally.\u201d \u201cIntentionally\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d are terms with traditional meanings in criminal law, and the meanings are different. <em>Cf. Salviejo-Fer-nandez v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 1063, 1067 (9th Cir.2006) (citations omitted) (noting that generally, \u201cpurpose\u201d equates with specific intent, and \u201cknowingly\u201d with general intent). Indeed, in <em>People v. Sanchez, </em>27 Cal.App.4th 918, 33 Cal.Rptr.2d 155, 158 (1994), a California court recognized that the lack of a specific intent requirement in section 11366.5(a) differentiated it from another, more general, state drug law. Although the Government urges us to ignore part of the explicit mens rea requirement of \u00a7 856(a)(2), we cannot read \u201cintentionally\u201d out of the statute. <em>See Boise Cascade Corp. v. EPA, </em>942 F.2d 1427, 1432 (9th Cir.1991) (citations omitted) (\u201cUnder accepted canons of statutory interpretation, we must interpret statutes as a whole, giving effect to each word and making every effort not to interpret a provision in a manner that renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent, meaningless or superfluous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Accordingly, Eudave-Mendez\u2019s California conviction does not fall categorically within 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2), and thus cannot constitute an \u201caggravated felony\u201d on the basis of being a \u201cdrug trafficking crime,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the BIA did not reach any other basis for characterizing Eudave-Mendez\u2019s conviction as an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d we remand to the BIA. <em>Cf. Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 1081, 1088 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that sometimes, in the face of a novel legal question, \u201cthe better course ... is to remand to the agency for its consideration of the issue in the first instance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">PETITION GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b644-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-6\">. This conclusion renders it unnecessary for us to consider Eudave-Mendez's argument that section 11366.5(a) cannot be a \"drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>trafficking crime\u201d because it does not contain a firearm element.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
