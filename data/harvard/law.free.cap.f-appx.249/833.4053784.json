The defendant requested a downward adjustment in his federal sentencing guidelines offense level, arguing that he had been only a minor participant in the offenses. The district court denied the adjustment and, after several days of sentencing hearings in which the defendant testified, granted him a \u201csafety valve\u201d adjustment. The court sentenced the defendant to 70 months in prison (the bottom of the applicable guideline imprisonment range).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">On appeal, the defendant raises five issues. Because we find none of them to have merit, we summarily affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">I. <em>Guilty Plea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">The defendant argues that he is entitled to specific performance of the government\u2019s alleged initial \u201cpartial oral/written agreement\u201d pursuant to which he and his co-defendants were permitted to plead guilty while reserving their rights to appeal from the denial of their motion to suppress. The defendant concedes in his brief, however, that he \u201cpleaded guilty af-terwards, not based on the unfulfilled promise of the prosecutor.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 30. Even assuming that at the time of the initial change-of-plea hearing in October of 2004 there existed an \u201cinformal agreement\u201d that the defendant would be permitted to plead guilty without waiving the right to appeal from the denial of the suppression motion, he does not argue that the actual plea, entered three months later, was pursuant to such an agreement. His \u201cplea was thus in no sense the product of governmental deception; it rested on no \u2018unfulfilled promise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mabry v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 504, 510, 104 S.Ct. 2543, 81 L.Ed.2d 437 (1984). Consequently, the defendant is not entitled to specific performance of the alleged initial \u201cpartial oral/written agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">II. <em>Role in the Offense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">The defendant claims that the district court erred in denying his request for a two-level reduction for his minor role in the offenses of conviction. \u201c[A] defendant who aspires to be classified as a minor participant bears the burden of proving that he is both (i) less culpable than most other participants in the offenses of conviction, and (ii) less culpable than the average miscreant involved in offenses of the same genre.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>354 F.3d 70, 74 (1st Cir.2004). \u201cReview of the decision to deny a downward adjustment for minor role is for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Morales-Madera, </em>352 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.2003). \u201cIf the record supports at least two permissible inferences, the fact-finder\u2019s choice between or among them cannot be clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we rarely reverse a district court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>regarding whether to apply a minor role adjustment.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>489 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 344, - L.Ed.2d - (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">In determining that the defendant was not a minor participant, the sentencing court relied upon the defendant\u2019s own testimony that 1) he had been given a cell phone and assigned responsibility for making the contact with the intended recipient of the drugs when the vessel reached Puerto Rico, and 2) that he had originally been recruited to participate in the drug smuggling scheme because of his familiarity with the coastline of the Dominican Republic, the original planned destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">The defendant maintains in his brief that \u201c[t]here is no factual controversy\u201d regarding the role in the offense and that the issue he raises \u201cturns merely on whether or not [Plutarco\u2019s admitted] conduct can be considered minimal, minor or average.\u201d In this regard, he argues that the court erred in relying upon the second factor\u2014 his knowledge of the Dominican coastline. Because the drugs were brought into the United States and the boat never traveled to the Dominican Republic, he argues that the second factor was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">We disagree. The court relied upon the fact that the defendant \u201cwas hired initially as the man that was going to navigate the boat through the waters of Santo Domingo.\u201d Although the boat did not end up traveling to the Dominican Republic, it does not appear clearly erroneous for the court to have inferred that a person chosen to navigate the boat into the port of arrival was also a person charged with responsibility for other important tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">The defendant also argues that his role in the offenses should have been assessed in the context of the \u201cwhole scenario,\u201d and in comparison with the roles of \u201cthe sellers and buyers of the shipment\u201d and the distributors in the United States. He contends that his role was minor because it was limited \u201cto aid[ing] in the transportation of drugs from one point to the other.\u201d However, \u201crole-in-the-offense adjustments depend ... on comparing each offender\u2019s actions and relative culpability with the elements of the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Ocasio, </em>914 F.2d 330, 333 (1st Cir.1990). Here, the defendant was not charged with distribution of the drugs. He was charged with possession with intent to distribute and with conspiring to import drugs. Therefore, he \u201chad a hand in each of the essential elements of the offense of conviction,\u201d <em>id., </em>and the district court did not clearly err in failing to compare his role with unidentified purchasers, sellers, and distributors of the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">III. <em>Failure to Depart</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">The defendant claims that the sentencing court erred in not granting him a downward departure on the ground of duress, as was granted to several of his co-defendants. He testified at his sentencing hearing that when he learned that the drugs were to be delivered to Puerto Rico instead of the Dominican Republic, he wanted to abandon the venture, but felt that he \u201chad no alternative but to get in the boat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">The defendant\u2019s failure to seek a downward departure on this basis in the district court forecloses our consideration of the issue. <em>See United States v. Morales-Ma-dera, </em>352 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.2003). Moreover, even if the court had denied a request by the defendant for a departure on this ground, \u201con appeal, we only have jurisdiction to review if \u2018the sentencing court\u2019s failure to depart did not represent an exercise of factfinding or discretion, but was instead the product of the court\u2019s miscalculation about whether it possessed the authority to depart.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bravo, </em>489 F.3d at 12-13. Given that the court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>downward departures for duress for some co-defendants, it was clearly aware of its authority to depart on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">IV. <em>Booker Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The defendant argues that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), prohibited the sentencing court from increasing his sentence based on judicial findings of fact, including role in the offense, and that such determinations must be made by a jury. As an initial matter, the court did not increase the defendant\u2019s sentence based on judicial findings of fact regarding his role in the offense; it merely declined to reduce his sentence on that basis. Moreover, where as in this case the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum for the offenses to which defendant pled guilty, this court has held that \u201c[ujnder Booker, a judge may do such fact finding in determining the Guidelines range. Nothing in <em>Booker </em>requires submission of such facts to a jury so long as the Guidelines are not mandatory.\u201d <em>United States v. Antonakopoulos, </em>399 F.3d 68, 80 (1st Cir.2005). The sentencing court applied the advisory guidelines and there was no <em>Booker </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">V. <em>Judicial Bias</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The defendant claims judicial bias by the judge who sentenced him and seeks resentencing before a new judge. We review for abuse of discretion the refusal of a trial judge to recuse himself. <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>289 F.3d 16, 27 (1st Cir. 2002). \u201c[Disqualification is appropriate when \u2018the facts asserted provide what an objective, knowledgeable member of the public would find to be a reasonable basis for doubting the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Here, the issue of bias was raised in a motion filed by defense counsel on April 1, 2005, to withdraw from representing the defendant. The motion cited as \u201cevidence\u201d of potential bias the judge\u2019s comments critical of the attorney\u2019s performance during the March 31, 2005 sentencing hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-11\">[Jjudicial remarks during the course of trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge. They <em>may </em>do so if they reveal an opinion that derives from an extrajudicial source; and they <em>will </em>do so if they reveal such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ5\"><em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). The defendant has not alleged an extrajudicial source from which the alleged bias was derived. The transcript of the sentencing hearing does not reveal \u201csuch a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant\u2019s bias claim relies largely upon the district court\u2019s tone of voice rather than the words themselves. At bottom, then, his claim relies upon \u201cexpressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger,\u201d which the Supreme Court has ruled do not establish bias or partiality. <em>Id. </em>at 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147. When the sentencing hearing resumed on April 4, 2005, the court specifically denied any animus toward defense counsel and explained that it was concerned about the lack of legal basis for some of the arguments made by counsel. At this point, counsel for the defendant confirmed that he did not feel that the court had been \u201cironic\u201d with him during that day\u2019s hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">The other grounds on which the defendant rests his present claim of judicial bias implicate judicial rulings in the case, including the denial of the defendant\u2019s request for a two-level reduction for a minor role in the offenses. It is settled that \u201cjudicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.... Almost invariably, they are</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>proper grounds for appeal, not for recu-sal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147. Such is the case here, where the rulings neither show a reliance upon an extrajudicial source nor display the requisite \u201cdeep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, the transcripts of the sentencing hearings reveal that the district court went to great lengths to ensure fairness in the defendant\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The conviction and sentence are <em>affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
