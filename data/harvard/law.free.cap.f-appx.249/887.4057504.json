Korman, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b914-9\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Plaintiff Terrianne Otts appeals from a judgment of the district court upholding a final determination by the Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) denying Otts\u2019s application for Social Security Disability Insurance (\u201cSSDI\u201d) for the period January 31, 2000, to February 21, 2002, and Social Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits for the period July 26, 2000, to February 21, 2002. Our review focuses not so much on the decision of the district court as on that of the Commissioner, and our task is not to determine <em>de novo </em>whether Otts was disabled during the relevant periods but to ensure that the Commissioner\u2019s decision was based on the correct legal standard and supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Halloran v. Barnhart, </em>362 F.3d 28, 31 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Shaw v. Chater, </em>221 F.3d 126, 131 (2d Cir.2000). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">1. <em>The Failure to Find a Listed Impairment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">The record shows that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) who reviewed Otts\u2019s disability claim on behalf of the Commissioner did so according to the five-step procedure specified in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920; <em>Rivera v. Schweiker, </em>717 F.2d 719, 722 (2d Cir.1983). Otts nevertheless submits that the ALJ erred at step three in concluding that her disability did not constitute a listed impairment, specifically, a disorder of the spine under \u00a7 1.04A of Appendix 1.- <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 1.04A (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">Section 1.04A defines a disorder of the spine as, inter alia, a \u201cherniated nucleus <em>pulposus\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., a herniated disk \u2014 \u201cresulting in compromise of a nerve root ... or the spinal cord\u201d with \u201c[ejvidence of nerve root compression characterized by neuro-anatomic distribution of pain, limitation of motion of the spine, motor loss (atrophy with associated muscle weakness or muscle weakness) accompanied by sensory or reflex loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It was Otts\u2019s burden to demonstrate that her disability met <em>\u201call </em>of the specified medical criteria\u201d of a spinal disorder. <em>Sullivan v. Zebley, </em>493 U.S. 521, 531, 110 S.Ct. 885, 107 L.Ed.2d 967 (1990) (emphasis in original); <em>see Rosa v. Callahan, </em>168 F.3d 72, 77 (2d Cir.1999) (diseuss-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>ing burdens of proof applicable to five-step analysis). Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that, although Otts met the threshold requirement of having a herniated disc, she did not carry her burden as to the other definitional criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">With regard to \u201cmotor loss ... accompanied by sensory or reflex loss,\u201d the ALJ noted that an examination conducted on January 31, 2000, the alleged onset date of Otts\u2019s disability, showed that Otts\u2019s hands were neurovascularly intact and that their \u201cstrength was good bilaterally and equal.\u201d The ALJ also noted that Dr. Ganesh, who diagnosed Otts with a herniated neck disc in August 2000, found that \u201c[t]here was no muscle atrophy,\u201d that \u201c[f)ine motor activity of the hands (dexterity) was intact,\u201d and that Otts\u2019s \u201cgrip strength was 5/5 bilaterally.\u201d While plaintiffs treating physician, Dr. Barber, identified some decreased muscle strength, motion, and sensation in Otts\u2019s right arm, he made no finding of nerve root compression. In fact, he reported that Otts\u2019s disc problem placed no limitations on her sitting, standing, or walking. The ALJ referenced Dr. Ganesh\u2019s similar conclusion. As the ALJ acknowledged, a neurosurgeon, Dr. Zogby, conclusorily reported that Otts was \u201ctotally disabled from work,\u201d but the ALJ acted within his discretion in discounting this view because Dr. Zogby \u201csaw the claimant on only one visit, and based his opinion on her subjective allegations and behavior.\u201d <em>See Balsamo v. Chater, </em>142 F.3d 75, 81 (2d Cir.1998) (observing that an ALJ \u201cis free ... to choose between properly submitted medical opinions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">While the ALJ might have been more specific in detailing the reasons for concluding that Otts\u2019s condition did not satisfy a listed impairment, the referenced medical evidence, together with the lack of compelling contradictory evidence from the plaintiff, permits us to affirm this part of the challenged judgment. <em>See Berry v. Schweiker, </em>675 F.2d 464, 468 (2d Cir.1982) (holding that \u201cthe absence of an express rationale does not prevent us from upholding the ALJ\u2019s determination ... [where] portions of the ALJ\u2019s decision and the evidence before him indicate that his conclusion was supported by substantial evidence\u201d); <em>see also Mongeur v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 1033, 1040 (2d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">2. <em>Assessing Residual Functional Capacity at Steps Four and Five</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Otts asserts that the ALJ erred in determining, at step four, that she retained the residual functional capacity to perform light exertional work, the level corresponding to her past job as a secretary. Under the regulations, light exertional work \u201crequires a good deal of walking or standing\u201d and \u201cinvolves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(b), 416.967(b). The ALJ found that Otts could satisfy these benchmarks despite the report of her long-time treating physician, Dr. Barber, that she could only lift ten pounds and only less than ten pounds frequently due to limitations in the use of her right arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">While an ALJ may afford controlling weight to the opinion of a treating physician that is supported by record medical findings, <em>see Rosa v. Callahan, </em>168 F.3d at 78-79; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2), he may also reject such an opinion upon the identification of good reasons, such as substantial contradictory evidence in the record, <em>see Halloran v. Barnhart, </em>362 F.3d at 32. In this case, the ALJ did not \u201ccomprehensively set forth reasons\u201d for rejecting Dr. Barber\u2019s opinion about weight limitations on Otts\u2019s ability to lift and carry. <em>Id. </em>at 33. The omission is significant because \u201cwe do not hesitate to remand\u201d a case when the rejection of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>treating physician opinion is not supported by specified reasons. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the ALJ observed only that two consulting physicians had concluded that Otts could perform light exertional work, which might liberally be construed as a reference to them finding that she could frequently lift ten pounds. The ALJ did not, however, identify any reasons for finding these opinions more reliable than Dr. Barber\u2019s. Indeed, to the extent the ALJ noted that he was not bound by these consulting doctors\u2019 opinions and had based his decision on his own independent review of the total record, the ALJ pointed to no other record facts supporting rejection of Dr. Barber\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">We need not, however, remand this case for further proceedings at step four because, even if the step four analysis were to be resolved in plaintiffs favor, we would still have to conclude that substantial record evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion at step five that Otts is not disabled because work exists in significant numbers in the national economy that she can still perform, <em>e.g., </em>information clerk and surveillance system monitor. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1560(c), 416.960(c). These jobs were identified by a vocational expert in response to a hypothetical that referenced Otts\u2019s exertional and non-exertional limitations, and that specifically assumed both her inability to use her right hand and arm and her inability to lift or carry more than five pounds. Such evidence was sufficient to allow the Commissioner to carry his burden at step five. <em>See Rosa v. Callahan, </em>168 F.3d at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Because this conclusion is, by itself, enough to support affirmance, we need not address Otts\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s reliance on the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, or any of her other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
