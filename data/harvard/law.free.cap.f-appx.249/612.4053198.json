We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Where it is unclear whether the BIA conducted a de novo review, we look to the IJ\u2019s decision as a guide. <em>See Avetova-Elisseva v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1192, 1197 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s finding on Fan\u2019s untimely asylum application because it was based on disputed facts. <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650 (9th Cir.2007) (per cu-riam). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition as to Fan\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-23\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Fan did not satisfy the standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Fa-ruk v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 940, 944 (9th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Fan did not establish that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to China. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(2). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review as to Fan\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b638-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
