We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Where, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA. <em>See Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">We have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s finding of no extraordinary or changed circumstances to excuse the untimely filing of Lopez-Palacios\u2019 asylum application. The record does not compel the conclusion that Lopez-Palacios has shown either changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the untimely filing of his asylum application. <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 657-58 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4), (a)(5). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review as to Lopez-Palacios\u2019 asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Lopez-Palacios did not satisfy the standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Faruk v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 940, 944 (9th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence also supports the denial of CAT relief because Lopez-Palacios did not establish that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to Colombia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review as to Lopez-Palacios\u2019 withholding of removal and CAT claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b631-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
