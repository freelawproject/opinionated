Weirup appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner of Social Security in Weirup\u2019s action challenging the cessation of his Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A) (2006). Weirup\u2019s benefits ceased in November 2001 after he did not respond to a request to furnish information indicating whether he was still under a disability. He requested reconsideration and eventually a hearing was held where the ALJ found that Weirup was able to make an adjustment to other work in the economy and was, therefore, not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. The district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s order upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits <em>de novo. See Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 679 (9th Cir.2005). We may set aside a denial of benefits \u201conly if it is not supported by substantial evidence or if it is based on legal error.\u201d <em>Floten v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>44 F.3d 1453, 1457 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">Weirup argues that the ALJ failed to point to any medical evidence that indicated that Weirup\u2019s medical condition improved since he was deemed disabled. The ALJ\u2019s finding that Weirup experienced medical improvement is supported by substantial evidence in the medical records: Weirup has had several surgeries that were considered successful; he appears to lead a lifestyle that includes hunting, fishing, doing chores around the house, socializing, and tending to his garden; and a medical evaluation found that he did not have problems with concentration and had no episodes of decompensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">Weirup argues that the ALJ erred in finding his testimony regarding his pain and physical limitations, his brother\u2019s testimony, and his mother\u2019s testimony not credible. The ALJ found that Weirup\u2019s testimony regarding the disabling effects of his pain was inconsistent with the medical records. The ALJ found Weirup\u2019s brother\u2019s testimony regarding Weirup\u2019s physical limitations also was inconsistent \u25a0with the medical records because the records evince that Weirup goes hunting and fishing with his son. The ALJ did not make an adverse credibility finding regarding Weirup\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony. To the contrary, he found the lay witnesses generally credible. To the extent that the ALJ rejected Weirup\u2019s and his brother\u2019s testimony, he gave sufficient reasons for doing so and these reasons are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Bruton v. Massanari, </em>268 F.3d 824, 828 (9th Cir.2001). Further, the reasons he provided for rejecting Weirup\u2019s brother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>testimony were germane to the witness. <em>See Regennitter v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>166 F.3d 1294, 1298 (9th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b724-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
