DiGiovanni submits that the requested revision is necessary to promote safety and noise abatement. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-17\">Our jurisdiction to entertain this appeal is established by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110(c). <em>See Friends of Gateway v. Slater, </em>257 F.3d 74, 77 (2d Cir.2001). Our standard of review, however, is \u201cextremely limited and highly deferential.\u201d <em>Massachusetts v. EPA, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1438, 1459, 167 L.Ed.2d 248 (2007) (discussing judicial review of agency\u2019s refusal to promulgate rule in environmental context) (internal quotation marks omitted). In general, courts will not set aside agency actions unless they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). When the challenged action is a refusal to initiate rulemaking, the standard may, in fact, operate \u201cat the high end of the range\u201d of deference, so that rulemaking will be judicially ordered \u201conly in the rarest and most compelling of circumstances.\u201d <em>EMR Network v. FCC, 391 F.3d 269, </em>273 (D.C.Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-20\">At the outset we note that although DiGiovanni \u2014 both before the agency and in this court \u2014 questions the safety consequences of the existing FAA rule, that rule was promulgated pursuant to the agency Administrator\u2019s statutory authority to \u201cdevelop plans and policy for the ... navigable airspace and [to] assign by regulation or order the use of the airspace necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40103(b)(1). Thus, our review is necessarily \u201climited to the <em>narrow issues as defined by the denial of the petition for \\rulemaking, </em>and does not extend to a challenge of the agency\u2019s original action in promulgating the disputed rule.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd. Union v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., </em>834 F.2d 191, 196 (D.C.Cir.1987) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">To begin, in reviewing the denial here at issue, we note that nothing in DiGiovanni\u2019s submissions demonstrate that \u201ca significant factual predicate\u201d for the existing rule \u201chas been removed,\u201d a circumstance that a sister circuit has described as presenting \u201cone of the strongest potential bases for overturning an agency\u2019s refusal to initiate rulemaking.\u201d <em>EMR Network v. FCC, </em>391 F.3d at 273 (internal quotation marks omitted). The record in this case satisfactorily demonstrates that, in denying Di-Giovanni\u2019s request for rule revision, the FAA considered the established criteria for processing such petitions: (1) the immediacy of safety or security concerns raised by the petition, (2) the priority of other issues confronting the FAA, and (3) the availability of FAA resources to address the identified concerns. See 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.73(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">With respect to the last two factors, the agency explained that its present commitment of resources to a strategic plan involving fifty rulemaking projects, some mandated by Congress, required it to be selective in adding further rulemaking projects to its agenda. [A15] Such a reason for denying a particular rulemaking request cannot be deemed arbitrary or capricious. <em>See EMR Network v. FCC, </em>391 F.3d at 273 (declining to overturn agency decision to engage in rulemaking where decision \u201cappears to represent the sort of priority-setting in the use of agency resources that is least subject to second-guessing by courts\u201d). As for the first factor, while the agency agreed with DiGiov-anni that it would be \u201cdesirable that all airports served by an instrument procedure have controlled airspace,\u201d it noted that \u201cthis is not always possible.\u201d Thus, the FAA explained that it relied on pilots \u201cto be vigilant and follow recommended traffic pattern and communication practices\u201d when operating in uncontrolled airspace. In rejecting DiGiovanni\u2019s argument that safety and noise abatement mandated revision of the existing rule, the FAA clarified the order governing the designation of Class D airspace; corrected certain of DiGiovanni\u2019s assumptions about pre-1993 control zones; explained that noise abatement policies determined by airport management existed independently of airspace classification; and noted the numerous operational regulations to ensure aircraft safety that applied without regard to airspace classification. DiGiov-anni may disagree with the agency\u2019s safety assessment, but we cannot identify abuse of agency discretion in the challenged denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The petition for review of the FAA\u2019s order of April 4, 2005 is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
