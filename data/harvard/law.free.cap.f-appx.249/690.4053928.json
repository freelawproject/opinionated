To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">The BIA acted within its discretion in denying Covarrubias\u2019 motion as untimely because it was filed more than eight months after the BIA\u2019s final removal order, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (requiring motion to reopen to be filed within ninety days of the final administrative removal order), and Covarrubias failed to establish grounds for equitable tolling, <em>see Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (equitable tolling is available \u201cwhen a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud or error,\u201d as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">To the extent Covarrubias contends the BIA should have exercised its sua sponte authority to reopen his case, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to do so. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">We do not consider any challenge to the BIA\u2019s underlying order dismissing Covar-rubias\u2019 direct appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal, because that decision was the subject of a previous petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b717-10\"> \u25a0pjiig disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
