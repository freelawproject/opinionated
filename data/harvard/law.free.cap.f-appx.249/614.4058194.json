We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-26\">When, as here, the BIA affirms without an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>directly. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Rostomi-an v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 1088, 1089 (9th Cir. 2000), and we deny the petition in part, grant the petition in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that petitioners failed to demonstrate past persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 970 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1019-21 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Substantial evidence further supports the IJ\u2019s finding that petitioners failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, because they failed to demonstrate the requisite individualized risk of persecution. <em>Cf. Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Because petitioners cannot meet their burden to demonstrate that they are eligible for asylum, they necessarily fail to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 673 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">We decline to consider the IJ\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 CAT claims, because petitioners did not raise the issue in their opening brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held that \u201cbecause the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the agency for further proceedings regarding voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b640-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
