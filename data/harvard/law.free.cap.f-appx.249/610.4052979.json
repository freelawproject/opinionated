Ashcroft, 358 F.3d </em>674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">We have jurisdiction over the remaining claims under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Mgoian v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1029, 1034 (9th Cir.1999), and we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-21\">Substantial evidence does not support the Id\u2019s finding that Chute failed to show that the government was unable or unwilling to protect him because Chute testified that he was assaulted and robbed by native Fijians on several occasions and the police did not take any action when he reported the incidents. <em>See Mashiri v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 1112, 1121 (9th Cir. 2004); <em>see also Surita v. INS, </em>95 F.3d 814, 819-20 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-22\">Substantial evidence does not support the Id\u2019s finding that \u201cassuming on the arguendo\u201d there was past persecution, Chute \u201cfailed to meet [his] burden.\u201d If past persecution is assumed, Chute has a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, and it is the government\u2019s burden to rebut the presumption. <em>See Deloso v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 858, 863-64 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-23\">Accordingly, we grant the petition as to Chute\u2019s asylum and withholding claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; GRANTED in part; and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b637-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
