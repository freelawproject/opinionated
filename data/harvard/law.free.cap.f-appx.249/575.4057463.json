We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-23\">Kassim contends the agency erred in finding that he was statutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal because he engaged in the persecution of others. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(i). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>We do not consider this contention because the IJ\u2019s alternative findings \u2014 that there had been a fundamental change in Sierra Leone, and that Kassim failed to show a well-founded fear of persecution or a likelihood of torture \u2014 are dispositive on Kas-sim\u2019s eligibility for relief, and he did not challenge these findings before the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Kassim stated in his motion to remand that he was eligible to adjust his status with a waiver of inadmissibility, but failed to submit an application for the waiver, or provide evidence that his qualifying relative would suffer \u201cextreme hardship\u201d if he were denied admission. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c) (\u201cA motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation\u201d); <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (holding that BIA may deny an applicant\u2019s motion to reopen if movant is not prima facie eligible for relief sought). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Kassim\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Kassim contends the IJ violated due process by exhibiting bias. Contrary to Kassim\u2019s contentions, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [he] was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review Kassim\u2019s contention that the IJ erred in finding him ineligible for cancellation of removal because he did not raise this issue before the BIA and thereby did not exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b602-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
