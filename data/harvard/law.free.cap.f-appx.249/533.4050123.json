We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>see Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir.2005), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Rodriguez-Reyes was removable because her conduct amounted to alien smuggling in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i). Rodriguez-Reyes testified that she knew her sister had no legal documentation to enter the United States, but still attempted to drive her across the border. <em>See Moran, </em>395 F.3d at 1091-92; <em>cf. Altamirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 595 (9th Cir.2005) (concluding petitioner did not violate alien smuggling statute where she knew there was an illegal alien in the car, but she was only a passenger and provided no affirmative act of assistance).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"A5qs\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
