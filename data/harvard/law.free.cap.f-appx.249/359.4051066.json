Defendant-Appellant Edgar Fernando Blanco Puerta pleaded guilty to conspiracy to \u201cprovide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B, and to conspiracy with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), 846. The District Court applied a sentencing enhancement for an offense involving or promoting a \u201cfederal crime of terrorism.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4(a). Puerta did not object to the sentencing enhancement in the District Court. Nevertheless, Puerta now appeals the sentencing enhancement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-24\">We review the decision of the District Court for plain error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir. 2005) (holding that the plain error standard applies when a defendant fails to object to a sentencing enhancement) (citations omitted). We find plain error only when \u201c(1) there was an error; (2) the error was clear and obvious; and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). If all three conditions are met, we have <em>\u201cdisere</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>tion </em>to notice a forfeited error but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358-59 (emphasis added) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">There is no plain error in this case. A \u201cfederal crime of terrorism\u201d is \u201can offense that \u2014 (A) is calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct; and (B) is a violation of ... [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 J2339B.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5); <em>see </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3A1.4 cmt. (n.l) (2004) (\u201cFor the purposes of this guideline, \u2018federal crime of terrorism\u2019 has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Puerta\u2019s conviction falls squarely within the definition of a \u201cfederal crime of terrorism\u201d in \u00a7 2332b(g)(5). Puerta pleaded guilty to violating \u00a7 2339B. Specifically, Puerta and his co-conspirators sought to trade drugs and money for weapons to supply the United Self Defense Force of Colombia, a designated foreign terrorist organization that opposes the Colombian government. Puerta\u2019s argument that \u00a7 2332b(g)(5) applies only to the government of the United States is unavailing. The relevant text refers broadly to \u201cgovernment,\u201d \u00a7 2332b(g)(5), in contrast to other subsections which specify \u201cthe United States Government,\u201d \u00a7 2332b(b)(l)(c). <em>See United States v. DeAmaris, </em>406 F.Supp.2d 748, 749-51 (S.D.Tex.2005) (holding that \u201cthe word \u2018government\u2019 as used in \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(a) includes foreign governments and is not limited to the government of the United States\u201d). Accordingly, we find no plain error in the District Court\u2019s decision to apply the sentencing enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
