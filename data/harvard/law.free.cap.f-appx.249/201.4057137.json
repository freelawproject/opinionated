We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">This case grows out of disputes Evans had with the faculty and administration at California State University, Stanislaus while a student there. He sued the United States Department of Education in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (Compl. H 11.). The court dismissed this complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, without leave to amend. (Compl. If 12.).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">Evans then filed the present suit in the Court of Federal Claims. Evans invoked that court\u2019s jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1), and the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), 2671-2680.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">On the government\u2019s motion, the Court of Federal Claims dismissed the suit, without prejudice, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court noted that although \u201cthe Tucker Act is a waiver of the government\u2019s sovereign immunity,\u201d it \u201cdoes not establish a substantive right of recovery.\u201d The court pointed out that \u201cjurisdiction\u201d under the Tort Claims Act, upon which Evans relied, \u201cis exclusively with United States district courts.\u201d \u201cIndeed, the Tucker Act expressly excludes tort claims from this court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d \u201cThus, this court lacks jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs claims.\u201d (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-16\">The court then stated: \u201c[ajdditionally, to the extent plaintiffs complaint alleges civil rights violations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, it is well-established that the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over civil rights claims brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims is limited. <em>See United States v. King, </em>395 U.S. 1, 3, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969). As that court pointed out, its jurisdiction covers only \u201ccases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1). Evans\u2019 claims based upon the Tort Claims Act are tort claims, over which the Court of Federal Claims has no jurisdiction. <em>Berdick v. United States, </em>222 Ct.Cl. 94, 612 F.2d 533, 536 (1979). The United States district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over claims under the Tort Claims Act. <em>See, e.g., Awad v. United States, </em>301 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed.Cir.2002); <em>Wood v. United States, </em>961 F.2d 195, 197 (Fed.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">To whatever extent Evans may be asserting claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Court of Federal Claims similarly would not have jurisdiction over them. Exclusive jurisdiction over such claims also lies in the United States district courts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Evans requests that, if we affirm the dismissal of his suit, we should then transfer his case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. That section provides that if a \u201ccourt finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought____\u201d We decline to do so. It would not be \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d to transfer this case to the same district court that previously had dismissed, without leave to amend, Evans\u2019 prior complaint based upon substantially the same allegations as the present case, because Evans had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">The judgment of the United States Court of Federal Claims dismissing this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
