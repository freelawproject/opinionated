We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment because Valenzuela did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants were deliberately indifferent in treating his surgically repaired [fractured] right thumb. <em>See id. </em>A difference in opinion between Valenzuela and the prison physicians about the preferred course of medical treatment does not constitute an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See id. </em>at 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Valenzuela\u2019s discovery motions because the defendants\u2019 responses to Valenzuela\u2019s discovery requests were sufficient. <em>See Kulas v. Flores, </em>255 F.3d 780, 783 (9th Cir.2001) (district court\u2019s rulings concerning discovery are reviewed for an abuse of discretion). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Valenzuela\u2019s request concerning the prison\u2019s mail room policies because the request was moot. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Valenzuela\u2019s request for an extension to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommendations because his request was untimely. <em>See Hawaiian Rock Prods. Corp. v. A.E. Lopez Enters., Ltd., </em>74 F.3d 972, 976 (9th Cir.1996) (district court\u2019s decision to deny a continuance is reviewed for an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b554-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
