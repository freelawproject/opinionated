Robinson, United States District Judge. Defendant was convicted, by a guilty plea, of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and tax evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. On November 5, 2005, Defendant was sentenced by Judge Robinson principally to a term of 37 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a term of 3 years of supervised release. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-20\">Hirsch first contends that the district court erred in making two enhancements under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). We apply de novo review to the legal questions regarding the application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Jolly, </em>102 F.3d 46, 48 (2d Cir.1996). In reviewing a sentencing court\u2019s calculations under the Guidelines, an appellate court must \u201cgive due defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>ence to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>United States v. Fritzson, </em>979 F.2d 21, 22 (2d Cir.1992). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>See United States v. Farah, </em>991 F.2d 1065, 1068 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">First, Hirsch argues that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, because he argues that he did not abuse a position of trust. We have held that \u201cwhether a position is one of \u2018trust\u2019 ... is to be viewed from the perspective of the offense victims and is a question of law for the court, subject to de novo review on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>160 F.3d 905, 910 (2d Cir.1998). A court\u2019s determination that an individual \u201cabused [a] position [of trust] in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense is a question of fact reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Hirsch, </em>239 F.3d 221, 227 (2d Cir.2001). Whether someone occupies a position of trust \u201cturns on \u2018the extent to which the position provides the freedom to commit a difficult-to-detect wrong,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>201 F.3d 163, 166 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam) (parenthetical citation omitted), and does not require \u201ca legally defined duty such as fiduciary duty.\u201d <em>United States v. Barrett, </em>178 F.3d 643, 646 (2d Cir.1999). We recently explained that this standard requires that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s position must involve discretionary authority ... [and that] this discretion must have been entrusted to the defendant by the victim.\u201d <em>Hirsch, </em>239 F.3d at 227 (parenthetical citations omitted). In this case it is clear that the defendant-appellant was entrusted with discretion over the victim\u2019s money and, further, that it was this discretion that provided the defendant with the opportunity to commit the crime. Alternatively to the abuse of trust determination, the district court found that, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, Hirsch employed his \u201cspecial skill\u201d in preparing the payroll tax forms. Hirsch does not challenge this finding on appeal. We have previously found that the \u201cspecial skill\u201d enhancement is applicable to those who use them knowledge of IRS procedures and tax forms to carry out a scheme of tax fraud. <em>Fritzson, </em>979 F.2d at 23. Therefore, it was not error for the district court to find the existence of a trust relationship in these circumstances, nor alternatively, the use of a \u201cspecial skill\u201d in applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 enhancement to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Next, Hirsch argues that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l), applicable to defendants who fail \u201cto report or correctly identify the source of income exceeding $10,000 in any year from criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l). Hirsch argues that because he did not plead guilty to a failure to pay taxes on money that he made through the criminal endeavor, but rather to a failure to pay to the IRS funds that were legitimately earned by his clients through noncriminal activities, his sentence should not be subject to this enhancement. Defendant\u2019s argument is meritless. The language of the U.S.S.G. and our case law make clear that the relevant conduct provision of the U.S.S.G. is to be interpreted broadly. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3; <em>see also United States v. Silkowski, </em>32 F.3d 682, 688 (2d Cir.1994). Furthermore, that a defendant can be held liable for uncharged relevant conduct that was \u201cpart of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2); <em>United States v. Martin, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>157 F.3d 46, 50 (2d Cir.1998). Given these applicable legal standards, it is clear that the District Court did not err in including as relevant conduct the Defendant\u2019s failure to report his own embezzled income from his fraudulent scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Finally, Hirseh argues that his sentence was not reasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court failed to give adequate consideration to the applicable statutory sentencing factors. <em>See also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1). When a sentence is challenged for reasonableness, we review both the actual term of the sentence and the procedures employed in determining the sentence. <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006). \u201cReasonableness review does not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge. Rather, the standard is akin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27; <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 114 (2d Cir.2005). Furthermore, while we will review the record as a whole to determine whether a sentence is reasonable in a specific case, \u201cin the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27. Finally, \u201cwe have imposed no [] requirement that a sentencing judge <em>precisely identify </em>either the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) or specific arguments bearing on the implementation of those factors in order to comply with her duty to consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors along with the Guidelines applicable range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27-28 (emphasis in original). In this case, it is clear that the district court was \u201caware of both the statutory requirements and the sentencing range or ranges that are arguably applicable, and nothing in the record indicates misunderstanding about such materials or misperception about their relevance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 29-30, thus \u201cwe will accept that the requisite consideration has occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. Not only did the district court judge read and reference all of the defendant\u2019s 77 page pre-sentence memorandum in its entirety, as well as a 12-page psychiatric exam report, and 45 pages worth of letters in support of the defendant, but the district court also explained, in detail, at the sentencing why it found an abuse of trust, would have alternatively found an enhancement for special skills, and why it included the enhancement for failure to report income exceeding $10,000. Furthermore, the district court gave the defendant ample time to argue for mitigating factors, and discussed and responded to the defendant\u2019s arguments in detail. Finally, the district court explained that it understood its duty under \u00a7 3553 and that it was taking those factors into consideration in determining the sentence. Therefore, there is nothing that the district court did in imposing a 37-month sentence, at the lowest end of the applicable Guideline range, that renders that sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of conviction and sentence imposed by the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
