Burr. <em>See In re Umar Shafiq, </em>No. A 97 656 674 (B.I.A. Nov. 7, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A 97 656 674 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 13, 2005). Shafiq asserts that the agency erred in finding him ineligible for relief from removal under the Family Unity Amendments to the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act (\u201cLIFE Act\u201d), Pub.L. 106-554 \u00a7 1504, 114 Stat. 2763, 2763A-324 (2001). Where, as here, the BIA adopts and affirms the Id\u2019s decision with some supplementation, \u201cwe review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245a.31, which implements the Family Unity Amendments to the LIFE Act, certain spouses and unmarried children of aliens eligible to adjust status under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245a.l0 may obtain family unity benefits in the United States if they, <em>inter alia, </em>entered the United States before December 1, 1988, and resided in the United States on that date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245a.31(b); Family Unity Amendments to LIFE Act, Pub.L. 106-554 \u00a7 1504(b), 114 Stat. 2763 at 2763A-325. Although petitioner concedes that he did not physically enter the United States until March 24, 2004, he contends that he is nevertheless eligible to receive family unity benefits under the relevant LIFE Act Amendments because his father\u2019s entry into the United States prior to December 1, 1998, created a legal domicile for him in this country. As the BIA correctly concluded, however, domicile is irrelevant to the legal requirements that petitioner enter the United States before December 1, 1988, and reside in the United States on such date. <em>See Rosario v. INS, </em>962 F.2d 220, 224 (2d Cir.1992) (noting that, although \u201ca minor\u2019s domicile is the same as that of its parents,\u201d residence is \u201cdetermined from the <em>physical fact </em>of ... living in a particular place\u201d (emphasis added)); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(33) (defining \u201cresidence\u201d as a person\u2019s \u201cprincipal, actual dwelling place in fact, without regard to intent\u201d). Because there is no record evidence that petitioner entered or resided in the United States prior to his entry in March 2004, he fails to satisfy the entry and residence requirements necessary to qualify for benefits under the Family Unity Amendments to the LIFE Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Accordingly, the petition for review of the BIA\u2019s November 7, 2006 order is hereby DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b268-10\">. The family unity benefits conferred upon eligible spouses and unmarried children by the Family Unity Amendments include an exemption from removal on certain specified grounds and authorization to work in the United States. <em>See </em>Family Unity Amendments to LIFE Act, Pub.L. 106-554 \u00a7 1504(a), 114 Stat. at 2763A-325.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
