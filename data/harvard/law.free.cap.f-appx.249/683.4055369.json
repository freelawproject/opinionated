We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. \u201c[Wjhere the BIA cites its decision in <em>Burbano </em>and does not express disagreement with any part of the IJ\u2019s decision, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision in its entirety.\u201d <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc) (citation omitted). We review for substantial evidence, see <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding that Razzak\u2019s testimony concerning his persecution incident lacked sufficient detail. <em>See Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 742 (9th Cir.2007). Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Razzak testified inconsistently as to which group was persecuting him. <em>See de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393-94 (9th Cir.1997). Because these issues go to the heart of Razzak\u2019s claim, the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Li, </em>378 F.3d at 962. Accordingly, Razzak\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Because Razzak failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, it necessarily follows that he failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Because Razzak\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same evidence that the IJ found not credible, we deny the CAT claim as well. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b709-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
