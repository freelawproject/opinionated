Scher-zer (collectively, \u201cFNL\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee Elaine L. Chao, Secretary of Labor, United States Department of Labor. FNL contends that the district court erred in concluding that (1) FNL\u2019s loan officers were \u201cemployees\u201d under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 <em>et seq. (\u201cFLSA </em>\u201d), (2) FNL\u2019s loan officers were not exempt from the minimum wage provisions of the FLSA as \u201coutside salesmen,\u201d and (3) FNL failed to meet its burden of proof to refute the Secretary of Labor\u2019s back wage computations.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-22\">Having reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the applicable law and having had the benefit of oral argument, we conclude that a panel opinion further addressing the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>raised would serve no jurisprudential purpose. Therefore, on the grounds identified by the district court, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of the Secretary of Labor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
