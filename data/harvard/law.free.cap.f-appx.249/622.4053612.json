Because the parties are aware of the facts of this ease, we do not recount them here. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">\u201c[W]here a defendant has received a sentence that includes a period of supervised release, a challenge to the length of his sentence of imprisonment is not moot because the district court has discretion regarding the length of supervised release ... and can change the supervised release period.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>434 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted). Therefore, although MartinezAlmaguer\u2019s estimated release date has already passed, his sentencing appeal is not moot because Martinez-Almaguer still must serve a period of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court was clearly allowed to consider Martinezr-Almaguer\u2019s prior aggravated felony conviction during sentencing. <em>See United States v. Zepeda-Martinez, </em>470 F.3d 909, 912 (9th Cir.2006). However, Martinez-Almaguer argues that the district court erred by enhancing Martinez-Almaguer\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) due to MartinezAlmaguer\u2019s subsequent deportation because he did not admit, and a jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt, that he had been deported at any time subsequent to his aggravated felony conviction. <em>See United States v. Covian</em>\u2014Sandoval, 462 F.3d 1090, 1098 (9th Cir.2006). We need not address this issue because the record contains overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence supporting that Martinez-Almaguer was deported subsequent to his aggravated felony conviction. Thus, any district court error would be harmless. <em>See Zepeda-Martinez, </em>470 F.3d at 913-14 (holding that such error was harmless when, as in this case, the government introduced warrants of deportation which included the alien\u2019s name, signature, fingerprint, and immigration case number, as well as the name, title, and signature of the immigration officer who witnessed the removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Additionally, the district court properly determined the applicable Guideline range, listened to and considered Martinez-Almaguer\u2019s arguments concerning his history and personal characteristics, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and reached its sentencing decision by taking into account the nature and circumstances of Martinez-Almaguer\u2019s particular offense. Thus, the district court\u2019s sentencing decision was reasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).
