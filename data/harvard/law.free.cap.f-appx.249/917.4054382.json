Videla denying Bah\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Lamine Bah, </em>No. A98 641 897 (B.I.A. Sept. 12, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 641 897 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 28, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">When, as in this case, the BIA adopts \u201cthe IJ\u2019s conclusion that an asylum applicant is not credible and emphasizes particular aspects of the IJ\u2019s decision[ ], we review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s opinions.\u201d <em>Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). We review an IJ\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). Our review of credibility determinations is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>See Ming Xia Chen, </em>435 F.3d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. To the extent Bah argues that the IJ gave too much weight to a \u201cminor misstatement\u201d in making the adverse credibility determination, we disagree. Although the IJ did devote several paragraphs to addressing Bah\u2019s \u201cslip of the tongue\u201d regarding a Guinean opposition party, the IJ determined that Bah was not credible based on numerous factors, including: (1) Bah\u2019s repeated non-responsiveness throughout his testimony; (2) Bah\u2019s lack of familiarity and confusion with basic details of his own political party, including the party with which it merged and its name after merger; (3) inconsistences between the allegations of abuse in Bah\u2019s -written statement and oral testimony; (4) Bah\u2019s inability to explain adequately how he obtained his pax\u2019ty registration card or why, in his initial application, Bah presented the Asylum Office with a registration card from a different political party; and (5) other gaps and inconsistencies in Bah\u2019s testimony, such as his varying explanations for why he did not have a death certificate for his father and whether he was destroying property before one of his arrests. The IJ reasonably determined that the cumulative effect of these inconsistencies, even if some of them are arguably minor or collateral on their own, made Bah\u2019s testimony incredible. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006). Even if the IJ did place too much weight on Bah\u2019s slip of the tongue, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence and we can confidently predict that the IJ would reach the same conclusion if we were to remand on this basis. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339 (2d Cir.2006). Because the adverse credibility finding undexvnines the only record evidence of Bah\u2019s alleged past persecution or risk of future persecution, denial of Bah\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA was appropriate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Bah did not meet his burden for establishing eligibility for relief under the CAT. Although withholding of removal under the CAT must be considered independently of an applicant\u2019s claims under the INA, see <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 184-85 (2d Cir. 2004), when \u201cthe applicant relies largely on testimonial evidence to establish [his] CAT claim, and does not independently establish a probability of torture ... an adverse credibility finding regarding testimonial evidence may provide a sufficient basis for denial of CAT relief.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 340. Bah submitted documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>that report general incidents of torture and prisoner abuse in Guinea, but he offered no evidence, other than his testimony of past persecution that the IJ found incredible, that he would actually be subject to such abuse. Because the factual predicate of Bah\u2019s CAT claim was based on the same assertions that the IJ had found incredible for Bah\u2019s asylum and withholding claims, the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding under CAT was also appropriate. <em>See Paul, </em>444 F.3d at 157; <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Finally, to the extent the IJ denied Bah\u2019s asylum claims in the alternative based on a determination that Bah had established a safe haven in Canada, the government concedes that the IJ\u2019s conclusion was incorrect. However, this error does not affect our disposition because our affirmance of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding provides an independent basis for denying the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">For the foregoing reasons, petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
