After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">In 2004, Green pleaded guilty to using a firearm in connection with a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Under the terms of the plea agreement, Green was to be sentenced to the statutory term of twenty-five years imprisonment, and he waived his right to appeal the conviction or sentence except in case of, inter alia, ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">In March 2006, Green filed a pro se motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to file an appeal from the sentence despite Green\u2019s request to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ruling that a movant was entitled to an out-of-time appeal if counsel failed to file a notice of appeal when requested, the court ordered an evidentiary hearing and appointed counsel for Green. At the hearing, Green testified that he had asked counsel to file an appeal challenging his sentence. Green\u2019s former attorney responded that the two never discussed an appeal because Green received the sentence he expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">The magistrate judge found that Green\u2019s claims were not credible or supported by the record, and therefore, he was not entitled to file an out-of-time appeal. Accordingly, the magistrate judge recommended denying the \u00a7 2255 motion as barred by the statute of limitations. The district court adopted the recommendation, over Green\u2019s objections, and denied the \u00a7 2255 motion on October 2, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">On December 14, 2006, Green filed a pro se motion for extension of time to file a notice of appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion under Fed. R.App. P. (\u201cRule\u201d) 4(a)(5)(A). According to Green, he requested counsel file the notice of appeal, but counsel failed to do so. Green explained that he had been held in county jail with no access to legal materials or to counsel, and that he did not learn that his appeal had not been preserved until he was transferred to federal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-16\">The district court found that Green had not shown excusable neglect or good cause because ignorance of the law was no excuse, and Green had not shown that he attempted other means of communication in addition to telephone. Green then filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">II. Discussion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AjY\">We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding a motion for an extension of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>under Rule 4(a)(5)(A) for abuse of discretion. <em>Advanced Estimating Sys., Inc. v. Riney, </em>130 F.3d 996, 997 (11th Cir.1997). The district court will often have some range of choice in deciding excusable neglect issues. <em>Advanced Estimating Sys., Inc. v. Riney, </em>77 F.3d 1322, 1325 (11th Cir.1996) (citing <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 745 (11th Cir.1989) (observing that the abuse of discretion standard allows \u201ca range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Here, Green concedes that he did not file his notice within the time frame proscribed by Rule 4(a)(1)(B). He asserts, however, that he was deceived by his attorney and he acted with due diligence once he learned his notice of appeal had not been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The timely filing of a notice of appeal is \u201ca mandatory prerequisite to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>United States v. Grant, </em>256 F.3d 1146,1150 (11th Cir.2001). Nevertheless, Rule 4 permits the district court to extend the time to file a notice of appeal upon a party\u2019s motion if the motion is filed within thirty days of the deadline for the notice of appeal, and the party shows excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(A). As this court has explained, \u201cthe phrase \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 may include, when appropriate, late filings caused by inadvertence, mistake, or carelessness under certain circumstances.\u201d <em>Locke v. SunTrust Bank, Inc., </em>484 F.3d 1343, 1346 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Advanced Estimating Sys., </em>77 F.3d at 1324). When analyzing a claim of excusable neglect, courts should \u201ctak[e] account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the party\u2019s omission,\u201d including \u201cthe danger of prejudice to the [nonmovant], the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the movant acted in good faith.\u201d <em>Advanced Estimating Sys., </em>77 F.3d at 1325 (citing <em>Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>507 U.S. 380, 395, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 1498, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993)). \u201cPrimary importance should be accorded to the absence of prejudice to the nonmoving party and to the interest of efficient judicial administration.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. Green asserted that his notice of appeal was untimely because counsel did not file it as requested, Green did not know of the time limitations, and he was unable to communicate with counsel. We note that Green\u2019s argument is the same as his claim in the underlying \u00a7 2255 motion \u2014 that is, that counsel failed to file a notice of appeal upon Green\u2019s request. In light of this, Green should have had sufficient experience with the legal system to know how and when to file a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the court had discretion in its decision, and could consider a wide range of choices, it cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>said that the district court abused its discretion. For these reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-11\">. As the Supreme Court has held, \u201cwhen counsel's constitutionally deficient performance deprives a defendant of an appeal that he otherwise would have taken, the defendant has made out a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim entitling him to an appeal.\u201d <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AX3\">. We recognize that it is an open question whether Green needs a certificate of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d) to bring this issue before this court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (\"Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>appealability, an appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d). Because we conclude on the merits that the district court did not abuse its discretion, we decline to address whether the court's decision was a \u201cfinal order\u201d requiring a COA. <em>Compare Hubbard v. Campbell, </em>379 F.3d 1245 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that a COA was not required to appeal an order dismissing the petitioner\u2019s \u201cAmended Petition\u201d relating back to the original habeas petition), <em>with Pagan v. United States, </em>353 F.3d 1343 (11 th Cir.2003) (concluding that an order denying or granting bond in post-convictions relief proceedings required a COA to appeal under the collateral order doctrine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b135-11\">. This court has held that an attorney\u2019s error based on a misunderstanding of the law did not constitute excusable neglect. <em>Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 1111, 1115 (11th Cir. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
