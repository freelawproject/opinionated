Fischer challenges his conviction and sentence for participating in a continuing criminal enterprise (\u201cCCE\u201d). <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848. He argues that his conviction was contrary to the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), and newly discovered evidence establishes his actual innocence. Fischer contends that he is entitled to habeas relief under section 2241 based on the savings clause of section 2255. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2255. Because the district court correctly concluded that the savings clause of section 2255 does not apply to Fischer\u2019s petition, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-22\">The availability of habeas corpus relief under section 2241 is a question of law we review <em>de novo. Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005). Under the \u201c \u2018savings clause\u2019 of [section] 2255 ... a prisoner [may] file a [section] 2241 petition only if an otherwise available remedy under [section] 2255 is \u2018inadequate or ineffective\u2019 to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. We have held that the savings clause applies to a claim only when \u201c1) that claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; 2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, 3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first [section] 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). If a prisoner qualifies for the savings clause, the proper inquiry is whether the petitioner can establish actual innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-23\">The only <em>Wofford </em>requirement at issue is whether Fischer was convicted for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>nonexistent offense. Fischer argues that, because <em>Richardson </em>changed the elements of his offense, he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Fischer\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363 (11th Cir.2003). We expressly held in <em>Sawyer </em>that \u201ca <em>Richardson </em>claim is not the type of defect that opens the portal to a [section] 2241 proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1366. We explained that \u201c[t]he conduct necessary to [establish] a CCE offense is the same <em>post-Richardson.\u201d Id. \u201cRichardson </em>clarified the standard by which a jury must find a defendant guilty of a CCE offense, but it did not invalidate CCE offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although Fischer correctly observes that his appeal differs from <em>Sawyer </em>because, unlike the defendant in <em>Sawyer, </em>Fischer did not have any substantive convictions that provided assurance that the jurors unanimously agreed on the specific violations underlying his CCE conviction, our statement in <em>Sawyer </em>that <em>Richardson </em>claims do not open the portal to section 2241 proceedings was unqualified. The district court correctly dismissed Fischer\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Fischer\u2019s argument that his claim of actual innocence should open the gateway to a section 2241 petition is also unavailing. In <em>Wofford, </em>we explained that a claim of actual innocence claims is considered after the portal to a section 2241 proceeding is opened. 177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3. A claim of actual innocence is not an exception to the requirement that a petitioner first qualify under <em>Wofford </em>for the savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The denial of Fischer\u2019s petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
