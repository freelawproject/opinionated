We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"aja-dedup-0\">The BIA acted within its discretion in denying Gonzalez Hernandez\u2019s motion as untimely because it was filed over one year after the BIA\u2019s final removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (requiring motion to reopen to be filed within ninety days of the final administrative removal). Gonzalez Hernandez did not show grounds for equitable tolling where he offered no evidence to rebut the transmittal letter attached to the August 2004 order, indicating that the order was mailed to his address of record. <em>See Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (explaining that filing deadline may be equitably tolled \u201cwhen a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error,\u201d as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence).</p>\n<p id=\"AhV\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED,</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"AKa\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
