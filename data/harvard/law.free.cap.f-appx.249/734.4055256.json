We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">Ms. Flaherty alleges disability since March 5, 2002, due to complications from an on-the-job injury in November 2001 in which she was caught in the closing doors of an elevator. She was previously found to be disabled based on an October 1996 application. In 2000, her disability ended. She received a post-secondary education and then worked as a medical assistant and a receptionist. She does not assert that her present claim relates back to her previous disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-17\">Ms. Flaherty contends that the following conditions have rendered her disabled: migraine, degenerative joint disease, fibromyalgia, pain syndrome, limitations in the use of her upper extremities, sleep disorder or sleep apnea, affective disorder, chronic depression, obesity, diabetes, and peripheral neuropathy. An administrative law judge (ALJ) held a hearing at which Ms. Flaherty, her neighbor, and a vocational expert testified. The ALJ determined that Ms. Flaherty retained the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform her past relevant work as a receptionist. Accordingly, he denied benefits at step four of the five-part sequential evaluation process. <em>See Fischer-Ross v. Barnhart, </em>431 F.3d 729, 731 (10th Cir. 2005) (describing five steps).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-18\">The Appeals Council denied Ms. Flaherty\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner. <em>Jensen v. Barnhart, </em>436 F.3d 1163, 1164 (10th Cir.2005). The district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Ms. Flaherty now appeals to this court, asserting that (1) the ALJ did not properly assess her RFC because he did not find that her migraines were severe, (2) the ALJ failed to consider the combined impact of all of her impairments, (3) the ALJ failed to develop the record to establish the onset date of her disabling migraines, and (4) the ALJ erred in find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>ing that she could return to her past relevant work as a receptionist.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The parties do not dispute that the date Ms. Flaherty was last insured for disability benefits was December 31, 2002. Her last day of work was March 5, 2002. Therefore, she must establish disability between March 5, 2002 and December 31, 2002, the \u201crelevant period.\u201d <em>See Henrie v. United States Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>13 F.3d 359, 360 (10th Cir.1993) (stating claimant must establish onset of disability prior to date insured status expired).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">\n<em>Legal Framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to ascertain whether it is supported by substantial evidence in the record and to evaluate whether he applied the correct legal standards. <em>Grogan v. Barnhart, </em>399 F.3d 1257, 1261 (10th Cir.2005). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do not reweigh the evidence or retry the case, but we \u201cmeticulously examine the record as a whole, including anything that may undercut or detract from the ALJ\u2019s findings in order to determine if the substantiality test has been met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In this context, \u201cdisability\u201d requires both an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity\u201d and \u201ca physical or mental impairment, which provides reason for the inability.\u201d <em>Barnhart v. Walton, </em>535 U.S. 212, 217, 122 S.Ct. 1265, 152 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). The impairment must be a \u201c \u2018medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months....\u2019\u201d <em>Fischer-Ross, </em>431 F.3d at 731 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">\n<em>Migraine Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">We first address Ms. Flaherty\u2019s claim that the ALJ erred in finding that her migraines were not severe. She relies on a report dated December 7, 2002, prepared by Dr. Van de Graaff following a consultative evaluation, as well as her own reports to various medical providers that headaches were among her complaints. Dr. Van de Graaff stated that Ms. Flaherty had \u201climitations in her ability to hold down gainful employment secondary to her recurrent and severe migraines, which are not optimally treated at this time.\u201d R. Vol. I, at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">The ALJ gave no weight to Dr. Van de Graaff s opinion that Ms. Flaherty\u2019s migraines were disabling because he did not have a treating relationship with her, he based his opinion on a single, subjective report given to him by Ms. Flaherty, and his opinion was not supported by the evidence of record. We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s reasons for not crediting Dr. Van de Graaffs opinion are in accordance with the governing regulation and case law. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d) (listing factors to be considered when \u201cdeciding the weight [to be given] to any medical opinion\u201d); <em>White v. Barnhart, </em>287 F.3d 903, 908 (10th Cir.2001) (stating sufficient reasons to disregard physician\u2019s opinion included lack of support for findings, opinion was inconsistent with other medical opinions, and treatment relationship with claimant was relatively brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">The ALJ considered both Ms. Flaherty\u2019s reports to medical sources during the relevant period and her testimony at the hearing. R. Vol. I, at 54. He concluded that her claims of \u201cincapacitating migraines [were] not credible to the extent and severity alleged during the relevant period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He noted that none of her treating sources diagnosed her with migraine syn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>drome and she had not been prescribed medication for migraine. These were appropriate factors for assessing credibility. <em>See Barnett v. Apfel, </em>231 F.3d 687, 690 (10th Cir.2000) (discussing factors to evaluate credibility). Moreover, \u201cthe mere presence of a condition is not sufficient to make a step-two [severity] showing.\u201d <em>Williamson v. Barnhart, </em>350 F.3d 1097, 1100 (10th Cir.2003). To the extent Ms. Flaherty claims she could not afford treatment for her migraines, the record indicates that she had health insurance during at least part of the relevant period, R. Vol. I, at 188 (claimant reported that she had insurance as of July 2002), and she did not testify during the hearing that a lack of finances was the reason she did not receive treatment for her migraines. Therefore, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Ms. Flaherty\u2019s migraines were not a severe impairment. We note that even though he did not find this to be a severe impairment, the ALJ nevertheless considered her symptoms of headaches in his RFC determination. <em>Id. </em>at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\n<em>Combination of Impairments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Ms. Flaherty also argues that the ALJ failed to consider the combined impact of all of her impairments. She further maintains that the ALJ did not accord enough weight to her fibromyalgia and that he placed undue weight on the opinion of a State agency physician who did not examine her.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">At step four, the ALJ must consider whether the claimant\u2019s \u201cimpairment or combination of impairments prevents [her] from performing [her] past work.\u201d <em>Grogan, </em>399 F.3d at 1261 (quotation omitted); <em>accord </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(e). The ALJ stated that he considered all of her symptoms in assessing her RFC. R. Yol. I, at 55. \u201c[0]ur general practice, which we see no reason to depart from here, is to take a lower tribunal at its word when it declares that it has considered a matter.\u201d <em>Hackett v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1168, 1173 (10th Cir.2005). Furthermore, the ALJ\u2019s discussion of the evidence and his reasons for his conclusions demonstrate that he considered all of Ms. Flaherty\u2019s impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">The non-examining physician\u2019s opinion is an acceptable medical source, which the ALJ was entitled to consider. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">Ms. Flaherty asks us to reweigh the non-examining physician\u2019s opinion and the effect of her fibromyalgia. \u201c[0]ur limited scope of review precludes this court from reweighing the evidence or substituting our judgment for that of the [Commissioner].\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>961 F.2d 1495, 1500 (10th Cir.1992). Because the record reflects that the ALJ considered Ms. Flaherty\u2019s impairments in combination, we will not disturb his determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">\n<em>Duty to Develop Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">Ms. Flaherty next contends that the ALJ failed to develop the record to establish the onset date of her disabling migraines. In a social security disability case, the claimant bears the burden to prove her disability. <em>Hawkins v. Chater, </em>113 F.3d 1162, 1164 (10th Cir.1997). Disability hearings are nonadversarial, however, and the ALJ has a duty \u201cto ensure that an adequate record is developed during the disability hearing consistent with the issues raised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThis duty to develop the record pertains even if the claimant is represented by counsel.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Sullivan, </em>987 F.2d 1482, 1492 (10th Cir.1993). \u201cOrdinarily, the claimant must in some fashion raise the issue sought to be developed which, on its face, must be substantial. Specifically, the claimant has the burden to make sure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>there is, in the record, evidence sufficient to suggest a reasonable possibility that a severe impairment exists.\u201d <em>Hawkins, </em>113 F.3d at 1167 (citations omitted). If she does so, then the ALJ\u2019s duty to order a consultative examination arises. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIsolated and unsupported comments by the claimant are insufficient, by themselves, to raise the suspicion of the existence of a nonexertional impairment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Ms. Flaherty argues that the ALJ\u2019s duty to develop the record arose from the \u201cconflict or ambiguity in the record\u201d concerning whether she had been diagnosed with migraines or whether she had been treated for them. Aplt. Op. Br. at 12. This is not the standard. The ALJ was not required to develop the record because Ms. Flaherty failed to adduce evidence of a reasonable possibility that her migraines were a severe impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Ms. Flaherty also claims the ALJ should have considered Dr. Setty\u2019s April 2003 records and migraine diagnosis. She points to no opinion, however, relating her April 2003 condition to the relevant period \u2014 March 5, 2002 to December 31, 2002. Therefore, this evidence did not create a duty to develop the record. <em>Cf. Potter v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>905 F.2d 1346, 1348-49 (10th Cir.1990) (noting that physician may provide retrospective diagnosis of condition, but evidence of actual disability during insured period is required).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">\n<em>RFC Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Finally, Ms. Flaherty claims that the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination was flawed because it did not take into account Dr. Van de Graaffs manipulative limitations. She claims she could not perform the frequent handling required of the receptionist position. The ALJ rejected Dr. Van de Graaffs limitations on handling and grasping because the limitations were not only contrary to the other evidence in the record, but also contrary to Dr. Van de Graaffs own examination findings. As discussed above, these were legitimate reasons for rejecting Dr. Van de Graaffs opinion. Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b761-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
