(\u201cScottsdale\u201d) and Katy Insurance Agency, Inc. (\u201cKaty\u201d) on claims arising from a dispute over insurance proceeds for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>property losses after a fire at a leased restaurant. The insured lessee of the Taste of Katy restaurant (Parvin Shahinp-our), the owner of the premises and the insured\u2019s landlord (Mason Park), and a judgment creditor (Burke Orr), all sought to be paid proceeds following the fire under a Scottsdale policy issued to Shahinp-our (\u201cthe Policy\u201d). Holding that Mason Park is not covered under the Policy, the district court granted summary judgment to Scottsdale and against Mason Park on Mason Park\u2019s breach of contract claim, and it dismissed Mason Park\u2019s extra-contractual claims against Scottsdale. Separately, the court granted summary judgment to Katy, Shahinpour\u2019s insurance agent, on Mason Park\u2019s extra-contractual claims against Katy. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">1. We review the district court\u2019s grants of summary judgment de novo. <em>Texas Indus., Inc. v. Factory Mut. Ins. Co., </em>486 F.3d 844, 846 (5th Cir. 2007). Summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In a diversity case such as this one, state substantive law applies. <em>Abraham v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>465 F.3d 609, 611 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78-80, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938)). All parties agree that Texas law applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">2. The Policy issued to Shahinpour contained two separate coverage parts: a Commercial Property Coverage Part (covering business personal property and business interruption losses) and a Commercial General Liability Coverage Part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mason Park contends both parts covered its property losses incurred during the fire. Under Texas contract law, \u201c [i]f policy language is worded so that it can be given a definite or certain legal meaning, it is not ambiguous and we construe it as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, </em>124 S.W.3d 154, 157 (Tex.2003). The fact that the parties offer different contract interpretations does not create an ambiguity. \u201cAn ambiguity exists only if the contract language is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">A review of the Policy reveals that Mason Park was not covered under the property coverage part. The loss payable provision, which modified the property coverage part, originally stated that the name and address of the loss payee was \u201cto follow.\u201d Nothing in the loss payable provision or anywhere else gave Scottsdale notice that Mason Park was the intended loss payee. The loss payable provision was properly cancelled by a change endorsement order prior to the fire. Contrary to Mason Park\u2019s argument, because Mason Park was never identified as the loss payee, Scottsdale was under no obligation to give Mason Park notice of the cancellation. And because nothing in the property coverage part indicates that Mason Park is a loss payee, an additional insured, or otherwise has coverage, it cannot recover under the property coverage part.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Mason Park\u2019s claim that its losses are covered under the Policy\u2019s liability coverage part also fails. Commercial li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>ability coverage is triggered when the insured is \u201clegally obligated to pay damages,\u201d such as when the insured is subject to \u201clegal liability\u201d recognized and enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction. 7A Couch on Insurance \u00a7 103:14 (3d ed.2005); <em>see Data Specialties, Inc. v. Trancon. Ins. Co., </em>125 F.3d 909, 911 (5th Cir.1997). All parties agree that Mason Park was added as an additional insured under the Policy\u2019s liability coverage part. However, this coverage does not extend to the fire damage caused to Mason Park\u2019s property. The liability coverage part obligates Scottsdale to pay the insured \u201cthose sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury5 or \u2018property damages\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d It does not mandate that Scottsdale pay Mason Park to compensate for its property losses as a result of the fire. Mason Park\u2019s attempts to twist the language of the Policy to create the appearance of coverage are without merit. Because the Policy did not cover Mason Park for the damages the fire caused, the district court properly granted summary judgment to Scottsdale.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">3. Mason Park also argues that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment to Scottsdale on Mason Park\u2019s claims under the Texas Insurance Code, under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDTPA\u201d), and for breach of the common law duty of good faith and fair dealing. Mason Park\u2019s evidence for these claims relates to its rejected insurance claim and Scottsdale\u2019s conduct during its investigation of the fire. We have already held that Scottsdale appropriately rejected Mason Park\u2019s insurance claim. Furthermore, the district court properly found that there is no evidence related to Scottsdale\u2019s investigation of Mason Park\u2019s claim indicating any wrongful act or bad faith. Therefore, the district court correctly rejected Mason Park\u2019s common law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The district court also properly rejected Mason Park\u2019s statutory claims. Mason Park brought a claim under former Article 21.55 of the Texas Insurance Code, recodified as Section 542.055,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which relates to the prompt investigation and paying of claims. Summary judgment for Scottsdale under former Article 21.55 is appropriate because Mason Park did not have a valid claim under the Policy, and the evidence does not reveal any improper delay in investigating Mason Park\u2019s insurance claim. Mason Park\u2019s claims under the former Article 21.55 of the Texas Insurance Code and the DTPA were properly dismissed. To recover under these provisions, Texas law requires that an insured show that it is entitled to recover for a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. <em>Crawford v. GuideOne Mnt. Ins. Co., </em>420 F.Supp.2d 584, 599 (N.D.Tex.2006). Mason Park has not done that.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">4. Mason Park also brought claims against Katy under former Article 21.21 of the Texas Insurance Code and Articles 17.46 and 17.50 of the DTPA. The entirety of the relationship between Katy, Shahinpour\u2019s insurance agent, and Mason Park consists of a Certificate of Liability Insurance (\u201cCOI\u201d) that Katy provided to Mason Park and that accu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>rately reflected Shahinpour\u2019s insurance coverage and named Mason Park as a \u201cCertificate Holder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Mason Park cannot recover on its statutory claims against Katy because it has not provided even a scintilla of evidence that Katy made a misrepresentation to it. \u201cIn the absence of some specific misrepresentation by the insurer or agent about the insurance, a policyholder\u2019s mistaken belief about the scope or availability of coverage is not generally not actionable under the DTPA.\u201d <em>Sledge v. Mullin, </em>927 S.W.2d 89, 94 (Tex.App.Fort Worth 1996, no writ). For the same reason, a claim based solely on a mistaken belief generally fails under the Texas Insurance Code. <em>Moore v. Whitney-Vaky Ins. Agency, </em>966 S.W.2d 690, 692-98 (Tex.App.San Antonio 1998, no writ). The COI here accurately reflected the terms of the Policy and the fact that Mason Park was only a \u201cCertificate Holder.\u201d And there is nothing in the COI identifying Mason Park as an additional insured under the property coverage part of the Policy. In this case, the COI clearly states that it is provided for information only and that it does not alter the terms of the Policy, which further undercuts Mason Park\u2019s claims. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Katy was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
