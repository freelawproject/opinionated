The first of these orders dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the second denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review. In a nutshell, Plaintiffs are physicians on the faculty of State University of New York (\u201cSUNY\u201d) Stony Brook School of Medicine who also work as clinicians at the Stony Brook University Hospital, and whose income as clinicians is managed and distributed by the Stony Brook Clinical Practice Management Plan (\u201cCPMP\u201d). They allege mismanagement and shortchanging by the CPMP, and bring suit under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\u201cLMRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, against United University Professions (\u201cUnion\u201d) and various SUNY and CPMP entities and officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">Plaintiffs challenge the District Court\u2019s dismissal of their complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-14\">We review the District Court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Raila v. United States, </em>355 F.3d 118, 119 (2d Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-15\">Generally, a union employee must exhaust the grievance remedies provided in the collective bargaining agreement before bringing suit against the employer. If, however, the union breaches its duty of fair representation in the grievance proceeding, the employee can sue both the union and the employer, notwithstanding the failure to exhaust the grievance procedures. In such a hybrid LMRA claim, Plaintiffs must show a breach of duty by both. <em>DelCostello v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 164-65, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-16\">The LMRA does not confer federal jurisdiction over labor disputes among states, their employees, and the unions who represent them. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2) (defining \u201cemployer\u201d to exclude entities that are either a \u201cState or political subdivision thereof\u2019); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 152(3) (defining \u201cemployee\u201d as only those who work for employers, <em>ie., </em>not a state or its political subdivision); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 152(5) (defining \u201clabor organization\u201d as one in which \u201cemployees\u201d participate for the purpose of dealing with \u201cemployers\u201d). Therefore, for federal jurisdiction to extend to Plaintiffs\u2019 hybrid claim, Plaintiffs must show that [1] they work for an \u201cemployer\u201d \u2014 that is, an entity that is not a \u201cpolitical subdivision of the State,\u201d and [2] they participate in a \u201clabor organization\u201d that deals with that employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-17\">Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the second of these requirements. According to the Complaint, the Union represents \u201cnearly 28,000 academic and professional faculty at 29 State-operated SUNY campuses.\u201d (emphasis added). The Union acts as \u201cthe exclusive bargaining representative with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>respect to salaries, wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment\u201d for those within the <em>\u201cState </em>University Professional Services Negotiating Unit, including Plaintiffs.\u201d (emphasis added). And <em>\u201c[a]s professors at SUNY Stony Brook, </em>Plaintiffs are employees in the <em>State </em>University Professional Services Negotiating Unit.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">This case is thus distinguishable from <em>London v. Polishook, </em>189 F.3d 196 (2d Cir.1999), in which we decided a similar jurisdictional question arising under section 102 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 412, a statute that defines \u201cemployee,\u201d \u201cemployer,\u201d and \u201clabor organization\u201d in a manner that, for present purposes, is identical to those terms\u2019 definitions in the LMRA. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 402(e), (f), (i). In that case, we held that the district court erred in dismissing the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. There, however, the plaintiffs alleged and provided supporting facts tending to show that the union represented some of its members in their capacity as employees of a private employer, and moreover, the employees of the private employer were not also employees of an exempt political subdivision. <em>London, </em>189 F.3d at 199. Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs have neither alleged nor provided facts to support an argument that the Union represents Plaintiffs in them capacity as employees of the CPMP entities, and all of the alleged employees of the CPMP entities are, Plaintiffs concede, also employees of SUNY. Plaintiffs further concede that SUNY is a political subdivision of New York State and therefore is not an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of the LMRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Moreover, the collective bargaining agreement Plaintiffs seek to enforce was negotiated and entered into exclusively by the Union and SUNY. We agree with the District Court that the Union\u2019s duties under the agreement \u2014 including grievances against the CPMP defendants \u2014 arise from its representation of Plaintiffs as public employees, and the Union thus does not constitute a \u201clabor organization\u201d for purposes of the LMRA. Accordingly, the District Court lacks jurisdiction over this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
