In brief, Youmans pled guilty to a single count under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) after New Haven police officers seized a nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol from him. The plea agreement stipulated that, for purposes of the Guidelines, Youmans\u2019s offense level was 23 and Youmans\u2019s criminal history was Category VI, resulting in a Guidelines sentencing range of 92 to 115 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-18\">At sentencing, Youmans moved for a downward departure or, in the alternative, a non-Guidelines sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.3 and <em>United States v. Brady, </em>417 F.3d 326, 334 (2d Cir.2005). The District Court sentenced Youmans to a 92-month prison term, the bottom end of the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-19\">Youmans challenges his sentence on two scores. First, he argues that because he presented a factually and legally sufficient request for a below- or non-Guidelines sentence, it was procedurally unreasonable for the District Court not to detail its reasoning for rejecting that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-20\">This circuit has never imposed such a requirement on district courts. \u201c[W]e entertain a strong presumption that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>sentencing judge has considered all arguments properly presented to her, unless the record clearly suggests otherwise.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 29 (2d Cir.2006), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 192, 166 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006) . This presumption prevents district court judges from having to engage in \u201c \u2018robotic incantations\u2019 ... to prove the of consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30 (quoting <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 113 (2d Cir.2005)). \u201c[A] sentencing judge\u2019s decision not to discuss explicitly the sentencing factors [under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] or not to review them in the exact language of the statute does not, without more, overcome the presumption that she took them all properly into account.\u201d <em>United States v. Pereira, </em>465 F.3d 515, 523 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The Supreme Court recently observed in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) , that \u201c[wjhere the defendant ... presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence\u201d \u2014 that is, a non-Guidelines sentence or a sentence that departs from the Guidelines range \u2014 \u201cthe judge will normally ... explain why he has rejected those arguments. Sometimes the circumstances will call for a brief explanation; sometimes they will call for a lengthier explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2468. We find that, in the circumstances of this case, the District Court\u2019s explanation for imposing a 92-month sentence was adequate. \u201cWhere a matter is as conceptually simple as in the case at hand and the record makes clear\u201d \u2014 as it does here \u2014 \u201cthat the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments, we do not believe the law requires the judge to write more extensively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2469. Moreover, our review of the sentencing proceedings confirms that the District Court fulfilled its obligation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c); the court considered Youmans\u2019s particular characteristics-his need for both deterrence and rehabilitation-and provided a sufficient explanation of its sentencing rationale</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">Second, Youmans argues that the District Court\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable because the Guidelines range was treated as the presumptive sentence. This argument likewise fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4) requires a district court to consider the applicable Guidelines range when fashioning a sentence. Moreover, the Guidelines are more than simply \u201canother factor\u201d for the District Court to consider. <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 133 (2d Cir.2006) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Although we have not presumed that a sentence within that range is reasonable, in the \u201coverwhelming majority of cases a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27. Here, the District Court decided on a sentence of 92 months\u2019 imprisonment, the very bottom of the applicable Guidelines range. Given the facts and circumstances of this ease, we cannot conclude that this sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
