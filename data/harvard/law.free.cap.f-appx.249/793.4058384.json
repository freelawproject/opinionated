Young, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the denial of his <em>pro se </em>motion for resentencing, brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3664(o)(2) and 3565, and through which he challenged the district court\u2019s entry of an amended judgment in 2002 that clarified the procedure through which he should fulfill his restitution obligation related to his 1995 convictions for carjacking, kidnaping, and firearms charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">Young argues on appeal that the district court lacked jurisdiction to amend his original judgment several years after his original judgment was entered. The government argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of Young\u2019s resentencing motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">We must resolve jurisdictional issues before we address the merits of the underlying claims. <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 93-102, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 1012-16, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). We review a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Makone v. Ray, </em>326 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">As an initial matter, a crucial part of Young\u2019s argument is his assertion that the district court did not have jurisdiction to amend his judgment several years after the court entered the original judgment. Because Young failed to file a direct appeal of the district court\u2019s amended judgment, we may not now review that judgment, and our scope of review is limited to whether Young could move for resentencing pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3664(o)(2) and 3565. <em>See United States v. Machado, </em>465 F.3d 1301, 1305-06 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">Regarding Young\u2019s assertion that his motion could be brought through \u00a7\u00a7 3664(o)(2) and 3565, we note that the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (\u201cVWPA\u201d), Pub.L.No. 97-291, 96 Stat. 1248, was amended substantially by the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (\u201cMVRA\u201d), Pub.L.No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1227, which became effective on April 24, 1996. <em>See United States v. Siegel, </em>153 F.3d 1256, 1258 (11th Cir.1998). Because Young was convicted in 1995, the provisions of the MVRA are not applicable to his case. The VWPA did not include \u00a7 3664(o)(2), and, accordingly, Young may not attempt to use that subsection to attack his restitution order. <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664 (1990) <em>and </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">Additionally, even if the provisions of the MVRA did apply to Young\u2019s case, the current version of \u00a7 3664 specifically states that \u201c[njothing in this section ... shall be construed to create a cause of action not otherwise authorized in favor of any person against the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(p). Furthermore, nothing in the former restitution statute under which Young was sentenced created an independent cause of action to attack a restitution order. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663, 3663A, 3664 (1990). The other statute that Young cited in his resentencing motion, \u00a7 3565, also fails to provide him a vehicle through which he could raise this motion, as \u00a7 3565 deals entirely with the revocation of probation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Furthermore, because Young solely was attacking his order of restitution, and not his imprisonment, his resentencing motion could not have been brought as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Blaik v. United States, </em>161 F.3d 1341, 1342-43 (11th Cir. 1998). Because Young was not authorized to apply for relief from his restitution order under \u00a7 2255, he could not have brought his resentencing motion as a \u00a7 2241 petition, either. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1f5); <em>Blaik, </em>161 F.3d at 1342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Thus, we conclude from the record that the district court properly denied Young\u2019s resentencing motion because there was no procedural basis through which he could bring such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
