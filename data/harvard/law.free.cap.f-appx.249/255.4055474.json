June 30, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A97-965-351 (Im-mig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 29, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-21\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir. 2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-22\">As a preliminary matter, we dismiss the petition for review as to Liu\u2019s asylum claim. Title 8, Section 1158(a)(3) of the United States Code provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), or the agency\u2019s finding that the lateness is unexcused by changed or extraordinary circumstances under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Notwithstanding that provision, however, this Court claims jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims\u201d and \u201cquestions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Liu\u2019s arguments, which quarrel with the IJ\u2019s purely factual determinations and the IJ\u2019s exercise of discretion, raise no colorable constitutional claim or question of law. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review Liu\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The untimeliness provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2) do not apply to Liu\u2019s withholding of removal claim; we therefore review the IJ\u2019s decision as to that claim on the merits. This Court has recently determined that an alien who is the spouse, flane\u00e9, or boyfriend of an individual who was forcibly sterilized does not automatically attain refugee status on that basis alone. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 300 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(en banc). </em>Absent proof of \u201cother resistance\u201d to coercive family planning policies or well-founded fear of future persecution on account of such resistance, such aliens are ineligible for asylum. <em>Id. </em>at 309-10. It is undisputed that Liu\u2019s withholding of removal claim depends solely on his assertion that his wife was forcibly sterilized and not on the basis of any \u201cother resistance\u201d to coercive family planning policies. Therefore, he is ineligible for both asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Because Liu has failed to sufficiently argue his CAT claim before this Court, and because addressing this argument does not appear to be necessary to avoid manifest injustice, any such argument is deemed waived. See <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2005) (explaining that issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is hereby DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b283-7\"> Judge Sotomayor continues to disagree with the majority opinion in <em>Shi Liang Lin </em>to the extent it applies beyond unmarried partners, <em>see Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 327 (Sotoma-yor, J., concurring), but she is bound by court precedent, <em>see United States v. Wilkerson, </em>361 F.3d 717, 732 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
