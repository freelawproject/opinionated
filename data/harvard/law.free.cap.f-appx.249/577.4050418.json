To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss the petition for review in No. 05-76781, and deny the petition for review in No. 06-71929.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioners failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003). Petitioners\u2019 contentions that the agency failed to follow its own precedent and mis-charac-terized the evidence of hardship are not supported by the record and do not amount to colorable due process claims. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[TJraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>see also Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001) (petitioner\u2019s assertion regarding due process violation based on the \u201cmisapplication of case law\u201d may not be reviewed).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen, because the BIA considered the evidence they submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (reversing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW in OS-76781 DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW in 06-71929 DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
