Lamar appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Lerner, Sampson &amp; Rothfuss, L.P.A., rejecting her claim that the Lerner law firm violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 <em>et seq., </em>when it included the notice required under the Act with the summons and complaint that it served on her. A recent decision by another panel of our court, <em>see Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. v. Lamar, </em>503 F.3d 504 (6th Cir.2007), governs this appeal. Save for the fact that the earlier case involved a different mortgage from the one at issue here, it parallels this case in every other material respect: It involves the same primary parties, the same key facts, the same complaints and the same defenses. <em>See </em>JA 75 (district court stating that \u201cthe claims raised here are identical to those raised [in Case No. 06-4335]\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 117 n. 1 (Lamar acknowledging that the two cases present \u201cidentical issues\u201d). In the earlier case, our court affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for LS &amp; R, concluding that \u201cLS &amp; R effectively conveyed notice of Lamar\u2019s right to dispute the validity of her debt.\u201d <em>Lamar, </em>503 F.3d at 506. Because that panel\u2019s decision was filed prior to this opinion, we are bound by it. <em>See Salmi v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir.1985). Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in that panel\u2019s opinion, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
