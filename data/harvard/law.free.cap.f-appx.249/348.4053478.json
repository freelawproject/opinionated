He argues that (1) his mother\u2019s testimony was the only evidence regarding his mental state when he committed his offense and (2) the district court mistakenly believed that a downward departure based on diminished capacity required a finding of incompetence. Ware does not challenge the correctness of the district court\u2019s Guideline calculations. Because Ware has failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s imposition of a guideline sentence was unreasonable, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. </em>Villanueva, 408 F.3d 193, 202 &amp; 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). We lack jurisdiction to address whether the district court erred by denying Ware a downward departure based on his mental condition, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 policy statement. <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir. 2007), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 163, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2007). Instead, we review \u201cto determine whether the district court\u2019s imposition of a guideline sentence instead of a non-guideline sentence was reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ware\u2019s sentence within the Guidelines sentencing range is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). This presumption of reasonableness is rebutted \u201conly where the sentence falls so far afoul of one of the standards in <em>[United States v.] Smith </em>as to constitute a clear error in the court\u2019s exercise of its broad sentencing discretion.\u201d <em>Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d at 376 (discussing <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">We find no fault in the district court\u2019s decision not to give additional weight to Ware\u2019s mental condition. The Forensic Psychologist\u2019s report indicated that Ware denied experiencing any symptoms of mental illness on or around the date of his offense, was aware of the events, and could control his impulses. Further, both the police reports and Ware\u2019s own recollections failed to indicate that he experienced any significant symptoms of mental illness around the time of his offense. By finding that the evidence showed no link between Ware\u2019s mental condition and his offense, the district court provided a sufficient explanation for rejecting Ware\u2019s request for a lower sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Thus, Ware has failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s imposition of a guideline sentence was unreasonable. Finally, Ware\u2019s contention that the district court misunderstood the relevant issue about his mental health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>is without a factual basis. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

We previously vacated Ware's sentence, holding that sentencing him under mandatory, rather than advisory, sentencing guidelines was not harmless error. <em>See United States v. Ware, </em>182 Fed.Appx. 299 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b375-16\">. \"A non-Guideline sentence unreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors where it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Smith </em>440 F.3d at 708.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
