The Clerk shall file the pro se reply brief received on January 17, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">We reject Jimenez-Carrillo\u2019s contention that the admission of the warrant of deportation violated the Confrontation Clause. <em>See United States v. Bahena-Cardenas, </em>411 F.3d 1067, 1075 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Jimenez-Carrillo\u2019s argument that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based on his prior conviction is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Covian-Sandoval, </em>462 F.3d 1090, 1096 (9th Cir.2006) (permitting enhancement for a prior conviction), as is his challenge to the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), <em>see id. </em>at 1096-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We also reject the contention that the district court violated Jimenez-Carrillo\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights by imposing as a condition of supervised release a requirement that he report to the probation office within 72 hours of entering the United States. <em>See United States v. Abbouchi </em>502 F.3d 850, 859 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">In his pro se brief, Jimenez-Carrillo contends that his prior convictions under California Health and Safety Code Section 11377(a) and California Penal Code Section 273a were not aggravated felony convictions for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). Subsequent to Jimenez-Carrillo\u2019s sentencing, the Supreme Court decided <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 625, 633, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), in which it held that \u201ca state offense constitutes a \u2018felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u2019 only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law.\u201d Because Section 11377(a) does not qualify as a drug trafficking offense under <em>Lopez, </em>we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Figueroa-Ocampo, </em>494 F.3d 1211 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that <em>Lopez </em>applies to criminal sentencing). Additionally, as the government concedes, the conviction under California Penal Code Section 273a was an aggravated felony. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Castellanos, </em>287 F.3d 876, 880-881 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">In accordance with <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>222 F.3d 1057, 1062 (9th Cir. 2000), we instruct the district court to delete from any subsequent judgment the incorrect reference to \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b608-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
