We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-24\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Guzeyev\u2019s testimony was vague regarding the nature of his religious denomination. <em>See id. </em>at 1153. In addition, Guzeyev failed to mention the fact that he was beaten while detained by the government. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-63 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Because Guzeyev failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, it necessarily follows that he failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Because Guzeyev\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony that the IJ found not credible, and because he points to no other evidence that the IJ should have considered in making its CAT determination, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b625-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
