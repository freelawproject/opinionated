We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in denying Goiry\u2019s request for a mitigating role adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Generally, we review sentences imposed after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 158, 162 (2d Cir.2006). There appears to be some uncertainty regarding the standard of review we apply to a district court\u2019s decision concerning a mitigating role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Burgos, </em>324 F.3d 88, 91 n. 2 (2d Cir.2003). But we need not resolve this issue now, as Goiry\u2019s challenge fails under any standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Section 3B1.2 of the Guidelines provides for a two-level reduction in offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant was a minor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. We have recognized that \u201ca mitigating role adjustment is appropriate if the defendant is substantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d in such a crime. <em>United States v. Carpenter, </em>252 F.3d 230, 235 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant bears the burden of establishing his reduced culpability. <em>United States v. Shonubi </em>998 F.2d 84, 90 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Goiry has failed to carry that burden. The factual findings made by the district court, which Goiry does not appear to dispute and are not clearly erroneous in any event, are sufficient to establish that Goiry was not substantially less culpable than the average participant in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The court was not required, as Goiry seems to suggest, to determine the role of an average participant in a conspiracy of comparable magnitude and then assess the extent of his role against this imaginary average. \u201cIt is not [the] defendant\u2019s exact role or status in the criminal activity that necessarily decides this question; rather, it is an assessment of [the] defendant\u2019s culpability in the context of all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Furthermore, Goiry\u2019s claim that the government could not oppose his request for an adjustment based on \u201callegations specifically denied by [him] during his safety valve proffer\u201d when it had previously accepted the truthfulness of his proffer admissions is unavailing. He has failed to identify any specific statements made during the proffer that contradict facts relied on by the government or found by the district court. He has also failed to challenge the accuracy of the Probation Department\u2019s Pre-Sentence Investigation Report, whose findings support those made by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Accordingly, the sentence of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
