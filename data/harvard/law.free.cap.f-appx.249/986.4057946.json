He filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition arguing that the 225 days that he spent in a community confinement facility prior to sentencing should be credited against his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585. He also asserted that his due process rights were violated because he was not properly advised prior to electing bail that the time he spent in the facility would not count against his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Barreto\u2019s first argument is foreclosed by <em>Reno v. Koray, </em>515 U.S. 50, 58-63, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995), in which the Supreme Court held that release on bail subject to restrictions, including confinement in a community treatment facility, is not official detention for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) and does not count towards the sentence imposed. Barreto concedes as much but argues that <em>Koray </em>was unfairly decided. Nevertheless, we are bound to follow <em>Koray </em>unless and until the Supreme Court itself overrules it. <em>See Medellin v. Dretke, </em>371 F.3d 270, 280 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">We also reject Barreto\u2019s contention that due process requires notice to a pretrial detainee that confinement while released on bail rather than official detention will not count towards the sentence. That possibility is too speculative to implicate the protections of the Due Process Clause. <em>See Cucciniello v. Keller, </em>137 F.3d 721, 724-25 (2d Cir.1998); <em>see also Luken v. Scott, </em>71 F.3d 192, 193-94 (5th Cir.1995) (addressing nature of liberty interest protected by due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"aye-dedup-0\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
