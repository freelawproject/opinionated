T-Mobile opposes. PowerOasis replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">PowerOasis filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire against T-Mobile alleging patent infringement. After the district court issued its Markman order, PowerOasis moved for summary judgment of infringement. T-Mobile opposed and moved for summary judgment of nonin-fringement and invalidity on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">On March 30, 2007, 2007 WL 962937, the district court granted T-Mobile\u2019s motion for summary judgment of invalidity, rejecting PowerOasis\u2019s assertion that the claims-in-suit were entitled to the priority date of the original parent application. In doing so, the district court construed \u201ccustomer interface\u201d to determine that the subject matter claimed in the claims-in-suit extended beyond what was claimed in PowerOasis\u2019s original application. Because the district court decided the case on invalidity, it did not address either Power-Oasis\u2019s motion for summary judgment of infringement or T-Mobile\u2019s motion for summary judgment of noninfringement. The district court entered its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">PowerOasis appealed. T-Mobile then filed a cross-appeal from the March 30, 2007 order \u201ccontingent upon the Federal Circuit not affirming the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment of invalidity.\u201d Specifically, T-Mobile seeks a contingent review of the district court\u2019s construction of \u201ccustomer interface,\u201d noting the relevance of the issue on the parties\u2019 unresolved motions regarding infringement. T-Mobile further argues that allowing the cross-appeal and resolving the claim construction issue on appeal would avoid potential unnecessary litigation below, particularly in light of an alleged conflicting claim construction of \u201ccustomer interface\u201d in a separate case involving the same patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">PowerOasis moves to dismiss T-Mobile\u2019s cross-appeal. We agree that the 2007-1265, -1307 cross-appeal is improper and should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">It is only necessary and appropriate to file a cross-appeal when a party seeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or lessen the rights of its adversary under the judgment. <em>Bailey v. Dart, </em>292 F.3d 1360, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Am. Ry. Express Co., </em>265 U.S. 425, 435, 44 S.Ct. 560, 68 L.Ed. 1087 (1924)). Here, the district court\u2019s judgment is limited to validity and a ruling on infringement would not enlarge T-Mobile\u2019s rights under that judgment or lessen PowerOasis\u2019s rights. Thus, a cross-appeal to challenge unresolved infringement issues is not proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-17\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">(1) PowerOasis\u2019s motion is granted. T-Mobile\u2019s cross-appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs in 2007-1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">(3) The revised official caption is reflected above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
