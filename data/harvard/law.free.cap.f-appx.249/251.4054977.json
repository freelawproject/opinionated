We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>A grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. Beth Israel Med. Ctr. v. Horizon Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of N.J., Inc., </em>448 F.3d 573, 579 (2d Cir.2006). \u201c[Sjummary judgment is appropriate where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and, based on the undisputed facts, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Bal is the sole proprietor of a company that sells air-purifying equipment. Bal contracted with Nova to provide credit card processing services, and alleges Nova breached that contract by terminating it early, harming Bal\u2019s business. On appeal Bal principally argues that the contract\u2019s provision for early termination and related contract language were ambiguous and, when construed in the light of extrinsic evidence, either prohibited termination or raised a triable issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The contract, a standard merchant processing agreement, stated that Nova had \u201ccause for immediate termination\u201d if Bal presented \u201cexcessive activity\u201d to Nova, including \u201cchargebacks ... in excess of one percent of the average monthly dollar amount of [the merchant\u2019s] card transactions.\u201d There is no dispute that the dollar value of the charges challenged by Bal\u2019s customers exceeded the permitted percentage, and that challenges resolved in the customer\u2019s favor are counted as \u201cchargebacks.\u201d The parties dispute whether challenges resolved in Bal\u2019s favor were in fact \u201cchargebacks\u201d within the meaning of the contract. The district court correctly found the contract\u2019s language to provide unambiguously that \u201cchargebacks\u201d include all challenged charges, regardless of the reason for the challenge or its validity. When the plain meaning of the contract is clear, we do not consider extrinsic evidence and we enforce the parties\u2019 agreement as written. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. RJR Nabisco, Inc., </em>906 F.2d 884, 889 (2d Cir.1990). Because Bal\u2019s total \u201cchargebacks\u201d exceeded the permitted amount, Nova rightfully terminated the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Upon lawful termination of the contract, Nova was also within its rights to withhold funds belonging to Bal and to report his account to a credit card issuer\u2019s database of merchants terminated for cause. The contract expressly permitted Nova to create a reserve account in connection with a merchant terminated for cause, and to hold such funds for nine months after termination. It is undisputed on this record that Nova has returned these funds to Bal. The contract also expressly acknowledged that Nova was required to report a merchant\u2019s termination for cause to the credit card issuer\u2019s database.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Bal also argues that the written contract is invalid because although he signed it, Nova did not. But there is no record evidence of a separate, oral agreement or what its terms might be. So, if Bal disproves the validity of the written contract, he forfeits his claim as there is no evidence of any other agreement and there can be no breach of contract claim without a contract. <em>See R.G. Group, Inc. v. Horn &amp; Hardart Co., </em>751 F.2d 69, 75-76 (2d Cir. 1984)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Bal\u2019s attempt to use Nova\u2019s filings in the district court to impugn Nova\u2019s credibility on appeal is unavailing because the contract is unambiguous on its face. The arguments presented to this Court for the first time in Bal\u2019s reply brief are deemed waived. <em>See JP Morgan Chase Bank v. Altos Hornos de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., </em>412 F.3d 418, 428 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Finding no merit in Bal\u2019s remaining arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
