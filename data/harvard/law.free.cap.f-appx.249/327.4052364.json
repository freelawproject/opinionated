(Goodyear) in a wrongful death action alleging that Goodyear was negligent in exercising control over Trevor\u2019s training and the safety of his workplace. Trevor, who was killed in an accident while changing tires on a motor home, was employed by Prine, Inc. (Prine), a licensed dealer of Goodyear tires operating under a Dealer Agreement and a Service Mark License. The district court held as a matter of law that Goodyear had no duty to Prine\u2019s employees under its contractual arrangement with Prine. The Townsends have appealed, and we review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Wells v. Gulf Ins. Co., </em>484 F.3d 313, 315 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">In Texas, \u201c[o]ne who retains the right of control or exercises actual control over the work of an independent contractor also owes a duty of reasonable care to the contractor\u2019s employees.\u201d <em>Exxon Corp. v. Tidwell, </em>867 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex.1993); <em>see also Redinger v. Living, Inc., </em>689 S.W.2d 415, 418 (Tex.l985)(adopting the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 414 (1977)). For liability there must be \u201ca nexus between the employer\u2019s duty of care and its right of control.\u201d <em>Hoechst-Celanese Corp. v. Mendez, </em>967 S.W.2d 354, 356 (Tex.1998). The more detailed the right of control over the independent contractor\u2019s work, the greater the employer\u2019s responsibility for any resulting injuries. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-15\">The Townsends argue that the Dealer Agreement and the Service Mark License between Goodyear and Prine created in Goodyear a contractual duty to Trevor because Goodyear retained control over the work to be performed. They also contend that Goodyear\u2019s contractual responsibility to supervise and retain control over the details of Prine\u2019s work makes Goodyear vicariously liable for Prine\u2019s negligence. They further argue that Goodyear\u2019s advertising of automotive services was indicative of its control because of statements concerning the high standards of its retailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Whether an employer of an independent contractor has retained a contractual assignment of control is a question of law for the court. <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Khan, </em>138 S.W.3d 288, 292 (Tex.2004). A general contractor will be liable for an independent contractor\u2019s acts if the contract gives it \u201cthe right to control the means, methods, or details of the independent contractor\u2019s work.\u201d <em>Dow Chem. Co. v. Bright, </em>89 S.W.3d 602, 606 (Tex.2002)(internal quotation and citation omitted). \u201cFurther, the control must relate to the injury the negligence causes, and the contract must grant the contractor at least the power to direct the order in which work is to be done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The contractual provisions here provided that Goodyear had the right to ensure its automotive standards were being met and that Prine\u2019s employees were adequately trained. The contract also gave Goodyear the right to inspect the premises and to confirm equipment requirements and the availability and competence of the automotive technicians. Prine, as the licensee, agreed to effect any changes deemed necessary by Goodyear to bring the automotive service work in line with industry standards. The Townsends argue that there is no evidence Goodyear inspected Prine\u2019s equipment or the capabilities of Prine\u2019s employees. The focus of the contract, however, is Goodyear\u2019s general right of control over Prine\u2019s operations in relation to the quality and standards of service of the automotive work rather than the specific right of control over the safety and training of Prine\u2019s employees. <em>See Exxon Corp., </em>867 S.W.2d at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The contract specifically provided that Prine was required to \u201cmaintain adequate equipment, tools, and trained personnel\u201d and that Prine would provide its personnel with training in accord with Goodyear\u2019s general requirements. Goodyear did not promulgate specific safety requirements, nor was it required to do so by any contractual provision. Although Goodyear required that Prine\u2019s employees be trained and offered training programs, Prine was not required to use Goodyear\u2019s services, and the contract did not specify which employees would be trained. \u201c[Mjerely exercising or retaining a general right to recommend a safe manner for the independent contractor\u2019s employees to perform their work is not enough\u201d to establish liability. <em>Koch Refining Co. v. Chapa, </em>11 S.W.3d 153, 155 (Tex.1999); <em>see also Shell Oil Co., </em>138 S.W.3d at 293 (\u201ca contracting party\u2019s right to order work stopped or fire an independent contractor for non-compliance does not create liability for everything the independent contractor does (or fails to do)\u201d). The contract here did not provide for Goodyear to train Prine\u2019s employees, and it did not provide Goodyear with supervision of the specific methods and means of Prine\u2019s operations which caused Trevor Townsend\u2019s unfortunate injuries. <em>See Dow Chem. Co., </em>89 S.W.3d at 606; <em>Exxon Corp., </em>867 S.W.2d at 23. The district court correctly determined that Goodyear did not have a duty to Trevor as Prine\u2019s employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
