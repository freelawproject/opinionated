Corp. v. United States, </em>No. 02-704C (Fed.Cl. Oct. 3, 2006). Based on our disposition of nearly identical claims by other parties, we <em>affirm, </em>the dismissal of claims relating to the price adjustment clause, but reverse dismissal and remand claims relating to the government\u2019s small business and minority set-aside programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">As this court held in <em>ConocoPhillips v. United States, </em>501 F.3d 1374 (Fed.Cir. 2007), the parties\u2019 use of the Petroleum Marketing Monthly (\u201cPMM\u201d) did not violate regulations or contract provisions. Specifically, PMM accurately reflected market price as conceived by the contract, the use of PMM was not a mistake by either party, and the government did not breach the contract by failing to pay fair market value for the fuel Tesoro supplied. Further, use of PMM was consistent with the governing regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Contrary to the disposition by the Court of Federal Claims, however, that court does have jurisdiction over Tesoro\u2019s claims that the government\u2019s program preferring minority suppliers violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Because the minority preference program allegedly affected the contract price, the Court of Federal Claims must consider the merits of Tesoro\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Tesoro\u2019s claims based on use of the PMM, but reverse the dismissal of claims based on the government\u2019s minority preference policy and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
