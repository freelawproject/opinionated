We deny Nyambariga\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-20\">We review for substantial evidence, a standard of review under which BIA factual findings are \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Setiadi v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 710, 713 (8th Cir.2006) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). An IJ\u2019s decision denying asylum will be upheld \u201cunless \u2018the evidence ... presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-21\">An applicant who is found to have suffered past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). Both the IJ and the BIA found Nyambariga failed to prove he suffered past persecution. Even if we assume Nyambariga suffered past persecution, the presumption he has a well-founded fear of future persecution is re-buttable, if there is a finding by the preponderance of the evidence that \u201c[t]here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in the applicant\u2019s country of nationality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 208.13(b)(1 )(i)(A). The record supports the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s decisions that a fundamental change in circumstances occurred when former Kenya President Moi was voted out of office in December 2002. Finding substantial evidence in the record as a whole supporting the agency\u2019s judgment, and no error of law, we deny Nyam-bariga\u2019s petition for review. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-22\">Petitioner\u2019s motion to hold proceedings in abeyance is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
