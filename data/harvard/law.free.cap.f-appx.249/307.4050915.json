He was sentenced to seventy-eight months of imprisonment, to be followed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>four years of supervised release. On appeal, Comparan\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising five issues but stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal. The Government declined to file a brief; Comparan, advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, has done so, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Counsel for Comparan first seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress. In view of Comparan\u2019s valid guilty plea, he has waived all antecedent nonjurisdictional defects, <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>992 F.2d 489, 490 (4th Cir.1993), including his Fourth Amendment claim. Counsel next claims that the district court erred in considering the Government\u2019s response to Comparan\u2019s objections to the presentence report. This claim is patently without merit, particularly in light of trial counsel\u2019s concession that Comparan was not prejudiced by any delay on the part of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Third, counsel for Comparan challenges the district court\u2019s application of a guidelines enhancement. Under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2005), a defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased two levels \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). \u201cThe adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) cmt. n. 3. \u201cIn order to prove that a weapon was present, the Government need show only that the weapon was possessed during the relevant illegal drug activity.\u201d <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s determination that a firearm or other weapon was present and justifies the enhancement is a factual question that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Apple, </em>915 F.2d 899, 914 (4th Cir.1990). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court did not err in enhancing Com-paran\u2019s sentence under this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Counsel also challenges whether the district court acted unreasonably in denying Comparan a four-point reduction based on his minimal role in the offense. A defendant has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that he had a minimal or minor role in the offense. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 202 (4th Cir.1999). A defendant may receive a four-level reduction for being a minimal participant if he is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4. This level of culpability is shown by \u201cthe defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others ... \u201d <em>Id. </em>A two-level reduction may be made when a defendant is a minor participant, that is, one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">In deciding whether the defendant played a minor or minimal role, the \u201ccritical inquiry is not just whether the defendant has done fewer \u2018bad acts\u2019 than his co-defendants, but whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is material or essential to committing the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Pratt, </em>239 F.3d 640, 646 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Role adjustments are determined on the basis of the defendant\u2019s relevant conduct. <em>United States v. Fells, </em>920 F.2d 1179, 1183-84 (4th Cir.1990). The district court in this case denied the minimal role reduction, finding \u201cno evidence to support a minimal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>or minor role in connection with the crime,\u201d and this finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Finally, counsel questions whether the district court acted unreasonably in denying an additional one-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3El.l(b). However, this adjustment may only be made upon formal motion by the Government at the time of sentencing. USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 6. In this case, there was no such motion. Therefore, as the district court noted, Comparan was not eligible for the third point reduction, and this claim entitles him to no relief. <em>United States v. Chase, </em>466 F.3d 310, 315 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Com-paran asserts that appellate counsel was ineffective for filing an <em>Anders </em>brief. This claim is not cognizable on direct appeal. To allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant must bring such claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Here, the record does not conclusively establish that Com-paran\u2019s appellate counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Comparan\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Comparan, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Comparan requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Comparan. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
