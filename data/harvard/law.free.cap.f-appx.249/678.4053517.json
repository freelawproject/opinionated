He claims that his Confrontation Clause rights were violated when the trial court admitted a tape-recorded statement by a non-testifying co-defendant made during a jailhouse telephone call to a friend. Because the state courts\u2019 denial of this claim was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law and because the state courts\u2019 determination of the facts was not unreasonable based on the evidence presented to it, we affirm. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Saechao argues that the admission of the statement violated <em>Cranford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). However, <em>Crawford </em>applies only to \u201ctestimonial\u201d evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The Oregon Court of Appeals characterized Gleason\u2019s statements as casual, off-hand remarks that were not \u201ctestimonial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">This holding was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Crawford, </em>which does not apply to \u201can off-hand, overheard remark.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354. There is no evidence in the record suggesting that Gleason made the statements for the purpose of supplying evidence to the prosecution. <em>Id. </em>Further, the conversation was between two friends, without any active participation by a government official, and Gleason made no effort to minimize his own guilt or shift the blame. Because <em>Crawford </em>did not speak to \u201cwhether and when statements made to someone other than law enforcement personnel are \u2018testimonial,\u2019\u201d <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 2274 n. 2, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. (2006), the Oregon Court of Appeals\u2019 treatment of the case was not an objectively unreasonable application of federal law, as defined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">Saechao also challenges the state trial court\u2019s finding that the out-of-court statement bore a particular guarantee of trustworthiness and was therefore admissible hearsay. <em>See Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). He argues that the decision was contrary to and an unreasonable application of <em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">We disagree. None of the troubling circumstances identified in <em>Lilly </em>\u2014 custodial interrogation, leading questions, and the declarant\u2019s intoxication \u2014 are present here. <em>Id. </em>at 139, 119 S.Ct. 1887 (Stevens, J., opinion). Furthermore, the trial court reasonably found that Gleason\u2019s statements were voluntarily made and trustworthy because the conversation was a casual chat between friends. Gleason may have been made aware, in general terms, that inmate phone calls are recorded, but the state court was not unreasonable in finding that he did not seem to think that anyone was actually listening to his conversation. We have previously cited to such factors as indicia of a statement\u2019s reliability. <em>See Padilla v. Terhune, </em>309 F.3d 614, 619-20 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number><em>States v. Boone, </em>229 F.3d 1231, 1234 (9th Cir.2000). Saechao specifically contends that the disputed statement \u2014 \u201cToo bad I happen to have been with him that night\u201d \u2014 is too ambiguous to be seen as trustworthy, and therefore inculpatory. The trial court found that Gleason was referring to the robbery. This was not unreasonable. A plain reading of the transcript shows that Gleason uttered the statement as part of his recollection of his activities with Saechao on \u201cthat night,\u201d as he put it. With no other evidence to the contrary, we must presume the correctness of this finding. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b705-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
