SEYMOUR, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Pat H. Hayes, proceeding pro se as an heir to the estate of his mother, Leona James Hayes, filed a civil complaint requesting damages from defendant Chesapeake Operating, Inc. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of defendant. Mr. Hayes appeals and, construing his filings liberally, <em>see Haines v. Kemer, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">Mr. Hayes\u2019s mother was the owner of restricted Indian lands regulated by the United States Department of Interior.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Hayes believes that, in dealing with the oil and gas leases covering the estate\u2019s lands, defendant Chesapeake violated the lease terms and applicable regulations. Based on his reading of 25 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 213.1 and 213.37, he asked the central regional director of the United States Geological Survey (USGS, a bureau of the United States Department of the Interior), to schedule a hearing at the Anadarko Agency of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA, another bureau of the Interior Department) on the alleged violations and his claims for $26,520,000 in damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">Mr. Hayes did not await agency action. On his own, he obtained permission to use the conference room at the Anadarko agency and scheduled a hearing for March 22, 2006. In a written response to Mr. Hayes\u2019s \u201chearing\u201d notification, the Interior Department Solicitor advised him that the references in the regulations to USGS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>were no longer accurate and that the Chickasaw Agency had jurisdiction over his concerns. The Solicitor\u2019s letter made it clear that Mr. Hayes himself could not schedule or conduct a hearing, that no Interior Department representative would appear at the purported hearing, and that the Anadarko conference room would not be available for Mr. Hayes\u2019s purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Mr. Hayes then filed an \u201cappeal\u201d with the Secretary of the Interior Department, asserting that he was entitled to damages due to Chesapeake\u2019s default for failing to attend the March 22 \u201chearing\u201d he had scheduled. The Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA) observed that Mr. Hayes\u2019s appeal did not identify an official action or inaction which it could review. It therefore dismissed the matter for lack of jurisdiction and referred the matter to the BIA Eastern Oklahoma Regional Director and the Chickasaw Agency Superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Rather than pursuing his claims with the Regional Director or the Chickasaw Agency, Mr. Hayes filed a district court lawsuit seeking enforcement of his so-called \u201cdefault judgment.\u201d He sought $102,522,000 in compensatory damages and fines, along with $205,104,000 in punitive damages. The district court determined that Mr. Hayes failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, granted Chesapeake\u2019s summary judgment motion, and denied Mr. Hayes\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">In spite of his failure to follow agency procedures, Mr. Hayes maintains on appeal that he is entitled to default judgment against Chesapeake. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s dismissal on exhaustion grounds for an abuse of discretion,\u201d though we examine \u201c[questions regarding the applicability and construction of federal law ... de novo.\u201d <em>Quarles v. United States ex rel. Bureau of Indian Affairs, </em>372 F.3d 1169, 1171 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">As this court has explained, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted. A party must exhaust administrative remedies when a statute or agency rule dictates that exhaustion is required. Under Department of Interior regulations, if an agency decision is subject to appeal within the agency, a party must appeal the decision to the highest authority within the agency before judicial review is available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"arp-dedup-0\"><em>Coosewoon v. Meridian Oil Co., </em>25 F.3d 920, 924 (10th Cir.1994) (citations omitted). Application of the doctrine permits an administrative agency to develop a factual record and apply its expertise to that record. <em>McKart v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 185, 193-94, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 23 L.Ed.2d 194 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Mr. Hayes\u2019s claims were never addressed in prescribed Interior Department proceedings. Accordingly, we see neither abuse of discretion nor legal error in the district court\u2019s determination that Mr. Hayes failed to exhaust administrative remedies and was therefore not entitled to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Mr. Hayes\u2019s motion to dismiss his appeal and motion to file for dismissal out of time are DENIED. <em>See </em>10th Cir. R. 27.2(A)(3) (requiring a motion to dismiss to be filed within 15 days after filing of notice of appeal, unless good cause is shown). His motion to proceed in forma pauperis is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-11\">.
