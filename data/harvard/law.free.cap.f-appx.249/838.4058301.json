Straus ordering Blake\u2019s removal to Jamaica. <em>See In re Vanver Vaughn Blake, </em>No. A 37 770 767 (B.I.A. Sept. 9, 2003), <em>affg </em>No. A 37 770 767 (Immig. Ct. Hartford Nov. 7, 2002). Blake asserts that the agency erred in concluding that he failed to establish United States citizenship derived from his mother\u2019s naturalization in 1991. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Blake\u2019s derivative citizenship claim depends on that part of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a) (repealed 2000)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that affords children born outside the United States to alien parents automatic citizenship upon</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arz-dedup-0\">the naturalization of the mother if the child was born out of wedlock and the paternity of the child has not been established by legitimation; ... if ... [s]uch naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of eighteen years; and ... [s]uch child is residing in the United States pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the naturalization of the parent ... or thereafter begins to reside permanently in the United States while under the age of eighteen years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a)(3) \u2014 (5). There is no dispute that Blake was born out of wedlock to Maxine Letteman and Barrington Blake in Jamaica on September 25, 1976. Nor is there any question that his mother was naturalized as a United States citizen when Blake was under eighteen and residing in this country as a lawful permanent resident. The sole question presented by this petition is whether the agency erred in concluding that Blake\u2019s paternity had been established by legitimation under Jamaican law. We review this legal conclusion <em>de novo. See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Jamaica\u2019s Status of Children Act (\u201cSCA\u201d) eliminates legal distinctions between children born in and out of wedlock by providing that, subject to specified exceptions, \u201cfor all the purposes of the law of Jamaica the relationship between every person and his father and mother shall be determined irrespective of whether the father and mother are or have been married to each other.\u201d SCA \u00a7 3(1). In setting forth evidentiary requirements for establishing paternity, Section 8(1) of the SCA states that \u201c[i]f ... the name of the father of the child to whom the entry relates has been entered in the register of births ..., a certified copy of the entry made ... shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the person named as the father is the father of the child.\u201d It is undisputed that Barring-ton Blake signed petitioner\u2019s Jamaican birth certificate as his father. Petitioner nevertheless insists that this action did not establish his paternity \u201cby legitimation.\u201d He submits that legitimation could be achieved only upon the marriage of his parents, as provided in Section 2 of Jamaica\u2019s Legitimation Act, legislation that preceded the enactment of the SCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">This argument is foreclosed by <em>Lewis v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 125, 131 (2d Cir.2007), wherein this court recently observed that a Jamaican national whose father registered his name on the child\u2019s birth certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>\u2018Vas legitimated\u201d under Jamaican law. The Seventh Circuit reached the same conclusion in <em>Wedderburn v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 795, 797, 802 (7th Cir.2000), as has the BIA, <em>see Matter of Pagan, </em>22 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 547, 549 n. 1 (BIA 1999); <em>Matter of Clahar, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 1981). Petitioner points us to no contrary interpretation of Jamaican law. To the extent he cites us to <em>Gorsira v. Loy, </em>357 F.Supp.2d 453 (D.Conn.2005), and <em>Matter of Rowe, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 962 (BIA 2006), these cases involved Guyanese law, which, while similar to that of Jamaica in attempting to eliminate discrimination against illegitimate children, is distinguishable in important respects relating to legitimation, <em>see Gorsira v. Loy, </em>357 F.Supp.2d at 495-96 (quoting a Law Library of Congress report on \u201cLegitimation in Guyana\u201d that notes the distinction).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Accordingly, because Blake was legitimated under Jamaican law by his father\u2019s registration of his name on his son\u2019s birth certif\u00edcate, <em>see Lewis v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d at 131, we can identify no legal error in the agency conclusion that Blake did not qualify for automatic citizenship pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a)(3)-(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The petition for review of the BIA\u2019s September 9, 2003 order of removal is hereby DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b865-8\">. Former \u00a7 1432(a) governs this petition because its repeal by the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Pub.L. No. 106-395, 114 Stat. 1631 (2000) (codified in scattered sections of 8 and 18 U.S.C.), does not apply retroactively. <em>See Drakes v. Ashcroft, </em>323 F.3d 189, 191 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
