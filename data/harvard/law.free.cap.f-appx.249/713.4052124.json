R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Defendants Richard Allen Johnson and Jimmie Allen Perkins were convicted of various criminal counts arising out of their participation in an armed bank robbery. Both defendants were sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment. On direct appeal, this court affirmed the defendants\u2019 convictions, but remanded both cases with directions to vacate the defendants\u2019 sentences and resentence them due to a sentencing error. <em>United States v. </em>Johnson, 168 Fed.Appx. 294 (10th Cir.2006). On remand, the district court conducted a re-sentencing hearing and imposed sentences equal to those originally imposed. Defendants now appeal their sentences. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The factual and initial procedural histories of this case were previously summarized by this court in affirming the defendants\u2019 convictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">On the afternoon of March 31, 2003, two men wearing camouflage clothing and masks broke into the home of Lowell and Ima Jean Moore located outside of Keota, Oklahoma. When Mr. Moore, who was disabled, returned home from fishing, he was confronted by the men and ordered, at gunpoint, to comply with their demands. Mrs. Moore, who worked at the Keota branch of the First National Bank of Stigler (hereinafter the Keota branch bank), received similar treatment when she returned home that afternoon from work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">The masked men proceeded to question the Moores about the Keota branch bank and indicated that they intended to rob it, threatened to kill the Moores if they did not cooperate, threatened to rape Mrs. Moore, and at one point took steps towards actually raping Mrs. Moore (i.e., ordering her to remove her pants and then unbuttoning and unzipping her pants when she refused to cooperate). At approximately 9:30 p.m. that evening, a third man wearing camouflage clothing and a mask arrived at the Moores\u2019 house, stayed for approximately forty-five minutes to an hour, and then left with firearms taken from the bedroom of Mrs. Moore\u2019s son. After the third man left the house, the remaining two masked men escorted the Moores to their bedroom and told them they could lay down.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">At approximately 4:00 a.m. the next morning, the masked men ordered the Moores out of bed and escorted them outside and into a white van owned by the Moores. The masked men drove the Moores approximately two miles from their home, blindfolded them, and proceeded to drive around for a long period of time, making numerous turns and stopping twice, once to meet up with another vehicle and a second time during which Mrs. Moore was removed by the masked men, interrogated again about the Keota branch bank, and advised of what her role would be in the robbery of the bank. Eventually, the masked men removed the blindfolds from the Moores, ordered Mr. Moore to drive the van, and directed him to the Keota branch bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">At the Keota branch bank, one of the masked men remained in the van with Mr. Moore while the other escorted Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Moore, who had keys to the bank, inside. In accordance with the masked man\u2019s directions, Mrs. Moore turned off the bank\u2019s alarm system and video camera, and then opened the bank\u2019s vault. The masked man removed a bag of money from the vault (totaling $29,300), left the bank with Mrs. Moore, and returned to the van. Mr. Moore was then ordered to drive as fast as he could out into the country. Outside of Keota on a country road, the masked men ordered the Moores out of the van and directed them to \u201cwalk west and don\u2019t look back.\u201d Supp. Vol. II, at 11. The Moores walked to a nearby house where they called law enforcement authorities. The Moores\u2019 van was subsequently found abandoned outside of Keota.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">On April 25, 2003, a criminal complaint was filed charging Johnson and Jimmie Perkins with robbing the Keota branch bank, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). (citation omitted). Both men were arrested that same day. During a post-arrest interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Jimmie Perkins admitted his involvement in the robbery, but asserted that he was forced to participate, under threat of physical harm to himself and his family, by a group of Mexican men. When questioned about Johnson\u2019s involvement in the robbery, Jimmie Perkins refused to say whether Johnson was involved or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">On June 11, 2003, a federal grand jury returned an eight-count indictment charging Johnson, Jimmie Perkins, and Anthony Perkins (Jimmie Perkins\u2019 son) with various crimes arising out of the robbery of the Keota branch bank, (citation omitted). Count I charged the defendants with conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Count II charged the defendants with armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (c). Count III charged the defendants with hostage taking in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203. (footnote omitted). Count IV charged Johnson and Jimmie Perkins with possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Counts V and VI charged Johnson with solicitation to commit a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 373. Count VII charged Johnson and Jimmie Perkins with possession of stolen firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(0- Finally, Count VIII charged all three defendants with conspiracy to possess a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The case proceeded to trial on December 17, 2003. At the conclusion of the evidence, the jury found the three defendants guilty as charged in the indictment. With respect to defendants Johnson and Jimmie Perkins, the jury also found, in response to a special interrogatory, that they brandished weapons during and in relation to Count IV of the indictment (i.e., the \u00a7 924(c) charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">On May 12, 2004, the district court conducted a joint sentencing hearing for the three defendants. At the government\u2019s request, the district court determined it would depart upward in two respects as regards the sentences of defendants Johnson and Jimmie Perkins. First, the district court concluded that their \u00a7 924(c) convictions effectively skewed their Guideline ranges lower than they would have been had they not been convicted under \u00a7 924(c). In other words, the district court concluded that the sentences for Johnson and Jimmie Perkins \u201cunder the Guidelines for violation of Sections 2113(a) and 924(c) might be less severe than had they been con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>victed of violating only Section 2113(a) with an enhancement for using a firearm ...(citation omitted). Thus, in accordance with Application Note 4 to \u00a7 2K2.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines (footnote omitted), the district court chose to calculate Guideline ranges for these two defendants by treating them as if they had not been convicted of violating \u00a7 924(c) (and thus in turn enhancing their offense levels for using a firearm during and in relation to the bank robbery). This resulted in an offense level of 38 for Johnson and 36 for Jimmie Perkins, and in turn a Guideline range of 235 to 293 months for Johnson and 188 to 235 months for Jimmie Perkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Second, the district court found \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that the combination of the sophistication of the robbery, the duration of the abduction, the use of multiple firearms and making multiple and repeated threats of death to multiple victims, and the sexual assault of Mrs. Moore [we]re aggravating factors present to a degree not adequately considered by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the Guidelines,\u201d which in turn caused the case \u201cto differ significantly from the heartland cases covered by the guidelines.\u201d (citation omitted). Thus, the district court departed upward by imposing a two-level enhancement to the offense levels of defendants Johnson and Jimmie Perkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Ultimately, the district court sentenced the three defendants in the following manner. With respect to defendant Johnson, who the district court found was the leader or organizer of the robbery, the district court imposed a sentence of 324 months, in the middle of Johnson\u2019s guideline range of 292 to 365 months. With respect to defendant Jimmie Perkins, the district court imposed a sentence of 293 months, a sentence at the very top of the guideline range of 235 to 293 months. Finally, with respect to defendant Anthony Perkins, the district court imposed a sentence of 188 months, a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\"><em>United States v. Johnson, </em>168 Fed.Appx. 294, 298-300 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">On direct appeal, this court affirmed the convictions of all three defendants, as well as the sentence of defendant Anthony Perkins, but remanded the cases of defendants Johnson and Jimmie Perkins to the district court for resentencing. In doing so, this court concluded that the district court committed plain error in finding that the robbery was \u201csophisticated\u201d and, in turn, relying on that finding to help support its decision to upward depart from the Guideline range with respect to the sentences for defendants Johnson and Jimmie Perkins. <em>Johnson, </em>168 Fed.Appx. at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">On remand, the government filed a motion essentially asking the district court to impose the same sentences originally imposed. More specifically, the government\u2019s motion requested that the district court \u201cdetermine both defendants^] sentences as if there were no 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction utilizing an alternate sentencing calculation.\u201d Johnson ROA, Vol. I, Doc. 136 at 1. The government\u2019s motion also asked the district court to impose a two-level upward departure on each defendant based on \u201cthe combination of factors\u201d cited in the government\u2019s prior motion for upward departure (i.e., extended duration of the offense, use of multiple firearms during the offense, the making of multiple death threats during the offense, and the sexual assault of one of the victims), \u201cexcluding sophistication of the rob-bery____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. According to the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>ernment, granting its motion would result in an offense level of 38 and an associated \u201crange of 235-293 months\u201d for defendant Jimmie Perkins, and an offense level of 40 and an associated Guideline range of 292-365 months for defendant Johnson (assuming application of a two-level enhancement for his leadership role). <em>Id. </em>at 4. Both defendants objected to the government\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">On August 3, 2006, the district court conducted a resentencing hearing for both defendants. During the hearing, the district court adopted the factual findings it made at the previous sentencing hearing, except for the question of who was \u201cthe perpetrator of the sexual assault.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Vol. 2 at 10. The district court also made the following, additional factual findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">\u2022 \u201cdefendants chose to abduct Mrs. Moore because she had keys to the bank and was responsible for opening the bank every morning,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 33;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">\u2022 \u201c[t]hey abducted her husband to further ensure her cooperation,\u201d <em>id.;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">\u2022 \u201c[t]he Moores were held at gunpoint in their home for 17 hours,\u201d <em>id.;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">\u2022 \u201c[n]o time during the 17 hours after the defendants learned that they could not immediately break into the bank, that they had to wait until morning, did they decide to give up their crime,\u201d <em>id.;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">\u2022 \u201cMuring the ordeal, multiple firearms [we]re used by the defendants, repeatedly used, to make threats and stuck in the face of both [victims],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 33-34;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">\u2022 \u201c[m]ultiple and repeated threats of death by the use of the guns to the Moores and family members were made by the defendants and they were made to coerce the Moores into cooperating and keep that cooperation going for 17 long hours,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 34;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-11\">\u2022 \u201cthere is evidence \u2014 convincing evidence that one of the defendants threatened to sexually assault Ms. Moore and indeed removed her pants which I think qualifies as a sexual assault, perhaps not technically, but that\u2019s pretty close to the court,\u201d <em>id.; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-13\">\u2022 \u201cthe guns stolen from the other family member were likewise brandished or used or would have been a threat as well as the guns simply brought to the scene by the defendants themselves,\u201d <em>id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">The district court then concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-15\">As to the factors submitted by the government and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 United States Code, Section 3553(a), the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the combination of the duration of the abduction, the use and threatening use of the multiple firearms in the commission of the offense, the multiple and repeated threats of death to the Moores, and the sexual assault on Ms. Moore are aggravating factors present to a degree not adequately considered by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines for bank robbery, which causes this case to differ significantly from the heartland cases covered by the bank robbery guidelines. This is not a smash-and-grab bank robbery. Very few bank robbers \u2014 bank robberies last for 17 hours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-16\">In determining the extent of the departure, the court notes that most guideline adjustments are two- or three-level adjustments, which in this case has a significant impact on the sentencing range of the defendants. Therefore, taking into consideration the combination of factors previously described, as well as the offense conduct, need for just punishment, deterrence and protection of the public, the court finds a two-level adjustment is appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AIp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>According to the sentencing table in the guidelines manual, this departure enhances the sentencing range to 292 to 365 months for Mr. Johnson and 235 to 293 months for Jimmie Perkins. The sentence imposed by the court in this case will be fashioned in accordance with those sentencing ranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 35-36. With respect to defendant Johnson, the district court imposed a total sentence of 324 months (comprised of 60 months on Count 1, 240 months on each of Counts 2 and 8, 84 months on Count 4, and 120 months on each of Counts 5, 6, and 7, with all of the terms, except for that imposed with respect to Count 4, to run concurrently). With respect to defendant Perkins, the district court imposed a total sentence of 293 months (comprised of 60 months on Count 1, 209 months on each of Counts 2 and 8, 84 months on Count 4, and 120 months on Count 7, with all of the terms, except for that imposed with respect to Count 4, to run concurrently).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\"><em>A. Defendant Johnson\u2019s appeal </em>\u2014 No. <em>06-7074</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">The district court, in imposing the two-level upward departures on each defendant, cited a combination of four factors. Defendant Johnson, in his appeal from re-sentencing, challenges three of the four factors relied upon by the district court, i.e., duration of the abduction, use of multiple firearms, and multiple threats of death. According to Johnson, these three challenged factors \u201cdo not survive application of the standards for when a factor considered by the offense guideline can serve as an upward departure ground.\u201d Johnson. Br. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">A sentencing court is permitted to depart from the Guidelines after determining a defendant\u2019s offense level, criminal history category, and the applicable Guideline range if \u201cthe court finds, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1), that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance ... of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(l)(A). More specifically, a sentencing court may depart based on circumstances (a) of a kind not adequately taken into consideration by the Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(2), or (b) present to a degree not adequately taken into consideration by the Guidelines, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5K2.0(a)(3). A sentencing court may also, as was the case here, \u201cdepart from the applicable guideline range based on a combination of two or more offender characteristics or other circumstances, none of which independently is sufficient to provide a basis for departure.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5K2.0(c). Under these latter circumstances, a departure is warranted \u201conly if\u2019 the \u201coffender characteristics or other circumstances\u201d relied on by the sentencing court, \u201ctaken together, make the case an exceptional one,\u201d and \u201ceach such offender characteristic or other circumstance is ... present to a substantial degree ... and ... identified in the guidelines as a permissible ground for departure, even if such offender characteristic or other circumstance is not ordinarily relevant to a determination of whether a departure is warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5K2.0(c)(l), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Generally speaking, when reviewing a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, this court reviews any legal questions de novo and the factual findings for clear error, giving due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts. <em>United States v. Petti-grew, </em>468 F.3d 626, 639-40 (10th Cir.2006). \u201cIn specifically reviewing upward departures, this court employs a four-part test, examining: (1) whether the factual circumstances supporting a departure are per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>missible departure factors; (2) whether the departure factors relied upon by the district court remove the defendant from the applicable Guideline heartland thus warranting a departure; (3) whether the record sufficiently supports the factual basis underlying the departure; and (4) whether the degree of departure is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Wolfe, </em>435 F.3d 1289, 1295 (10th Cir.2006). \u201cAll of these steps are subject to a unitary abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">\n<em>1) Duration of the abduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Johnson contends that the duration of the abduction was not a proper basis for departing upward \u201cbecause the [Sentencing] Commission included abduction in the robbery guideline and could foresee that abduction could occupy a period of time outside the time necessary for the robbery.\u201d Johnson Br. at 7. He further argues that \u201c[t]he time period [of abduction] in this case was only what was necessary to accomplish the robbery, and abduction did not become an independent criminal objective.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Generally speaking, \u201cabduction or unlawful restraint\u201d is considered by the Guidelines to be an \u201cencouraged\u201d basis for departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.4 (\u201cIf a person was abducted, taken hostage, or unlawfully restrained to facilitate commission of the offense or to facilitate the escape from the scene of the crime, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range.\u201d). As noted by Johnson, however, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1, which establishes the offense level for robbery convictions, expressly takes abduction into account by mandating a four-level increase \u201c[i]f any person was abducted to facilitate commission of the offense or to facilitate escape----\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(A). Further, the district court in this case applied that four-level increase in calculating Johnson\u2019s guideline range. Thus, in order for the abduction that occurred in this case to properly justify, in combination with one or more other factors, an upward departure, it must have been \u201cpresent to a substantial degree.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5K2.0(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Johnson asserts that \u201cthe abduction did not take this case out of the heartland of robberies represented by Guideline 2B3.1.\u201d Johnson Br. at 13. In support of that assertion, Johnson argues that \u201c[i]t is foreseeable that robberies may be committed wherein victims are abducted for several hours in order to facilitate the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. He also asserts that \u201c[t]he abduction was not for a gratuitous period of time, and ended minutes after the robbery was accomplished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. In other words, he asserts that \u201c[t]he abduction ... was for the length of time\u2019 needed to accomplish the robbery,\u201d and no more. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">The problem with Johnson\u2019s arguments is that he is incorrectly relying on the standard set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(3), i.e., the requirement that a circumstance be \u201cpresent in the offense to a degree substantially in excess of, or substantially below, that which ordinarily is involved in that kind of offense.\u201d That standard, however, is inapplicable here because the district court did not rely solely on the length of the abduction, but rather relied on the length of the abduction together with three other factors, to impose an upward departure. Thus, although Johnson may be correct in asserting that an abduction lasting seventeen hours could not be considered \u201csubstantially in excess of that which is ordinarily involved in\u201d a bank robbery, it does not answer the pertinent question of whether the lesser standard set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(c)(2)(A) is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>After reviewing the record on appeal, we conclude that the length of the abduction does, indeed, satisfy this lesser standard. The evidence presented at trial in this case overwhelmingly established, and Johnson does not dispute, that the abduction of the Moores lasted from approximately 2 p.m. on the afternoon of March 31, 2003, until 7:30 or 8:00 a.m. on the morning of April 1, 2003, or a total of seventeen to eighteen hours. Further, the district court, in citing the length of the abduction as one of the factors it was relying on to impose an upward departure, stated: \u201cVery few ... bank robberies last for 17 hours.\u201d Johnson ROA, Vol. 2 at 36. Notably, Johnson does not directly dispute this conclusion, nor does he seriously dispute that the length of the abduction was, indeed, \u201csubstantial.\u201d In short, it is clear that the abduction, in terms of length, was present \u201cto a substantial degree,\u201d and that the district court properly relied on this factor to impose the upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">\n<em>2) Multiple firearms</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Johnson next contends that the use of \u201cmultiple firearms was not a factor present substantially in excess of the typical case, and does not distinguish this case as rare and exceptional.\u201d Johnson Br. at 13. In support of this contention, Johnson notes that (a) there is no evidence \u201cthat the intruders were armed with more than one firearm each,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 14, (b) the intruders unloaded and ultimately removed from the house the firearms belonging to the Moores, and (c) there is no evidence that weapons were used inside the Moore\u2019s vehicle during the robbery episode. In sum, Johnson argues \u201cthat this was a garden variety abduction/robbery as far as use or number of weapons was involved.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">The initial problem with Johnson\u2019s arguments is, again, that he is relying on the more demanding standard set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(3), i.e., the requirement that a circumstance be \u201cpresent in the offense to a degree substantially in excess of, or substantially below, that which ordinarily is involved in that kind of offense,\u201d instead of the lesser, \u201cto a substantial degree\u201d standard set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Applying the correct standard, we conclude, as the district court effectively concluded, that the defendants\u2019 use of weapons was present \u201cto a substantial degree.\u201d As previously noted, the district court at the time of resentencing expressly found that \u201c[djuring the ordeal, multiple firearms [we]re used by the defendants, repeatedly used, to make threats and stuck in the face of both [victims].\u201d Johnson ROA, Vol. 2 at 33-34. In other words, although each of the defendants may only have brandished a single weapon at a time during the course of the abduction, it is uncontroverted that they repeatedly used those weapons over the entire course of the abduction to threaten and coerce the Moores into cooperating. Accordingly, the \u201cuse of multiple weapons\u201d was indeed present \u201cto a substantial degree,\u201d and thus was properly relied on by the district court in imposing the upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">\n<em>3) Multiple death threats</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">Lastly, Johnson concedes \u201cthat multiple and repeated threats of death were made to the Moores, in order to coerce them into cooperating,\u201d but nevertheless argues that \u201cthe role of death threats did not set this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>case apart as the rare case not envisioned by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Johnson Br. at 15. Rather, he argues, \u201c[t]he threats of death were of the usual kind that accompany robberies \u2014 comply or be harmed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In sum, he argues that this factor \u201cwas not present substantially in excess of what is ordinarily involved.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Johnson again relies on the wrong standard in making his argument. Rather than relying on the correct, \u201cto a substantial degree\u201d standard set, he instead erroneously relies on the \u201csubstantially in excess of\u2019 standard. Thus, his arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In any event, we conclude after reviewing the record that it was proper for the district court to rely on this factor in imposing the upward departure. At the time of resentencing, the district court found, and Johnson now concedes, that \u201cMultiple and repeated threats of death by the use of the guns to the Moores and family members were made by the defendants and they were made to coerce the Moores into cooperating and keep that cooperation going for 17 long hours.\u201d Johnson ROA, Vol. 2 at 34. Thus, whether or not the use of death threats in this case was \u201csubstantially in excess of that ... which ordinarily is involved in th[is] kind of offense,\u201d it is clear that death threats were used here \u201cto a substantial degree.\u201d In turn, it was proper for the district court to rely on the defendants\u2019 repeated use of death threats in imposing the upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">\n<em>I) Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">In conclusion, all three of the factors challenged by Johnson were properly relied on by the district court in imposing the upward departure. Further, it is clear that these three factors, together with the commission of the sexual assault, made this \u201can exceptional\u201d case for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(c)(l), and Johnson does not argue to the contrary. Thus, we affirm defendant Johnson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\"><em>B. Defendant Perkins\u2019 </em>appeal\u2014 <em>No. 06-7075</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Defendant Jimmie Perkins asserts five issues on appeal from his resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">\n<em>1) Lack of notice of sentencing enhancements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">Perkins first contends that the government violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) by failing to provide him with adequate notice of its intent to seek enhancements to his base offense level. In particular, Perkins complains that \u201cno information, argument or authority, was ever received from the United States Attorney as to the five \u25a0 sentencing enhancements [ultimately] used [by the district court at the time of resentencing] to increase [his] sentencing range____\u201d Perkins Br. at 25. Likewise, Perkins contends, \u201c[t]he Probation Office gave [him] no\u201d notice of these enhancements prior to the resentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 26. This court \u201creview[s] the District Court\u2019s adherence to Rule 32(h) de novo.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number><em>States v. Dozier, </em>444 F.3d 1215, 1217 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Rule 32(h), entitled \u201cNotice of Possible Departure from Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party\u2019s pre-hearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure. The notice must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aav\">Although this statutory language appears to apply only to upward and downward departures, we will assume, arguendo, that Rule 32(h) also encompasses enhancements to a defendant\u2019s offense level.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">After Perkins was convicted at trial, the probation office prepared and submitted a PSR recommending the imposition of five sentencing enhancements: (1) a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l) for taking the property of a financial institution; (2) a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(A) because a person was abducted to facilitate commission of the robbery; (3) a one-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(6) because firearms were taken from the Moores\u2019 house; (4) a one-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7) because the amount of loss was more than $10,000 but less than $50,000; and (5) a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(5) because the offense involved car-jacking (i.e., the taking of the Moores\u2019 van). Although Perkins objected to four of these proposed enhancements (he did not object to the two-level enhancement for car-jacking), the district court overruled his objections and imposed all five of the proposed enhancements. On direct appeal, this court, applying a plain error standard of review, overruled Perkins\u2019 <em>Booke</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>objection to the enhancements. In doing so, this court concluded, in pertinent part, \u201cthat a jury applying a reasonable doubt standard would have found all of the facts underlying the five enhancements.... \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>168 Fed.Appx. at 307. This court ultimately remanded Perkins\u2019 case for resentencing, however, due to the district court\u2019s reliance on an improper factor in imposing an upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-14\">On remand, Perkins filed a \u201cSentencing Memorandum\u201d arguing, in pertinent part, that a new PSR should be prepared addressing \u201call sentencing issues ... that could be raised or considered by the [district] Court____\u201d Perkins ROA, Vol. 1, Doc. 134 at 3. In support of this request, Perkins asserted that he \u201cha[d] received nothing from the probation officer in this case as to recommendations on the re-sentencing,\u201d \u201cdfidn\u2019t] know what the Government m[ight] be asking for,\u201d and \u201cwantfed] to know in advance what the Court w[ould] consider ... so that [he] could prepare for the [resentencing] hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The district court conducted a hearing on Perkins\u2019 motion, during which Perkins\u2019 counsel conceded that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>new PSR was unnecessary. <em>Id., </em>Vol. 2 at 8 (\u201cSo, you know, I\u2019m not here to create a lot more work and, you know, another Presen-tence Report, a whole bunch of other investigation. I don\u2019t think we need all of that....\u201d). At the conclusion of that hearing, the district court denied Perkins\u2019 request for a new PSR, and instead indicated it would rely on the original PSR. <em>Id. </em>at 19. The district court did, however, indicate that the parties could \u201csubmit additional objections to the\u201d original PSR. <em>Id. </em>Following this hearing, the government filed a motion requesting that the district court (a) apply an alternate sentencing calculation, and (b) impose a two-level upward departure. Perkins filed an objection to the government\u2019s proposed upward departure. <em>Id., </em>Doc. 137. Importantly, Perkins noted, as part of his objections, that he would likely be receiving the same enhancements that were originally imposed by the district court at the original sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5 (noting that he would likely receive a 6-level enhancement based on the use of firearms); <em>id. </em>at 5 (noting that he would likely receive \u201ca 2 point enhancement because the property of a financial institutional was the object o the offense,\u201d \u201can additional 4 points because the Moores were abducted during the course of the offense,\u201d and \u201can additional 2 points ... based on the carjacking\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Based upon these facts, Perkins was provided with sufficient notice of the five sentencing enhancements ultimately imposed by the district court at the resen-tencing hearing. Specifically, the district court indicated on remand that it would rely on the original PSR, which expressly listed each of the five sentencing enhancements. Further, Perkins effectively conceded in his objections to the government\u2019s proposed upward departure that he was aware that the five sentencing enhancements would be considered, and likely applied, by the district court. Thus, we conclude there was no violation of Rule 32(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">\n<em>2) District co'iirt\u2019s factual findings regarding sentencing enhancements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Perkins next contends that the district court violated his rights by basing each of the five sentencing enhancements on its own factual findings utilizing a preponderance of the evidence standard. In other words, Perkins complains that the sentencing enhancements were neither supported by his own admissions or findings by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Perkins\u2019 argument clearly lacks merit. Contrary to Perkins\u2019 argument, <em>Booker </em>made clear that sentencing facts need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, as long as a district court applies the Guidelines in an advisory fashion (which the district court in this case clearly did), facts may be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Magallanez, </em>408 F.3d 672, 685 (10th Cir.2005). That is, provided the sentence imposed by the district court is within the range authorized by the statute under which the defendant was convicted, judicial fact-finding by a preponderance of the evidence does not violate the Constitution. <em>United States v. Crockett, </em>435 F.3d 1305, 1319 (10th Cir.2006). We note that Perkins does not assert that his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum. Thus, it was entirely permissible for the district court to make its own factual findings applying a preponderance of the evidence standard, and to utilize those findings to enhance Perkins\u2019 base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">\n<em>3) The alternative sentencing calculation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Perkins next focuses upon the district court\u2019s adoption of what the parties refer to as \u201cthe alternative sentence calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>lation,\u201d and what essentially amounted to an upward departure, proposed by the prosecution and authorized by Application Note 4 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4. In particular, Perkins complains that Application Note 4 \u201cprovides no method or criteria\u201d for application of the alternative sentence calculation. Perkins Br. at 40. Instead, he argues, \u201c[t]he only direction implicit in this Application Note is that the highest sentence should be meted out \u2014 without any consideration of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Perkins also appears to suggest that the alternative calculation was inappropriate in light of the district court\u2019s (a) application of five enhancements to his base offense level, and (b) imposition of a two-level upward departure based on other circumstances of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Section 2K2.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines governs the calculation of sentences for offenses involving the \u201cUse of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes.\u201d Application Note 4 to \u00a7 2K2.4 provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">[i]f a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for any explosive or weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment, n. 4. Application Note 4 does, however, provide the following exception to this general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ax3-dedup-0\">In a few cases in which the defendant is determined not to be a career offender, the offense level for the underlying offense determined under the preceding paragraphs may result in a guideline range that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C .... \u00a7 924(c), ... produces a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C .... \u00a7 924(c) ... (i.e., the guideline range that would have resulted if the enhancements for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm had been applied). In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted so that the conviction under 18 U.S.C .... \u00a7 924(c) ... does not result in a decrease in the total punishment. An upward departure under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ... \u00a7 924(c)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">Although Perkins argues that Application Note 4 \u201cprovides no method or criteria\u201d for application of the alternative sentence calculation, and thus does not take into account the overall reasonableness of the sentence, his reading of Application Note 4 is incorrect. Application Note 4 simply grants sentencing courts authority to \u201cdepart upward to ensure that defendants convicted under both \u00a7 924(c) and the underlying crime of violence do not receive more lenient sentences by virtue of the \u00a7 924(c) conviction than if they had been convicted of the underlying offense alone.\u201d <em>United States v. Banks-Giombet-ti, </em>245 F.3d 949, 953 (7th Cir.2001). In other words, Application Note 4 affords sentencing courts the discretion to decide, in cases such as this, whether the lower or higher sentencing range is more appropriate. To be sure, Application Note 4 suggests, and it is likely to be true, that the higher sentencing range (i.e., the range achieved by upward departing) will usually be more appropriate. Nevertheless, a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>fendant, such as Perkins, is always free to argue that the lower sentencing range is more appropriate (as Perkins did here), and/or to request a variance below the guideline range ultimately calculated in order to achieve what the defendant believes to be a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Perkins\u2019 other arguments also lack merit. In particular, nothing in Application Note 4 indicates that the alternative sentencing calculation is inappropriate, or should not otherwise be applied, if a defendant has received a certain number or level of enhancements to his or her base offense level. Thus, the fact that the district court applied five enhancements to Perkins\u2019 base offense level did not prohibit it from applying the alternative sentencing calculation authorized by Application Note 4. Likewise, nothing in Application Note 4, or any other guideline provision, prohibited the district court from applying a second upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">\n<em>U) The district court\u2019s upward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Perkins challenges each of the four factors cited by the district court in imposing the two-level upward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0(e). For the reasons already discussed above in connection with defendant Johnson\u2019s appeal, there is no merit to Perkins\u2019 challenges to the multiple firearms, multiple threats, and duration of abduction factors. In other words, for the reasons already discussed, the district court properly relied on all three of these factors in imposing the upward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0(c). Thus, that leaves only Perkins\u2019 challenge to the sexual assault factor cited by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Perkins suggests that this is \u201cperhaps ... the most troubling of all the factors for the upward departure.\u201d Perkins\u2019 Br. at 45. Although Perkins does not dispute that Mrs. Moore was sexually assaulted, he argues that the assailant \u201cwas never identified between the three defendants on trial,\u201d and \u201c[t]here was no evidence presented at trial or the first sentencing hearing [that] the other two defendants were aware the assault occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, Perkins argues the sexual assault was not a foreseeable act for which he, as the non-assailant, should be held responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">As previously noted, \u00a7 5K2.0(c) allows a sentencing court to \u201cdepart from the applicable guideline range based on a combination of two or more offender characteristics or other circumstances, none of which independently is sufficient to provide a basis for departure.... \u201d The application notes to \u00a7 5K2.0 define \u201ccircumstance\u201d to \u201cinclude[ ], as appropriate, an offender characteristic or any other offense factor.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, comment, n. 1. Both this circuit and the First Circuit have interpreted this definitional language to mean that \u201cupward departures are allowed for acts of misconduct not resulting in conviction, as long as those acts, whether or not relevant conduct in the section IB 1.3 sense, <em>relate meaningfully to the offense of conviction.\u201d United States v. Amirault, </em>224 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2000) (emphasis added); <em>accord United States v. Neal, </em>249 F.3d 1251, 1259-60 (10th Cir. 2001) (adopting the First Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Amirault).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Applying that standard here, it is clear that the sexual assault of Mrs. Moore \u201crelated meaningfully to\u201d Perkins\u2019 \u201coffense[s] of conviction.\u201d In particular, it is uncontroverted that the assault occurred while the Moores were held hostage in their own home, and while the three defendants were waiting for the bank to open. Further, the prosecution presented testimony at trial from a former supervisor of defendant Johnson\u2019s (Thomas Leon Guinn) who testified that a few weeks prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>robbery, Johnson indicated he was thinking about robbing a Keota bank by kidnap-ing a woman who had keys to the bank, and that, as part of his robbery scheme, he intended to threaten to rape or harm the woman. Tr. at 79-81. Based upon this testimony, a reasonable finder of fact could have concluded, applying a preponderance of the evidence standard, that Johnson likewise informed the other two defendants, prior to the actual commission of the crime, about his plan to rape or harm the woman. In turn, then, the sexual assault would clearly fall within the scope of \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under \u00a7 1B1.3 because it would have been \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d by Perkins. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). Accordingly, the district court properly relied on the sexual assault in imposing the two-level upward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">\n<em>5) Presumptive reasonableness of the Sentencing Guidelines</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Perkins argues, at length, that \u201cthe position of this Circuit as to the presumptive reasonableness of the sentencing guidelines is in error.\u201d Perkins\u2019 Br. at 49. Perkins\u2019 arguments, however, are clearly foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (approving the presumption of reasonableness adopted by this circuit and others).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">We AFFIRM the sentences of both defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">. Johnson does not, and indeed cannot, dispute that the use of weapons during the commission of an offense is a permissible ground for departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.6 (\u201cIf a weapon or dangerous instrumentality was used or possessed in the commission of the offense the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\">. Johnson does not argue that consideration of multiple death threats as a factor was impermissible under the Guidelines. Although Chapter 5, Part K of the Guidelines does not appear to expressly discuss the use of death threats, it does indicate that \"extreme conduct\u201d on the part of the defendant may justify an upward departure. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.8 (\"If the defendant's conduct was unusually heinous, cruel, brutal, or degrading to the victim, the court may increase the sentence above the guideline range to reflect the nature of the conduct.\u201d). Further, \u00a7 2B3.1 of the Guidelines, which specifically addresses robberies, does provide for an enhancement if \"a threat of death was made....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-12\">.

This language would seem to suggest that Rule 32(h) does, in fact, apply to sentencing enhancements, as opposed to upward or downward departures. However, <em>Dozier </em>itself involved only an upward departure. Thus, the above-quoted language appears to be dicta.
