GOLD, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon the Revolving Lender Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss [DE 36] and Bank of America\u2019s Motion to Dismiss [DE 35] (\u201cthe Motions\u201d). Responses and replies were timely filed with respect to both motions, <em>see </em>[DE 50]; [DE 52]; [DE 56]; [DE 57], and on May 7, 2010, oral argument was held. I have jurisdiction pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 632, as it is undisputed that both actions at issue are \u201csuits of a civil nature at common law ... to which [a] corporation organized under the laws of the United States [is] a party [and which] aris[es] out of transactions involving international or foreign banking.\u201d Having considered the relevant submissions, the arguments of the parties, the applicable law, and being otherwise duly advised in the Premises, I grant the Motions in part and dismiss certain claims for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-14\">II. Relevant Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-15\">Although the facts giving rise to the claims at issue are detailed in my August 26, 2009 Order Denying Fontainebleau\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment in the Southern District of Florida Action, <em>see generally Fontainebleau Las Vegas, LLC v. Bank of America, N.A., </em>417 B.R. 651 (S.D.Fla.2009) (\u201cAugust 26 Order\u201d), I reiterate the relevant factual background here with citations to the operative complaints <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to ensure that the record clearly demonstrates that the facts and inferences upon which this Order is predicated are drawn only from the operative complaints and the referenced undisputed central documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-16\">A. <em>The Credit Agreement and Disbursement Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-17\">On June 6, 2007, Fontainebleau Las Vegas LLC and affiliated entities (\u201cFontainebleau\u201d) entered into a series of agreements with a number of lenders (\u201cthe Lenders\u201d) for loans to be used for the construction and development of the Fontainebleau Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>sort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada (\u201cthe Project\u201d). (Avenue Compl.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at \u00b6\u00b6 113-115); (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 2^4); <em>see generally </em>[DE 37-1] (\u201cCr. Agr.\u201d); [DE 37-2] (\u201cDisb. Agr.\u201d). Among the agreements entered into by Fontainebleau and the Lenders were a Credit Agreement and a Disbursement Agreement. (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 115); (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 27). It is these two agreements that are the subject of the operative complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\">In connection with the June 6, 2007 loan transaction, Fontainebleau and the Lenders entered into a Credit Agreement that provided, among other things, for a syndicate of lenders to provide three kinds of loans to Fontainebleau: (a) $700 million initial term loan facility (\u201cthe Initial Term Loan\u201d); (b) a $350 million delay draw term loan facility (\u201cthe Delay Draw Term Loan\u201d); and (c) an $800 million revolving loan facility (\u201cthe Revolving Loan\u201d). (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 115); (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24); (Cr. Agmt. at 22, 38). The Plaintiffs proceeding on the Avenue Complaint (\u201cthe Avenue Plaintiffs\u201d) are comprised of certain term lenders that participated in either the Initial Term Loan and/or the Delay Draw Term Loan. (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 115, 117). The Plaintiffs proceeding on the Aurelius Complaint (\u201cthe Aurelius Plaintiffs\u201d) are suecessorsin-interest to certain Term Lenders that participated in either the Initial Term Loan and/or the Delay Draw Term Loan (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 25). Both the Avenue and Aurelius Defendants (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d) are lenders that agreed to fund certain amounts under the Revolving Loan. (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 102-112); (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 11-22). In addition to being a Revolving Lender, Defendant Bank of America also was the Administrative Agent for purposes of the Credit Agreement. (Cr. Agr. at 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">While the Initial Term Loan was to be made on the date of closing, (Cr. Agmt. at 22), the borrowing of funds under the Delay Draw and Revolving Loans prior to the Project\u2019s opening date was governed by a two-step borrowing process set forth in the Credit and Disbursement Agreements. (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 32-33); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 119). First, Fontainebleau was required to submit a Notice of Borrowing to the Administrative Agent (i.e., Bank of America) specifying the requested loans and the designated borrowing date. (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 33); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 119); (Cr. Agmt. \u00a7 2.4(a)). Upon receipt of each Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent was required to notify each lender, as appropriate, so that each lender could, \u201csubject [ ] to the fulfillment of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 [of the Credit Agreement]\u201d and in accordance with Section 2.1, make its pro <em>rata </em>share of the requested loans available to the Administrative Agent on the borrowing date requested by Fontainebleau. (Cr. Agr. \u00a7 \u00a7 2.1(c); 2.4(b)). Then, \u201c[u]pon satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions precedent specified in Section 2.1,\u201d Section 2.4(c) of the Credit Agreement called for the proceeds of the loans to be \u201cremitted to the Bank Proceeds Account and made available to [Fontainebleau] in accordance with and upon fulfillment of conditions set forth in the Disbursement Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">The second step in the borrowing process concerns Fontainebleau\u2019s access to the funds remitted to the Bank Proceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>Account and is governed by the Disbursement Agreement. To access these funds, Fontainebleau was required to fulfill certain conditions set forth in the Disbursement Agreement\u2014including, but not limited to, the submission of an Advance Request to Defendant Bank of America as Disbursement Agent\u2014at which point the loan proceeds would be disbursed in accordance with the Disbursement Agreement. (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 120); (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 37); <em>see also </em>(Disb. Agr. \u00a7 \u00a7 2.4, 3.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">However, pursuant to Section 2.5.1 of the Disbursement Agreement, Fontainebleau\u2019s right to disbursements was not absolute. That section provides that Defendant Bank of America (as Disbursement Agent) was required to issue a Stop Funding Notice \u201c[i]n the event that (i) the conditions precedent to an Advance [set forth in Section 3.3 of the Disbursement Agreement] have not been satisfied, or (ii) [Wells Fargo, N.A. or Bank of America] notifies the Disbursement Agent [Bank of America] that a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing .... \u201d (Disb. Agr. \u00a7 2.5.1); (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 37); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 124). Under the Disbursement Agreement, the issuance of a Stop Funding Notice has the effect of preventing disbursements from the accounts subject to certain waiver provisions and limited exceptions not at issue. (Disb. Agr. \u00a7 2.5.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">As noted, Defendants\u2019 agreement to make Revolving Loans to Fontainebleau is governed by Section 2.1(c) of the Credit Agreement. The first sentence of Section 2.1(c) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[s]ubject to the terms and conditions [of the Credit Agreement],<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> each Revolving Lender severally agrees to make Revolving Loans to [Fontainebleau] <em>provided </em>that ... unless the Total Delay Draw Commitments have been fully drawn, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans shall not exceed $150,000,000.\u201d (emphasis in original). The second sentence of Section 2.1(c) provides that \u201c[t]he making of Revolving Loans which are Disbursement Agreement Loans shall be subject only to the fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 5.2.\u201d (emphasis in original). Section 5.2 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he agreement of each lender to <em>make </em>[the Revolving Loans at issue here] ... is subject only to the satisfaction of following conditions precedent: (a) Borrowers shall have submitted a Notice of Borrowing specifying the amount and Type of the Loans requested, and the making thereof shall be in compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 2 of this Agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">B. <em>The March 2009 Notices of Borrowing and Disbursements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-11\">On March 2, 2009, Fontainebleau submitted a Notice of Borrowing (\u201cMarch 2 Notice\u201d) to Defendant Bank of America, as Administrative Agent, that simultaneously \u201crequest[ed]\u201d the entire amount available under the Delay Draw Term Loan (i.e., $350,000,000) and the Revolving Loan (i.e., $670,000,000).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 44); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>(Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 141). At the time of the March 2, 2009 request, approximately $68 million in Revolving Loans had previously been funded and remained outstanding. (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 45); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 152). On March 3, 2009, Bank of America, as Administrative Agent, wrote to Fontainebleau rejecting the March 2 Notice, stating that the March 2 Notice did not comply with Section 2.1(c)(iii) of the Credit Agreement, which does not allow the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans to exceed $150,000,000 unless the Delay Draw Term Loans have been \u201cfully drawn.\u201d (Aurelius Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50-51); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 143-45). On March 3, 2009, Fontainebleau wrote to Bank of America articulating its position that its March 2, 2009 Notice complied with the Credit Agreement because \u201cfully drawn\u201d meant \u201cfully requested,\u201d <em>not </em>\u201cfully funded,\u201d as Bank of America was contending. (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 54-55); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 141). Thus, according to Fontainebleau, the simultaneous request for the remainder of the Delay Draw Term Loan and the Revolving Loans complied with the Credit Agreement because the Delay Draw Term Loans had been \u201cfully drawn\u201d by virtue of having been \u201cfully requested.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\">On March 3, 2009, Fontainebleau issued another Notice of Borrowing (\u201cthe March 3 Notice\u201d), which was nearly identical to the March 2 Notice, but purported to correct a \u201cscrivener\u2019s error\u201d in the March 2 Notice by reducing the amount of Revolving Loans requested from $670,000,000 to approximately $656 million in order to account for approximately $14 million of Letters of Credit that were outstanding and had not been considered in connection with the March 2 Notice. (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 141); (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 56). On March 4, 2009, Defendant Bank of America rejected the March 3 Notice for the same reason it rejected the March 2 Notice (i.e., the Notice, which simultaneously requested $350,000,000 in Delay Draw Term Loans and Revolving Loans in excess of $150,000,000 in Revolving Loans, did not comply with Section 2.1(c)(iii) because the Delay Draw Term loans had not yet been \u201cfully drawn\u201d). (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 57); (Avenue Comp, at \u00b6 144).</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">In an attempt to remedy the \u201cfully drawn\u201d issue, Fontainebleau issued yet another Notice of Borrowing on March 9, 2009 (\u201cthe March 9 Notice\u201d). (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 65) (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 151). The March 9 Notice was directed solely to the Delay Draw Term Loan, requesting the full amount of the $350,000,000 commitment. <em>Id. </em>Despite the fact that Bank of America \u201creceived notice ... [i]n September and October 2008 that Lehman [Brothers] fail[ed] to comply with its funding obligations under the Retail Facility\u201d in violation of Section 3.3.3 of the Disbursement Agreement, Defendant Bank of America did not issue a \u201cStop Funding Notice.\u201d (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 96-109); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 129-133). Instead, it processed the March 9 Notice and sent it to all the Delay Draw Term Lenders, advising them that the March Notice complied with the Credit Agreement and that the Delay Draw Lenders were required to fund. (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 66); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 153). Plaintiffs allege that Bank of America \u201cwillfully took no action in response to the notice\u201d regarding Lehman Brothers\u2019 default, \u201cfavor[ed] its own interests over those of the Delay Draw lenders\u201d by failing to issue a Stop Funding Notice, (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 109, 151), and failed to act \u201cbecause it wished to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>preserve its ongoing business relationship with the Borrower and its principal indirect owners, including Jeffrey Soffer.\u201d (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 129-30).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">On or about March 10, 2009, Plaintiffs funded their commitments under the Delay Draw Term Loans. In all, the Delay Draw Term Loan Lenders funded approximately $337,000,000 of the $350,00,000 Delay Draw Loan.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Aurelius Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 at 66-67); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 154). Of these Delay Draw Term Loan proceeds, $68,000,000 were used to repay \u201cthen outstanding\u201d Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.1(b)(iii) of the Credit Agreement, of which a twenty-five percent share was attributable to Bank of America as a Revolving Lender. (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 152-53). Then, on or about March 25, 2009, Bank of America disbursed more than $100,000,000 of the Delay Draw Term Loan proceeds to Fontainebleau pursuant to an Advance Request submitted on March 25, 2009. (Avenue Compl. at 1f 165); (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 124). In addition, on or about March 23, 2009, Bank of America sent a letter to Fontainebleau regarding the Revolving Loans; the letter stated that because \u201calmost all of the [Delay Draw Term Loans] have funded ... Section 2.1(c)(iii) now permits the Borrower to request Revolving Loans which result in the aggregate amount outstanding under the Revolving Commitments being in excess of $150,000,000.\u201d (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 89); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 163).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">C. <em>Events Subsequent to the March 25 Advance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">On April 20, 2009, Bank of America, \u201cin its capacity as Administrative Agent, sent a letter to [Fontainebleau], the Lenders and other parties, in which [Bank of America] advised that ... [it has been] determined that one or more Events of Default have occurred and are occurring\u201d and stating that the Revolving Loan commitments were being \u201cterminated effective immediately\u201d pursuant to Section 8 of the Credit Agreement (\u201cthe Termination Notice\u201d). (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 73); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 167-68). According to Plaintiffs, Bank of America was aware of these Events of Default prior to the March 25, 2009 Delay Draw Term Loan disbursement, but failed to take appropriate action (e.g., issuing a Stop Funding Notice). (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 128); (Avenue Compl. at 11167).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">On April 21, 2009, Fontainebleau sent a Notice of Borrowing (\u201cthe April 21 Notice\u201d) requesting $710,000,000 under the Revolving Loan facility; this Notice of Borrowing was not honored. (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 71-72); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 169). Subsequent to April 21, 2009, the Project was \u201cderailed and the value of the collateral securing Plaintiffs\u2019 loans [was] substantially diminished.\u201d (Avenue Compl. at 1\u00cd 172); (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 153). Plaintiffs allege that they have been damaged by the derailment of the Project, the diminution in the value of their collateral, and the purportedly improper March 25 disbursement of Delay Draw Term Loan proceeds; it is further alleged that these damages were the result of Defendants\u2019 improper failure to fund the March 3, 2009 Notice and Bank of America\u2019s material breaches of the Credit and Disbursement Agreements. (Aurelius Compl. at \u00b6 151-53); (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 172).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>Based on these allegations, the Avenue and Aurelius Plaintiffs filed the instant lawsuits in June and September 2009, respectively. The Aurelius Complaint asserts three causes of action. The first is a contract claim against all Defendants for breach of the Credit Agreement as a result of them failure to fund the Notices of Borrowing submitted on or about March 2 and 3, 2009. The second is also a contract claim for breach of the Credit Agreement against all Defendants, but is predicated upon Defendants\u2019 failure to fund the April 21, 2009 Notice of Borrowing. The third count also sounds in contract, but asserts a breach of the Disbursement Agreement against Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\">The Avenue Complaint, on the other hand, asserts six causes of action: the first is for breach of the Disbursement Agreement against Bank of America; the second is for breach of the Credit Agreement against all Defendants; the third asserts that Bank of America breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by favoring its own interests and those of the Revolving Lenders (including itself) over those of the Term Lenders and failing to communicate with the Term Lenders regarding Events of Default; the fourth alleges that all Defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by adopting a contrived construction of the Credit Agreement in order to justify their refusal to fund the March 2 and 3 Notices; and finally, the fifth and sixth counts request declaratory relief regarding the parties\u2019 rights and obligations vis-a-vis the Credit and Disbursement Agreements. Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Defendants now request dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract and implied covenant claims. <em>See </em>[DE 35]; [DE 36].</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">D. <em>The Southern District of Florida Action and the Current MDL Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">When Fontainebleau\u2019s project was derailed in Spring 2009, Fontainebleau filed a voluntary Chapter 11 petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida. On the same day that Fontainebleau filed for bankruptcy protection, it commenced an adversary proceeding against the Revolving Lenders (including Bank of America) seeking, among other things, a ruling requiring the Revolving Lenders to \u201cturn over\u201d the approximately $657 million requested via the March 3 Notice to the bankruptcy estate in pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542(b) (\u201cthe Florida Action\u201d). On June 9, 2009, Fontainebleau filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment in the Bankruptcy Court as to its turnover claim, and on June 16, 2009, Defendants filed a Motion to Withdraw the Reference pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(d). On August 4, 2009, I granted Defendants\u2019 Motion to Withdraw the Reference in the Florida Action. After permitting the Term Lenders to file an amicus brief, I denied Fontainebleau\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, concluding as a matter of law that, for purposes of the Credit Agreement, \u201cfully drawn\u201d unambiguously means \u201cfully funded.\u201d <em>Fontainebleau Las Vegas, LLC v. Bank of America, N.A., </em>417 B.R. 651, 660 (S.D.Fla.2009).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>In December 2009, the Joint Panel on Multi-District Litigation (\u201cthe Panel\u201d) heard the Avenue Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for centralization of their lawsuit and the Florida Action in the Southern District of New York. Defendants and the Aurelius Plaintiffs objected, requesting that the suits be transferred to the Southern District of Florida for pre-trial proceedings. After considering the parties\u2019 positions, the Panel issued an Order finding \u201cthat centralization under Section 1407 in the Southern District of Florida will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of the litigation.\u201d <em>In re: Fontainebleau Las Vegas Contract Litigation, </em>657 F.Supp.2d 1374, 1375 (J.P.M.L.2009). Following the issuance of the Panel\u2019s Order, the Avenue Action was transferred to me for pre-trial proceedings. Approximately one month later, the Aurelius Action was also transferred to me as a \u201ctag-along\u201d action in accordance with the Panel\u2019s directive. <em>Id. </em>at 1374 n. 2. As the MDL judge, I now consider the instant motions to dismiss. <em>See </em>Rule 7.6, R.P.J.P.M.L.

Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">For purposes of deciding a motion to dismiss, my review is limited to the four corners of the operative complaint and any documents referred to therein that are central to the claims at issue. <em>Griffin Industries, Inc. v. Irvin, </em>496 F.3d 1189, 1199 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, Inc., </em>555 F.3d 949, 959 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also Day v.

Where there is a conflict between allegations in a pleading and the central documents, it is \u201cwell settled\u201d that the contents of the documents control. <em>Griffin, </em>496 F.3d at 1206 (quoting <em>Simmons v. Peavy-Welsh Lumber Co., </em>113 F.2d 812, 813 (5th Cir.1940)). Thus, only the contents of the operative complaints and the undisputed central documents will be considered for purposes of this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">In determining whether to grant Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, I must accept all the <em>factual </em>allegations<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in the complaints as true and evaluate all reasonable inferences derived from those facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs. <em>Hill v.

In other words, \u201c[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v.

The question of whether, for standing purposes, Plaintiffs have \u201ca legally enforceable right\u201d with respect to a contractual covenant is a matter of state law. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); <em>see also Mid-Hudson Catskill Rural Migrant Ministry, Inc. v.

(Cr.

This well-established rule applies with equal force to both bipartite and multipartite agreements. <em>See Berry Harvester v. Walter A.

In such cases, the \u201ccritical inquiry is whether the parties to the agreement intended to give [Plaintiffs] the right to enforce\u201d the promise at issue.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Hence, in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>have standing to sue Defendants\u2019 for failure to fund the Revolving Loans, Plaintiffs must adequately demonstrate that they are \u201cintended beneficiaries\u201d of Defendants\u2019 promise to fund the Revolving Loans under the Credit Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\">The question of whether a party is an intended or incidental beneficiary of a particular contractual promise can be determined \u201cas a matter of law\u201d based on the parties\u2019 intentions as expressed in the operative agreement. <em>See generally Fourth Ocean Putnam Corp. v.

However, as New York\u2019s highest court has noted, that requirement \u201chas been progressively relaxed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Today, the rule is that a beneficiary can establish that he has standing to enforce a particular promise <em>\u201conly if no </em>one other than the [beneficiary] can recover if the promisor breaches the [promise] or the contract language ... clearly evidence^] an intent to permit enforcement by the third-party.\u201d <em>Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank v.

This promise creates a duty on the part of Defendants to make loans <em>to Fontainebleau </em>in accordance with the Credit Agreement; it does not establish a duty to the Plaintiffs here or \u201cclearly evidence an intent to permit enforcement by [Plaintiffs].\u201d <em>Fourth Ocean, </em>66 N.Y.2d at 45, 495 N.Y.S.2d 1, 485 N.E.2d 208. Additionally, it is not the case that \u201cno one other than [Plaintiffs] can recover if [Defendants] breache[d],\u201d <em>id., </em>as Fontainebleau would unquestionably be able to recover if it were able to prove that it suffered damages as a result of Defendants\u2019 material breach of the Credit Agreement. While I recognize that \u201cthe full performance of [Defendants\u2019 purported obligation to fund the Revolving Loans] might ultimately benefit [Plaintiffs],\u201d this, at best, establishes that Plaintiffs were \u201cincidental beneficiaries\u201d of Defendants\u2019 promise to Fontainebleau to make Revolving Loans. <em>Fourth Ocean, </em>66 N.Y.2d at 45, 495 N.Y.S.2d 1, 485 N.E.2d 208; <em>see also Salzman v.

Such arguments are not relevant or proper, for \u201c[a]n ambiguity does not exist by virtue of the fact that one of a contract\u2019s provisions could be ambiguous under some other circumstances.\u201d <em>Bishop v.

One of the conditions set forth in Section 3.3 is that \u201c[n]o Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.\u201d (Disb. Agr. \u00a7 3.3.3).

Defendant Bank of America does not dispute this. Instead, Bank of America argues that: (1) the claim is insufficient because the Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cfail[ed] to attach th[e] purported \u2018notice\u2019 or even identify the lender who sent the alleged communications\u201d; and (2) pursuant to Section 9.3.2 of the Disbursement Agreement, Bank of America was \u201centitled to rely on certifications from [Fontainebleau] as to satisfaction of any requirements and/or conditions imposed by th[e] [Disbursement Agreement].\u201d [DE 35, pp. 10, 13]. I reject Bank of America\u2019s first argument, for at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, I must accept all of Plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations in the complaints as true\u2014i.e., Plaintiffs need not support their factual allegations with documentary evidence at this stage of the proceedings. <em>See Hill, </em>321 F.3d at 1335. Bank of America\u2019s second argument also fails, as there are no allegations on the face of the operative complaints establishing that Fontainebleau \u201ccertif[ied]\u201d that Lehman Brothers had not defaulted under the Retail Facility Agreement.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> While it can certainly be inferred that such representations were made given that Fontainebleau submitted various Advance Requests subsequent to the Fall of 2008, inferences of this nature are not appropriately drawn at this stage. To the contrary, it is well-settled that I must evaluate all reasonable inferences <em>in favor of the Plaintiff\u2019s. Wilson v. Strong, </em>156 F.3d 1131, 1133 (11th Cir.1998). Because Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints adequately allege facts indicating that Bank of America knew of Lehman Brothers\u2019 default under the Retail Financing Agreement and failed to issue a Stop Funding Notice in violation of the Disbursement Agreement, Count III of the Aurelius Complaint and Count I of the Avenue Complaint will not be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">C. <em>Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing Against Bank of America\u2014Count III of the Avenue Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">Count III of the Avenue Complaint asserts that Bank of America breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it \u201cimproperly approved Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>vanee Requests, issued Advance Confirmation Notices, failed to issue Stop Funding Notices, [] caused the disbursement of funds from the Bank Proceeds Account; and [ ] fail[ed] to communicate information to the Term Lenders regarding Events of Default that were known o[r] should have been known to [Bank of America].\u201d (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 192).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">While it is well-settled that breach of the implied covenant of good faith gives rise to a stand-alone cause of action under New York law, <em>see Granite Partners, LP. v. </em>Bear; <em>Stearns &amp; Co., </em>17 F.Supp.2d 275, 305 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (noting that \u201c[b]reaeh of the [good faith] covenant gives rise to a cognizable claim\u201d), it is equally settled that \u201cNew York law ... does not recognize a separate cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when a breach of contract claim, based upon the same facts, is also pled.\u201d <em>Harris v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>310 F.3d 73, 81 (2d Cir.2002). In their opposition papers, the Avenue Plaintiffs acknowledge this rule, but contend that it does not apply because its implied covenant claim is predicated, in part, upon the factual allegation that Bank of America \u201cfailed to communicate information regarding defaults,\u201d while its Disbursement Agreement claim is not. [DE 52]. This argument is not a novel one, and has been roundly rejected by New York courts. <em>Alter v. Bogoricin, </em>No. 97-CV-0662, 1997 WL 691332, *1, *7-*8 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 6, 1997) (rejecting similar argument, dismissing implied covenant claim, and noting that it has been observed that \u201cevery court faced with a complaint brought under New York law and alleging both breach of contract and breach of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing has dismissed the latter claim as duplicative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">The critical inquiry in this respect is not whether the two claims are founded upon identical facts, but whether the relief sought by Plaintiffs \u201cis intrinsically tied to the damages allegedly resulting from [the] breach of contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Canstar v.

In support of this claim, the Avenue Plaintiffs allege that Defendants \u201cbreached the implied covenant [of good faith] by adopting a contrived construction of the Credit Agreement in order to justify their refusal to fund the March 2 Notice [of Borrowing] and the March 3 Notice [of Borrowing].\u201d (Avenue Compl. at \u00b6 198). Under New York law, claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith are unsustainable as a matter of law if a plaintiff \u201cseek[s] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>imply an obligation of the defendants which [is] inconsistent with the terms of the contract\u201d at issue. <em>Fitzgerald v.

Because I have concluded that the purportedly \u201ccontrived construction\u201d of \u201cfully drawn\u201d is, in fact, the correct interpretation, this claim fails as a matter of law, as it seeks to impose an obligation\u2014i.e., a particular construction of the Credit Agreement\u2019s terms\u2014that is inconsistent with the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">Based on the foregoing, I conclude that\u2014with the exception of Count I of the Avenue Complaint and Count III of the Aurelius Complaint\u2014all claims asserted by the Plaintiffs warrant dismissal. The dismissal of these claims is <em>with prejudice </em>for two reasons. First, the facts, circumstances, and applicable law indicate that any attempt to amend the dismissed claims would be futile; and second, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim despite having previously amended their complaints.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Novoneuron Inc. v. Addiction Research Institute, Inc., </em>326 Fed.Appx. 505, 507 (11th Cir.2009) (affirming dismissal with prejudice where Plaintiff amended as a matter of right and later decided to litigate the merit s of Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss rather than requesting leave to amend); <em>Butler v.

However, because the parties have indicated that the promises contained in the Intercreditor Agreement are not germane to this action, [MTD Hr\u2019g Tr. 3:26 p.m.-3:28 p.m.], I see no reason to invite further amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">Based on the foregoing, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-11\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-12\">1.

I recognize the parties' position that having ''standing\u201d to sue for a breach of a contractual promise is distinct from the concept of Article III standing. [MTD Hr\u2019g Tr. 3:25 p.m., May 7, 2010] (\"I have always just thought of this as having been innocently mislabeled. I agree with [defense counsel] that when they said standing, what they really meant was the term lenders don\u2019t have any contractual right\u201d). While there is case law supporting this contention, the Eleventh Circuit treats the question of whether a party has a \"legally enforceable right\u201d with respect to a contractual promise as an Article III issue. <em>AT &amp; T Mobility, LLC v. National Ass'n for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc., </em>494 F.3d 1356, 1360 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, </em>405 F.3d 964, 975-980 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, I treat it as such. I emphasize, however, that this distinction has no bearing on the motions at bar, for Plaintiffs\u2019 contract claims must fail if they lack standing, regardless of how the standing issue is framed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">. At oral argument, the parties agreed that the question of whether Plaintiffs have a legal right to enforce the Revolving Lenders' promise to fund the loans at issue must be determined pursuant to New York law. [MTD Hr\u2019g Tr. 3:25 p.m., May 7, 2010]. In determining and applying the law of New York, I must follow the decisions of the state's highest court, and in the absence of such decisions on an issue, must adhere to the decisions of the state's intermediate appellate courts, unless there is some persuasive indication that the state's highest court would decide the issue otherwise. <em>See Best Van Lines, Inc. v.

While the Plaintiffs and Defendants disagree as to whether Plaintiffs were intended beneficiaries of the Revolving Lenders' promise to fund, both sides appear to agree that one must be an intended beneficiary of a promise in order to have a legal right to enforce it. [MTD Hr\u2019g Tr. 3:35 p.m.-3:38 p.m.].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1288-8\">.Although this argument was not raised in its opposition papers, counsel for the Aurelius Plaintiffs asserted at oral argument that Section 260 of New York Jurisprudence (Second) Contracts and Section 297 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts support the conclusion that all parties to a multipartite agreement are presumed to have a right to enforce every promise contained therein unless a party\u2019s right to enforce \"is specifically severed.\u201d [MTD Hr'g Tr. 3:38 p.m.]. Having reviewed these sections, I reject this contention and note that Plaintiffs appear to have conflated two distinct concepts in advancing this argument: the first is whether a party has a legal right to enforce a particular promise; the second is whether the right to enforce a particular promise is held jointly or severally by multiple parties. The issue here is <em>not </em>whether Plaintiffs and Fontainebleau have a \"joint\u201d or a \"several\u201d (i.e., separately enforceable) right to enforce the Revolving Lenders' promise to fund; rather, the question is whether Plaintiffs have <em>any right whatsoever to </em>enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>that promise. With respect to this issue, it is clear that the <em>Berry Harvester </em>test controls\u2014 i.e., \"[w]hether the right or privilege conferred by the promise of one party to a tripartite contract belongs to one or both of the other parties depends upon the intention of the parties; the mere fact that there are three parties to the contract does not enlarge the effect of any promise, except as it may extend the advantage to two persons instead of one where that is the intention.\u201d 22 N.Y.

The fact that some of the cases cited involve third-party beneficiaries that were not actually \"parties\u201d to the written agreements at issue does not render the cases inapposite.

For example, in a tripartite contract setting where A makes an enforceable promise to B that is expressly intended for the benefit of C, C is a \"third-party beneficiary\u201d of that promise notwithstanding the fact that he, she, or it is technically a \"party\u201d to the written agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">.

Sept. 27, 2007), in support of the contention that they have a legally enforceable right in Defendants\u2019 promise to fund the Revolving Loans. This case fails to buttress Plaintiffs\u2019 position regarding standing, as it involved claims for declaratory relief, not breach of contract\u2014 claims that have different requirements with respect to standing than the contract claims at bar. <em>Deutsche Bank, </em>2007 WL 2823129, <em>*2, </em>2007 U.S. Dist.

While I recognize that \"[i]t is reasonable to assume that the same words used in different parts of the instrument are used in the same sense,\u201d it is beyond dispute that the very same terms can have different meanings for purposes of a single agreement where \"a different meaning is indicated\u201d by the agreement itself. <em>Johnson v. Colter, </em>251 A.D. 697, 297 N.Y.S. 345 (4th Dept.1937) (citation omitted). This is especially true in the context of agreements spanning hundreds of pages that cover varying topics. For example, the word \"draw\u201d might have a different meaning when used to refer to \u201cdrawing\u201d on a letter of credit than when used in reference to \"drawing\u201d on different sources of information, \"drawing\u201d on a chalkboard, or having \"drawn\u201d on a revolving credit facility. Thus, I emphasize that I am not concluding that \"draw\u201d must <em>always </em>mean \"fund\u201d for purposes of the Credit and Disbursement Agreements. Instead, my conclusion is limited to the meaning of \"fully drawn\u201d for purposes of Section 2.1(c)(iii). However, I note that a review of other relevant provisions appears to buttress my conclusion that, in the context of Term Loans and Revolving Loans, \u201cfully drawn\u201d unambiguously means \"fully funded.\u201d For example, Section 5.2(c), entitled <em>\u201cDraw-down Frequency, \u201d </em>provides that Disbursement Agreement loans \"shall be <em>made </em>no more frequently than once every calendar month.\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, this provision, which regulates the frequency of \"draw-downs\u201d vis-a-vis Revolving and Term Loans, indicates that a \"drawdown\u201d is the equivalent of \"making\u201d (i.e., funding) a Revolving or Delay Draw Term Loan, and not a \"request\u201d or \"demand\u201d for such a loan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1293-9\">.

At oral argument, I asked whether there is \u201canything that anyone could point to in the complaint one way or the other that refers to Fontainebleau affirmatively certifying that there was no default\u201d; counsel for Bank of America was unable to reference any such allegation.
