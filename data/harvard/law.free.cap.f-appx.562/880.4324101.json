Renol MURAT, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b902-12\">No. 13-13225</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJS\">Non-Argument Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b902-13\">United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b902-14\">April 7, 2014.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b902-15\">Kathleen Mary Salyer, Wifredo A.

Murat pled guilty to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm (Count 1), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), one count of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine (Count 2), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking felony (Count 3), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). He received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Counts 1 and 2, and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">On appeal, Murat argues that that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), Pub.L. No. 111-220, \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2372, should apply retroactively to eliminate the statutory mandatory minimum in his pre-FSA sentencing, which occurred in December 2008. He also raises an equal-protection challenge based on an alleged disparity in treatment between those sentenced before and after the enactment of the FSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">The district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Murat\u2019s motion because Murat\u2019s sentence was based on a mandatory minimum. <em>See United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1078 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cThe law is clear that a sentencing court lacks jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, even when an amendment would lower the defendant\u2019s otherwise-applicable Guidelines sentencing range, when the defendant was sentenced on the basis of a mandatory minimum.\u201d). Even if the district court had jurisdiction, Murat\u2019s FSA claim would still fail because the \u201cFSA is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress, and thus it does not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.\u201d <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). Additionally, the FSA does not apply to defendants sentenced prior to the date the FSA was enacted, August 3, 2010. <em>Id. </em>Murat was sentenced in December 2008, so the FSA clearly does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Similarly, the district court correctly declined to hear Murat\u2019s claim that his sentence violates the equal protection clause because such a claim is not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion does not grant jurisdiction to hear a constitutional challenge to a sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny Murat\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
