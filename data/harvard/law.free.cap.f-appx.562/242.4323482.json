After conducting a hearing, the district court sentenced Brown to 240 months in prison. In imposing its sentence, the district court applied a leadership enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SBl.l(a). On appeal, Brown challenges the leadership enhancement, arguing that the evidence showed that he was a mere participant or member in the conspiracy. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">A defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased four levels \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). \u201cIn determining whether a defendant is a leader, a court should consider the following factors: \u2018the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 247 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.1 (cmt. n. 4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The district court\u2019s determination that Brown was a leader or organizer for purposes of \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>See United States v. Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d 586, 622 (5th Cir.2013). We \u201cwill uphold a district court\u2019s factual finding on clear error review so long as the enhancement is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">As found by the district court, the pre-sentence report and the sentencing testimony showed that Brown\u2019s role far exceeded that of an average member or a mere \u201ccook.\u201d Brown recruited and organized others for the purpose of securing pseudoephedrine and other precursor materials, he determined the form and amount of payment for those materials, and he secured locations to cook the methamphetamine. The district court\u2019s factual findings are plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision is not clearly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
