He appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against employees of the Beto Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice where Smith was briefly confined in early 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-23\">Smith alleged that he was denied adequate treatment for his injured knees and then subjected to excessive force after he complained about a perceived lack of proper attention. By consent, the case was referred to the magistrate judge for a final decision. In 2012, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the merits. Smith declined to address the summary judgment motion and said he did not need to do so. The court granted summary judgment and dismissed all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-24\">The court concluded that \u201cthe undisputed competent summary judgment evidence shows that the medical defendants provided appropriate care and were not deliberately indifferent to [Smith\u2019s] medical needs.\u201d The court also determined that a video recording showed that no defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>used excessive force when removing Smith from the prison infirmary after he pulled down his pants, sat on the floor, and refused to move. All other colorable claims, liberally construed, were likewise dismissed on the uncontested summary judgment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>a grant of summary judgment. <em>Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., </em>670 F.3d 644, 650 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cSummary judgment is proper if the pleadings and evidence show there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). To defeat summary judgment, the nonmovant must set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(1). Speculation, unsupported assertions, and concluso-ry allegations are inadequate to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>Hernandez, </em>670 F.3d at 660. Nor can Smith overcome summary judgment by merely resting on the allegations of his pleadings. <em>See Duffle v. United States, </em>600 F.3d 362, 371 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-18\">Smith offers only generic statements of law and conclusional factual assertions, scattered throughout his briefs. Even when Smith\u2019s contentions are construed with utmost liberality, they do not challenge any specific ruling by pointing to summary judgment evidence creating a contested issue of material fact. Indeed, Smith declined to offer such evidence in the district court. At best, Smith reiterates the allegations of his pleadings, which cannot overcome summary judgment. <em>See Duffie, </em>600 F.3d at 371. \u201cIt is not our duty to scrutinize the record\u201d in order to find facts supporting Smith\u2019s appeal. <em>Hernandez, </em>670 F.3d at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-21\">Because Smith has identified no genuine dispute as to any material fact,\u201d summary judgment was proper. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. All motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
