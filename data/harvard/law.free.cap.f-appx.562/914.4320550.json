He does not challenge his convictions, but raises two claims with respect to his total sentence: (1) the district court clearly erred in imposing a 14-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H), based on an attributable loss amount of between $400,000 and $1,000,000; and (2) the court also clearly erred in imposing a two-level increase under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C), for use of sophisticated means during the commission of the underlying offenses. We conclude both of the arguments Brennan raises on appeal fail, and we therefore affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">I. LOSS AMOUNT</p>\n<p id=\"b937-17\">Section 2B1.1 of the Guidelines provides for a 14-level increase for a fraud offense involving between $400,000 and $1,000,000 in losses. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H). Application notes clarify the \u201closs is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)). \u201cActual loss\u201d is defined as \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(A)(i)). \u201cIntended loss,\u201d on the other hand, means \u201cthe pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense,\u201d including pecuniary harm \u201cthat would have been impossible or unlikely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>occur.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n. 3(A)(ii)). In the context of fraud offenses, we have recognized that sentencing based on intended loss is appropriate even where no actual loss occurred. <em>See United States v. Menichino, </em>989 F.2d 438, 442 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The district court did not clearly err in determining the intended loss amount was $500,000. <em>See United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1197 (11th Cir.2011) (reviewing the district court\u2019s determination of loss amount for clear error). Brennan himself testified at trial that, after being presented with the fraud scheme, he agreed to participate and wished to sell $500,000 of Optimized Transportation Management stock over the course of five weeks. Moreover, a codefendant and a confidential informant, both of whom spoke with Brennan throughout the course of the conspiracy, each corroborated Brennan\u2019s admission by testifying the scheme was designed to raise half a million dollars. The district court was entitled to rely on the trial testimony in determining the loss amount. <em>See United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213, 1290 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining a district court may base its loss amount determination on factual findings derived from, among other things, evidence heard during trial). Thus, the district court did not clearly err in imposing a 14-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H), based on an attributable loss amount of between $400,000 and $1,000,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">II. SOPHISTICATED MEANS</p>\n<p id=\"AIV\">Section 2B1.1(b)(9)(C) of the Guidelines prescribes a two-level enhancement where the offense involves sophisticated means. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C). \u201cSophisticated means\u201d refers to \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense,\u201d and includes \u201c[e]onduet such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.9(B)). In evaluating whether a defendant qualifies for the enhancement, the proper focus is on the offense conduct as a whole, not on each individual step. <em>See Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1199 (\u201cEach action by a defendant need not be sophisticated in order to support this enhancement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">The district court did not clearly err in imposing the two-level increase for use of sophisticated means. <em>See United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010) (reviewing a district court\u2019s findings of fact related to the imposition of a sophisticated means enhancement for clear error). Testimony at trial showed Brennan did not simply follow orders, as he contends, but instead directed a codefen-dant to issue kickback shares and forwarded a timed press release for publication. Moreover, while Brennan evidently did not personally participate in match trading as part of the scheme, his codefendant, who was responsible for the match trading portion of the scheme, testified he informed Brennan of the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">In any case, Brennan has not contested his convictions for the fraud offenses, and the Guidelines prescribe the \u201csophisticated means\u201d adjustment based on the offense conduct as a whole, not simply the defendant\u2019s own personal conduct in perpetrating the offense. <em>See Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1199. The district court did not clearly err in concluding that the methods used by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>the conspirators to attempt to execute the fraud scheme \u2014 such as the timed press release, the issuance of kickback shares to a third-party, and match trading \u2014 were sophisticated enough to warrant the increase under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C). The timed press release and the designation of the kickback shares, like the methods employed in similar cases in which we have affirmed the imposition of a sophisticated means enhancement, relied on deception and third-party non-participants to conceal the underlying criminal activity. <em>See Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d at 1268 (affirming the district court\u2019s imposition of a sophisticated means enhancement where the fraudulent scheme involved, among other things, forging company documents and transferring funds to unwitting third parties); <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2007) (holding a sophisticated means enhancement was appropriate because the defendant used campaign accounts and credit cards issued to other people to conceal cash expenditures and cover his tax fraud). Thus, the district court did not clearly err in imposing a two-level increase under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C), for use of sophisticated means during the commission of the underlying offenses</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-6\">. Additionally, because intended rather than actual loss caused by the underlying offense is the appropriate measure in this case, as Brennan concedes, the court did not err by omitting an actual loss calculation under \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(F)(ix)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
