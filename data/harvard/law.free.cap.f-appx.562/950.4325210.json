The Florida Supreme Court handed down that suspension after it concluded that Scott had violated several provisions of Florida\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>Fla. Bar v. Scott, </em>39 So.3d 309 (Fla.2010). He responded to his suspension by filing a complaint in federal district court against the Florida Supreme Court, the Florida Bar, and three individual defendants who were involved in his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-20\">In his federal lawsuit, Scott asserted two claims. In his first claim, he contended that Florida Bar Rule 4-8.4(c) is facially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>unconstitutional and that the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision suspending him from the practice of law violated his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In his second claim, he alleged that Steven Frankel, Arlene Sankel, and Judge Norman Gerstein \u2014 the three individual defendants \u2014 had engaged in extrinsic fraud by participating in an ex parte communication related to his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Scott sought several forms of relief from the district court. On the first claim, he sought (1) a declaration that Florida Bar Rule 4-8.4(c) is unconstitutional on its face; (2) an order directing the Florida Supreme Court to vacate its decision suspending him from the practice of law; (3) an order directing the Florida Supreme Court to reinstate his license to practice law; and (4) an order expunging his disciplinary history. On his second claim, he sought $2,000,000 in damages from the three individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">The defendants moved to dismiss Scott\u2019s complaint. The district court referred those motions to a magistrate judge, who recommended that Scott\u2019s complaint be dismissed. The magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss Scott\u2019s facial challenge to Florida Bar Rule 4-8.4(c) for failure to state a claim and that all of Scott\u2019s other claims be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and dismissed Scott\u2019s complaint. This is his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Scott contends that Florida Bar Rule 4 \u2014 8.4(c) is facially invalid under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether a bar rule is unconstitutional is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Doe v. Fla. Bar, </em>630 F.3d 1336, 1342 (11th Cir.2011). A facial challenge is \u201cthe most difficult challenge to mount successfully\u201d because it requires a defendant to show \u201cthat no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\u201d <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 2100, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987). That is a \u201cheavy burden\u201d to overcome. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-10\">Florida Bar Rule 4-8.4(c) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-11\">A lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-12\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, except that it shall not be professional misconduct for a lawyer for a criminal law enforcement agency or regulatory agency to advise others about or to supervise another in an undercover investigation, unless prohibited by law or rule, and it shall not be professional misconduct for a lawyer employed in a capacity other than as a lawyer by a criminal law enforcement agency or regulatory agency to participate in an undercover investigation, unless prohibited by law or rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">Rather than attack the entire rule in his facial challenge, Scott challenges only the rule\u2019s exception \u201cthat it shall not be professional misconduct for a lawyer for a criminal law enforcement agency or regulatory agency to advise others about or to supervise another in an undercover investigation.\u201d He asserts that the exception makes the rule facially invalid because \u201cit allows lawyers to commit future wrongs without limits of conduct or obligation to make restitution for the wrongs they commit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">We conclude that the district court correctly dismissed Scott\u2019s facial challenge. Not only does Scott fail to present a single instance in which applying Rule 4-8.4(c)\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>exception would be unconstitutional, but he also fails to provide any explanation for how the rule violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses under the applicable jurisprudential tests. He simply asserts instead that the rule\u2019s exception allows certain lawyers \u201cto commit future wrongs without limits.\u201d And that premise is plainly incorrect, as evidenced by the plain language of the rule. <em>See </em>Fla. Bar R. 4 \u2014 8.4(c) (\u201c[I]t shall not be professional misconduct for a lawyer for a criminal law enforcement agency or regulatory agency to advise others about or to supervise another in an undercover investigation, <em>unless prohibited by laiv or rule.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). Because Scott has failed to demonstrate a single instance in which applying Rule 4-8.4(c)\u2019s exception would violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses, let alone \u201cthat no set of circumstances exists under which the [exception] would be valid,\u201d his facial challenge necessarily fails. <em>See Salerno, </em>481 U.S. at 745, 107 S.Ct. at 2100.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Scott\u2019s remaining claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a question that we review <em>de novo. Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009). Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, \u201cfederal district courts generally lack jurisdiction to review a final state court decision.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>630 F.3d at 1340. That is because the United States Supreme Court is the federal court that reviews final decisions made by a state\u2019s highest court. <em>Id. </em>Decisions by state supreme courts disciplining attorneys for misconduct qualify as such final decisions. <em>See Johnson v. Supreme Court of Ill., </em>165 F.3d 1140, 1141 (7th Cir.1999). As a re-suit, \u201cthe <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine eliminates most avenues of attack on attorney discipline.\u201d <em>Id.; see also In re Cook, </em>551 F.3d 542, 548 (6th Cir.2009); <em>In re Rhodes, </em>370 F.2d 411, 413 (8th Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies when \u201cstate-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments\u201d bring later claims in federal district court that invite the district court to review and reject the earlier state-court judgments. <em>Alvarez v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>679 F.3d 1257, 1262 (11th Cir.2012). The doctrine applies where an issue presented to the district court is \u201cinextricably intertwined with the state court judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That occurs where \u201c(1) the success of the federal claim would effectively nullify the state court judgment\u201d or \u201c(2) the federal claim would succeed only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">In this ease, the district court properly dismissed Scott\u2019s remaining constitutional claims under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Scott was a \u201cstate-court loser\u201d based on the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision to suspend him from the practice of law for three years, <em>see Mothershed v. Justices of Supreme Court, </em>410 F.3d 602, 606-07 (9th Cir.2005), and his federal lawsuit was an attempt to have the federal district court review and reject the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision. That intention is evident from the relief he sought from the district court: an order directing the Florida Supreme Court to vacate its decision suspending him from practice, reinstate his license, and expunge his disciplinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">Scott\u2019s claim for damages against Frankel, Sankel, and Judge Gerstein was also properly dismissed under the <em>Rooker-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number><em>Feldman </em>doctrine. That damages claim was premised on an allegation of extrinsic fraud relating to the preparation of an amended referee report. Scott specifically contended that Frankel, Sankel, and Judge Gerstein colluded to omit material facts from that report. However, the amended referee report and the report\u2019s conclusion that Scott had violated several ethics rules formed the foundation of the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision suspending Scott from the practice of law. Scott\u2019s damages claim could succeed \u201conly to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues\u201d when it suspended Scott\u2019s license to practice law. <em>See Alvarez, </em>679 F.3d at 1263. Therefore, the damages claim was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision, and the district court did not have jurisdiction over the claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Scott\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-7\">. <em>See D.C.
