He appeals his sentence, arguing that the court unconstitutionally enhanced his sentence based on a prior conviction that was neither alleged in the indictment nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He concedes that the Supreme Court has decided \u2014 and that this court has adhered to its decision \u2014 that a prior conviction need not be alleged in the indictment for the court to impose an enhanced sentence. He raises the issue to preserve it for further review in light of <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-21\">In that Carillo-Lucas properly concedes that precedent forecloses his argument, his sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b844-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
