He was sentenced to 180 months in prison, the statutory minimum under \u00a7 924(e)(1), and he now appeals. He argues that the district court procedurally erred at sentencing by failing to elicit fully articulated objections from him after his sentence was imposed. He also argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) violates the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and that the district court plainly erred by sentencing him under an unconstitutional statute. After careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">I. Flores\u2019s Objections to his Classification under the ACCA</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">A. The Alleged <em>Jones </em>Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">After the district court \u201cstates its factual findings, applies the guidelines, and imposes sentence,\u201d it must provide the parties the opportunity \u201cto object to the district court\u2019s ultimate findings of fact and <em>conclusions of law </em>and to the manner in which the sentence is pronounced.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1102 (11th Cir.1990) (emphasis added), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc) (per curiam). Flores claims that the district court violated <em>Jones </em>in two ways by asking the following question after imposing Flores\u2019s sentence: \u201cNow that [the] sentence has been imposed, does the defendant or his counsel object to the Court\u2019s findings of fact or the manner in which the sentence was pronounced?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">First, Flores appears to suggest that the court erred by failing to directly elicit objections from the defendant, even where, as here, the defendant was represented. Without suggesting that we would ever adopt such a rule, we reject Flores\u2019s claim because even if we were to adopt the proposed rule, it was satisfied. The court specifically asked if <em>\u201cthe defendant </em>or his counsel object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-14\">Second, Flores claims that the court erred in eliciting objections only as to \u201cthe Court\u2019s findings of fact or the manner in which the sentence was pronounced,\u201d without mentioning, as required by <em>Jones, </em>the court\u2019s conclusions of law. In <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam), we held that the district court violated <em>Jones </em>when the court asked only, \u201cIs there anything further?,\u201d and the defendant raised no objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>tions in response. We noted in <em>Campbell </em>that \u201cthere [was] no indication that defense counsel understood the court to be eliciting objections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Flores\u2019s contention is therefore premised on the notion that a party hearing an invitation to raise objections to findings of fact or the manner of pronouncement of a sentence would somehow not understand that the court was also eliciting objections generally, including objections to conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">We reject this contention. The post-imposition question here signaled clearly and obviously that the parties were invited to object. The question in <em>Campbell </em>\u2014 \u201cIs there anything further?\u201d \u2014 could easily have been taken as an inquiry wholly unrelated to objections, and indeed, defense responded by requesting drug treatment for the defendant rather than by offering objections. <em>Id. </em>Here, no such confusion was possible, and no one could seriously conclude that objections to conclusions of law were not also invited. Defense counsel concedes that she had no legal objections, so the plausibility of Flores\u2019s contention is weakened even further. A defendant would not parse the district court\u2019s elicitation and decline to raise objections to conclusions of law because the court only invited objections to conclusions of fact and the manner in which the sentence was imposed. The defendant\u2019s failure to offer objections signaled only that he had none \u2014 a conclusion confirmed by his failure to discuss any specific objections he would have made at the time had the court given a perfect <em>Jones </em>elicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Regardless of whether a <em>Jones </em>violation occurred, it is appropriate to consider the merits of Flores\u2019s objections in this appeal. Flores\u2019s brief states that, as a result of the <em>Jones </em>violation, we should remand \u201cto the district court for resentencing so that Mr. Flores can articulate his specific objections to the district court\u2019s legal conclusions on his objections.\u201d The objections on which the court rendered legal conclusions were found in a pro se brief filed by Flores. In that filing, he objected to his classification as an armed career criminal in the Presen-tence Investigation Report (PSI). The district court, after noting that it would normally strike such pro se objections filed by represented defendants, nevertheless overruled Flores\u2019s objections on the merits, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-9\">[I]t has been noted in the PS[I] addendum that that [Flores\u2019s objection] has been rejected by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. But even if it had not, there are enough independent criminal history points that the criminal history would come out to a level six whether you were a career offender or not, I believe. If anybody thinks I\u2019m mistaken, I\u2019ll hear that now.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">In stating that he has \u201cobjections\u201d to these legal conclusions, Flores is more or less stating that he wants to appeal the district court\u2019s decision. The court\u2019s alleged <em>Jones </em>violation did not deprive him of this opportunity. In <em>United States v. Weir, </em>we held that when the \u201cdistrict court clearly understands] the [party\u2019s] position and specifically reject[s] it[,] [t]his satis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>fie[s] the purpose of <em>Jones </em>to allow the district court to make a studied decision on the objection.\u201d 51 F.3d 1031, 1033 (11th Cir.1995). <em>Weir </em>further held that objections which are raised and addressed before the sentence is imposed need not be re-raised after the <em>Jones </em>elicitation in order to be preserved for appeal, <em>id., </em>so Flores\u2019s pro se objections are preserved. Rather than grant Flores remand, which is not warranted because it does not appear a <em>Jones </em>violation occurred and which seems pointless given that the objections Flores seeks to make were already considered and rejected by the court to which we would remand, we will simply construe his \u201cobjections\u201d to the court\u2019s legal conclusions as an appeal from the court\u2019s decision to sentence him in accord with the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We review sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1235 (11th Cir.2006). We review the district court\u2019s legal interpretations de novo and its factual findings for clear error. Id.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">C. The Merits of Flores\u2019s ACCA Objections</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Flores objected to his classification under the ACCA, claiming that his prior convictions did not constitute \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) because the convictions failed to specify the quantity of drugs involved. In <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>we recognized that the prior drug offenses at issue there could not be classified as \u201cserious\u201d for purposes of sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c) for this very reason. 586 F.3d 918, 929-30 (11th Cir.2009). If such convictions do not constitute \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d under \u00a7 3559(c), they should not under \u00a7 924(e), either, Flores claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">We agree with the PSI\u2019s conclusion, echoed by the district court, that this case is not analogous to <em>Sanchez. </em>To be sure, the statute at issue in <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00a7 3559(c), and the statute at issue here, \u00a7 924(e), use the phrase \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d but the statutory definitions of that phrase are different. The definition in the former is defined, at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(H), by cross-referencing various portions of the federal Controlled Substances Act, which define offenses based in part on the amount of drugs involved. Section 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), by contrast, defines the same phrase as \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ... for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d Thus, when <em>Sanchez </em>held that underlying convictions required proof of the amount of drugs involved, it did so because of the statutory definition of \u201cserious drug offense\u201d applicable to \u00a7 3559(c). The stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>utory definition of that phrase in \u00a7 924(e) has no such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The offenses here are second degree felonies under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) for sale of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to sell. Second degree felony drug convictions qualify as serious drug offenses for purposes of the ACCA because they carry maximum penalties of more than ten years, regardless of the quantities involved. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.082(3)(c). Thus, the district court properly overruled Flores\u2019s objection to the PSI on this basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Flores also contended that two of the three underlying convictions used to classify him as an armed career criminal were handed down on the same day, so they were not \u201ccommitted on different occasions\u201d as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). PSI Addendum, upon which the district court relied, noted that there were actually four separate offenses. This implies that even if the two convictions from the same day only constituted a single occasion, there were still a total of three, sufficient for classification as an armed career criminal under \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Neither the PSI Addendum nor the district court addressed Flores\u2019s argument that <em>United States v. Sneed </em>precluded the use of police reports and other sources that were not approved in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), in determining whether offenses were committed on different occasions. 600 F.3d 1326, 1333 (11th Cir.2010). First, we note that Flores\u2019s factual proffer\u2014an acceptable source under <em>Shepard, see Sneed, </em>600 F.3d at 1383 (listing <em>Shepard- </em>approved sources)\u2014lists the four separate convictions mentioned in the PSI Addendum, so <em>Sneed </em>does not undermine the conclusion in the PSI. Second, as the government notes, though two of Flores\u2019s convictions occurred on the same day, the crimes occurred separately, on September 23, 2006 and October 5, 2006. Flores does not dispute the government\u2019s assertion that these details are found in the Informations and Judgments for these cases, which are approved sources under <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Flores also challenged his criminal history category, but that objection is irrelevant once his classification under \u00a7 924(e) is established. Section 924(e) includes a statutory minimum sentence of fifteen years, which is precisely the sentence Flores received. Consequently, regardless of whether a <em>Jones </em>violation occurred, Flores\u2019s objections to the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding his objections to the PSI either fail or are inconsequential. He was properly categorized as an armed career criminal under the ACCA, a crime and classification to which he pled guilty. Accordingly, he was reasonably sentenced to the statutory minimum period for this crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">II. Flores\u2019s Tenth Amendment Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">Flores further claims that we should vacate his sentence because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) violates the Tenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Amendment. Regardless of whether this argument was preserved, we must determine whether the statute is unconstitutional. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>59 F.3d 1196, 1198 (11th Cir.1995) (noting that the plain error standard applies to claims that have not been preserved but that there is \u201cno plainer error than to allow a conviction to stand under a statute which Congress was without power to enact\u201d). We have held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not unconstitutional facially. See <em>United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 715-16 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201c[T]his court has already held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not constitutionally invalid under the Commerce Clause ... [provided] that the government prove[s] some \u2018minimal nexus\u2019 to interstate commerce.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Nor is the statute unconstitutional as applied in these exact circumstances. Flores\u2019s factual proffer establishes that the firearm and ammunition in this case were manufactured outside the state of Florida, and that creates a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce to overcome Flores\u2019s Tenth Amendment challenge under our precedent. <em>Id. </em>(noting that the government may establish the minimal nexus \u201cby demonstrating that the firearm ... traveled in interstate commerce[,] [and] [h]ere, the government established that the firearms ... were manufactured outside of Florida [meaning they] necessarily traveled in interstate commerce\u201d (citation, internal quotation marks, and alteration omitted)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Having thoroughly reviewed Flores\u2019s objections to his sentence and the district court\u2019s legal conclusions, we find them meritless. Flores pled guilty to crimes which carry a fifteen year minimum sentence, and that is precisely the sentence he received. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-6\">. <em>Jones </em>required <em>post-imposition </em>elicitations to ensure that objections related to \"what transpire[d] at the sentencing hearing itself\u201d would be addressed. 899 F.2d at 1102. The court\u2019s elicitation for <em>anyone </em>to state whether the court was mistaken seems to satisfy the purpose of <em>Jones </em>but not its timing requirement. We have not held, however, that a <em>Jones </em>violation \u2014 failing to elicit objections <em>post-imposition </em>\u2014 will be deemed harmless so long as the court elicited objections at some point following the objectionable conduct, and we need not do so to decide this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\"><em>. </em>\u201cTypically, when a defendant fails to object to an alleged error before the district court, we review the argument only for plain error,\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1240 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Appellants claiming a <em>Jones </em>violation almost always do so in order to avoid being subjected to plain error review. Here, as already discussed, based on <em>Weir </em>and by virtue of the fact that Flores raised his objections below, Flores was never at risk of being subjected to plain error review, so establishing a <em>Jones </em>violation would not help him unless he has new objections, which he does not.</p>\n<p id=\"AAs\">in any event, the remedy for a <em>Jones </em>violation is not automatic remand as Flores seems to suggest. Where, as here, the record is sufficient to permit meaningful appellate review of any objections, we may review such objections and remedy the <em>Jones </em>violation by reviewing under a preserved error standard. <em>See id. </em>at 1242. Therefore, even if there were a <em>Jones </em>violation, the remedy would be to review Flores\u2019s objections as if they were preserved below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\">. We note that technically, the district court erred by stating that the Eleventh Circuit had previously rejected a similar argument. The cases cited in the PSI addendum are actually district court opinions. <em>See Jackson v. United States, </em>923 F.Supp.2d 1334, 1338 (M.D.Fla. 2013) (citing <em>Brantley v. United States, </em>Nos. 8:11-CV-1750-T-33EAJ, 8:09-CR-132-T-33EAJ, 2011 WL 6057510, at *8 (M.D.Fla. Dec. 6, 2011)). The government\u2019s response to Flores\u2019s pro se motion erroneously cited the same cases as Eleventh Circuit decisions, perhaps explaining the same error in the PSI. Regardless, the reasoning of the opinions is correct and flows obviously from the text of the relevant statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\">. Flores essentially concedes this point but notes that the Supreme Court has granted certiorari to determine whether the Tenth Amendment poses any limitation on Congress's authority to regulate intrastate criminal activity. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>681 F.3d 149 (3d Cir.2012), <em>cert. </em>granted,- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 978, 184 L.Ed.2d 758 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
