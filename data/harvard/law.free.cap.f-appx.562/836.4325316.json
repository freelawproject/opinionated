Oak Grove argues that Cook was not entitled to the statutory presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis; that the administrative law judge should have admitted the interpretation of an x-ray by Dr. Scott Loveless; and that Oak Grove rebutted the presumption that Cook was totally disabled. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Cook was entitled to a presumption of total disability attributable to pneumoconiosis. A worker is entitled to a presumption that he is totally disabled if he worked in underground mines at least 15 years and proves that he has a totally disabling respiratory impairment. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 111-148, \u00a7 1556, 124 Stat. 119, 260 (2010); 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4). Oak Grove did not dispute that Cook had worked in underground mines for 16 years, and the administrative law judge was entitled to find that Cook was totally disabled based on two pulmonary function tests in June 2009 and February 2010 that revealed he had disabling respiratory impairments. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(b)(2)(i). The technician who administered the February 2010 test reported, as he was required to do, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 718.103(b)(5), that Cook\u2019s cooperation was \u201cinconsistent\u201d and \u201cpoor,\u201d and the administrative law judge considered Cook\u2019s behavior in deciding whether to credit the results of the test. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 718 App. B. (\u201cIf it is established that one or more standards have not been met, the claims adjudicator may consider such fact in determining the evidentiary weight to be given to the results of the ventilatory function tests.\u201d). \u201cWe do not question the weight accorded ... [the February 2010 test] by the ALJ, for such is not within our scope of review.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Ala. By-Products Corp., </em>862 F.2d 1529, 1531 n. 1 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">Dr. Phillip O\u2019Reilly opined that the June 2009 test showed a \u201csevere restriction\u201d and that Cook was \u201c50 [to] 75% impaired,\u201d but O\u2019Reilly\u2019s opinion did not constitute \u201ccontrary probative evidence\u201d to negate the test, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(b)(2). O\u2019Reilly did not dispute the validity of the June 2009 test, <em>see Lollar v. Ala. ByProducts Corp., </em>893 F.2d 1258, 1267 (11th Cir.1990), or address whether Cook could resume work as a coal miner or engage in comparable work, see 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(b)(2)(iv). O\u2019Reilly determined that the results of an arterial blood gas study performed in June 2009 were normal, but that test result did \u201cnot, by itself, negate\u201d the finding that Cook suffered from a totally disabling respiratory impairment, <em>see Lollar, </em>893 F.2d at 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Oak Grove argues that the administrative law judge should have admitted Dr. Loveless\u2019s reading of an x-ray as showing no pneumoconiosis because it was a \u201crecord of Cook\u2019s medical treatment\u201d or, alternatively, because it was necessary to understand the medical notes of Cook\u2019s pulmonary specialist, but we decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>consider arguments that Oak Grove failed to exhaust during the administrative proceedings. Under the Black Lung Benefits Act, \u201cin the absence of good cause,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.456(b)(1), a party may not introduce more than \u201ctwo chest x-ray interpretations ... in support of [its] affirmative case,\u201d id. \u00a7 725.414(a)(2)(i), (a)(3)(i), \u201cone physician\u2019s interpretation of each chest x-ray ... in rebuttal of the case presented by the opposing party,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 725.414(a)(2)(h), (a)(8)(h), and \u201cany record of ... medical treatment for a respiratory or pulmonary or related disease,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 725.414(a)(4). During the proceedings before the administrative law judge, Oak Grove submitted Loveless\u2019s reading \u201cin rebuttal of [Cook\u2019s] case\u201d and, alternatively, \u201cin support of [its] affirmative case.\u201d Oak Grove argued in its petition to the Benefits Review Board that there was \u201cgood cause\u201d to admit Loveless\u2019s reading to understand the notes of Cook\u2019s pulmonary specialist, but the Board declined to consider the argument because it had not been presented to the administrative law judge. <em>See Del Monte Fresh Produce v. Dir., OWCP, </em>568 F.3d 1216, 1223 (11th Cir.2009). We also will not consider arguments that Oak Grove never presented to the administrative law judge. <em>See Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor v. Drummond Coal Co., </em>831 F.2d 240, 243 (11th Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Taft v. Ala. By-Products Corp., </em>733 F.2d 1518, 1523 (11th Cir.1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Substantial evidence also supports the finding that Oak Grove failed to rebut the presumption that Cook was totally disabled. An employer can rebut the presumption by proving either that the miner did not suffer from legal or clinical pneu-moconiosis or that the miner\u2019s totally disabling impairment is unrelated to his pneu-moconiosis. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(d). Oak Grove contends that the administrative law judge erroneously disregarded two computed tomography scans as proof that Cook did not suffer from pneumoconiosis, but Oak Grove failed to establish that the scans were \u201cmedically acceptable test[s] or procedure[s]\u201d that warranted consideration, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.107(a). Even if we were to assume that the administrative law judge erred in failing to consider the scans, any error was harmless because the interpretations of the scans did not mention pneumoconiosis. \u201cRebuttal requires affirmative proof that pneumoconiosis does not and did not exist, not silence as to whether the miner\u2019s severe lung condition is or is not pneumoco-niosis.\u201d <em>Black Diamond Coal Mining Co. v. Benefits Review Bd., </em>758 F.2d 1532, 1534 (11th Cir.1985). And Oak Grove did not challenge the finding that it failed to prove that Cook\u2019s impairment was unrelated to his pneumoconiosis; Oak Grove instead argued to the Board that Cook did not have pneumoconiosis. The Board was not obliged to review a finding about causation not disputed by Oak Grove. <em>See Del Monte, </em>563 F.3d at 1223.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">We AFFIRM the decision to award benefits to Cook.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
