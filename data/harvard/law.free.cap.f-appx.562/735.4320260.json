Mr. Reddy became the subject of an undercover law enforcement operation after an officer using the persona of a 15-year-old boy named \u201cSteven\u201d responded to Mr. Reddy\u2019s online Craigslist ad for oral sex. Through a series of emails and text messages, Mr. Reddy set up a meeting with \u201cSteven\u201d for oral sex. Officers arrested Mr. Reddy upon his arrival at the designated meeting place.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Mr. Reddy challenges his conviction on three grounds: (1) the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction because he did not learn that \u201cSteven\u201d was 15 years old until after \u201cSteven\u201d had assented to engage in sexual activity; (2) the district court\u2019s jury instructions constructively amended his indictment by including attempt to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), where the indictment did not clearly allege attempt; and (3) multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-13\">After carefully reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the relevant portions of the records, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">I. Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>a verdict challenged for sufficiency of the evidence. <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1333 (11th Cir.2010). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and resolve all reasonable inferences and credibility evaluations in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Doe, </em>661 F.3d 550, 560 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">To sustain a conviction for a crime of attempt under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), the government first must prove (1) that the defendant acted with the specific intent to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to engage in unlawful sexual activity, and (2) that he took a substantial step toward the commission of the offense. <em>United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11th Cir.2004). As to intent, the government must prove that the \u201cdefendant intended to cause assent on the part of the minor,\u201d not that he acted with the specific intent to engage in the sexual activity. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>603 F.3d 904, 913 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>(11th Cir.2010). An attempt to \u201cstimulate or cause the minor to engage in sexual activity\u201d fits the statutory definition of persuasion or inducement. <em>Murrell, </em>368 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">\u201cA substantial step can be shown when the defendant\u2019s objective acts mark his conduct as criminal and, as a whole, strongly corroborate the required culpability.\u201d <em>United States v. Yost, </em>479 F.3d 815, 819 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). In <em>Murrell, </em>for example, we held that the defendant, who had arranged to have sex with a minor at a hotel, took a substantial step toward his goal of inducing her to engage in sexual activity because he (1) made incriminating statements to an undercover law enforcement officer; (2) traveled several hours to meet the girl at the hotel; and (3) brought with him a teddy bear, money to pay the girl\u2019s father, and a box of condoms. <em>Murrell, </em>368 F.3d at 1288. <em>See also Yost, </em>479 F.3d at 820 (holding that the defendant took a substantial step that \u201ccrossed the line from mere \u2018talk\u2019 to inducement\u201d by placing a call to an undercover officer posing as a minor, posting sexually explicit pictures online, and making arrangements to meet the minor).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Here, the evidence was sufficient to support Mr. Reddy\u2019s conviction for an attempt offense under \u00a7 2422(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">First, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Mr. Reddy intended to cause a minor to assent to unlawful sexual activity. <em>See Lee, </em>603 F.3d at 914. Throughout their e-mail and text-message correspondence, Mr. Reddy specifically and repeatedly asked the 15-year-old \u201cSteven\u201d whether he agreed to perform oral sex.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, the correspondence showed that Mr. Reddy intended to induce \u201cSteven\u201d to engage in oral sex by discussing with him where they could meet, sending him a photo, asking him whether he had \u201cdone it before,\u201d and mentioning the size of his own genitalia. <em>See Murrell, </em>368 F.3d at 1287.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Second, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Mr. Reddy took a \u201csubstantial step\u201d toward causing \u201cSteven\u201d to assent to sexual contact with him. <em>See Lee, </em>603 F.3d at 915. Mr. Reddy asked for \u201cSteven\u2019s\u201d phone number and initiated a text-message conversation, during which he explicitly propositioned \u201cSteven\u201d for oral sex. <em>See Yost, </em>479 F.3d at 820 (finding that a call placed to an undercover officer posing as a minor constituted a substantial step); <em>Murrell, </em>368 F.3d at 1288 (finding that incriminating statements to an undercover officer constituted a substantial step). Mr. Reddy also made arrangements to meet \u201cSteven\u201d at a specified location, and he later drove to that location. <em>See Yost, </em>479 F.3d at 820; <em>Murrell, </em>368 F.3d at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">Mr. Reddy\u2019s argument that \u201cSteven\u201d agreed to oral sex before revealing his age \u2014 and that consequently Mr. Reddy neither had the intent nor took a substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>tial step to cause a minor\u2019s assent \u2014 fails for two reasons. For starters, the record is unclear as to whether \u201cSteven\u201d assented to perform a specific sexual activity before telling Mr. Reddy that he was 15 years old. \u201cSteven\u2019s\u201d first e-mail to Mr. Reddy stated that he \u201cwas interested,\u201d and his second e-mail gave his age as 15 and discussed whether Mr. Reddy would \u201chost.\u201d In neither e-mail, however, did \u201cSteven\u201d expressly state that he assented to oral sex or any other sexual activity. In addition, the record is clear that once Mr. Reddy learned that \u201cSteven\u201d was 15 years old, he specifically and repeatedly asked \u201cSteven\u201d if he would assent to perform oral sex. <em>See Lee, </em>603 F.3d at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support both the intent and the substantial step requirements for an attempt offense under \u00a7 2422(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">II. Constructive Amendment of Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">We review jury instructions <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they misstated the law or misled the jury. <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2000). Constructive amendment of an indictment generally constitutes <em>per se </em>reversible error. <em>United States v. Behety, </em>32 F.3d 503, 508 (11th Cir.1994). We recently held, however, that \u201cin cases where the defendant fails to object to a constructive amendment, we apply traditional plain-error review.\u201d <em>United States v. Madden, </em>733 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">A constructive amendment occurs \u201cwhen the essential elements of the offense contained in the indictment are altered to broaden the possible bases for conviction beyond what is contained in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Keller, </em>916 F.2d 628, 634 (11th Cir.1990). A constructive amendment does not occur simply because a \u201cjury instruction did not exactly match the form of the indictment,\u201d so long as \u201cthe substance of the indictment remained intact.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>525 F.3d 1033, 1046 (11th Cir.2008). In determining whether an indictment is sufficient, we read it as a whole and give it a \u201ccommon sense construction.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>582 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2009) (quotations omitted). Additionally, \u201c[t]he law is well established that where an indictment charges in the conjunctive several means of violating a statute, a conviction may be obtained on proof of only one of the means, and accordingly the jury instruction may properly be framed in the disjunctive.\u201d <em>Simpson, </em>228 F.3d at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">We review whether the district court constructively amended Reddy\u2019s indictment for plain error because Mr. Red-dy failed to raise objections on the matter before the court. <em>See Madden, </em>733 F.3d at 1322. The district court did not plainly err because the jury\u2019s instructions reflected the substance of the indictment. <em>See Moore, </em>525 F.3d at 1046. The indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ment alleged that Reddy had \u201cused and attempted to use a facility of interstate commerce ... to knowingly persuade, induce, entice, and coerce\u201d a minor to engage in a sexual activity.\u201d The \u201ccommon sense construction\u201d of this language is that it conjunctively charged Mr. Reddy with both the attempted and completed offense. <em>See Jordan, </em>582 F.3d 1239, 1245. The indictment\u2019s use of the conjunctive, in turn, allowed the jury to be charged that the government need only prove the attempted offense. <em>See Simpson, </em>228 F.3d at 1300.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not constructively amend the indictment, and thus did not commit plain error. <em>See Madden, </em>733 F.3d at 1322; <em>Moore, </em>525 F.3d at 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">III. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Finally, Mr. Reddy argues that he was deprived of a fair trial due to multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments. We ordinarily review a claim of prosecutorial misconduct <em>de novo. United States v. Merrill, </em>513 F.3d 1293, 1306 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cHowever, with respect to a prosecutor\u2019s statements made during closing where the defendant did not raise this objection at trial, we review only for plain error,\u201d which is an error that is \u201cso obvious that failure to correct it would jeopardize the fairness and integrity of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1306-07 (quotation omitted). To establish prosecu-torial misconduct, \u201c(1) the remarks must be improper, and (2) the remarks must prejudicially affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307 (quotation omitted). A defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudicially affected when a reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different. <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">As Mr. Reddy did not raise any objections to the government\u2019s closing argument, we review for plain error. <em>See Merrill, </em>513 F.3d at 1306-07. Mr. Reddy challenges three statements that the government made during closing argument: (1) references to Mr. Reddy\u2019s position as a pediatrician that were allegedly designed to enflame the jury\u2019s emotions;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) references to Mr. Reddy\u2019s subpoena power that improperly shifted the burden of proof onto Mr. Redding;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (3) a statement that improperly bolstered the testifying police officers\u2019 credibility.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">Of these three statements, only the first is potentially improper. The statement regarding Mr. Redding\u2019s subpoena power was proper because Mr. Redding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>had specifically called attention to the government\u2019s failure to call the witness in question. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1439 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation omitted) (\u201c[I]t is not improper for a prosecutor to note that the defendant has the same subpoena powers as the government, particularly when done in response to a defendant\u2019s argument about the prosecutor\u2019s failure to call a specific witness.\u201d). The statement regarding the testifying police officers was not improper bolstering because it merely \u201cacknow-ledg[ed] that adverse legal consequences would flow from lying under oath\u201d and responded to Mr. Redding\u2019s strategy \u201cto attack and undermine the credibility\u201d of the officers, both of which are permissible. <em>See United States v. Bernal-Benitez, </em>594 F.3d 1303, 1314 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">As to the statement regarding Mr. Redding\u2019s being a pediatrician, it was improper because his job was irrelevant to whether he had violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b). However, Mr. Reddy cannot demonstrate prejudice in light of the strong independent evidence of his guilt. The emails and text messages that he sent to \u201cSteven\u201d propositioning him for oral sex, as well as his arrival at the designated meeting place, provided an ample basis for the jury to convict him. He has thus not shown \u201ca reasonable probability ... that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>See Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 947. Moreover, the curative effect of the district court\u2019s repeated advisements to the jury that attorneys\u2019 statements were not evidence weigh against Mr. Reddy\u2019s claim. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cProsecutorial misconduct must be considered in the context of the entire trial, along with any curative instruction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Mr. Reddy\u2019s conviction for an attempt offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-11\">. A defendant can be convicted of an attempt offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) even if there is no actual minor victim. <em>See United States v. Root, </em>296 F.3d 1222, 1227 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that the defendant\u2019s \"belief that a minor was involved is sufficient to sustain an attempt conviction\u2019\u2019), <em>superseded by Guideline amendment on other grounds, as recognized in United States v. Jerchower, </em>631 F.3d 1181, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\">. Although some of Mr. Reddy\u2019s comments were rather sheepish and betrayed worry that \"Steven\u201d would not want to go through with the plan (e.g., \"r u sure u wanna do this?\u201d or \"i am not among those cute asian guys\u201d), a jury could very reasonably interpret these comments as designed to shore up \"Steven\u2019s\u201d assent and thus \"stimulate or cause [him] to engage in sexual activity.\u201d <em>See Murrell, </em>368 F.3d at 1287. Indeed, sheepish enticement is still enticement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b759-12\">. The fact that Mr. Reddy did not post his initial ad on a forum designed for adults to meet minors, unlike the defendants in <em>Mwrell </em>and <em>Yost, </em>does not take his subsequent conduct out of \u00a7 2422(b)\u2019s scope. After he learned \"Steven\u201d was only 15 years old, he continued to make comments \u2014 e.g. \"u wanna suck me?\u201d \u2014 that a jury could reasonably interpret as intended to \"cause the minor to engage in sexual activity.\u201d <em>See Murrell, </em>368 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b760-7\">. Mr. Reddy argues that even if there is sufficient evidence to convict him, we should recommend this case for <em>en banc </em>review so that we may reconsider the definition of \"inducement\" as used in the context of \u00a7 2422(b). We decline the invitation. An <em>en banc </em>hearing \"an extraordinary procedure intended to bring to the attention of the entire court a precedent-setting error of exceptional importance in an appeal or other proceeding,\u201d as well as \"a panel opinion that is allegedly in direct conflict with precedent of the Supreme Court or of this circuit.\u201d 11th Cir. R. 35-3. No such circumstances exist here. Mr. Reddy concedes that we are bound by the definition of \"inducement\u201d given in <em>Murrell, </em>368 F.3d at 1287. Although he argues that this definition conflicts with other courts\u2019 definitions, he does not contend that Murrell conflicts with our precedent or with a Supreme Court decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\">. Mr. Reddy\u2019s suggested interpretation of his indictment \u2014 that the word \"attempt\u201d modified only the phrase \"to use a facility Of interstate commerce\u201d \u2014 does not make sense. Mr. Redding could never complete his persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a minor if he attempted, but failed, to use an interstate-commerce facility. Thus, logically, \"attempt\u201d can only be understood to modify the entire sentence including \"persuade, induce, entice....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b761-9\">. The prosecutor referred to Mr. Reddy as \"a pediatric resident,\u201d \"a doctor who\u2019s supposed to heal children and instead is trying to hurt one.\u201d He further stated that Mr. Redding had \"a responsibility to take care of children. He abused that. He took advantage of it, and that is wrong.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b761-14\">. In response to Mr. Redding\u2019s statement to the jury that the government failed to call a certain witness, the prosecutor stated that Mr. Reddy \"can compel anybody to be here. That\u2019s one of the rights that the Defendant has. The Court can issue subpoenas and compel anybody to be here and testify.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b761-15\">. The prosecutor stated that the investigating officers had \"no motive for coming in here and telling you a lie, risking their careers, risking their futures, risking their reputations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
