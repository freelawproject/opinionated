On appeal, Withrow argues that the district court erred in failing to grant a \u201cfull\u201d sentence reduction in his prior \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government argues that Withrow\u2019s quest for a reduced sentence is barred by the law-of-the-case doctrine. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-19\">In 2009, Withrow was sentenced to 144 months\u2019 imprisonment for conspiracy to distribute at least 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. In 2012, Withrow filed pro se his first motion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. Pursuant to Amendments 750 and 759, the district court reduced Withrow\u2019s total offense level from 29 to 25, which resulted in a revised guidelines range of 110 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, because With-row\u2019s offense carried a statutory 10 year mandatory minimum sentence, the resulting guidelines range was 120 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, citing particularly to Withrow\u2019s extensive criminal history and the need to protect the public from his further crimes, and decided to grant only a \u201cminimal reduction.\u201d The court then resentenced Withrow to a term of 137 months\u2019 imprisonment, representing the high end of the amended range. On appeal, we affirmed in an unpublished opinion, rejecting Withrow\u2019s arguments that (1) his original variance should have resulted in a similar variance below the amended guidelines range; (2) the minimal reduction was contrary to the rationale of Amendment 750; and (3) the Fair Sentencing Act retroactively applied pursuant to <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). <em>United States v. Withrow, </em>508 Fed.Appx. 859, 860-61, 864 (11th Cir.2013) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">Where a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A district court\u2019s application of the law-of-the-case doctrine is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Bobo, </em>419 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, \u201can issue decided at one stage ... is binding at later stages of the same case.\u201d <em>United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560 (11th Cir.1997). Under this doctrine, \u201c[a]n appellate decision binds all subsequent proceedings in the same ease not only as to explicit rulings, but also as to issues decided necessarily by implication on the prior appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996). A district court is obligated to follow our mandates. <em>Id. </em>The law-of-the-case doctrine does not apply if (1) new evidence is presented; (2) there is an intervening change in the law that dictates a different result; or (3) the prior decision is clearly erroneous and would result in manifest injustice. <em>Eseobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d at 1561.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Here, Withrow\u2019s claim fails. The district court correctly noted that, during Withrow\u2019s appeal of his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, we already considered and rejected Withrow\u2019s argument that he should have been given a \u201cfull\u201d sentence reduction. <em>See Withrow, </em>508 Fed.Appx. at 864. Because Withrow has not shown new evidence, an intervening change in the law, clear error, or manifest injustice, the law-of-the-case doctrine bars his raising this argument again in a second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-16\">. Withrow also raised breach-of-contract, equal-protection, and due-process claims before the district court, but has failed to raise these arguments on appeal. Thus, we deem these claims abandoned. <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
