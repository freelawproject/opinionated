His sentence was enhanced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), because the district court determined that Spann had at least three prior convictions for either violent felonies or serious drug offenses. He received a 184-month prison term. Relying on <em>National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, - </em>U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012) <em>(National </em>Federation), Spann contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) exceeds Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause. Spann argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied because his factual resume did not state that his possession of the firearm was an economic activity and failed to reflect that he was engaged in the relevant market at the time of the regulated conduct. He also contends that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is facially unconstitutional because <em>National Federation </em>interprets the Commerce Clause to mandate that \u201cCongress may regulate only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ongoing economic activity,\u201d and his possession of a firearm purchased many years ago does not qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">We review Spann\u2019s arguments de novo. <em>United States v. Kay, </em>513 F.3d 432, 440 (5th Cir.2007). This court rejected Spann\u2019s arguments regarding <em>National Federation </em>in <em>United States v. Alcantar, </em>733 F.3d 143, 145-46 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1570, 188 L.Ed.2d 579, 2014 WL 682525 (Mar. 24, 2014) (No. 13-8792).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Spann also argues that the Texas offense of evading arrest using a vehicle in violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 38.04(b)(1)(B) is not a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. He contends that his evading arrest conviction did not constitute a violent felony because the Texas offense can be committed by fleeing in any vehicle, not just a motor vehicle. He argues that because in <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of the use of a motor vehicle during flight, this court should reconsider <em>United States v. Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009), which held that the Texas offense of evading arrest with a vehicle was a violent felony under the ACCA because \u201cfleeing by vehicle poses a serious risk of injury to others.\u201d We review de novo the district court\u2019s \u201clegal conclusions underlying the district court\u2019s application of the ACCA.\u201d <em>United States v. Fuller, </em>453 F.3d 274, 278 (5th Cir.2006). In <em>Sykes, </em>the Supreme Court held that an Indiana conviction for resisting law enforcement through felonious vehicle flight was a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s residual clause. 131 S.Ct. at 2277. The Supreme Court noted that this decision was consistent with decisions of various circuit courts including this court\u2019s decision in <em>Harrimon. Id. </em>at 2272. We have rejected the arguments that the Texas statute is not a violent felony because it can be committed by fleeing in any vehicle, not just a motor vehicle, and that <em>Sykes </em>overruled <em>Harri-mon </em>because it emphasized the use of a motor vehicle during flight. <em>See United States v. Standberry, </em>546 Fed.Appx. 381, 382 (5th Cir.2013). Because <em>Sykes </em>did not overrule <em>Harrimon </em>either explicitly or implicitly, we are bound by our decision in <em>Harrimon. Id. </em>As the evading arrest conviction is Spann\u2019s third qualifying conviction for the armed career criminal enhancement, we do not address whether Spann\u2019s robbery conviction is a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Finally, Spann argues that the residual clause of the ACCA is unconstitutionally vague and cites, inter alia, Justioe Scalia\u2019s dissent in <em>Sykes </em>in support. <em>See Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2284. As Spann concedes, however, the Supreme Court has rejected the argument that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. <em>See United States v. Gore, </em>636 F.3d 728, 742 (5th Cir.2011) (citing <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 210 n. 6, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
