He contends that the district court erred in dismissing his <em>pro se </em>action without informing him of the opportunity to file a motion to amend his complaint or of his right to appeal. Warning also asserts that the district court erred because it failed to explain the deficiencies in his complaint so that he could properly amend it.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-23\">Warning\u2019s initial, counseled complaint raised a number of claims that stemmed from the Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s foreclosure of his property. The district court dismissed that complaint in August 2012. After retaining new counsel, Warning filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied. He then submitted a second motion for reconsideration, this time as a <em>pro se </em>litigant. The district court again denied the motion, citing a local rule which prohibits parties from asking the court to reconsider its denial of an earlier motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-24\">Warning appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and its denial of his two motions for reconsideration. This Court issued an order on January 28, 2014, concluding that Warning\u2019s appeal was untimely with respect to the dismissal of his complaint and the denial of his first motion for reconsideration. The order permitted Warning to proceed only with his appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his second motion for reconsideration. As a result, we will consider only Warning\u2019s arguments challenging the denial of his second motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-25\">Warning\u2019s brief to this Court, however, does not address the denial of his second motion for reconsideration except for the occasional passing reference to it. He instead focuses on the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint. Although we liberally construe the pleadings of <em>pro se </em>litigants, \u201cissues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). And even if he had not abandoned his challenge of the district court\u2019s denial of his second motion for reconsideration, the district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>abuse its discretion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by denying it. Rule 7.2E of the Civil Local Rules of Practice for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia provides that parties \u201cshall not file motions to reconsider the court\u2019s denial of a prior motion for reconsideration.\u201d LR 7.2E, NDGa. The district court\u2019s reliance on that clearly worded local rule was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Clark v. Hous. Auth. of City of Alma, </em>971 F.2d 723, 727 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201c[T]his circuit gives great deference to a district court\u2019s interpretation of its local rules.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-22\">. We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Richardson v. Johnson, </em>598 F.3d 734, 740 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
