California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). De La Garza-Montemayor has filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as De La Garza-Montemayor\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. In his response, De La Garza-Montemayor contends, inter alia, that his below-range sentence should not be entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because his guideline sentencing range was calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, which he argues is not based on empirical evidence. That contention is foreclosed, <em>see United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009), but by raising the argument De La Garza-Montemayor has preserved it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
