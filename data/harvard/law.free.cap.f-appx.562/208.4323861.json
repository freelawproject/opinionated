Du Bois appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and denial of her motion for leave to amend. In her original complaint, Du Bois asserted claims for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1985 and 1986. Du Bois alleged that Defendants-Appellees had, among other things, exerted undue influence over Du Bois\u2019s mother in an attempt to alienate Du Bois from her mother and conspired to prevent Du Bois from becoming her mother\u2019s guardian. The district court ordered Du Bois to submit a statement of the basis for subject matter jurisdiction over the lawsuit. In response, Du Bois argued that Defendants-Appellees had conspired to deprive her of the equal protection of the laws in violation of \u00a7 1985(3) and had violated the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. In a thorough memorandum and recommendation, the magistrate judge, noting that Du Bois had conceded that diversity jurisdiction was lacking, concluded that Du Bois was not able to state any claims under federal law and therefore could not establish subject matter jurisdiction. The district court adopted the memorandum and recommendation and further concluded that amending the complaint would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-21\">Having reviewed the record on appeal, including the parties\u2019 briefs and the district court\u2019s opinion, we are satisfied that the district court correctly dismissed Du Bois\u2019s lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and acted within its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>in denying leave to amend. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
