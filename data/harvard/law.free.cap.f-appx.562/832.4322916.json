Butler raised four state law claims involving Butler and his son, and their bail bond corporation; and he alleged that the defendants all resided in Alabama. The district court dismissed the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction after finding that Butler failed to allege diversity of citizenship among the parties and failed to plead a colorable claim arising under a federal law or the U.S. Constitution, noting that Butler had made only one footnote reference to constitutional amendments, which was inadequate to invoke federal-question jurisdiction. On appeal, Butler does not mention the dismissal or subject-matter jurisdiction, and argues only the merits of his underlying claims attacking the state cases. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>We review dismissals for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). A federal court may raise jurisdictional issues on its own initiative at any stage of litigation. <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 506, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006). While we liberally interpret briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants, issues not briefed on appeal are deemed abandoned and we will not consider them. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">A district court must have jurisdiction under at least one of the three types of subject-matter jurisdiction: (1) jurisdiction pursuant to a specific statutory grant; (2) federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331; or (3) diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). <em>Baltin v. Alaron Trading Corp., </em>128 F.3d 1466, 1469 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cIt is presumed that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction, and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">For a federal court to have diversity jurisdiction, the action must be between citizens of different states and the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000. <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., </em>545 U.S. 546, 552, 125 S.Ct. 2611, 162 L.Ed.2d 502 (2005). Diversity jurisdiction requires that no plaintiff is a citizen of the same state as any defendant. <em>MacGinnitie v. Hobbs Grp., LLC, </em>420 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Section 1331 provides district courts with subject-matter jurisdiction over \u201call civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. \u201c[A] cause of action arises under federal law only when the plaintiffs well-pleaded complaint raises issues of federal law.\u201d <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, </em>481 U.S. 58, 63, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987). \u201cA well-pleaded complaint presents a federal question where it establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiffs right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.\u201d <em>Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1310 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Even a claim that arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States may be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction if (1) \u201cthe alleged claim under the Constitution or federal statutes clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction,\u201d or (2) \u201csuch a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u201d <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala. v. Sanders, </em>138 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation omitted). A claim is \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous\u201d so as to warrant dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction only \u201cif the claim has no plausible foundation, or if the court concludes that a prior Supreme Court decision clearly forecloses the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">A court must dismiss a complaint if it determines that jurisdiction is lacking. Fed.R.Civ.P.12(h)(3). A district court may dismiss a complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction based on: (1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint plus undisputed facts evidenced in the record; or (3) the complaint plus undisputed facts plus the court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts. <em>Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404, 413 (5th Cir. May 1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, an oppos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>ing party may attack a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Fed. R.CivJP. 12(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">A district court must grant a plaintiff at least one opportunity to amend his complaint before dismissal if \u201cit appears a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\u201d even if the plaintiff never seeks leave to amend. <em>Bank v. Pitt, </em>928 F.2d 1108, 1112 (11th Cir.1991), <em>overruled in part by Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 &amp; n. 1 (11th Cir.2002) (en banc) (holding that a district court is not required to <em>sua sponte </em>grant a counseled plaintiff leave to amend when plaintiff never filed a motion to amend or requested leave to amend before the district court, but expressly noting that the holding did not apply to <em>pro se </em>litigants). On the other hand, where a plaintiff seeks leave to amend a complaint after a responsive pleading has been filed, a district court may properly deny the request when amendment would be futile. <em>Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">A Rule 12(b)(1) motion can be based upon either a facial challenge to the complaint itself or a factual challenge that looks beyond the complaint to evidence concerning jurisdiction. <em>McElmurray v. Consol. Gov\u2019t of Augusta-Richmond Cnty., </em>501 F.3d 1244, 1251 (11th Cir.2007). A \u201cfacial attack\u201d requires a district court \u201cmerely to look to the complaint to see if the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a basis of subject matter jurisdiction, and the allegations in his complaint are taken as true for the purposes of the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Only the United States as prosecutor can bring a complaint under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242, the criminal analogue of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Hanna v. Home Ins. Co., </em>281 F.2d 298, 303 (5th Cir.1960) (\u201cThe sections of Title 18 [\u00a7\u00a7 241-242] may be disregarded in this suit. They are criminal in nature and provide no civil remedies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Here, Butler\u2019s claims fail for two reasons. First, Butler has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because he does not offer any argument regarding, or even mention, the dismissal or subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874. Second, assuming Butler has adequately challenged the dismissal, his challenge fails because his first amended complaint did not allege a basis on which the district court could have exercised jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">To begin with, Butler failed to allege diversity jurisdiction, stating only that he and all of the defendants were residents of Alabama. The amended complaint also failed to raise issues of federal law. Rather, the four-count amended complaint raised state and common law causes of action for fraud, conspiracy, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duty. The sole reference to federal law in the amended complaint \u2014 a single footnote citation listing, without context or elaboration, various constitutional amendments \u2014 is inadequate to demonstrate a federal question under the well-pleaded complaint rule. Moreover, the attached copies of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242 are similarly unavailing, and are, in any event, inapplicable because they are criminal statutes that do not provide a civil cause of action or any civil remedy. <em>Hanna, </em>281 F.2d at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">Although Butler purported to assert two \u201cfederal questions\u201d in his response to the motions to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>amended complaint, the district court was not required to consider those assertions because dismissal was proper based on the amended complaint alone. <em>Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 413. Further, to the extent that the court construed the defendants\u2019 12(b)(6) motions as Rule 12(b)(1) motions, it was still only required to look to the face of the complaint, because their jurisdictional arguments were facial, not factual. <em>McElmurray, </em>501 F.3d at 1251. Finally, because the court (1) <em>sua sponte </em>allowed Butler to amend his original complaint once to cure any pleading deficiencies, and (2) later found that further amendment would have been futile, it was not required to consider additional or amended pleadings, and there is no indication that Butler could amend the operative pleading to adequately state a viable claim. <em>Bank, </em>928 F.2d at 1112; <em>Hall, </em>367 F.3d at 1262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-7\">.
