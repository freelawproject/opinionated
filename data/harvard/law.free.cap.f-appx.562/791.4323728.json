On appeal, Ashcraft does not challenge his mandatory minimum 120-month prison term or the special conditions of supervised release. Rather, Ashcraft contends that the supervised release term itself is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">Then, we examine whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>Although we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). The defendant bears the burden to show his sentence is unreasonable in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">While the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it need not address each factor explicitly; rather a statement that the court has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the parties\u2019 arguments is sufficient to show the factors were adequately considered. <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1278 (11th Cir.2008). The weight given to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is within the district court\u2019s sound discretion and \u201cwe will not substitute our judgment\u201d in weighing those factors. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1261 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). We reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">As to procedural reasonableness, Ash-craft argues that the district court failed to make case-specific findings to support a life term of supervised release. Ashcraft does not cite to any authority requiring the district court to make specific findings of fact to support the supervised release term. Under our precedent, the district court is not required to address each factor on the record, but must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and must adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) (providing that a district court \u201cat the time of sentencing, shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence\u201d). Generally, when the sentence imposed is within the advisory guidelines range, the \u201cdistrict court is not required to give a lengthy explanation for its sentence if the case is typical of those contemplated by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">Here, the district court adequately explained the chosen supervised release term, which was within the advisory guidelines range of five years to life. After confirming that there were no objections to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the district court also calculated Ashcraft\u2019s prison term under the advisory guidelines and imposed the ten-year mandatory minimum prison term. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (stating that when the high end of the advisory guidelines range is below the statutory mandatory minimum, the mandatory minimum is the guidelines sentence). The district court then stated that it was \u201cgoing to follow up, based on the charging allegations, with a lifetime of supervised release based on the charges.\u201d The district court explained that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the guidelines range and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements, and that the sentence imposed met the goals of punishment and deterrence. After Ash-craft objected to the life term of supervised release, the district court responded, \u201cI find that the term of supervision, given the nature of the offenses is appropriate, and again, having considered all of the factors under 3553(a).\u201d The district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence, including the supervised release term, was ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>quate, and Ashcraft has not shown procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Ashcraft also has not shown that lifetime supervision is substantively unreasonable. Ashcraft\u2019s life term was within both the statutory range and the advisory guidelines range of five years to life. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(k); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(b). We ordinarily expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Furthermore, the policy statement to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(b) recommends the statutory maximum where, as here, the offense is a sex offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(b), p.s. This Court has acknowledged the importance of the policy statement in \u00a7 5D1.2 and the reasoning behind it, stating that it \u201ccannot be read in a vacuum, as the policy statement is derived from the statutory authority in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(k) and is consistent with Congress\u2019s intention to punish sex offenders with life terms of supervised release because of the high rate of recidivism.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1199 (quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">In addition, Ashcraft\u2019s offense was a serious one that involved trying to entice what he thought was a child to have sex with him. According to the undisputed facts in the PSI, Ashcraft responded to an ad on Craigslist posted by an undercover officer posing as a 13-year-old girl. Ash-craft corresponded with the \u201cchild\u201d via email and cell phone text messages, asking her about her age and whether she wanted to have sex with him. Ashcraft arranged to meet the \u201cchild\u201d at a gas station, telling her not to tell anyone. The \u201cchild\u201d texted Ashcraft asking him to buy her Skittles candy at the gas station. When Ashcraft entered the gas station and purchased a bag of Skittles, he was arrested. After his arrest, Ashcraft admitted to investigators that he thought he was communicating with a person who was 13 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Ashcraft points to mitigating facts, such as his willingness to plead guilty, his lack of any serious prior criminal history, and the fact that no real child was involved and no one was harmed. The district court was aware of all of these facts, however, and clearly concluded that the nature of his sex offense and the need for deterrence nonetheless warranted lifetime supervision. Ashcraft essentially asks us to reweigh the factors. However, we do not reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors on appeal and will not remand for resentencing unless the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by imposing a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences. <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). There is no indication that the district court made a clear error of judgment here.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">In sum, Ashcraft has not carried his burden to show that his life term of supervised release is either procedurally or substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
