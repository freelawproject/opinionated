Wright is currently serving a total 84-month sentence that includes 24 months for his convictions for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon (Count 4) and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and five or more grams of cocaine base (Count 6); and a mandatory consecutive 5-year sentence for his conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime (Count 7). Wright\u2019s 24-month sentence was below his advisory guideline range of 100 to 125 months, based on both a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance departure and an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) variance, although the sentencing court did not indicate to what extent its sentence accounted for each of these grounds. In this appeal from the order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Wright argues that: (1) the rule of lenity requires a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction in his favor because \u00a7 lB1.10(b) is ambiguous regarding what to do in his factual situation \u2014 where it is unclear how the district court calculated his sentence, and where a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure of 11 or more levels at his original sentencing would mean that his applicable guideline range was lowered by Amendment 750; and (2) U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2), as amended by Amendment 759 to the Sentencing Guidelines, violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, exceeded the U.S. Sentencing Commission\u2019s authority, and violated the separation of powers doctrine. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). We are bound by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>opinion of a prior panel unless the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc overrules that opinion. <em>Id. </em>The defendant bears the burden of establishing that a retroactive amendment actually lowers his guidelines range. <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The amendment relied upon for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief must lower the \u201capplicable guideline range,\u201d which is \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 lBl.l(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)). If the amendment lowers the defendant\u2019s guideline range, the district court may resentence the defendant, but it may not sentence the defendant to a sentence that is below the low end of the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a), (b)(2)(A). However, the Guidelines provide an exception to this rule and allow the district court to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended range if the original sentence imposed was below the applicable guideline range because of a reduction based upon the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B). This exception only applies to reductions based on substantial assistance following a government motion pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), or Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). Id. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Prior to 2011, the exception in \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) permitted the district court to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range if the original term of imprisonment was below the applicable guideline range, and was not limited to below-guidelines sentences based on substantial assistance departures. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) (2010). Enacted in 2011, Amendment 759 revised the policy statement located in \u00a7 1B1.10 governing motions for sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and restricted the district court\u2019s discretion to reduce a sentence below the amended guideline range except for a comparable reduction when the defendant originally received a below range sentence based on substantial assistance. U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 759 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">In <em>United States v. Colon, </em>an appeal from a denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion pursuant to Amendment 750, we addressed an appellant\u2019s arguments regarding the legality of Amendment 759. 707 F.3d 1255, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2013). First, we held that Amendment 759 did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because Amendment 759\u2019s restriction on the district court\u2019s discretion did not increase the appellant\u2019s punishment above what it was at the time the she committed her crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 1258-59. Second, we concluded that the Sentencing Commission did not exceed its authority under the Sentencing Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994, by amending \u00a7 lB1.10(b) through Amendment 759, because \u00a7 994(a) gave the Commission authority to issue policy statements governing sentencing reductions, and \u00a7 994(u) required the Commission to specify the circumstances in which a sentence may be reduced based on a retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1259-60. Furthermore, we said that \u00a7 lB1.10(b) does not override a court\u2019s decision to vary downward at the original sentencing proceeding, but instead limits the court\u2019s discretion to award a new variance in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 1260. Third, we held that Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>759 did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because \u201cnothing in \u00a7 lB1.10(b) requires a court to undo its original sentencing determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, \u00a7 lB1.10(b) limits the court\u2019s discretion in applying Amendment 750 to previous sentences, a limitation that Congress authorized the Commission to impose. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">To determine a base offense level for an offense that involved different controlled substances, each substance is to be converted to its marijuana equivalent, the quantities are to be added together, and then the offense level is to be determined based on reference to the Drug Quantity Table. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 8(B)) (2012). Pursuant to the 2008 Guidelines, under which Wright initially was sentenced, 1 gram of crack cocaine was equivalent to 20 kilograms of marijuana. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 10(E)) (2008). One gram of powder cocaine was equivalent to 200 grams of marijuana. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Amendment 750, which applies retroactively, equated 1 gram of crack cocaine to 8,571 grams of marijuana. U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 750 (2011); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 8(D)). Amendment 750 did not amend the marijuana equivalency for powder cocaine, and it remains that 1 gram of powder cocaine is equivalent to 200 grams of marijuana. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 8(D)). A defendant\u2019s base offense level is 26 if he was held accountable for at least 100 kilograms, but less than 400 kilograms, of marijuana. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c)(7) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">\u201cThe rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them.\u201d <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 514, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008). \u201cThe simple existence of some statutory ambiguity, however, is not sufficient to warrant application of that rule, for most statutes are ambiguous to some degree.\u201d <em>Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 138, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998). In order for the rule of lenity to apply, there must be a \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138-39, 118 S.Ct. 1911 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Here, the district court did not err in concluding that it lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Wright\u2019s sentence because Wright did not show that his amended guideline range pursuant to Amendment 750 was lower than his current sentence. Although the sentencing court did not indicate how many levels it departed downward under \u00a7 5K1.1, the record is devoid of support for Wright\u2019s claim that the district court had imposed an 11-level \u00a7 5K1.1 departure, which he admits is what would be necessary in order for him to be eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. As the record shows, prior to sentencing, the government moved for a 4-level substantial assistance departure, and the minute entry from sentencing states that the court granted the government\u2019s motion. At sentencing, Wright specifically asked for a 6-level \u00a7 5K1.1 based on his extraordinary assistance, and never made any mention of a greater \u00a7 5K1.1 departure than that. When the court sentenced Wright, it first calculated his total sentence with a 4-level \u00a7 5K1.1 departure, which it indicated would be 130 months. It then stated that it was going to give him a lower sentence because Wright should not be given up on, and concluded that it was going to give him the best sentence it could and still comply with \u00a7 3553(a). Moreover, at the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) hearing, the court\u2019s comments strongly indicated that it had intended, at most, a 6-level departure. Wright\u2019s amended offense level following a 6-level departure would be 17, and, when combined with his criminal history category of IV, would yield an amended guideline range of 37 to 46 months. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Pt. A (table). Accordingly, because Wright\u2019s amended guideline range, accounting for the greatest requested \u00a7 5K1.1 departure, is greater than his original sentence of 24 months, he is ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Further, Wright has not shown any \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty\u201d in \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B), and, thus, the rule of lenity does not apply in this case. Rather than being ambiguous, \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) clearly limits the district court\u2019s ability to further reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below his amended guideline range to situations where a substantial assistance departure previously was given. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B). Wright\u2019s unusual factual situation does not make that guideline grievously ambiguous or uncertain, but instead implicates his ability to show that he is eligible for the exception provided for in \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Nor are we persuaded by Wright\u2019s claim that \u00a7 1B1.10, as amended by Amendment 759, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, exceeds the Sentencing Commission\u2019s authority, and violates the separation of powers doctrine. As he acknowledges, our precedent in <em>Colon </em>squarely forecloses those arguments, and we are bound by the opinion of a prior panel that has not been overturned by the Supreme Court or our Court sitting en banc. <em>See Colon, </em>707 F.3d at 1258-60; <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Wright\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. In addition, this case is not appropriate for summary affirmance and further briefing is unnecessary, so we deny the government\u2019s motion for summary affir-mance.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
