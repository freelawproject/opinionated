Clay now contends that her sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-17\">I. Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b942-18\">From December 2010 to June 2012, Clay and her two codefendants, Chante Mozley and Aid Bonannee, filed around 2,000 fraudulent income tax returns using stolen identities. They filed the returns using Mozle/s Electronic Filing Identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>Number<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and requested that the tax refunds be deposited into bank accounts they controlled. In total, Clay and her codefen-dants sought about $11 million in refunds. The IRS ultimately paid out over $4 million of the requested funds, a substantial portion of which was never recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">In August 2012 a federal grand jury returned a 43-count indictment charging Clay and her codefendants with, among other things, conspiracy to defraud the United States by filing false income tax returns, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 286 (Count 1); filing and obtaining payments for false income tax returns, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 (Counts 29-33); wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (Counts 34-38); and, for Clay only, aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), (2) (Counts 39-43). Clay initially pleaded not guilty to these charges, but she changed course on the first day of trial and \u2014 without a plea agreement \u2014 pleaded guilty to Counts 1 and 40. The district court dismissed the remaining counts against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">On Count 1, the conspiracy charge, the presentence investigation report (PSR) calculated a base offense level of six. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2B1.1(a)(2) (Nov. 2012). The PSR increased that offense level by 20 because the intended loss amount for the offense was between $7 million and $20 million, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(K), and it added an additional 6 levels because the offense involved 250 or more victims, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(C). After subtracting two levels for acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a), the PSR calculated a total offense level of 30. That offense level, coupled with Clay\u2019s criminal history category of I, yielded a guidelines range of 97 to 120 months imprisonment on the conspiracy charge. The aggravated identity theft charge carried a mandatory consecutive sentence of 24 months. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). Neither party objected to the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Although she failed to object to the PSR, Clay did file a motion for a \u201cdownward departure,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in which she argued that she should not be held responsible for the full intended loss amount. In support of that argument, Clay pointed to the disparity between intended loss and actual loss and argued that she played a smaller role in the fraudulent scheme than her codefendants. She also asked the court to consider that she has a child with special needs. The district court denied Clay\u2019s motion and sentenced her to, among other things, 97 months imprisonment on Count 1 and a consecutive 24-month term on Count 40. Clay now appeals her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">II. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">Clay first contends that her sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court (1) failed to adequately explain her sentence as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1); (2) imposed an unwarranted 6-level enhancement for more than 250 victims under U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(C); and (3) erroneously imposed a 20-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(K) for a loss amount greater than $7 million but less than $20 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">A. Explanation for the Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">A district court is required to \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence,\u201d and, if the sentence is a guidelines sentence, its \u201creason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the [advisory guidelines] range.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). If the court fails to adequately explain its chosen sentence, it has committed procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (instructing appellate courts to ensure that \u201cthe district court committed no significant procedural error, such as ... failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u201d). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 3553(c)(1), even if the defendant did not raise that objection in the district court. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176,1181 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Although the law obliges district courts to state the reasons for choosing a particular sentence, \u201ca lengthy discussion is not required in the typical case.\u201d <em>United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). All that is required is that the sentencing judge \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). To meet that standard, the sentencing court need not discuss or explicitly state on the record that it has considered each \u00a7 3553(a) factor as long as it acknowledges that it generally considered those factors and the defendant\u2019s arguments. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he district court explicitly acknowledged that it had considered [the defendant\u2019s] arguments at sentencing and that it had considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). This statement alone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences.\u201d); <em>see also Flores, </em>572 F.3d at 1271 (holding a sentence to be procedurally reasonable where the district court \u201cexplicitly stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">The district court\u2019s explanation in this case was adequate. The court stated on the record that it considered: (1) the parties\u2019 statements; (2) the PSR, which contained the advisory guidelines sentencing options; (3) each of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors; and (4) Clay\u2019s motion for a downward departure or variance. The court\u2019s explanation was thus sufficient to demonstrate that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decision-making authority. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. at 2468; <em>Flores, </em>572 F.3d at 1270-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">B. Enhancements for Multiple Victims and Loss Amount</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Clay contends that the district court erred by applying a 6-level enhancement for committing an offense that involved 250 or more victims and by applying a 20-level enhancement for causing an intended loss between $7 million and $20 million. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(C), (b)(1)(E). She asserts that she cannot be held responsible for the conduct of her co-conspirators because the district court failed to make any of the \u201cparticularized findings\u201d that she believes are required and because the PSR did not, in her view, identify a law enforcement finding that she victimized that many people. Because she did not raise those issues before the district court, we review the court\u2019s decision of them only for plain error. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number><em>States v. Hoffman, </em>710 F.3d 1228, 1231-32 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Under the sentencing guidelines, a defendant convicted of conspiracy is responsible for \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of [her coconspirators] in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity that occurred during the commission of the offense,\u201d in preparation for the offense, or in trying to escape detection for that offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). In other words, a defendant like Clay is responsible for the conduct of her co-conspirators only if that conduct was both (1) in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and (2) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity. <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 2. We have also held that, \u201cto determine a defendant\u2019s liability for the acts of others, the district court must first make individualized findings concerning the scope of criminal activity undertaken by a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>323 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted). Only then should the court consider reasonable foreseeability and whether the conduct was in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 2; <em>see also United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278, 1281 (11th Cir.1999) (noting that \u201cboth \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) and its commentary unambiguously direct that sentence enhancements for co-conspirator conduct will be limited to those acts which are reasonably foreseeable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">\u25a0Relying on the application notes to the sentencing guidelines and our <em>Hunter </em>decision, Clay argues that the district court committed reversible error by failing to make particularized findings about the scope of her involvement in the conspiracy. She casts her challenge as a \u201cprocedural\u201d one, insisting that the court was required to make particularized findings, but she ultimately seeks to retract facts she admitted (by failing to object to) at sentencing. This is ar crucial distinction between her situation and the authority she cites in which we have required particularized findings. In <em>Hunter, </em>for example-, the government and the defendants both filed objections to the PSR regarding the extent to which the defendants were responsible for the actions of other members of the conspiracy. 323 F.3d at 1317. And in <em>Gallo, </em>which Clay does not cite, the defendant argued at sentencing that a \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d finding was required to hold her responsible for her co-conspirators\u2019 possession of firearms. 195 F.3d at 1280. We held that the district court\u2019s failure to make particularized findings in those cases required remanding for resen-tencing. <em>Id. </em>at 1284; <em>Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at 1323. But because the \u201choldings of a prior decision can reach only as far as the facts and circumstances presented to the Court in the case which produced that decision,\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1321 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted), <em>Hunter </em>and <em>Gallo </em>do not control this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">In this case, there were no objections to the PSR, no trial, and no real record on which to base the findings Clay now claims are required. As the prosecutor noted, it was \u201c[h]ard to get good information in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>case because not a lot of people [we]re talking.\u201d But the information the court did have justified its application of those two enhancements. The district court could have permissibly relied on any of the following pieces of information: (1) undisputed statements in the PSR that \u201cthe offense involved 250 or more victims\u201d and that Clay herself was \u201cresponsible for an intended tax loss between $7,000,000 and $20,000,000;\u201d (2) another undisputed statement in the PSR asserting that Clay and her coconspirators filed approximately 1,175 fraudulent tax returns in 2010 and 649 fraudulent returns in 2011;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (3) Clay\u2019s counsel\u2019s admission at sentencing that she had personally filed about \u201c300 or so\u201d of the roughly 2,000 returns; and (4) counsel\u2019s statement, when asked whether he objected to the district court\u2019s loss calculation, that he \u201chad to live with\u201d that calculation because the PSR was \u201cusing the intended loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Because Clay neglected to object to the statements in the PSR, she admitted them as fact for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006). We have held that a defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to object to conclusory statements in the [PSR] renders those statements undisputed and permits the sentencing court to rely upon them without error <em>even if there is an absence of supporting evidence.\u201d United States v. Aguilar-Ibarra, </em>740 F.3d 587, 592 (11th Cir.2014) (quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Thus, the district court here was entitled to rely on the undisputed statements in the PSR that Clay was responsible for an intended loss between $7 million and $20 million and that her offense involved more than 250 victims. However conclusory those statements were, the district court was not required to make any additional factual findings when those undisputed statements were before it, and the court did not plainly err in applying enhancements on the basis of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err in sentencing Clay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">III. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">Clay also contends that her sentence is substantively unreasonable under the to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>tality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>626 F.3d 566, 573 (11th Cir.2012). A district court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to \u201creflect the seriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201cpromote respect for the law,\u201d \u201cprovide just punishment for the offense,\u201d \u201cafford adequate deterrence,\u201d \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d and \u201cprovide the defendant with needed educational ... training\u201d or correctional treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Section 3553(a) contains a number of additional factors that a court must take into account when imposing a sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court must consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but it may attach more weight to some factors than others. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (noting that the weight given to any one of these factors is \u201ccommitted to the sound discretion of the district court\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). A district court errs if it \u201c(1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Clay argues that her 121-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court \u201cappeared to rely solely on the guideline range\u201d and the need for deterrence while ignoring relevant factors such as her history, characteristics, and the role she played in the conspiracy. Clay also points out that she received a sentence three times longer than that of co-conspirator Chante Mozley, creating an unwarranted sentencing disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">We note at the outset that the district court sentenced Clay at the bottom of her guidelines range. Her advisory guidelines range on the conspiracy charge was 97 to 120 months, and the aggravated identity theft charge carried a mandatory consecutive term of two years imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A. Thus, Clay\u2019s 121-month sentence represents 97 months for conspiracy (the bottom of the guidelines range) and an additional 24 months for identity theft. Although we do not automatically presume the reasonableness of a sentence falling within the guidelines range, \u201cwe ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). Moreover, we will not reweigh the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and will not \u201cremand for re-sentencing unless the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). The district court did not commit such an error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Clay and her codefendants orchestrated a very serious and harmful scheme. They filed around 2,000 fraudulent tax returns, causing an actual loss of about $4 million and an intended loss of $11 million. The sentence the court imposed reflects the seriousness of this offense and will serve as a deterrent to others. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(B). It was within the advisory guidelines range. <em>See id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a)(4). The district court considered other factors as well. The court stated on the record that it had considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and, by entertaining Clay\u2019s motion for a downward variance, it necessarily considered that (1) the actual loss amount was less than the intended loss amount, (2) Clay received very little money from the scheme, (3) her role was \u201cso minimal compared to the other two defendants,\u201d and (4) she has a special needs child for whom she cares. All of these considerations are relevant to the \u00a7 3553(a)(1) sentencing factor \u2014 \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The district court permissibly exercised its discretion to attach more weight to the aggravating factors than to any of the potential mitigating factors Clay relies on now. <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1237 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe district court ... is permitted to attach \u2018great weight\u2019 to one factor over others.\u201d) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 57, 128 S.Ct. at 600).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Clay\u2019s claim of an unwarranted sentencing disparity is also meritless. She notes that her codefendant Chante Mozley, the woman who provided the Electronic Filing Identification Number used in the scheme, was sentenced to only 42 months imprisonment. While that is nearly three times less than Clay\u2019s sentence, the comparison is inapt because the two defendants are not similarly situated. <em>See United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1252 (11th Cir.2009) (rejecting claim of sentencing disparity because the defendants \u201c[we]re not similarly situated\u201d); <em>see also 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (instructing sentencing courts about \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with <em>similar </em>records who have been found guilty of <em>similar </em>conduct\u201d) (emphasis added). Unlike Clay, Mozley pleaded guilty to only one count and did so thirteen days in advance of trial pursuant to a plea agreement with the government. She also cooperated with the government and was granted a reduction to her sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 as a result. Clay on the other hand pleaded guilty to two counts on the day that trial began and did so without a plea agreement or any reduction for cooperation. \u201cA well-founded claim of disparity ... assumes that apples are being compared to apples,\u201d and that is not the case for Clay and Mozley. <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir.2009). It is telling that Clay does not compare her sentence to that of codefen-dant Alci Bonannee, who was sentenced to a total of 317 months following trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Clay\u2019s sentence was both proeedurally and substantively reasonable and the district court\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-7\">. An Electronic Filing Identification Number is a code that the IRS gives to tax preparers to enable them to electronically file tax returns. <em>See </em>IRS Webpage \"FAQs About Electronic Filing ID Numbers,\u201d http://www.irs. gov/Tax-Professionals/e-FileProviders-&amp;-Partners/FAQs-About-ElectronicFiling-ID-Numbers-(EFIN) (Dec. 19, 2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b943-8\">. Although Clay designated the motion as one for a downward departure, its content indicates that she was actually seeking a downward variance. The difference between the two is that a downward departure implicates the calculation of the guidelines range while a downward variance invokes the district court\u2019s discretion to impose a sentence below the calculated guidelines range based on the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 830 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b945-7\">. We also note that the particularized finding \"requirement\u201d is not as absolute as Clay would have us believe. We have excused a sentencing court's failure to make such findings where the evidence presented at trial supported the court's imposition of an enhancement based on the acts of others. <em>See United States v. Petrie, </em>302 F.3d 1280, 1290 (llth Cir.2002) (\u201c[A] sentencing court\u2019s failure to make individualized findings regarding the scope of the defendant's activity is not grounds for vacating a sentence if the record supports the court's determination with respect to the offense conduct, including the imputation of others' unlawful acts to the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b946-5\">. These approximate figures were calculated based on the PSR's statement that 97% of the 1,211 returns the conspirators filed for tax year 2010 had \"fraudulent indicators\u201d and that at least 65% of the 998 returns they filed for tax year 2011 had such indicators.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b946-6\">. Clay also argues that our decision in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir.1990), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136 (11th Cir.1993), requires resentencing in this case. In <em>Jones </em>we held that a district court should, after imposing a sentence, \"elicit fully articulated objections ... to the court's ultimate findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1102. Clay contends that the district court did not comply with <em>Jones </em>because the court, after asking whether there were any objections to the sentence, \"moved forward to advise the defendant regarding the right to appeal\u201d without giving the parties the opportunity to respond. The government concedes that after asking for objections, the district court moved on \"[wjithout pausing.\" However, we have not always vacated a sentence where a district court has not complied with <em>Jones. See United States v. Cruz, </em>946 F.2d 122, 124 n. 1 (11th Cir.1991) (excusing the district court\u2019s violation of <em>Jones </em>where the record was nonetheless sufficient to enable appellate review). More importantly, the record shows that Clay had an opportunity to object and raise additional issues when the court paused a few statements after it had elicited objections to the sentence. At that time, Clay's counsel requested that Clay be permitted to self-surrender to custody at a later date. That request indicates that counsel did have the opportunity to object to the court's sentence after it was announced, even if the opportunity did not come immediately after the court explicitly elicited objections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b947-6\">.
