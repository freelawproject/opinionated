Civ. Prao. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 110.003. The district court dismissed the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>claims with prejudice as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the TRFRA claim and dismissed it without prejudice, denied Wagner\u2019s motions for in-junctive relief, and imposed a strike against Wagner pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The district court correctly concluded that Wagner\u2019s retaliation claim lacks an arguable basis in law and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 767 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir.1999). We will not consider Wagner\u2019s claim that the suspension of inmate choirs and ban on musical instruments violated his right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment because this claim is being raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Jennings v. Owens, </em>602 F.3d 652, 657 n. 7 (5th Cir.2010). However, for the following reasons, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Wagner\u2019s First Amendment and RLUIPA claims as frivolous. <em>See Brewster, </em>587 F.3d at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Wagner alleged that he is not allowed to play the piano during religious services but that the Kairos organization has been exempted from the suspension of inmate choirs and confiscation of musical instructions. His First Amendment claim has an arguable basis in law in light of his allegation that these restrictions are not being applied neutrally. <em>See Mayfield v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>529 F.3d 599, 607, 610 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">As to his RLUIPA claim, these restrictions arguably substantially burden Wagner\u2019s exercise of religion by influencing him to act in a way that violates his religious beliefs. <em>See Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Texas, </em>560 F.3d 316, 332-34 (5th Cir.2009). It is also arguable that these restrictions are not justified by a compelling governmental interest achieved through the least restrictive means in light of Wagner\u2019s allegation that another religious organization is still permitted to play musical instruments. <em>See id. </em>at 334-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the dismissal of Wagner\u2019s retaliation claim as frivolous is AFFIRMED. The dismissal of Wagner\u2019s First Amendment and RLUIPA claims as frivolous is VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings. The dismissal of Wagner\u2019s TRFRA claim and denial of in-junctive relief are also VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings because these decisions rested on the conclusion that Wagner\u2019s claims were frivolous. The imposition of a strike against Wagner pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g) is REVERSED. <em>See Mayfield, </em>529 F.3d at 617. Last, Wagner\u2019s incorporated motion for the appointment of counsel on appeal to conduct oral argument is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
