He now appeals his convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In appealing his convictions, Artello argues that the District Court, in accepting his guilty pleas under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, erred (1) in failing adequately to explain the charged offenses \u2014 especially the <em>mens rea </em>element of the offenses \u2014 and (2) in accepting an insufficient factual basis for the Count 1 offense. Artello appeals his sentences on the grounds (1) the sentences are procedurally unreasonable \u2014 because the District Court miscalculated the offense level under the applicable guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, by \u201cdouble counting\u201d through the use of special offense characteristic \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F), and in not giving him credit under special offense characteristic \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l) for lacking the intent to distribute the child pornography \u2014 and (2) the sentences are substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Before we consider Artello\u2019s arguments, we note that \u2014 with the exception of his argument that his sentences are substantively unreasonable \u2014 he failed to present his arguments to the District Court in the form of objections; instead, he waited until now, on appeal, to present them. We therefore consider whether, under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), the \u201cplain-error rule,\u201d the District Court committed plain error in failing to recognize the objections on its own initiative and then ruling on them in Artello\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Rule 52(b) states that \u201c[a] plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). To obtain the reversal of a conviction for plain error, a defendant must show that \u201cthere is: \u2018(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">To determine whether a district court, in accepting the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, committed plain error that affected the defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d we examine \u201cthree \u2018core objectives\u2019 of Rule 11.\u201d We ask whether the record shows (1) that the plea was voluntary, i.e., free of coercion; (2) that the defendant understood the nature of the charges against him; and (3) that the defendant was aware of the direct consequences of pleading guilty. <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1289 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">In his brief, Artello argues that the District Court erred in accepting his guilty pleas</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-11\">because the court failed to ensure a knowing and voluntary decision by the defendant in pleading guilty to a child pornography distribution and possession charges given that the factual basis offered for the offense was entirely lacking in any evidence of distribution and lacking also in any evidence of knowing possession, and where the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>failed to explain the relevant law concerning the distribution count in such a manner that the defendant could understand whether to enter a guilty plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adu\">Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Rule 11 required the court, before entering judgment on Artello\u2019s guilty pleas, to determine that there was a factual basis for each plea. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The rule also required the court to inform Artello of the \u201cnature of each charge to which [he was] pleading.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(G).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We turn first to the factual-basis issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Early during the Rule 11 proceeding, the prosecutor summarized the facts the Government would establish if the case went to trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-7\">On August 16th of 2012, agents of the United States Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement executed a search warrant at the residence of Michael Artello, the defendant. On the defendant\u2019s Dell In-spiran laptop computer, agents discovered approximately 418 unique movie files and 257 image files, which involved the use of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, and which depicted minors engaged in such conduct. All of the images travelled in interstate or foreign commerce, including over the Internet. The defendant admitted that he used the peer-to-peer sharing program Fro-stWire to download child pornography.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI7\">Artello admitted these facts, and properly so. They show that he <em>distributed </em>the pornography through his use of the peer-to-peer file-sharing program. That program\u2019s purpose is to facilitate the distribution of files between its users. <em>See United States v. Spriggs, </em>666 F.3d 1284, 1287 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that the Government proves distribution of child pornography when it demonstrates that a defendant has knowingly used file-sharing program when there is child pornography on his computer); <em>see also United States v. Chiaradio, </em>684 F.3d 265, 282 (1st Cir.2012) (\u2018When an individual consciously makes files available for others to take and those files are in fact taken, distribution has occurred.\u201d); <em>United States v. Shaffer, </em>472 F.3d 1219, 1223-24 (10th Cir.2007) (holding that a defendant distributes child pornography where he possesses child pornography on his computer and utilizes a peer-to-peer filing sharing program). The facts the prosecutor recited also show that Ar-tello <em>possessed </em>the child pornography on his laptop. In sum, the court had adequate factual bases on which to adjudicate Artello\u2019s guilt on both counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">Turning to the nature of the charges \u2014 in particular, the Count 1 distribution charge \u2014 we conclude that the court ensured that Artello knew the nature of the offense. The court was aware that Artello is well-educated and that his lawyer had prepared him for the Rule 11 proceeding. He came to court fully cognizant of what lay ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">The District Court adequately and repeatedly informed Artello of the relatively simple child pornography possession and distribution charges brought against him. Artello stated that he was thoroughly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>aware of what the indictment alleged, that it charged him in Count 1 with violating \u00a7 2252(a)(2) by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-4\">knowingly distribut[ing] any visual depiction, using any means and facility of interstate and foreign commerce and that has been shipped and transported in interstate and foreign commerce by any means, including by computer, and the production of such visual depiction involved the use of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkpH\">and, in Count 2, with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-5\">knowingly possessing] matter, that is, a Dell laptop computer, which contained any visual depiction that had been shipped and transported using any means and facility of interstate and foreign commerce, and in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, by any means, including by computer, and which was produced using material which have been so shipped and transported, by any means, including by computer, and the production of such visual depiction having involved the use of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct ... and such visual depiction was of such conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Thus, the indictment clearly laid out the elements of Artello\u2019s two offenses, including <em>mens rea. </em>In addition, during the plea colloquy, the District Court went over the indictment and the elements to ensure that Artello understood what the Government had to prove. In response, Artello stated that he understood the charges and that he had no questions about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">After reviewing the plea colloquy, we are satisfied that Artello\u2019s guilty pleas were made knowingly and voluntarily and that the District Court did not err, much less commit plain error, in accepting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">As noted above, Artello did not object to his sentences as procedurally unreasonable on the ground that the District Court misapplied the Guidelines \u2014 specifically, the special offense characteristics of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2. A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court misapplies the Guidelines by failing to calculate or improperly calculating the Guidelines range. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Artello failed to object to the court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2G2.2, and thus to the court\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines range, we review the application for plain error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">The guideline for the Count 1 and 2 offenses is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2. The base offense level applicable here is found at \u00a7 2G2.2(a)(2) and is 22. The specific offense characteristics that were applied in this case were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-13\">(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-14\">(1) If (A) subsection (a)(2) applies; (B) the defendant\u2019s conduct was limited to the receipt or solicitation of material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor; and (C) <em>the defendant .did not intend to </em>traffic in, or <em>distribute, such material, decrease by 2 levels.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-15\">(2) If the material involved a prepubescent minor or a minor who had not attained the age of 12 years, increase by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-16\">(2) <em>(Apply the greatest) If the offense involved:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>(F) Distribution other than distribution described in subdivisions (A) through (E), increase by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-4\">(4) If the offense involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence, increase by 4 levels....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-5\">(6) <em>If the offense involved the use of a computer </em>or an interactive computer service for the possession, transmission, receipt, or distribution of the material, or for accessing with intent to view the material, increase by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-6\">(7) If the offense involved\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-7\">(D) 600 or more images, increase by 5 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Both counts of the indictment allege that Artello violated \u00a7 2252(a) \u201cby any means, including by computer.\u201d Since use of a computer is an element of the offenses and included in the \u00a7 2G2.2 base offense level, the court purportedly erred in increasing that level pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6). And since the distribution of child pornography is an element of the Count 1 offense, the court erred in enhancing the base offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F). Both errors, he contends, amounted to \u201cdouble counting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">\u201cImpermissible double counting occurs only when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of another part of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1226-27 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). We presume that separate guidelines sections apply cumulatively, \u201cunless specifically directed otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1227 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">The problem Artello faces in arguing that the District Court committed plain error in enhancing the base offense level as indicated above is that he points to no controlling precedent or Guideline or statutory provision \u2014 and we are aware of none \u2014 that would have placed the court on notice that it could not enhance the base offense level with the challenged specific offense characteristics as it did. Accordingly, the District Court did not commit plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">Nor did the court err in denying Artello an offense level reduction of two levels pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l). That section provides for the reduction if the defendant only solicited, or sought to receive, child pornography. To receive this reduction, Artello, whose burden it was to prove the applicability of the reduction, <em>see United States v. Belfast, </em>611 F.3d 783, 824 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Zaldivar, </em>615 F.3d 1346, 1352 (11th Cir.2010), had to show that his conduct was limited to the receipt or solicitation of child pornography. U.S.S.G \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(1)(B). He failed to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">In sum, we find no procedural unreasonableness here. We therefore move to the question of whether Artello\u2019s sentences are substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-16\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188-89 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc). </em>The district court must impose a sentence that is not greater than necessary to satisfy the objectives listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>imposing a particular sentence, the district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Artello bears the burden of showing that his sentences are unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the facts of the case, <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005), and the totality of the circumstances, <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189. We vacate a district court\u2019s sentence only if we \u201care left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190 (internal quotation marks omitted). We \u201cordinarily ... expect\u201d that a sentence imposed within the guideline range will be substantively reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty also indicates substantive reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that the sentence was substantively reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum penalty).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Artello\u2019s sentences were substantively reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Artello argues that the District Court did not give enough consideration to his arguments regarding his personal characteristics and the fundamental problems with the child pornography sentencing guidelines. The weight accorded any one factor is left to the court\u2019s discretion, <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190, and Artello has shown no abuse of that discretion. Additionally, the sentences were below the applicable guideline range and well below the statutory maximum penalty, which indicates reasonableness. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788; <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">For the foregoing reasons, Artello\u2019s convictions and sentences are</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2) and (b)(1) state, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-11\">(a) Any person who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-12\">(2) knowingly ... distributes any visual depiction using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce ... by any means including by computer, [and] ... the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and ... such visual depiction is of such conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-13\">(b)(1) Whoever violates, or attempts or conspires to violate, paragraph ...
