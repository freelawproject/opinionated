Green also executed a Deed of Trust that securitized the payment of the Note with her property. On June 27, 2011, Green sued multiple defendants in Texas state court alleging, among other things, that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJPMC\u201d) did not have the right to foreclose on her property. JPMC removed the action to United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Defendants-Appellees, JPMC, Mortgage Electronic Registration System, Inc. and the other MERS entities (\u201cMERS\u201d) moved for summary judgment. Defendant-Ap-pellee, CTX Mortgage Company, LLC (CTX) also moved to dismiss Green\u2019s complaint. The district court granted both motions. Green timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-19\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b261-20\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Stauffer v. Gearhart, </em>741 F.3d 574, 581 (5th Cir.2014). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif .the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-22\">This court reviews dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, </em>\u201caccepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Toy v. Holder, </em>714 F.3d 881, 883 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-24\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b261-25\">Green presents three issues on appeal: (1) whether the district court erred when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>refused to consider her argument that the Note was improperly accelerated, (2) whether the district court erred in finding that JPMC had standing even though the Note was \u201cbifurcated,\u201d and (3) whether the district court erred when it held that Texas Government Code \u00a7 192.007 does not require a Mortgagee to record an assignment of a Deed of Trust as a prerequisite to the validity of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the district court recognized that \u201cGreen asserts for the first time in her response to the MSJ Defendants\u2019 motion that she is entitled to a declaratory judgment that JPMC did not comply with the terms of the Deed when it sent Green a notice that it was accelerating the Note\u2019s maturity date.\u201d The district court refused to consider this new theory because \u201cGreen did not assert this claim in her amended complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u201cA claim which is not raised in the complaint but, rather, is raised only in response to a motion for summary judgment is not properly before the court.\u201d <em>Cutrera v. Bd. of Sup\u2019rs of La. State Univ., </em>429 F.3d 108, 113 (5th Cir.2005). As such, we have noted that \u201cdistrict courts do not abuse their discretion when they disregard claims or theories of liability not present in the complaint and raised first in a motion opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>De Franceschi v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P., </em>477 Fed.Appx. 200, 204 (5th Cir.2012). Green\u2019s complaint does allege that the defendants lacked \u201cauthority to accelerate the alleged Note,\u201d but nowhere does it allege that the defendants failed to properly provide her notice of default and an opportunity to cure. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in disregarding this new theory at the summary-judgment stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Green next argues that JPMC lacks standing to foreclose because JPMC has not provided evidence of the assignment of the Deed of Trust and Note. As our cases have recognized, JPMC has standing because it holds the original Note, which is endorsed in blank. <em>See e.g., Kiggundu v. Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., </em>Inc., 469 Fed.Appx. 330, 331-32 (5th Cir.2012) (\u201cBecause the note was endorsed in blank and the Bank of New York was in possession of the note, under Texas law, the Bank of New York was entitled to collect on it. Moreover, under Texas law, the mortgage follows the note.\u201d (internal citations omitted)); <em>Reeves v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., </em>544 Fed.Appx. 564, 570 (5th Cir.2013) (unpublished) (\u201cOwnership of the Note was sufficient to allow Wells Fargo to foreclose.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Green also argues that JPMC lacks standing because the Note and Deed of Trust were \u201cbifurcated.\u201d As Green acknowledges, we rejected this argument in <em>Martins v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P., </em>722 F.3d 249, 255 (5th Cir.2013): \u201cThe \u2018split-the-note\u2019 theory is therefore inapplicable under Texas law where the foreclosing party is a mortgage servicer and the mortgage has been properly assigned. The party to foreclose need not possess the note itself.\u201d Nonetheless, Green argues we should certify this question. But certification is not \u201ca proper avenue to change our binding precedent.\u201d <em>Jefferson v. Lead Indus. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>106 F.3d 1245, 1247 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding that JPMC has standing, and we refuse Green\u2019s certification request.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">Green\u2019s remaining argument is that \u00a7 192.007 imposes an obligation on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>mortgagee to show an unbroken chain of title. Green again recognizes this argument is foreclosed by <em>Reinagel v. Deutsche Bank Nat\u2019l Trust Co., </em>735 F.3d 220, 228 n. 27 (5th Cir.2013), which noted that \u201cthis obscure provision has never been cited in a state court decision and is best read as a procedural directive to county clerks, not as a prerequisite to the validity of assignments.\u201d <em>See also Hudson v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>541 Fed.Appx. 380, 383 (5th Cir.2013). The district court did not err, and we again deny Green\u2019s certification request. <em>See Jefferson, </em>106 F.3d at 1247. The futility of this argument is equally dispositive of Green\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal of her claims against CTX.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">For the above stated reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
