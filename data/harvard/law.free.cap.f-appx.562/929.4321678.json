Miller alleges that Nationstar \u2014 the servicer for Miller\u2019s mortgage loan \u2014 violated section 1692f(6) when Nationstar changed the locks and- placed a lockbox on Miller\u2019s front door after Miller defaulted on his loan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Under section 1692f(6), a \u201cdebt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt,\u201d including \u201c[tjaking or threatening to take any nonjudicial action to effect dispossession or disablement of property if ... there is no present right to possession of the property claimed as collateral through an enforceable security interest....\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Miller alleges that Nationstar dispossessed him of his property unlawfully when it changed the locks on his front door. Miller does not, however, dispute Nationstar\u2019s contention that the house was vacant when the locks were changed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Under the terms of Miller\u2019s mortgage document, Nationstar was authorized to make \u201creasonable or appropriate\u201d efforts to protect its interest in and to secure an abandoned property, including specifically</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">changing the locks. Because Nationstar acted under the terms of its enforceable security interest when it changed Miller\u2019s locks, nothing evidences a violation of section 1692f(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">Miller argues that Nationstar lacked \u201creasonable cause\u201d to enter the property, which Miller alleges was \u201clocked, safe, secure and in no danger of harm or destruction.\u201d In making this argument, however, Miller relies mistakenly on language in paragraph 7 of the mortgage (permitting Nationstar to inspect the property upon \u201creasonable cause\u201d), instead of on paragraph 9 of the mortgage (permitting Na-tionstar to secure abandoned property).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">No genuine issue of material fact exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-8\">. On appeal, Miller does not challenge the grant of summary judgment on his claims for violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and of other sections of the FDCPA (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e(2), (4), (5), (8), (10), (11), 1692f(l) and 1692g(b)) or the grant of summary judgment on his claims for declaratory judgment and injunc-tive relief. Thus, these claims are abandoned. <em>See N. Am. Med. Corp. v. Axiom Worldwide, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number><em>Inc., </em>522 F.3d 1211, 1217 n. 4 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b952-9\">. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and we view the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Skop v. City of Atlanta, </em>485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b952-10\">. The district court noted that Miller added this section 1692f(6) claim in his amended complaint without leave of court, \u201d[i]n direct contradiction to the Court\u2019s Order dismissing Plaintiff's Complaint;\" but the court still addressed Miller's claim \u201d[o]ut of an abundance of caution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b952-19\">.In support of its contention that Miller\u2019s property was vacant, Nationstar produced an affidavit from its process server testifying, in part, that neighbors reported that Miller's property had been vacant for over six months. Miller does not dispute that the property was in fact vacant, but argues that the affidavit contained inadmissible hearsay testimony. Because Miller failed to raise a timely objection to the affidavit in the district court, we need not address Miller\u2019s hearsay argument. <em>See Lussierv. Dugger, </em>904 F.2d 661, 667 (11th Cir.1990) (motions for reconsideration in the district court \"should not be used \u2018to raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before the judgment is issued.' \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
