After the district court granted a motion for default judgment against Nicaragua, and awarded damages in excess of $12 million, Nicaragua moved to vacate the award and dismiss the complaint under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The court granted the motion, vacated the damages award, and dismissed the complaint. The sole question before us on appeal is whether the FSIA mandated dismissal of the complaint. Because we conclude that it did, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">Lylle Araya-Solorzano, Robert Solorza-no, both U.S. citizens, and other members of the Solorzano family, owned eighty percent of a Nicaraguan pharmaceutical company called Laboratorios SOLEA, S.A. (SOLEA). In May 2007, SOLEA\u2019s unionized workers seized control of SOLEA facilities and turned them over to Nicaraguan control. Roberto Solorzano, acting on behalf of himself and the family, negotiated with INSS to sell the family\u2019s shares for $4 million. Roberto Solorzano also negotiated for himself the sale of one of SOLEA\u2019s trademarks for $1.3 million. Although all parties agreed to the terms of the sales, INSS never paid for the shares or the trademark. In 2012, Lylle Araya-Solorzano and Robert Solorzano, separately, filed complaints against Nicaragua for breach of contract and unjust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>enrichment in connection with these sales.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Attached to Araya-Solorzano\u2019s complaint were copies and translations of the offer and acceptance. In the offer letter, the INSS executive chairman expressed interest in obtaining the stock for 4 million. In the response letter, Solorzano indicates that all stockholders agree to the terms of purchase and accept 4 million in U.S. dollars. The response letter appears on Roberto Solorzano\u2019s letterhead with an address in Managua, Nicaragua. Neither letter makes any reference to any other terms of the deal. Letters outlining the trademark purchase were attached to Roberto Solorzano\u2019s complaint. These, too, mention only the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">After Nicaragua failed to respond to the complaint, the Solorzanos moved for entry of default and for default judgment. In support of their motion, the Solorzanos submitted an affidavit from a Nicaraguan attorney, in which the attorney stated that the payment under the contract \u201cwas to be paid in Nicaragua.\u201d The court tried the consolidated case as to the issue of damages only and awarded damages, with interest, in the amount of $12.3 million. Thereafter, Nicaragua moved to vacate the default judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60, and dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction under the FSIA and personal jurisdiction over Nicaragua, and for insufficient process and service of process. The district court granted the motion and vacated its order of default judgment, finding that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, the court found that Nicaragua\u2019s actions had no \u201cdirect effects\u201d in the United States, as required to overcome Nicaragua\u2019s sovereign immunity under the FSIA. The court noted that the contract made no reference to the United States, and both the offerer and offeree were in Nicaragua at the time the deal was made. The Solorzanos now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">We review jurisdictional questions <em>de novo, Beg v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, </em>353 F.3d 1323, 1324 (11th Cir.2003), but we review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, <em>Aquamar, S.A. v. Del Monte Fresh Produce, </em>179 F.3d 1279, 1289-90 (11th Cir.1999). The FSIA \u201cprovides the only basis for courts in this country to acquire jurisdiction over a foreign state. It provides that a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction of the United States unless an FSIA statutory exemption is applicable.\u201d <em>Calzadilla v. Banco Latino Internacional, </em>413 F.3d 1285, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1604, 1605(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The only exception relevant to our discussion is if \u201cupon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">\u201c[A]n activity is commercial under the FSIA: when a foreign government acts, not as regulator of a market, but in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>manner of a private player within it.\u201d <em>Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. v. Unidentified Shipwrecked Vessel, </em>657 F.3d 1159, 1176 (11th Cir.2011) (quotations omitted). The purchase of stock and trademarks is a commercial activity because \u201cit is the type of transaction that private actors could complete.\u201d <em>Beg, </em>353 F.3d at 1325 (concluding that the government\u2019s confiscation of property was not commercial because private parties could not act in the same manner); <em>see also Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., </em>504 U.S. 607, 614-16, 112 S.Ct. 2160, 119 L.Ed.2d 394 (1992) (explaining that the government\u2019s issuance of bonds to finance a currency-exchange program was commercial).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">A \u201cdirect effect\u201d under the FSIA is one that follows \u201cas an immediate consequence of the defendant\u2019s ... activity.\u201d <em>Weltover, </em>504 U.S. at 618, 112 S.Ct. 2160 (quotations and citation omitted). The effect must be more than \u201cpurely trivial\u201d or \u201cremote and attenuated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But it need not be a substantial or foreseeable effect. <em>Id. </em>\u201cMere financial loss by a person \u2014 individual or corporate \u2014 in the U.S. is not, in itself, sufficient to constitute a \u2018direct effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adler v. Fed. Republic of Nigeria, </em>107 F.3d 720, 726-27 (9th Cir.1997) (internal citation omitted); <em>see also Rogers v. Petroleo Brasileiro, S.A., </em>673 F.3d 131, 140 (2d Cir.2012) (the plaintiffs status as a U.S. citizen is insufficient, standing alone, to result in \u201cdirect effects\u201d in the United States). Instead, courts \u201c \u2018often look to the place where the legally significant acts giving rise to the claim occurred\u2019 in determining the place where a direct effect may be said to be located.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 727 (citing <em>United World Trade v. Mangyshlakneft Oil Production Ass\u2019n, </em>33 F.3d 1232, 1239 (10th Cir.1994)). Moreover, in evaluating \u201cdirect effects,\u201d we ask, \u201cwas the effect sufficiently \u2018direct\u2019 and sufficiently \u2018in the United States\u2019 that Congress would have wanted an American court to hear the case?\u201d <em>Guevara v. Republic of Peru, </em>608 F.3d 1297, 1309 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Harris Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Iranian Radio &amp; Television, </em>691 F.2d 1344, 1351 (11th Cir.1982) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">In <em>Weltover, </em>the Supreme Court held that a breach of contract arising when Argentina unilaterally rescheduled its bonds caused direct effects in the United States because the contract designated New York as the place of payment, some payments were made before the rescheduling, and therefore money \u201cthat was supposed to have been delivered to a New York bank for deposit was not forthcoming.\u201d <em>Weltover, </em>504 U.S. at 618, 112 S.Ct. 2160. We have held that, in the context of a breach-of-contract claim, U.S.-based injuries such as an inability to ship goods to the United States, lost profits from future sales, harm to reputation, and expenditures connected to the breach were too indirect and speculative to qualify as \u201cimmediate consequences.\u201d <em>Samco Global Anns, Inc. v. Arita, </em>395 F.3d 1212, 1217 (11th Cir.2005). In at least one case, we have stated that the so-called \u201cnegative activity\u201d of a foreign sovereign\u2019s failure to make a payment cannot overcome immunity under the FSIA. <em>Guevara, </em>608 F.3d at 1310 (explaining that Peru\u2019s failure to pay reward money within the United States did not have the necessary \u201cdirect effects\u201d under \u00a7 1605(a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">The Solorzanos argue that they can show direct effects in the United States because the money to be paid was in U.S. dollars, and the offer and acceptance for each sale were actually integrated into a single document in the United States. They contend there is no support for the district court\u2019s conclusion that the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>tracts were transacted in Nicaragua or that Roberto Solorzano was in Nicaragua at the time of the negotiations. They assert that the court erred by considering materials outside the pleadings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and it should have conducted a hearing on the matter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">We are not persuaded. Rather, we conclude that the failure to make payment in the United States in this case is the type of \u201cnegative activity\u201d we rejected in <em>Guevara. </em>As the district court found, and the Solorzanos do not dispute, the parties negotiated the sale in Nicaragua. Attached to the complaint is Roberto Solorzano\u2019s acceptance letter, which is written on his letterhead with a Nicaraguan address. Second, according to the affidavit of the Solorzanos\u2019 expert, the contract was to be paid in Nicaragua, and no payments had been made in the United States. <em>Cf. Weltover, </em>504 U.S. at 618, 112 S.Ct. 2160 (finding there were direct effects in the United States where some payments under the contract had already been made here). The only connection with the United States is that the Solorzanos live here, they are U.S. citizens, and they included in their acceptance letter that they would be paid in U.S. dollars. These facts alone are insufficient, <em>see Rogers, </em>678 F.3d at 140, and the Solorzanos offer no other explanation to show how there are direct effects here.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Moreover, as the Solorzanos repeatedly explain, the payment could have been made in any one of a number of countries because the family members agreeing to the sale lived all over the world. The effects were no less direct in those locations. That payments could have been made in multiple places makes the direct effects here more \u201cspeculative.\u201d <em>See Samco Global Arms, </em>395 F.3d at 1217 (discussing speculative and indirect harm). Thus, the failure to make the payment, although perhaps felt by the Solorzanos here, was not sufficiently \u201cdirect\u201d or sufficiently \u201cin the United States\u201d to show that Congress wanted the U.S. courts to hear this case. <em>See Guevara, </em>608 F.3d at 1309 (internal citation omitted). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under the FSIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-5\">. Lylle Araya-Solorzano also named the Secretary of State as a defendant. Roberto So-lorzano named the Secretary of Commerce. Both defendants have been dismissed from the underlying action, and neither Solorzano challenges the dismissal on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b925-6\">. Under Rule 60(b), the district court may vacate a final judgment where \u201cthe judgment is void.\u201d There is no question that a judgment is void if the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b925-13\">.Under the FSIA, a \"foreign state\u201d includes \u201cagencies and instrumentalities of such states.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a). The parties do not dispute that INSS is a \"foreign state\" under the FSIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b927-6\">. Attacks on the court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction are either facial or factual attacks. <em>See, e.g., Houston v. Marod Supermarkets, Inc., </em>733 F.3d 1323, 1335-36 (11th Cir.2013). \"In a factual challenge to subject matter jurisdiction, a district court can 'consider extrinsic evidence such as deposition testimony and affidavits.' In so doing, a district court is 'free to weigh the facts\u2019 and is 'not constrained to view them in the light most favorable\u2019 to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1336 (internal citation omitted). Accordingly, we conclude there was no error in the court's consideration of the affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b927-7\">. The Solorzanos also argue that: Nicaragua implicitly waived its sovereign immunity because its behavior was so grossly unfair; jurisdiction is proper because this is where the offer and acceptance were integrated; and the Uniform Commercial Code provides for delivery at the buyer's residence. We decline to address these arguments, which are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal). Finally, the Solorzanos explicitly stated in their response to the defendants\u2019 motion for a hearing that the court could decide the motion to vacate judgment on the motion and responses. They cannot now argue that it was error for the court to do so without a hearing. <em>See F.T.C. v. AbbVie Prod., LLC, </em>713 F.3d 54, 65 (11th Cir.2013) (\"It is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling ... invited by that party.\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
