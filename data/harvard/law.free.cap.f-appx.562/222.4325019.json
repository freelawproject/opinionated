The BIA agreed with the IJ that Chen\u2019s asylum application was untimely and that he had not established eligibility for withholding of removal or for CAT protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">This court lacks jurisdiction to review the finding that Chen failed to establish \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d, which would justify an untimely asylum application. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594-96 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-20\">By failing to brief a challenge to the eligibility determinations for withholding of removal and CAT protection, Chen has abandoned these issues. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Likewise, although Chen asserts in the issue statement of his brief that Congress did not intend the one-year deadline to penalize applicants for asylum, he has abandoned the issue by failing to brief it. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-21\">DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. r. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
