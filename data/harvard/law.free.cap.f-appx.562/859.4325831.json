The district court denied Maldonado\u2019s motion on the ground that she was not \u201cin custody\u201d at the time she made the inculpatory statements and, therefore, the postal inspectors. did not have to give a <em>Miranda,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>warning. After a thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">United States postal inspectors initiated an investigation of Maldonado, a mail carrier, after receiving a complaint from a mail customer who stated that a Visa gift card she had sent to her son in Miami had never arrived. The inspectors conducted a \u201clive test,\u201d where they set up surveillance and provided Maldonado with a gift card in a sealed envelope with an electronic transmitter that was designed to alert when the envelope was opened. Later that day, a team of postal inspectors stopped Maldonado and discovered the live test piece open inside of her mail truck. She returned to her assigned post office with the inspectors and was interviewed inside a supervisor\u2019s office with the door closed. Maldonado initially denied any wrongdoing, but later admitted to taking the gift cards and opening the live test piece. Following a jury trial, Maldonado was convicted of two counts of mail theft and one count of unauthorized opening of mail by a postal employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress as a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cWhether [a defendant] was \u2018in custody\u2019 and entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings is [also] a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Moya, </em>74 F.3d 1117, 1119 (11th Cir.1996). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions and we review its factual findings for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">A \u201ccustodial interrogation cannot occur before a suspect is warned of [her] rights against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>475 F.3d 1221, 1224 (11th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 445, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)). Pre-custodial questioning, in contrast, does not require <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>United States v. Street, </em>472 F.3d 1298, 1309 (11th Cir.2006). The \u201cinitial step\u201d in determining whether a person was \u201cin custody\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>\u201cis to ascertain whether, in light of the objective circumstances of the interrogation\u201d and the totality of all the circumstances, \u201ca reasonable person would have felt that he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d <em>Howes v. Fields, </em>565 U.S.-,-, 132 S.Ct. 1181, 1189, 182 L.Ed.2d 17 (2012) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). An interviewee\u2019s \u201cstatus as a suspect, and the coercive environment that exists in virtually every interview by a police officer of a crime suspect,\u201d does not automatically create a custodial situation. <em>United States v. Muegge, </em>225 F.3d 1267, 1270 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">One of the factors a court should consider when determining whether the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>dant was \u201cin custody\u201d is the location of questioning. <em>See Howes, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1189. Although not dispositive, \u201ccourts are much less likely to find the circumstances custodial when the interrogation occurs in familiar or at least neutral surroundings, such as the suspect\u2019s home.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1348 (11th Cir.2006) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Courts may also consider whether a defendant was \u201c[u]nambiguously advis[ed] ... that [s]he is free to leave and is not in custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1347. This is a \u201cpowerful factor\u201d that \u201cgenerally will lead to the conclusion that the defendant is not in custody absent a finding of restraints that are so extensive that telling the suspect [s]he was free to leave could not cure the custodial aspect of the interview.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Other relevant factors include the duration of the questioning, statements made during the interview, the presence of physical restraints during questioning, and \u201cthe release of the interviewee at the end of the questioning.\u201d <em>Howes, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the district court properly found Maldonado\u2019s interrogation was non-custodial. Prior to the start of the interview at Maldonado\u2019s assigned post office, Special Agent Eugene Davis read Maldonado a form containing <em>Garrity</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>warnings, which informed her that the interview was voluntary and that she could stop answering questions at any time. Maldonado initialed next to each of the <em>Garrity </em>rights-including that \u201c[t]his interview is strictly voluntary, and I may leave or stop answering questions at any time\u201d \u2014 and signed the acknowledgment at</p>\n<p id=\"AGI\">the bottom of the form stating that she understood these rights. These facts strongly suggest that Maldonado\u2019s interrogation was not custodial. <em>See Brown, </em>441 F.3d at 1347-48. Further, there is no indication that there were restraints on Maldonado\u2019s freedom of movement \u201cthat [were] so extensive that telling [her] [s]he was free to leave could not cure the custodial aspect of the interview.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1347 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">Although there were some factors to suggest the interview was custodial in nature, such as: (1) when a team of U.S. postal inspectors stopped Maldonado while she was working her delivery route, they effectively blocked in her mail truck and appeared to indicate that returning with them to the post office was mandatory; and (2) prior to the start of the interview at the post office, a female postal inspector accompanied Maldonado to the restroom and refused to let Maldonado close the door. These facts, however, do not render this a custodM interrogation because: (1) Maldonado was unambiguously told that she was free to leave, was not in custody, and did not have to answer questions, <em>see Brown, </em>441 F.3d at 1347; (2) she was \u201cin the familiar ... surroundings\u201d of her workplace, <em>see id. </em>at 1349; (3) she was not physically restrained during questioning, <em>see Howes, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1189; (4) the postal inspectors did not brandish their weapons when they first approached Maldonado on her delivery route, or later during the interview, <em>see United States v. Luna-Encinas, </em>603 F.3d 876, 881 (11th Cir.2010); (5) although a postal inspector accompanied Maldonado to the restroom for safety reasons, Maldonado\u2019s movements were never restricted and she was free to leave at any time, see <em>Brown, </em>441 F.3d at 1348-49; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>(6) after the interview was over, Maldonado left voluntarily and was not arrested until approximately six weeks later, <em>cf. Howes, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">For these reasons, we agree with the district court that Maldonado\u2019s statements were not made during a custodial interrogation. Accordingly, the district court properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-9\">. <em>Miranda v.
