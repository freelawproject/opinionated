On appeal, Beasley argues that his 115-month sentence, 36 months below the advisory guidelines range: (1) is proeedurally unreasonable because the district court miscalculated his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b); and (2) is substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">A. Beasley\u2019s Offenses</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">In January 2012, a special agent conducting an online child pornography investigation located an IP address for a computer that possessed image and movie files previously identified as child pornography in other investigations. After entering the IP address into the Internet Crimes Against Children (\u201cICAC\u201d) database, the special agent found that the IP address had logged on to a peer-to-peer file sharing network called \u201cE-Donkey\u201d over \u201c4,000 times from June 16, 2011 to February 17, 2012, with more than 1,000 different image or movie files on E-Donkey network.\u201d After comparing those 1,000-plus files to those in the ICAC database, the special agent found two files, in particular, that were previously identified as child pornography and had file names indicative of child pornography. The special agent downloaded those two files from available \u201cE-Donkey\u201d network hosts. The two files were videos containing child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">After linking the IP address to Beasley\u2019s Florida residence, two special agents executed a search warrant there. During his interview, Beasley initially denied downloading and viewing images of child pornography and offered to get his laptop and external media so the agents could preview it. However, to preserve the forensic integrity of the evidence, agents told Beasley not to touch any computer equipment. After being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Beasley admitted that he had collected images and videos of child pornography since the early 1990s and had over 40,000 child pornography images.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">During the search, the agents found a Compaq laptop computer and a Dell computer in Beasley\u2019s room. The laptop com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>puter had an external hard drive where Beasley said he stored his child pornography collection on a file called \u201cEMD,\u201d which stood for \u201ceMule downloads.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A forensic examination of the two computers revealed that: (1) the Dell computer contained 16B videos and 1,919 images depicting child pornography, some containing bestiality and bondage; (2) the Compaq laptop contained one movie and 226 images depicting child pornography; (3) the external hard drive contained 103 movies and 4,260 images depicting child pornography, some containing bestiality or bondage.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In total, Beasley\u2019s computers had 267 movies and 6,405 images of child pornography. The forensic examination revealed that on November 29, 2010, Beasley used eMule, a peer-to-peer file sharing program, to receive three movie files containing child pornography.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">B. Charges and Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The indictment charged Beasley with receipt of child pornography (Count One) and possession of child pornography (Count Two). Count One alleged that, on November 29, 2010, Beasley knowingly received three computer files (i.e., the three movies the forensic examination showed Beasley downloaded using a peer-to-peer file sharing program), that were shipped or transported by computer using the Internet. Count Two alleged that, on February 15, 2012, Beasley knowingly possessed computer images of child pornography that were shipped or transported by computer using the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">Without a plea agreement, Beasley pled guilty to both counts. At the plea hearing, Beasley stated that he knowingly downloaded images of child pornography. Beasley admitted the government\u2019s factual basis for the plea, summarized above.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">C. PSI</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">The probation officer\u2019s PSI recounted the facts contained in the government\u2019s factual basis for the plea. The PSI calculated a total offense level of 34 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">Specifically, the PSI assigned Beasley: (1) an offense level of 22, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(a)(2); (2) a two-level increase under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) because the pornographic material involved a prepubescent minor; (3) a two-level increase, under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F), because the offense involved distribution of child pornography, other than distribution for pecuniary gain, thing of value, or to a minor; (4) a four-level increase, under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4), because the offense involved material that portrayed sadistic or masochistic conduct; (5) a two-level increase, under \u00a7 3G2.2(b)(6), because the offense involved the use of a computer; and (6) a five-level increase, under \u00a7 3G2.2(b)(7)(D), because the offense involved over 600 images. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>PSI recommended a three-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">With a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of I, Beasley\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(l), Count One had a mandatory minimum sentence of five years and a maximum of twenty years. Pursuant to \u00a7 2252A(b)(2), Count Two had a maximum sentence of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">D.Beasley\u2019s Objections</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Beasley objected to paragraph 32 of the PSI, which applied the two-level \u201cdistribution\u201d increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F). Beasley also objected to the PSI\u2019s failure to give the two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l), which applies when the defendant\u2019s conduct is limited to solicitation or receipt of child pornography and the defendant \u201cdid not intend to ... distribute\u201d the child pornography. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">As to distribution, Beasley contended that, although he used a peer-to-peer file sharing program, eMule, on his computer, \u201c[tjhere [was] no evidence that Mr. Beasley knowingly shared his files with others.\u201d Beasley pointed out that he \u201cdid not participate in internet chat rooms in which he traded images with others, and he did not purposely send images to others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">In addition, Beasley argued that the district court should vary downward and impose the mandatory minimum five-year sentence. As mitigating factors, Beasley stressed that: (1) he had no criminal history; (2) he suffers from pervasive developmental delays, Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, ADHD, anxiety, and depression; (3) although he has an IQ of 137, he has the social maturity of a 15-year-old; (4) as a child, he became socially isolated due to his odd behaviors and instead socialized on the Internet; (5) he idolized his father, who was a sexual voyeur who exposed his son to child pornography at an early age; (6) his obsessive-compulsive behavior contributed to his inability to stop viewing child pornography images once he realized it was wrong; (7) after his father died of cancer, his depression and anxiety worsened, he was hospitalized for suicidal ideation, and he was unable to work; (8) he sought counseling, participated in psychological evaluations and treatment, and hoped to continue counseling in prison; (9) he has a strong support network of family and friends, reflected in letters submitted to the court; and (10) according to Dr. Robert Cohen\u2019s evaluation, Beasley was a low risk of recidivism with proper therapy and medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">E. Addendum to the PSI</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">In response, the probation officer prepared an addendum to the PSI stating that the PSI\u2019s offense-level computation was correct. To support the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) two-level \u201cdistribution\u201d increase in paragraph 32 and lack of a \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l) reduction, the probation officer added these facts: (1) Beasley \u201cused peer to peer fil[e] sharing in the commission of the offense\u201d; (2) his \u201cfiles are made available to others using the file sharing program in exchange for access to their files\u201d; and (3) Beasley \u201cused the peer to peer to receive child pornography and other users were able to access his files containing child pornography.\u201d Simply put, the probation officer contended that distribution was shown where a defendant installed a file sharing program that allowed others to access the defendant\u2019s files even if the defendant himself did not actually forward any files to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">F. Sentencing Court\u2019s Resolution of Beasley\u2019s Objections</p>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">At the sentencing hearing, Beasley had no objections to the facts contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>PSI. When the district court asked for objections \u201cas to the application of the guidelines,\u201d Beasley renewed his two objections to the PSI\u2019s offense-level calculation. Beasley\u2019s counsel acknowledged that \u201cthe 11th Circuit is against me\u201d and explained that he was raising the objection in case the law changed as result of a 2012 Sentencing Commission Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The Report cited by Beasley stated that \u201cevery court of appeals that has addressed the issue has held that a defendant\u2019s knowing use of a P2P file-sharing program that allows others to have access to child pornography files on the defendant\u2019s computer qualifies as \u2018distribution\u2019 even if the defendant only made his illegal files available to strangers on the P2P network.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Federal Child Pornography Offenses, Ch. 2B2, at 33 (December 2012). The Report added that \u201c[p]ut another way, the distribution enhancement applies even if a defendant did not <em>intend, </em>to distribute so long as he possessed <em>knowledge </em>that, by participating in a P2P file-sharing program whereby he could access others\u2019 files, he was making his child pornography files accessible to others in the P2P network.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the Report stated that the current version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 is outdated in light of technological advances and recommended revisions. <em>See generally id., </em>Ch. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Beasley\u2019s counsel argued that Beasley should receive the two-level reduction because, other than the fact that he had the eMule software program on his computer, there was no evidence Beasley intended to distribute child pornography to other users. Beasley\u2019s counsel added, \u201cThere\u2019s no chat rooms. There was no active role in trading and soliciting from others via email or chats.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The prosecutor responded that Beasley\u2019s use of \u201cthe peer-to-peer shared folder\u201d in the eMule peer-to-peer file sharing program disqualified him for the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l) reduction because it showed he intended to distribute. The prosecutor stated that Beasley \u201cknew and understood that using that peer-to-peer shared folder would allow others to go into his shared folder, as well as him soliciting or receiving or downloading that information from other people\u2019s shared folders.... \u201d The prosecutor contended that the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) increase was appropriate \u201cbecause the defendant used that peer-to-peer file sharing network,\u201d and \u201cthe 11th Circuit has been very clear with regard to this in that the two-level enhancement is used on the peer-to-peer shared file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">The district court commented that the parties \u201cacknowledge^] that the case law in the 11th Circuit has addressed that issue with regard to the distribution and the fact that the defendant used the peer-to-peer file sharing in the commission of the offenses with which he\u2019s been adjudicated guilty.\u201d The prosecutor summarized her argument, stating that it was Beasley\u2019s \u201cuse of this peer-to-peer shared drive\u201d that was an \u201cact of distribution\u201d requiring the two-level increase. Defense counsel did not dispute the prosecutor\u2019s statements about Beasley\u2019s use of the peer-to-peer \u201cshared folder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">The district court overruled Beasley\u2019s objections given it was undisputed that Beasley used the eMule peer-to-peer file sharing program \u201cand that others were able to access his files containing the child pornography.\u201d The district court stated that it had resolved Beasley\u2019s objections to the \u201cprobation officer\u2019s application of the guidelines\u201d and that there were \u201cno objections to the facts contained in the presen-tence report.\u201d The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s facts as the court\u2019s findings of fact and found that Beasley\u2019s total offense level was 34, his criminal history was cate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>gory I, which resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 151 to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">G. Imposition of the 115-Month Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Beasley argued for a downward variance. Personally addressing the district court, Beasley accepted full responsibility for his actions and promised that he was \u201cnever going to do what [he] did again.\u201d Through counsel, Beasley discussed his difficult family and social background and explained that his mental health disorders made him unable to control conduct he knew was wrong. Beasley explained that with the support of his family and friends and with his desire for treatment, he was unlikely to reoffend. Beasley emphasized that he had not accessed child pornography since the special agents\u2019 interview, even though he purchased a new laptop and viewed adult pornography with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The government requested a sentence within the guidelines range, noting that Beasley suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and a \u201cchronic addiction to pornography.\u201d Although Beasley was \u201ccontrite,\u201d he nevertheless purchased a new laptop after moving to his mother\u2019s home in New York, following the special agents\u2019 interview and seizure of his Florida computers. A forensic examination revealed that the new laptop contained nine thumbnail images of child pornography in unallocated space, in addition to large amounts of adult pornography. A forensic examination of other computers found in Beasley\u2019s possession at his mother\u2019s residence revealed a significant number of older child pornography files. Although these older computers\u2019 registries showed that the files were last accessed in 2006, 2008, or 2010, Beasley still could have been charged with possessing them. The government asked the district court to consider these newly discovered images as relevant conduct, but agreed that they did not change Beasley\u2019s guidelines calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Beasley responded that: (1) there was no evidence that he viewed child pornography on the new laptop; (2) the presence of the thumbnail images in the unallocated space was consistent with someone visiting adult pornography websites or downloading large amounts of adult pornography; (3) those thumbnail images may be included in a cache of adult pornography that he downloaded; and (4) the forensic report did not reveal any search terms for child pornography or any files containing child pornography in the recent folder or the recycle bin.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">The district court was concerned about Beasley\u2019s new laptop purchase because it seemed inconsistent with Dr. Cohen\u2019s opinion that Beasley was unlikely to reoffend and Beasley\u2019s allocution that he resolved to never look at child pornography again. The district court acknowledged, however, that there was no evidence Beasley had viewed child pornography on the new laptop and stated that Beasley\u2019s seemingly inconsistent conduct could be attributed to his \u201csevere addiction problem\u201d with pornography. Beasley explained that his new laptop purchase was not inconsistent with his low risk of recidivism because he used the new laptop only to play online games, chat with friends on social networking websites, and look at adult pornography, which, unlike child pornography, is not against the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">The district court then proceeded to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including (1) Beasley\u2019s difficult upbringing; (2) his disabilities; (3) the bullying he experienced; (4) his father\u2019s voyeurism and influence on his sexual morality; and (5) Dr. Cohen\u2019s report diagnosing Beasley with Asperger\u2019s syndrome, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and ADHD and indicating that Beasley is at a low risk of recidivism. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>The district court also considered the nature of Beasley\u2019s offense, stressing that this case was serious given the significant number of images. The district court ultimately granted a downward variance of 36 months and sentenced Beasley to two concurrent terms of 115 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by ten years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The district court listed its reasons for the variance, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, Beasley\u2019s history and characteristics, including his: (1) mental health issues; (2) exposure to his father who was a negative influence; (3) difficult teenage years; (4) depression; (5) voluntarily committing himself three times for suicidal ideation; (6) \u201cself-rehabilitation\u201d; (7) low risk of recidivism documented in Dr. Cohen\u2019s report; and (8) lack of criminal history, particularly the lack of \u201chistory of inappropriate contact offenses, particularly contact offenses with minors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The district court asked the parties whether there were any objections to the sentence imposed. Beasley\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cJust for the record, Your Honor, as to procedural and substantive unreasonable[ness].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">A. Distribution Enhancement Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Beasley argues that the district court erred in applying the two-level distribution increase and in denying a two-level reduction for lack of intent to distribute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 2G2.2 applies to child pornography offenses. For a defendant, like Beasley, convicted of receiving child pornography, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l) provides a two-level reduction in the offense level if, among other things, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct was limited to the receipt or solicitation of\u2019 child pornography, and <em>\u201cthe defendant did not intend to </em>traffic in, or <em>distribute, </em>such material.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">If, however, the defendant\u2019s offense involved \u201c [distribution\u201d of child pornography, \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3) calls for an offense-level increase depending on the nature of that distribution. Specifically, a five-level increase applies if the offense involved distribution that was for pecuniary gain or the receipt of a thing of value or was to a minor; a six-level increase applies if the distribution was to a minor and was intended to entice the minor to engage in any illegal activity; and a seven-level increase applies if the distribution was to a minor and was intended to entice the minor to engage in sexual conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(A)-(E). If the offense involved distribution \u201cother than\u201d for pecuniary gain, for a thing of value, or to a minor, the district court imposes a two-level increase. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">An application note to \u00a7 2G2.2 defines \u201cdistribution\u201d as \u201cany act, including possession with intent to distribute, production, transmission, advertisement, and transportation, related to the transfer of material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2, cmt. n. 1. The note states that \u201cdistribution includes posting material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor on a website for public viewing but does not include the mere solicitation of such material by a defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">This Court already has addressed when the use of a peer-to-peer file sharing program constitutes \u201cdistribution\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u00a7 2G2.2(b), albeit in the context of the five-level increase for distribution for a non-pecuniary thing of value. In <em>United States v. Spriggs, </em>the defendant used a peer-to-peer file sharing program called \u201cShareaza 2.0.\u201d <em>Spriggs, </em>666 F.3d 1284, 1286 (11th Cir.2012). This Court concluded that to establish \u201cdistribution,\u201d the government need not prove that another peer-to-peer network user actually downloaded a child pornography file from the defendant\u2019s computer. <em>Id. </em>at 1287. Rather, \u201c[ajllow-ing files to be accessed on the Internet by placing them in a file sharing folder is akin to posting material on a website for public viewing. When the user knowingly makes the files accessible to others, the distribution is complete.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Although the <em>Spriggs </em>Court determined that there was \u201cdistribution,\u201d it nonetheless concluded that the district court erred in applying the five-level increase because there was no evidence that there was a transaction (i.e., exchanging child pornography with another user) for \u201ca thing of value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1288-89 (explaining the guidelines contemplate a transaction conducted for .valuable consideration, not free access, to receive the five-level increase under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B)). Because the two-level increase in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F), like the five-level increase in \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B), requires \u201cdistribution,\u201d Spriggs\u2019s interpretation of that term to include \u201cknowingly mak[ing] the files accessible to others\u201d through the use of a peer-to-peer file sharing program applies here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">At Beasley\u2019s sentencing hearing, it was undisputed that: (1) he knowingly installed and used the peer-to-peer file sharing program eMule on his computer to download child pornography; and (2) he made his own child pornography files accessible to other eMule users. Under <em>Spriggs, </em>these facts were sufficient to support the application of the two-level distribution enhancement. At sentencing, Beasley argued that a more active role, such as using e-mail or chat rooms to trade images, was necessary to show distribution. Beasley\u2019s argument, however, is foreclosed by <em>Spriggs, </em>which concluded that making child pornography files accessible to other peer-to-peer network users is enough to constitute distribution for purposes of \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3). Indeed, at sentencing, Beasley\u2019s counsel acknowledged that his argument was foreclosed by our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">For the first time on appeal, Beasley argues that the government was required to offer evidence that he knowingly made his child pornography files accessible to other eMule users. This argument lacks merit because at the sentencing hearing Beasley never made an objection that triggered the government\u2019s obligation to offer any evidence in support of the increase. At the sentencing hearing, Beasley\u2019s objection to his offense level calculation was a legal one, not a factual one. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 833-34 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that the defendant waived his objection to the facts relating to his prior convictions contained in the PSI and PSI addendum because he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>object to them despite several opportunities to do so and instead at sentencing stated that his objection \u201crested not on a dispute regarding the facts of those convictions,\u201d but on a legal argument as to whether those convictions were \u201cserious enough to warrant the classification [as an armed career criminal]\u201d); <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 844 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Norris, </em>50 F.3d 959, 962 (11th Cir.1995) (explaining that failure to object to the PSI\u2019s fact findings precludes appellate review of that issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The probation officer even prepared an addendum to the PSI clarifying that Beasley used the eMule peer-to-peer file sharing program to download child pornography and \u201cother [eMule] users were able to access [Beasley\u2019s] files containing child pornography.\u201d Beasley never objected to this statement in the PSI\u2019s addendum, either in writing or orally at the sentencing hearing. In fact, at the beginning of the sentencing hearing, Beasley confirmed that he did not dispute the facts contained in the PSI, which at this point included the PSI addendum. Beasley further acknowledged that \u201cthe case law, and the 11th Circuit [was] against [him]\u201d as to the two-level distribution enhancement and that he was making his legal argument \u201cfor the record should the law change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">And, Beasley continued to raise no factual objection, even when both the prosecutor and the district court stated on the record that it was undisputed that Beasley had made his files accessible to other eM-ule users. Indeed, before overruling Beasley\u2019s objections to the PSI, the district court stated that \u201cthere certainly is no objection with regard to the facts in this case that Mr. Beasley used a peer-to-peer file sharing\u201d and \u201cthat others were able to access his files containing the child pornography.\u201d Yet, even at this point, Beasley did not raise a factual objection. Beasley did not dispute at all, much less with \u201cspecificity and clarity,\u201d the fact that he knowingly allowed other eMule users to have access to his child pornography files.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">On the particular record before us, we cannot say the district court erred in applying the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) increase and denying the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">B. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (1 1th Cir.2008). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">Then, we examine whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>Although we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum is another indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). The defendant bears the burden to show his sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number><em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Beasley\u2019s procedural reasonableness claim rests on his challenge to the calculation of his offense level under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l) and (b)(3)(F). As discussed above, that challenge is unavailing. Accordingly, Beasley has not shown that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">As to substantive reasonableness, Beasley contends that the district court focused on his new laptop purchase \u201cto the exclusion of the other sentencing factors,\u201d and punished Beasley for viewing adult pornography on the new laptop.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The sentencing transcript belies this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Although the district court initially discussed Beasley\u2019s new laptop purchase in light of the likelihood of recidivism, the record indicates that the court did not do so \u201csingle-mindedly,\u201d \u201cto the detriment of\u2019 the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and with undue weight. <em>See United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that the district court\u2019s single-minded focus on only one factor resulted in an unreasonable sentence). Instead, as outlined above, the district court extensively considered a number of other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, many of them mitigating.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Moreover, Beasley has not shown that the district court\u2019s decision to impose a 115-month sentence was an abuse of its discretion in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Beasley\u2019s sentence was 36 months below the advisory guidelines range of 151 to 188 months and well below the twenty-year statutory maximum, both indications of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). As the district court noted, Beasley\u2019s offenses involved thousands of images of child pornography. Beasley admitted collecting child pornography for about twenty years, and investigators found 6,405 images and 267 movies on the computer media at his Florida home, some depicting bestiality or bondage. Under the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say the district court committed a clear error of judgment and imposed a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\">.
