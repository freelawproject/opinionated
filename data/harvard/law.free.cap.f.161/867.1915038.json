The plaintiff was in the employ of the shingle company, and in the course of such employment was injured. The policy was in force at the time of the injury. Plaintiff, by his guardian ad litem, brought suit against the shingle company for damages and recovered a judgment for $5,500 and costs. The shingle company had in the meantime become insolvent and was adjudged a bankrupt. The present action is brought against the insurance company to recover the sum of $5,000 upon the judgment, and is based upon the liability tor indemnity provided in the contract of insurance. In the court below a demurrer to the complaint was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>sustained, and the complaint' ordered dismissed.

The policy of insurance involved in this case provided that no action would lie against the insurance company to recover for any loss under the policy, unless it should be brought by the assured itself for loss actually sustained and paid in money by it in satisfaction of a judgment, after trial on the issue. The complaint alleges that after the commencement of plaintiff\u2019s original action against the shingle company, and during the pendency of the action, the shingle company became insolvent and was adjudged a bankrupt; that, notwithstanding that fact, the insurance company thereafter continued to defend said action and to direct and control the proceedings therein. The shingle company, by reason of its insolvency and bankruptcy, is unable to satisfy the judgment, and the insurance company refuses to pay the judgment. The purpose of the complaint is to secure a decree adjudging the insurance company liable for the payment of $5,000 on account of plaintiff\u2019s judgment and ordering and directing said insurance company to pay said sum on account of said judgment for the benefit of plaintiff, and requiring the defendant shingle company, upon the payment of said sum, to give an acquittance and discharge to said insurance company of all liability. The character of this action in a federal court is a suit in equity to secure an equitable remedy, but the decree of the Circuit Court is brought here for review upon a writ of error. A decree in equity cannot be reviewed by a writ of error. The San Pedro, <em>2 </em>Wheat. 132, 140, 4 L. Ed. 202; McCollum v. Eager, 2 How. 61, 11 L. Ed. 179; Ballance v. Forsyth, 21 How. 389, 16 L.
