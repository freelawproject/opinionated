Cheek, filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for breach of contract and related causes of action after his employer, appellee United Healthcare of the Mid-Atlantic, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> terminated his employment. United responded with a motion to compel arbitration, which the Circuit Court granted. Cheek appealed, and we granted <em>certiorari </em>prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals. For the reasons discussed herein, we conclude that the arbitration agreement between Cheek and United is unenforceable for lack of consideration because United\u2019s promise to arbitrate is illusory and because United\u2019s employment of Cheek cannot serve as consideration for the arbitration agreement. Consequently, we shall reverse the order of the Circuit Court compelling arbitration and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">On November 17, 2000, United orally offered Cheek a position of employment as a senior sales executive, which was confirmed in writing the same day. The two-page letter set forth various conditions of United\u2019s offer of employment, including that Cheek accept United\u2019s \u201cEmployment Arbitration Policy.\u201d Specifically, the letter stated that enclosed with it were \u201csummaries of the United Group Internal Dispute and Employment Arbitration Policy which are conditions of your employment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>In a November 28, 2000, letter to United, Cheek wrote that he was \u201cdelighted to accept United Healthcare\u2019s generous offer\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll of the terms in your employment letter are amenable to me.\u201d He also indicated that he had submitted his resignation that morning to his current employer, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">On January 2, 2001, during Cheek\u2019s first day of employment with United, he received a copy of United\u2019s Employee Handbook, which contained summaries of United\u2019s Internal Dispute Resolution Policy and Employment Arbitration Policy (hereinafter, \u201cArbitration Policy\u201d or \u201cPolicy\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The summary of the Arbitration Policy described the scope of the Policy, the rules applicable in arbitration, how an employee initiates arbitration, and the types of relief available in arbitration. Specifically, the summary of the Policy stated that United \u201cbelieves that the resolution of disagreements\u201d between employees and United \u201care best accomplished by an internal dispute review (IDR) and, where that fails, by arbitration based on the rules of the American Arbitration Association.\u201d Accordingly, United declared in the summary of the Policy that arbitration \u201cis the final, exclusive and required forum for the resolution of all employment related disputes which are based on a legal claim\u201d and that \u201cany party to [such a dispute] may initiate the arbitration process.\u201d Particularly relevant to the disposition of this appeal, the summary of the Arbitration Policy also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">United Healthcare reserves the right to alter, amend, modify, or revoke the Policy at its sole and absolute discretion at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>any time with or without notice. The senior executive of Human Resources has the sole authority to alter, amend, modify, or revoke the Policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">On January 2, 2001, Cheek signed an \u201cAcknowledgment Form for the Code of Conduct and Employment Handbook.\u201d In that Form, Cheek acknowledged that he had \u201cspecifically received and reviewed,\u201d among other things, an \u201cInternal Dispute Resolution/Employment Arbitration Policy.\u201d The Form that Cheek signed also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">I understand that UnitedHealth Group Employment Arbitration Policy is a binding contract between UnitedHealth Group and me to resolve all employment-related disputes which are based on a legal claim through final and binding arbitration. I agree to submit all employment-related disputes based on legal elaim[sic] to arbitration under United-Health Group\u2019s policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Within seven months, on July 27, 2001, United informed Cheek that United was eliminating his position as of August 10, 2001, when, in fact, his employment was terminated. In response, on December 31, 2001, Cheek filed a four-count complaint against United in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In the complaint, Cheek sought damages for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of Maryland Code, \u00a7 3-501 et. seq. of the Labor and Employment Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cheek also claimed under the doctrine of promissory estoppel that United should have been precluded from denying the existence of a valid employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">On February 6, 2002, United filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss and/or Compel Arbitration and Stay Lawsuit\u201d with the Circuit Court. On May 15, 2002, after hearing from the parties, the Circuit Court entered an order dismissing Cheek\u2019s complaint and ordering him to submit his claims to arbitration. Thereafter, Cheek noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari, <em>Cheek v. United Healthcare, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>374 Md. 81, 821 A.2d 369 (2003), prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Cheek presents the following questions for review, which we have restructured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">(I) Whether the arbitration agreement between Cheek and United is \u201cunenforceable and void as against public policy\u201d because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">(A) The rules of the arbitration can be altered, revised, or amended at the sole discretion of United;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">(B) The arbitration agreement does not allow the arbitrator to conclude that an employee is anything other than an \u201cemployee at will;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">(C) The arbitration agreement was \u201cfoisted\u201d on Cheek after an employment contract was formed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">(II) Whether United\u2019s \u201csole and absolute discretion\u201d to \u201calter, amend, modify, or revoke\u201d its arbitration agreement with Cheek at any time renders its promise to arbitrate illusory and the arbitration agreement, therefore, unenforceable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">For the reasons discussed herein, we conclude that the arbitration agreement in the present case is unenforceable for lack of consideration because United\u2019s promise to arbitrate is illusory and United\u2019s employment of Cheek did not act as consideration for the arbitration agreement. Consequently, we need not address Cheek\u2019s remaining questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">Cheek contends that the Circuit Court erred in compelling arbitration and advances several arguments in support of that contention. Cheek claims that the Arbitration Policy \u201clacks mutuality\u201d and is also \u201cvoid as against public policy\u201d because it states that United has \u201cthe right to alter, amend, modify, or revoke the Policy at its sole and absolute discretion at any time with or without notice.\u201d Additionally, Cheek argues that the Arbitration Policy \u201clacks consideration.\u201d In support of that claim, Cheek asserts that he agreed to the Arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Policy after he had already entered into a binding oral contract of employment with United. Consequently, Cheek asserts that he \u201creceived nothing that he had not already [received].\u201d Cheek further claims that the Arbitration Policy is one of \u201cadhesion\u201d and that he was acting under \u201cduress\u201d when he signed it because he was in an inferior bargaining position, because the arbitration agreement precludes an arbitrator from finding anything other than at-will employment, and because the agreement was offered to him on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis after he had already given up his position at Blue Cross/Blue Shield of the District of Columbia. Finally, Cheek contends that the Arbitration Policy is unenforceable because United\u2019s promise to arbitrate is \u201cillusory.\u201d In support of that contention, Cheek relies on <em>Floss v. Ryan\u2019s Family Steak Houses, Inc., </em>211 F.3d 306 (6th Cir.2000), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held, according to Cheek, that a \u201csubstantially similar arbitration scheme was [illusory and therefore] unenforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AlF\">United, on the other hand, contends that it and Cheek \u201centered into a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement.\u201d Contrary to Cheek\u2019s assertion, United claims that the Arbitration Policy is supported by \u201cmutuality of obligation\u201d because United \u201cpromised to provide Cheek employment for, <em>inter alia, </em>Cheek\u2019s promise to abide by the terms of the [arbitration agreement],\u201d and because it promised to submit to arbitration \u201call employment related disputes which are based on a legal claim.\u201d That United reserved the right to modify the Arbitration Policy, it asserts, \u201cis of no consequence to the issue of mutuality.\u201d United also claims that the Arbitration Policy was supported by \u201cadequate consideration.\u201d In support of that claim, United rejects Cheek\u2019s assertion that the Arbitration Policy was entered into after his employment commenced, and further argues that the \u201cmutual promise to arbitrate\u201d and United\u2019s \u201ccontinued employment\u201d of Cheek each served as adequate consideration to support the Arbitration Policy. Additionally, United argues that the Arbitration Policy is not a contract of adhesion because it is a \u201csimple\u201d four-page document, because there is no evidence of any \u201cgreat disparity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>bargaining power between the parties,\u201d and because the Arbitration Policy does not preclude an arbitrator from finding an employment contract. Finally, United asserts that a promise is not illusory \u201csimply because it permits one party to unilaterally modify [an] agreement without notice,\u201d and that its right to modify the Arbitration Policy, therefore, does not \u201cdestroy [its] promise to arbitrate Cheek\u2019s dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We have described arbitration as \u201cthe process whereby parties voluntarily agree to substitute a private tribunal for the public tribunal otherwise available to them.\u201d <em>Gold Coast Mall, Inc. v.

Otherwise it shall deny the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The determination of whether there is an agreement to arbitrate, of course, depends on contract principles since arbitration is a matter of contract. As such, \u201ca party cannot be required to submit any dispute to arbitration that it has not agreed to submit.\u201d <em>Curtis G. Testerman Co. v.

Kandel, </em>308 Md. 183, 191, 517 A.2d 1092, 1096 (1986)). In particular, we have recognized that the \u201c[fjorebearance to exercise a right or pursue a claim,\u201d can \u201cconstitute[ ] sufficient consideration to support .[an] ... agreement.\u201d <em>Chernick, </em>327 Md. at 480, 610 A.2d at 774 (citing <em>Erie Ins. Exch. v. Calvert Fire Ins., </em>253 Md. 385, 389, 252 A.2d 840, 842 (1969)); <em>Beall, </em>291 Md. at 230, 434 A.2d at 1019 (\u201cforbearance to exercise a legal right is sufficient consideration to support a promise.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">A promise becomes consideration for another promise only when it constitutes a binding obligation. Without a binding obligation, sufficient consideration does not exist to support a legally enforceable agreement. <em>See Tyler v. Capitol Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>206 Md. 129, 134, 110 A.2d 528, 530 (1955)(recognizing that \u201c \u2018If [an] option goes so far as to render illusory the promise of the party given the option, there is indeed no sufficient consideration, and therefore no contract ____\u2019 \u201d)(quoting 1 <em>Williston on Contracts, </em>Sec. 141 (Rev. Ed.)). <em>See also </em>Restatement of Contracts 2d \u00a7 77 cmt. a (1981)(\u201cWhere the apparent assurance of performance is illusory, it is not consideration for a return promise.\u201d); 2 Arthur L. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 5.28 (2003)(explain-ing that \u201can illusory promise is neither enforceable against the one making it, nor is it operative as a consideration for a return promise,\u201d and that \u201cif there is no other consideration for a return promise, the result is that no contract is created.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">An \u201cillusory promise\u201d appears to be a promise, but it does not actually bind or obligate the promisor to anything. An illusory promise is composed of \u201cwords in a promissory form that promise nothing.\u201d Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 5.28 (2003). \u201cThey do not purport to put any limitation on the freedom of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the alleged promisor. If A makes an illusory promise, A\u2019s words leave A\u2019s future action subject to A\u2019s own future whim, just as it would have been had A said nothing at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, the Restatement of Contracts explains that \u201c[wjords of promise which by their terms make performance entirely optional with the \u2018promisor\u2019 whatever may happen, or whatever course of conduct in other respects he may pursue, do not constitute a promise.\u201d Restatement of Contracts 2d \u00a7 2 cmt. e. Likewise, \u201cthe promise is too indefinite for legal enforcement is the promise where the promisor retains an unlimited right to decide later the nature or extent of his performance. The unlimited choice in effect destroys the promise and makes it merely illusory.\u201d 1 Samuel Williston, Contracts, \u00a7 4:24 (4th Ed. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">United initiated the arbitration with Cheek; it has not revoked nor in any way altered the Arbitration Policy with Cheek at any time. Nonetheless, the fact that \u201cUnited HealthCare reserves the right to alter, amend, modify, or revoke the [Arbitration] Policy at its sole and absolute discretion at any time with or without notice\u201d creates no real promise, and therefore, insufficient consideration to support an enforceable agreement to arbitrate. Indeed, the plain and unambiguous language of the clause appears to allow United to revoke the Employment Arbitration Policy even after arbitration is invoked, and even after a decision is rendered, because United can \u201crevoke\u201d the Policy \u201cat any time.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude that United\u2019s \u201cpromise\u201d to arbitrate employment disputes is entirely illusory, and therefore, no real promise at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>In so concluding, we align ourselves with courts from other jurisdictions that have found similar language to be illusory. In <em>Floss v. Ryan\u2019s Family Steak Houses, Inc., </em>211 F.3d 306 (6th Cir.2000), the United States Court <em>of </em>Appeals for the Sixth Circuit was\u2019 called upon to interpret an arbitration agreement between the appellants and a third-party arbitration service provider, Employment Dispute Services, Inc. (hereinafter, \u201cEDSI\u201d), which the appellants were required to enter into in order to be considered for employment by Ryan\u2019s Family Steak Houses. <em>Id. </em>at 309. In the agreement, EDSI agreed to provide a forum for arbitration, but reserved the right to alter the applicable rules and procedures of arbitration without any notification to or consent from the appellants. <em>Id. </em>at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The Sixth Circuit concluded that the agreement was unenforceable because there was no \u201cmutuality of obligation\u201d and therefore, no consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 316. In so concluding, the Court reasoned that EDSI\u2019s promise to provide an arbitration forum was \u201cillusory\u201d because EDSI had \u201creserved the right to alter the applicable rules and procedures without any obligation to notify, much less receive consent from\u201d the appellants. <em>Id. </em>at 315-16. The Court explained that \u201can illusory promise arises when a promisor retains the right to decide whether or not to perform the promised act\u201d and that \u201c[a] promise is also illusory when its indefinite nature defies legal enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315. <em>See also Penn v. Ryan\u2019s Family Steak Houses, Inc., </em>269 F.3d 753, 759, 761 (7th Cir.2001) (construing a similar agreement where EDSI had sole, unilateral right to amend arbitration rules; holding that EDSI\u2019s promise was illusory, and that the arbitration agreement, therefore, was unenforceable).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Similarly, in the case before us, United has the right to \u201calter, amend, modify, or revoke the [Employment Arbitration] Policy at its sole and absolute discretion at any time with or without notice\u201d and without consent. United, however, claims that <em>Floss </em>is distinguishable because the Employee Arbitration Policy at issue in the present case, unlike the agreement in <em>Floss, </em>does not allow United to modify the rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>of arbitration, which are based on those of the American Arbitration Association. Additionally, United highlights criticism of the <em>Floss </em>decision incorporated in Corbin on Contracts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">If EDSI modified the rules and procedures of its arbitral tribunals in such a way that the resulting rules and procedures continued to resemble something we might recognize as \u2018arbitration,\u2019 then EDSI\u2019s modification fell within the promise to arbitrate, and EDSI would still be doing what it promised ... it would do: arbitrate their disputes with Ryan\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 5.28 (2003 Supp). Even Corbin on Contracts, however, recognizes that \u201c[t]here might be disputes at the margins,\u201d in which a finding of an illusory promise would be appropriate. <em>Id. </em>Certainly, the ability to completely revoke an arbitration policy unilaterally, at any time, even after invocation and decision, and without notice to or consent from the employee, is at that margin.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit also has found language similar to the language at hand to be illusory. In <em>Dumais v. American Golf Corp., </em>299 F.3d 1216 (2002), Dumais, the employee, signed a \u201cNew Co-Worker Authorization <em>&amp; </em>Acknowledgment Form\u201d that bound her to the provisions of American Golf Corporation\u2019s employee handbook, which included an arbitration provision. <em>Id. </em>at 1217. A provision of the handbook stated that American Golf \u201creserves the right to at any time change, delete, modify, or add to any of the provisions contained in this handbook at its sole discretion\u201d with the exception of the arbitration provision. <em>Id. </em>Another provision stated that American Golf had the right to amend, supplement, or revise everything in the handbook, and this provision did not exclude the arbitration provision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The Tenth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the Federal District Court for the District of New Mexico denying American Golfs motion to compel arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 1220. The Court reasoned that the conflicting sections of the employee handbook created an ambiguity that should be construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>against American Golf. <em>Id. </em>at 1219. Accordingly, the Court found that American Golf had the ability to \u201cchange, delete, modify, or add\u201d to the arbitration provision at any time, which rendered \u201cthe alleged agreement between American Golf and [Dumais] to arbitrate their employment disputes illusory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1220. <em>See also Phox, </em>230 F.Supp.2d at 1282 (holding employer\u2019s promise to arbitrate \u201cillusory\u201d because employer reserved \u201cthe right to modify or cancel the provisions\u201d of an employee handbook, including an arbitration clause, \u201cat its sole discretion\u201d); <em>Gourley v.

According to United, its \u201cemployment or continued employment of Cheek constituted sufficient consideration for the agreement to arbitrate.\u201d United asserts that, by providing Cheek with a job, it has given sufficient consideration for Cheek\u2019s promise to arbitrate employment disputes, so that United\u2019s promise is not illusory. To agree with United would place this Court in the untenable position of having to go beyond the confines of the arbitration agreement itself and into an analysis of the validity of the larger contract, an inquiry which we cannot make. Moreover, we always would have to find that consideration exists to support an arbitration agreement in situations in which performance of the contract has occurred. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Maryland\u2019s Arbitration Act \u201cexpresses the legislative policy favoring enforcement of agreements to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>374 Md. at 641, 824 A.2d at 93. The Arbitration Act expresses this policy by \u201cstrictly confining] the function of the court in suits to compel arbitration to the resolution of a single issue-is there an agreement to arbitrate the subject matter of a particular dispute.\u201d <em>Gold Coast Mall, </em>298 Md. at 103-04, 468 A.2d at 95; <em>Holmes, </em>336 Md. at 546, 649 A.2d at 371 (1994) (\u201cThe narrow scope of the court\u2019s involvement [in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>petition to compel, or stay, arbitration] follows from our recognition of the legislative intent to favor arbitration.\u201d); <em>Crown Oil &amp; Wax Co., </em>320 Md. at 557-58, 578 A.2d at 1189 (stating that a court is prohibited under Section 3-210 of the Arbitration Act from inquiring into the merits of a claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In order to observe this mandate, we have followed the lead of the Supreme Court in <em>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967), by considering an arbitration clause of a larger contract to be severable therefrom. In <em>Holmes, </em>we were called upon to determine \u201cwhether allegations of fraudulent inducement and violations of the Franchise Act in a franchise agreement containing a broad arbitration clause are sufficient to permit the franchisee to avoid arbitration of a dispute.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>336 Md. at 541, 649 A.2d at 368. We recognized that the Supreme Court in <em>Prima Paint, supra, </em>in considering the same issue, reviewed the policies of the Federal Arbitration Act favoring the enforcement of arbitration agreements, and determined that \u201cwhere a party opposed a motion for arbitration based on allegations that there was fraud in the inducement of the entire contract, the issue is one for an arbitrator, not a court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541-42, 649 A.2d at 368. The \u201creasoning behind <em>Prima Paint,\u201d </em>we noted, \u201cis that the arbitration clause is a severable part of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 649 A.2d at 369. We then recognized that Maryland\u2019s Arbitration Act is the \u201cState analogue\u201d to the Federal Arbitration Act, because both embody a policy of enforcing valid arbitration agreements. <em>Id. </em>at 541, 649 A.2d at 368. Reviewing additional federal and state case law, we observed that mutual promises to arbitrate act as \u201can independently enforceable contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 649 A.2d at 370. In an enforceable arbitration agreement, we explained, each party has promised to arbitrate disputes arising from an underlying contract, and \u201ceach promise provides consideration for the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in a motion to compel arbitration, a court must determine whether \u201cthere is a mutual exchange of promises to arbitrate,\u201d and \u201c[o]nce a court determines that the making of the agreement to arbitrate is not in dispute, its inquiry ceases, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>agreement to arbitrate has been established as a valid and enforceable contract.\u201d Id. at 544, 649 A.2d at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">United, however, invites us to disregard the narrow scope of our role by looking beyond the Arbitration Policy and into the underlying employment agreement to determine whether consideration exists to support an agreement to arbitrate. To accept United\u2019s assertion that its employment or continued employment of Cheek constituted consideration for the Arbitration Policy would require that we inquire into, and at least make an implicit determination about, the nature of the underlying employment agreement. Indeed, the merits of the underlying controversy in the present case call into question the type of employment relationship that existed between United and Cheek. In his complaint to the Circuit Court, Cheek claimed, among other things, damages for breach of contract, alleging that United \u201cmaterially breached its contractual obligation to [Cheek] by failing to pay [Cheek] his base pay, incentive compensation, and other benefits.\u201d The November 17, 2000 letter memorializing United\u2019s offer of employment to Cheek, however, states that \u201cyou [Cheek] retain the right to terminate your employment with [United], at any time and for any reason, as does [United].\u201d Similarly, the employee handbook states in part that its provisions, except for the Arbitration Policy, \u201cdo not establish a contract or any particular terms or conditions of employment between [Cheek] and [United]. None of the policies constitute or are intended to constitute a promise of employment.\u201d Given the language of the letter and the handbook, and the relief sought in the complaint, it is apparent that the parties disagree about whether the employment relationship between Cheek and United was \u201cat will,\u201d in which case employment \u201cmay be legally terminated at the pleasure of either party at any time,\u201d or whether it imposed contractual employment obligations upon United. Therefore, were we to entertain United\u2019s assertion regarding Cheek\u2019s employment as consideration, we would be straying into the prohibited morass of the merits of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>United, nonetheless, urges us to find employment as consideration, as the Court of Special Appeals did in <em>Simko, Inc. v. Graymar Co., </em>55 Md.App. 561, 464 A.2d 1104 (1983). <em>Simko, </em>however, is inapposite. In that case, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that continued employment of an at-will employee for a substantial period beyond the threat of discharge was sufficient consideration to support a post-employment covenant not to compete. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 464 A.2d at 1107-08. The present case involves an arbitration agreement, not a covenant not to compete. As previously discussed, in determining whether an arbitration agreement contained within a larger agreement is enforceable, courts are limited to determining only one thing: whether a valid arbitration agreement exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In concluding that United\u2019s employment or continued employment of Cheek does not act as consideration in return for Cheek\u2019s promise to arbitrate, we join at least two other state courts. In <em>The Money Place, LLC. v. Barnes, </em>349 Ark. 411, 78 S.W.3d 714 (2002), the Supreme Court of Arkansas determined that an arbitration provision in The Money Place\u2019s Deferred Presentment Agreement was invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 715. The plaintiffs in <em>The Money Place </em>filed a class-action suit against that business, \u201calleging usury in its payday-loan/deferred-check presentment business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining that the arbitration agreement was invalid, the Arkansas Supreme Court rejected The Money Place\u2019s claim that if the entire Deferred Presentment Agreement was supported by sufficient consideration, then the arbitration clause also was enforceable based upon the same consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 717. \u201cTo analyze the contract as The Money Place\u201d suggested, the Court stated, would require it \u201cto go to the merits of the underlying case,\u201d for if fees collected by The Money Place in its payday-loan/deferred-check presentment business were, \u201cin reality, interest, and are usurious, then the contract [would have lacked] consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court then stated that it was \u201cfollowing] the lead of the United States Supreme Court\u201d in declining to address whether there was consideration for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>contract as a whole and in \u201climit[ing][its] inquiry into whether the arbitration provision of the contract ... is valid.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In <em>Stevens/Leinweber/Sullens, Inc. v. Holm Development and Management, Inc., </em>165 Ariz. 25, 795 P.2d 1308 (Ct.App.1990), the Court of Appeals of Arizona concluded that Holm, the owner of a construction project, could not \u201c \u2018borrow1 consideration from the principal contract to support an arbitration provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313. An addendum to the construction contract granted Holm \u201cthe absolute option of selecting either arbitration or litigation as the means of dispute resolution\u201d and also gave Holm \u201cthe right to reconsider its choice of dispute resolution \u2018at any time, prior to a final judgment in the ongoing proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In concluding that the arbitration provisions were void for lack of consideration, Arizona\u2019s intermediate appellate court reasoned that it could not look to consideration in the underlying contract because the arbitration provisions constituted a separable and independent agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">As support for its conclusion that the arbitration provisions were separable from the construction contract, the Arizona Court looked to two provisions of Arizona\u2019s arbitration act, which are similar to the Maryland Act, and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Prima Paint, supra, </em>upon which we relied in <em>Holmes, supra. </em>Section 12-1502 of the Arizona Revised Statute, according to the Court, \u201crestricts judicial review to a determination of whether a valid arbitration provision exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1311. That Section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">On application of a party showing [a valid agreement to arbitrate] and the opposing party\u2019s refusal to arbitrate, the court shall order the parties to proceed with arbitration, but if the opposing party denies the existence of the agreement to arbitrate, the court shall proceed summarily to the determination of the issue so raised and shall order arbitration if found for the moving party. Otherwise, the application shall be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Section 12-1501, the Court stated, \u201csets forth the grounds upon which the validity of an arbitration provision may be challenged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That Statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>A written agreement to submit any existing controversy to arbitration or a provision in a written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. (Emphasis omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">These two statutory provisions, when \u201c[r]ead in conjunction,\u201d the Arizona Court declared, \u201cembody the concept of separability endorsed by the United States Supreme Court in\u201d <em>Prima Paint, supra. Id. </em>at 1312. Finally, the Court rejected Holm\u2019s contention that the arbitration provision should be considered separate from the underlying contract only when necessary to preserve an agreement to arbitrate, reasoning that nothing in the language of A.R.S. Section 12-1501 warranted such a result, and that the doctrine of separability was in fact \u201cinherent in the language\u201d of that Statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We disagree with cases from other jurisdictions that determine that consideration for an underlying contract also can serve as consideration for an arbitration agreement within the contract, even when the arbitration agreement is drafted so that one party is absolutely bound to arbitrate all disputes, but the other party has the sole discretion to amend, modify, or completely revoking the arbitration agreement at any time and for any reason. Indeed, the cases of <em>Kelly v. UHC Mgmt. Co., Inc., </em>967 F.Supp. 1240 (N.D.Ala.1997), decided by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Southern Division, and <em>McNaughton v. United Healthcare Servs., Inc., </em>728 So.2d 592 (Ala.1998), from the Supreme Court of Alabama, both involved the same disclaimer language of United\u2019s Arbitration Policy at issue in this case, namely, that United \u201creserves the right to alter, amend, modify, or revoke this policy at its sole and absolute discretion at any time with or without notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The Federal District Court held that United\u2019s ability \u201cto alter, amend, modify, or revoke [the Arbitration Policy] at its sole and absolute discretion at any time with or without notice,\u201d did not render the Policy unenforceable for lack of consideration. <em>Kelly, </em>967 F.Supp. at 1258. According to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>District Court, the plaintiffs in the case provided consideration by \u201ctheir promise to arbitrate employment disputes,\u201d and United \u201cgave consideration in continuing to employ the plaintiffs in exchange for their signing the arbitration agreements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Supreme Court of Alabama, in a five-to-four decision, relied in part on the Federal District Court\u2019s decision, in concluding that United\u2019s Arbitration Policy was a binding agreement. <em>McNaughton, </em>728 So.2d at 595-96. The Court rejected McNaughton\u2019s contention that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable for lack of mutuality of obligation, as well as his argument that the language of the Arbitration Policy rendered it \u201cvoid under the doctrine of unconscionability/mutuality of remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596. The Alabama Court also concluded that \u201cunder clear Alabama contract law, United\u2019s providing at-will employment of McNaughton constituted sufficient consideration in exchange for McNaughton\u2019s agreement to arbitrate her employment disputes under United\u2019s arbitration policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Other cases, as well, have concluded that consideration from an underlying contract, or continued employment, can support an arbitration clause and render it enforceable. <em>See e.g. Blair v. Scott Specialty Gases, </em>283 F.3d 595, 604 n. 3 (3rd Cir.2002) (noting in dicta that continued employment may serve as consideration for an agreement to arbitrate); <em>Barker v. Golf U.S.A., Inc., </em>154 F.3d 788, 792 (8th Cir.1998) (concluding that under Oklahoma law, \u201cmutuality of obligation is not required for arbitration clauses so long as the contract as a whole is supported by consideration\u201d); <em>Doctor\u2019s Assocs., Inc. v. Distajo, </em>66 F.3d 438, 453 (2nd Cir.1995) (stating that Connecticut courts would conclude that when an arbitration agreement is integrated into a larger contract, consideration for the contract as a whole would cover the arbitration clause as well); <em>Wilson Electrical Contractors, Inc. v. Minnotte Contracting Corp., </em>878 F.2d 167, 169 (6th Cir.1989) (finding that arbitration clause within larger contract did not require consideration independent from consideration of larger contract; also stating that <em>Prima Paint, supra, </em>\u201cdoes not <em>require </em>separate consideration for an arbitration provision contained within a valid contract.\u201d); <em>Avid Engineering, Inc. v. Orlando Marketplace Ltd., </em>809 So.2d 1, 4 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2001) (\u201cBecause there was sufficient consideration to support the entire contract, the arbitration provision was not void for lack of mutuality of obligation.\u201d); <em>Sablosky v. Edward S. Gordon Co., </em>73 N.Y.2d 133, 538 N.Y.S.2d 513, 535 N.E.2d 643, 646 (1989) (\u201cIf there is consideration for the entire agreement that is sufficient; the consideration supports the arbitration option, as it does every other obligation in the agreement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We disagree with these cases. As previously discussed, under Maryland law, the role of the courts in a motion to compel or stay arbitration is strictly circumscribed; we may only consider whether an agreement to arbitrate the dispute at hand exists; we must not stray into the merits of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>underlying disagreements. To do so could eclipse the role of the arbitrator, should a valid agreement exist, and therefore run afoul of strong Federal and Maryland policies favoring arbitration as a viable method of dispute resolution. We believe that the cases referred to above pay short shrift to this principle. Even if we could touch upon the underlying merits in a motion to compel or stay arbitration, however, we would decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">If we were to conclude that consideration from the underlying agreement was sufficient to support the arbitration agreement, we would be precluded from ever finding an arbitration agreement invalid for lack of consideration when performance of a contract has already occurred, no matter how illusory the arbitration agreement was.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Finally, we find that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Green Tree Financial Corp.-Alabama v. Randolph, </em>531 U.S. 79, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000), is distinguishable from the present case. In that case, Randolph financed the purchase of a mobile home through Green Tree Financial Corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 82, 121 S.Ct. at 517, 148 L.Ed.2d at 378. She signed a Manufactured Home Retail Installment Contract and Security Agreement that contained a provision providing that all disputes arising from the contract would be resolved in binding arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 83, 121 S.Ct. at 518, 148 L.Ed.2d at 378. Randolph later sued Green Tree in the United States District Court for the District of Alabama, alleging that they violated the Truth in Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. <em>Id. </em>Green Tree responded with a motion to compel arbitration, which the District Court granted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Before the Supreme Court, Randolph contended that the arbitration clause contained within the Manufactured Home Retail Installment Contract and Security Agreement was unenforceable. <em>Id. </em>at 84, 121 S.Ct. at 518, 148 L.Ed.2d at 379. In support of that contention, she claimed that because the clause was silent as to who would pay for arbitration costs, there was a possibility that she would be responsible for the costs, which, if prohibitively expensive, would effectively pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>elude her from pursuing her statutory claims. <em>Id. </em>at 89, 121 S.Ct. at 521, 148 L.Ed.2d at 382. The Supreme Court rejected Randolph\u2019s contention because it was too \u201cspeculative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 121 S.Ct. at 521-22, 148 L.Ed.2d at 383-84. The record, the Court noted, did \u201cnot show that Randolph will bear such costs if she goes to arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 121 S.Ct. at 522, 148 L.Ed.2d. at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The Arbitration Policy in the present case, unlike the agreement in <em>Green Tree Financial, </em>is not \u201csilent\u201d as to who is bound to arbitrate; it clearly and specifically gives United the sole discretion to modify, alter, amend, or revoke arbitration for any reason, at any time, but Cheek is bound to arbitrate \u201call employment-related disputes.\u201d No \u201cspeculation\u201d as to the legal consequences of this Policy is necessary. Cheek is bound to arbitrate any disputes arising from the employment relationship, while United can revoke the policy at any time, for any reason, without notice or consent. Consequently, whether United chooses to exercise the option to revoke the policy or not begs the question, because it had not bound itself to a course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We have concluded that the arbitration agreement in the present case is unenforceable for lack of consideration. This is so because United\u2019s promise to arbitrate was illusory, and because United\u2019s employment of Cheek cannot serve as consideration for the arbitration agreement. Accordingly, we need not, and do not, express any opinion as to Cheek\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.

We find persuasive the dissenting opinion in <em>McNaughton, </em>of Justice J. Cook. Justice Cook explained that an at-will employment contract existed separately from the Employment Arbitration Policy. <em>Id. </em>at 604. The Justice also explained that the at-will contract was unilateral in nature, because the promise to pay is accepted by the act of performing work, but that an arbitration agreement is a bilateral and executory contract, where the parties bargain for mutual promises, not performance. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Wagner v. City of Globe, </em>150 Ariz. 82, 85, 722 P.2d 250, 253 (1986) (\"Employment contracts, particularly those which would be considered at-will, are the best and most typical examples of <em>unilateral contracts.\u201d)). </em>Thus, she determined that there existed two separate agreements, each of which was of a different class; the at-will employment contract as unilateral, and the arbitration agreement as bilateral. The consideration for the unilateral at-will employment contract (the promise to pay), Justice Cook opined, could not serve as the consideration for the separate bilateral agreement to arbitrate, because the parties to such a bilateral agreement bargained for mutual promises to forgo their rights to go to court and resolve disputes in arbitration. She also criticized the majority\u2019s determination that because continued at-will employment is sufficient consideration for a non-competition agreement between an employer and an employee, it could likewise act as consideration for an arbitration agreement. According to Justice Cook, the majority's analogy was flawed because a non-competition agreement is a type of unilateral contract, but an arbitration agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>is bilateral. <em>Id. </em>at 605. Thus, she concluded that United Healthcare Services\u2019s promise to arbitrate was illusoiy, and that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable. <em>Id. </em>at 605.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b205-8\">HARRELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ann\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">I respectfully dissent.

That offer included conditions, such as the requirement that Cheek agree to be bound by United\u2019s \u201cEmployment Arbitration Policy\u201d. On 28 November 2000, Cheek authored an acceptance letter to United informing it that he was \u201cdelighted to accept United Healthcare\u2019s generous offer\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll of the terms of your employment letter are amenable to me.\u201d (Maj. op. at 142). The mutual obligations of the agreement to arbitrate and the consideration for the contract of employment render the agreement to arbitrate enforceable in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Cheek\u2019s unsworn and unsubstantiated assertion that he did not receive, until after commencing employment with United, the summary of United\u2019s Arbitration Policy referred to as an attachment in the 17 November 2000 offer letter, is unconvincing. His attorney\u2019s artfully framed statement, made in passing in the Response and Opposition to United\u2019s motion in the Circuit Court, that \u201cno detail\u201d of the policy was provided, is also unavailing. (Maj. op. at 141, n. 2). United\u2019s human resources representative (and the author of United\u2019s 17 November offer letter to Cheek), in an affidavit in support of United\u2019s motion to compel arbitration filed in the Circuit Court, appended a \u201ctrue and correct copy of the offer letter that was provided to Mr. Cheek\u201d and stated further that United\u2019s company policy was also to distribute a summary of the arbitration policy upon commencement of employment. Cheek conceded that he received a copy of the four-page summary of United\u2019s Arbitration Policy at the commencement of his employment. (Maj. op. at 143).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Even were one to assume Cheek did not receive a summary of United\u2019s Arbitration Policy with the 17 November offer letter, his unqualified acceptance of the offer, including the arbitration condition, was not obtained by duress, Cheek\u2019s suggestion to the contrary notwithstanding. This Court has held that the \u201ctest [for] duress is essentially composed of two elements: \u2018(1) a wrongful act or threat by the opposite party to the transaction ..., and (2) a state of mind in which the complaining party was overwhelmed by fear and precluded from using free will or judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Joy, </em>283 Md. 205, 217, 389 A.2d 874, 881 (1978) (quoting <em>Plechner v. Widener College, Inc., </em>418 F.Supp. 1282, 1294 (E.D.Pa.1976)). <em>See also Central Bank v. Copeland, </em>18 Md. 305 (1862). If one hopes to benefit from the law of duress, then that person cannot place himself or herself into the situation which is the impetus for the deprivation of that person\u2019s free will. \u201cThe mere stress of business does not constitute duress when the person against whom it is asserted is not responsible for the circumstances.\u201d <em>Shillman v. Hob-stetter, </em>249 Md. 678, 693, 241 A.2d 570, 578 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Cheek implies that he was forced into employment with United, and thus bound by its \u201cundetailed\u201d arbitration policy, because he involuntarily was placed in a position where he had no alternative but to accept the terms of the contract after resigning from a position with his former employer. On the contrary, Cheek <em>freely and voluntarily </em>placed himself into a position whereby he had no other immediate employment opportunities, except with United. Cheek submitted his resignation to his former employer before he notified United of his acceptance of its employment offer. United is \u201cnot responsible for the circumstances\u201d surrounding Cheek\u2019s decision to resign from his former employer before accepting United\u2019s offer and without apprising himself of any material information now claimed to be lacking or missing in United\u2019s offer. If Cheek did not have sufficient information regarding the announced condition of arbitration in the employment offered by United, he should not have resigned from his former employment and accepted United\u2019s offer before making further inqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>ry. The terms of employment with United did not change between the offer date and Cheek\u2019s acceptance. Because United did not commit any wrongful act to coerce Cheek\u2019s unconditional acceptance of its employment offer as presented, Cheek\u2019s decision to resign \u201cprematurely\u201d from his former employer should have no bearing on the outcome of this case. <em>Shillman, </em>249 Md. at 693, 241 A.2d at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">This Court dealt with the severability of an arbitration agreement from the contract of which it is a part in <em>Holmes v. Coverall North America, Inc., </em>336 Md. 534, 649 A.2d 365 (1994). The <em>Holmes </em>Court adopted the view \u201cthat an arbitration clause is a severable contract which is enforceable independently from the contract as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545, 649 A.2d at 370. The Court went on to state \u201cthat the mutual promises to arbitrate constitute a separate agreement contained in the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547, 649 A.2d at 371. See also <em>Allstate v. Stinebaugh, </em>374 Md. 631, 644, 824 A.2d 87, 95 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held to the same effect in <em>Johnson v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>148 F.3d 373 (4th Cir.1998). That case involved an arbitration agreement that applied to all job applicants at a retail store in Maryland. The Fourth Circuit concluded that the parties\u2019 mutual agreement to arbitrate constituted sufficient independent consideration to support the agreement to arbitrate, standing on its own. In so doing, the <em>Johnson </em>court cited to <em>O\u2019Neil v. Hilton Head Hosp., </em>115 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.1997), for the proposition that \u201can arbitration agreement was supported by adequate consideration where both parties agreed to be bound by the arbitration process.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>148 F.3d at 378. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>interpreting South Carolina law, involved the resort to arbitration in an employee discharge suit. The <em>O\u2019Neil </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">O\u2019Neil first argues the contract to arbitrate was not supported by adequate consideration because the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>was not binding on the hospital. O\u2019Neil\u2019s argument fails because its premise is mistaken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">Here the agreement to be bound by arbitration was a mutual one. The contract to arbitrate was proffered by the employer. Such a proffer clearly implies that both the employer and the employee would be bound by the arbitration process. If an employer asks an employee to submit to binding arbitration, it cannot then turn around and slip out of the arbitration process itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\"><em>O\u2019Neil, </em>115 F.3d at 274. The <em>O\u2019Neil </em>court reiterated that \u201ca mutual promise- to arbitrate constitutes sufficient consideration for this arbitration agreement.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>115 F.3d at 275 <em>(citing Rickborn v. Liberty Life Ins.

Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 424, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 1816, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967) (quoting <em>U.S. v.

Heron, </em>261 Md. 234, 242, 274 A.2d 636, 640 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In the present case, there is no indication that either Cheek or United intended severability of the arbitration agreement from the employment contract as a whole. The parties do not dispute that the employment contract as a whole is valid, enforceable, and supported by consideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such, the arbitration provision within the contract is supported by the consideration for the contract and is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The majority opinion in the present case commendably devotes attention to a review of cases from those of our sister jurisdictions that have addressed the consideration issue. <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 155-61. It then, however, places Maryland in the company of the decidedly minority view (\u201cwe join at least two other state courts\u201d <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 155) that consideration from the overarching contract should not be looked to as consideration to support an arbitration agreement within the contract. The justification for this position, in the minds of the majority, is that to do so would require the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>address the sufficiency of the consideration of the entire contract, a question, if raised, normally reserved for the arbiter. Maj. op. at 161. I fail to see this as a real problem. Courts are not required to inquire into the adequacy of consideration where there is at least some indicia of its presence. <em>See Blumenthal, </em>261 Md. at 242, 274 A.2d at 640. Further, the majority of our sister jurisdictions have decided that consideration from the overall contract may be used to support an arbitration clause, recognizing that doing so will result in sending <em>more </em>cases to the arbiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">I disagree further with the majority\u2019s rejection of the persuasive authority from the majority of courts that have addressed this issue. Maj. op. at 158-61. In <em>Avid Engineering v. Orlando Marketplace, Ltd., </em>809 So.2d 1 (Fla.App.2002), the written contract in question was \u201cto provide engineering services for an expansion of retail space.\u201d The court there held that \u201cbecause there was sufficient consideration to support the entire contract, the [embedded] arbitration provision was not void for lack of mutuality of obligation.\u201d <em>Avid, </em>809 So.2d at 4. The Court of Appeals of New York also has held that \u201cif there is consideration for the entire agreement that is sufficient; the consideration supports the arbitration option, as it does every other obligation in the agreement.\u201d <em>Sablosky v. Gordon Co., Inc., </em>73 N.Y.2d 133, 538 N.Y.S.2d 513, 516, 535 N.E.2d 643, 646 (1989) (involving the arbitration of commissions claimed to be due to real estate salespeople).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Federal courts, usually in the context of analyzing state laws, have analyzed and decided the issue in much the same way. The Third Circuit recently dealt with the issue of consideration for an arbitration agreement embedded in a contract in the case of <em>Blair v. Scott Specialty Gases, </em>283 F.3d 595 (2002). In <em>Blair, </em>an employee brought a sexual harassment suit against her former employer. The court, ordering arbitration pursuant to a provision in the employment agreement, stated that \u201cwhen both parties have agreed to be bound by arbitration, adequate consideration exists and the arbitration agreement should be enforced.\u201d <em>Blair, </em>283 F.3d at 603. The <em>Blair </em>court went on to state that \u201ca contract need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>have mutuality of obligation as long as the contract is supported by consideration.\u201d <em>Blair, </em>283 F.3d at 604 (referencing \u201cdecisions that have found that continued employment may serve as consideration\u201d, such as <em>Hightower v. GMRI, Inc., </em>272 F.3d 239, 243 (4th Cir.2001); <em>Venuto v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>No. 98-96, 1998 WL 414723, at *5, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis 11050, at *14-*15 (E.D.Pa. July 22, 1998) (holding that an at-will employee\u2019s continued employment provides adequate consideration for an arbitration provision)). In the context of an alleged breach of an employment contract, the Sixth Circuit found that <em>\u201cPrima Paint [supra] </em>does not require separate consideration for an arbitration provision contained within a valid contract.\u201d <em>Wilson Electrical Contractors, Inc. v. Min-notte Contracting Corp., </em>878 F.2d 167, 169 (6th Cir.1989). In a case in which a franchisee sued the franchisor for fraud, the Eighth Circuit, interpreting Oklahoma law, stated that it believed that \u201cmutuality of obligation is not required for arbitration clauses so long as the contract as a whole is supported by consideration.\u201d <em>Barker v. Golf U.S.A., </em>154 F.3d 788, 792 (8th Cir.1998). The <em>Barker </em>court relied on the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 79 (1979), for the proposition that \u201cif the requirement of consideration is met, there is no additional requirement of ... \u2018mutuality of obligation\u2019.\u201d (Internal citation omitted in original.) <em>Id. </em>The Second Circuit addressed the issue of consideration for an overall contract \u201cpouring over\u201d to an arbitration clause in <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates v. Distajo, </em>66 F.3d 438 (2d Cir.1995). In that case, the court, citing <em>Sablosky, supra, </em>stated that \u201cthe Connecticut courts would conclude that \u2018where the agreement to arbitrate is integrated into a larger unitary contract, the consideration for the contract as a whole covers the arbitration clause as well\u2019.\u201d <em>Distajo, </em>66 F.3d at 453. The <em>Distajo </em>court observed that \u201cmost courts facing this issue have arrived at the same conclusion [that the consideration supporting the overall contract can also support an arbitration provision, standing alone].\u201d <em>Distajo, </em>66 F.3d at 452 (citing to <em>Wilson, supra; Becker Autoradio U.S.A. v.

Both cases involve the Appellee here, United, or a related entity, as a party and interpret and apply its apparently uniform arbitration policy. More specifically, both cases involve the clause within United\u2019s arbitration policy whereby it \u201creserves the right to alter, amend, modify, or revoke the Policy at its sole and absolute discretion with or without notice.\u201d <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 142-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\"><em>Kelly v. UHC Management Company, Inc., </em>967 F.Supp. 1240 (N.D.Ala.1997), involved an employment discrimination claim for which United sought implementation of its then-new arbitration policy. After reviewing the same contract language as is at issue in the present case, the <em>Kelly </em>court stated that the only showing necessary for enforcement is that the arbitration \u201cagreements are supported by consideration, not \u2018mutuality of obligation\u2019.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>967 F.Supp. at 1260. In <em>McNaughton v. United Healthcare Services, </em>728 So.2d 592 (Ala.1998), an employee sued United for fraud and intentional interference with business relations relating to an interdepartmental transfer. United sought arbitration. The <em>McNaughton </em>court, applying Alabama law, stated that \u201cUnited\u2019s providing at-will employment to [appellant] constituted sufficient consideration in exchange for [appellant\u2019s] agreement to arbitrate [his] employment disputes under United\u2019s arbitration policy.\u201d <em>McNaughton, </em>728 So.2d at 595. The court reiterated that it had \u201cconsistently held that an employer\u2019s providing continued at-will employment is sufficient consideration to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>make an employee\u2019s promise to his employer binding.\u201d 728 So.2d at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The reasoning of the majority in the present case notwithstanding, I am persuaded that Maryland would be better advised to follow the national majority view permitting consideration for the contract to suffice as consideration for the embedded arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">We generally should strive, whenever possible, to find arbitration agreements between private parties enforceable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe courts \"will prefer a construction which will make the contract effective rather than one which will make it illusory or unenforceable.\u201d <em>Kelley Constr. Co. v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>247 Md. 241, 247, 230 A.2d 672, 676 (1967). United\u2019s Arbitration Policy, as explicated in the four page summary given Cheek, contains a provision under which the employer has \u201cthe right to alter, amend, modify, or revoke the Policy at its sole and absolute discretion at any time with or without notice.\u201d (Maj. op. at 142-43). This Court repeatedly has held generally that the reservation of the power to alter, amend, or terminate an agreement does not invalidate the agreement. \u201cThe conclusion should be drawn that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>unlimited option to cancel does not invalidate a contract where it can be shown that it does not wholly defeat consideration.\u201d <em>Stamatiades v. Merit Music Service, </em>210 Md. 597, 613, 124 A.2d 829, 837 (1956), citing <em>Tyler v. Capitol Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>206 Md. 129, 110 A.2d 528, 529 (1955). \u201cIt is only where the option reserved to the promisor is unlimited that his promise becomes illusory and incapable of forming part of a legal obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614, 124 A.2d at 838. <em>See Yarnick v. King, </em>259 Md. 241, 249, 269 A.2d 607, 611 (1970) (stating that \u201ca power to terminate in case performance is not satisfactory may be expressly reserved without invalidating the contract\u201d); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Brown, </em>348 Md. 708, 715, 705 A.2d 1158, 1161 (1998) (stating that \u201ca conditional promise may be consideration, and when a man acts in consideration of a conditional promise, if he gets the promise he gets all that he is entitled to by his act, and if, as events turn out, the condition is not satisfied, and the promise calls for no performance, there is no failure of consideration.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">United\u2019s reserved power to alter or terminate the arbitration agreement, however, was not without limit. That power should be read reasonably as exercisable only with regard to subsequent arbitrable conduct or acts, but not as to those acts which occurred prior to any asserted alteration or termination. Thus read, the Arbitration Policy was not illusory as United was bound to the original provisions of the arbitration agreement for all arbitrable incidents occurring prior to any purported change or revocation it might make with regard to the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The majority here focuses on an asserted lack of mutuality of obligation as a means to declare illusory United\u2019s promise to arbitrate. Such focus is short-sighted. We addressed the general problems associated with illusory contracts, versus those with a failure of consideration, in <em>Acme Markets, Inc. v. Dawson Enters., Inc., </em>253 Md. 76, 251 A.2d 839 (1969). In <em>Acme, </em>we stated that \u201cwhen a contract is entered into, a power of termination may be expressly reserved to either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>party or to both of them.\u201d <em>Acme, </em>253 Md. at 86, 251 A.2d at 845. We went on to state that \u201cthe reservation of such a power to terminate does not invalidate the contract or render the consideration for a promise insufficient, so long as the party reserving the power to terminate is irrevocably bound for any appreciable period of time or has materially changed any of his legal relations or otherwise rendered some performance capable of operating as a consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87, 251 A.2d at 846 (quoting 6 <em>A. Corbin, Contracts </em>\u00a7 1266 (1962)). We continued that \u201ca contract is not made invalid for lack of mutuality by the fact that one of the parties and not the other is given the option of terminating the contract on some condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 1A <em>A. Corbin, Contracts </em>\u00a7 265 (1963)). \u201cAlthough an option to terminate may be unilateral and appear to lack mutuality, it has been held that if the provisions are quite clear as to one party\u2019s option a court cannot be expected to relieve the other party of the consequences thereof because the bargain as to him was improvident, rash, foolish or oppressive\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 88-89, 251 A.2d at 847. When melded with the objective theory of contract interpretation, the result is identical to that discussed by this Court over fifty years ago, \u201cwhere the right to terminate a contract is reserved in the instrument itself, in the absence of fraud, undue influence, or mistake, such reservation is valid and will be enforced, if not contrary to equity and good conscience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 251 A.2d at 847 (quoting <em>Kahn v. Janowski, </em>191 Md. 279, 285-86, 60 A.2d 519, 521 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">As noted earlier, the arbitration agreement between United and Cheek is not illusory because the terms of the agreement, as construed here, may not be revoked or modified by United as to a particular arbitrable dispute after it has arisen. Stated otherwise, United is bound to the terms of the arbitration agreement as it exists at the time an arbitrable incident arises. It could not revoke or change the terms regarding prior acts triggering the then-prevailing arbitration provisions because \u201cno party has a right to rescind or modify a contract merely because he finds, in the light of changed conditions, that he has made a bad deal.\u201d <em>Harford County, </em>348 Md. at 384, 704 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>A.2d at 431. I note, however, that there is not the slightest hint in this record that United proposed any such change in, or revocation of, the Arbitration Policy incorporated in its contract with Cheek.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">United gave Cheek an opportunity to review and/or inform himself about the Arbitration Policy before he accepted the employment offer. Cheek freely entered into the employment contract without further inquiry into any \u201cdetails\u201d of that Policy. Cheek agreed to the arbitration agreement almost seven months before the subject arbitrable dispute arose. During that time, United made no attempt to alter, amend, modify, or revoke its Arbitration Policy. United was as bound to the Arbitration Agreement as was Cheek for the dispute giving rise to the present litigation. As such, United\u2019s promise was not illusory, and there was neither lack or failure of consideration or lack of mutuality of obligation. The contract contained a valid arbitration agreement, which was supported by consideration. As a result, it is my view that the parties, as ordered by the Circuit Court, should submit this dispute to arbitration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\">. No reasonable argument could be mounted on these facts of a failure of consideration in the employment contract. United promised to pay Cheek an initial annualized base salary of $75,000, an initial annual minimum sales incentive totaling $90,000, and a sign-on bonus of $25,000, together with other benefits and \u201cperks\u201d. In his acceptance of the offer, Cheek described it as \"generous\u201d and its terms \u201camenable\u201d to him. Thus, the majority opinion\u2019s concern that a court would have to evaluate the sufficiency of consideration for the overall contract, in resolving the issue of enforcement of the arbitration agreement, is not a factor in this case. <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 153-54.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-8\">. As a supplemental note, Cheek, as he sought to do here, should not be permitted to both sue for enforcement of the employment contract as a whole, while concurrently trying to enjoin enforcement of the arbitration clause contained therein. \"No party suing on a contract should be able to enforce certain contract provisions while simultaneously attempting to avoid the terms of an arbitration provision contained therein.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Bankers Ins. Co., </em>245 F.3d 315, 323 (4th Cir., 2001) <em>(citing to Int\u2019l Paper Co. v. Schwabedissen Maschinen &amp; Anlagen GMBH, </em>206 F.3d 411, 418 (4th Cir., 2000), holding that it would \u201cboth disregard equity and contravene [the FAA]\u201d to allow a plaintiff \"to claim the benefit of the contract and simultaneously avoid its burdens.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\">. Section 3-206(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code (2002 Repl. Vol., 2003 Supp.), dealing with the validity of arbitration agreements, states that written arbitration agreements are \"valid and enforceable, and [are] irrevocable, except upon grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-206(a) (2002). Section 3-206(b), however, provides that \u00a7 3-206(a) \u201cdoes not apply to an arbitration agreement between employers and employees ... unless it is expressly provided in the agreement that this subtitle shall apply.\u201d In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>McGrow, Pridgeon &amp; Co., </em>298 Md. 66, 467 A.2d 1025 (1983), we stated that \"the reference in \u00a7 3-206(b) to 'employers and employees\u2019 should be read as not including the arbitration agreement between employer and a single employee\u201d and that the Court\u2019s \"reading necessarily excludes from \u00a7 3-206(b) an agreement between an employer and a single employee to arbitrate future disputes.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>298 Md. at 78, 467 A.2d at 1031.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
