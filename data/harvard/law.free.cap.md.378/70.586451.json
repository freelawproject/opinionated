We shall hold that, in the context of a tort action against a Baltimore City landlord, based upon a child\u2019s consumption of lead-based paint which was present in the form of flaking, loose, or peeling paint in the leased premises, in violation of the Housing Code, the plaintiff does not have to show that the landlord had notice of the violation to establish a prima <em>facie </em>case. To the extent that our opinions in <em>Richwind v. Brunson, </em>335 Md. 661, 645 A.2d 1147 (1994), and its progeny, are inconsistent with this holding, those opinions are modified or overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The following facts were set forth in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion, <em>Lewin Realty III, Inc. v. Brooks, </em>138 Md.App. 244, 255-256, 771 A.2d 446, 452-453 (2001) (footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">\u201cIn August 1988, Shirley Parker rented a house at 1202 North Patterson Park Avenue, in Baltimore City. Fresh paint was applied to the interior of the house at the beginning of the tenancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">\u201cSharon Parker, Shirley Parker\u2019s daughter, moved into the North Patterson Park Avenue house (\u2018the House\u2019) soon after her mother rented it. On December 6, 1989, Sharon gave birth to Sean, the minor appellee, who lived there too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">\u201cSometime in February or March 1991, when Sean was slightly more than a year old, Lewin [Realty] purchased the House at auction. Lewin is owned by four stockholders, one of whom is Marvin Sober. * * * Mr. Sober is in charge of managing the company and conducting its day to day business. Before Lewin purchased the House, Mr. Sober went on a \u2018walk through\u2019 inspection of it. Sharon was present when the \u201cwalk through\u2019 took place, and accompanied Mr. Sober as he inspected the House. Sharon testified that at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the time of the \u2018walk through,\u2019 there was peeling, chipping, and flaking paint present in numerous areas of the interior of the House, including in Sean\u2019s bedroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">\u201cAfter Lewin purchased the House, it entered into a new lease with Shirley. It did not re-paint the interior of the House at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">\u201cIn February 1992, Sean was diagnosed with an elevated blood lead level. Four months later, in May 1992, a nurse from the Baltimore City Health Department (\u2018BCHD\u2019) came to the House and spoke to Sharon about Sean\u2019s elevated blood lead level. Sharon testified that she first learned about Sean\u2019s condition at that time. That same month, the BCHD issued a lead paint violation notice for the property to Lewin. The House was inspected and found to contain 56 areas of peeling, chipping, and flaking lead paint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Sharon Parker filed a five-count complaint individually and on behalf of her minor son, Sean, against Lewin Realty. The complaint alleged negligence with regard to Sean (count one), negligence with regard to Ms. Parker (count two), violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (count three), strict liability in tort (count four), and sought punitive damages (count five). Pursuant to the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City dismissed counts four and five. The respondent then filed a motion for summary judgment as to the remaining counts in the complaint. The Circuit Court granted the motion for summary judgment with respect to the Consumer Protection Act, strict liability in tort and punitive damages, but denied the motion as to the negligence counts. Subsequently, upon the petitioner\u2019s motion, the trial court also dismissed count two of the complaint which pertained to Sharon Parker\u2019s individual claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The remaining negligence count was based on several grounds, including, <em>inter alia: </em>(a) Lewin Realty\u2019s violation of the Baltimore City Code; (b) Sean\u2019s exposure to an unreasonable risk of harm from the lead-based paint while Lewin Realty knew that its dangerous properties were not known to Sean and not discoverable in the exercise of reasonable care; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>(c) Lewin Realty\u2019s failure to exercise reasonable care in properly maintaining the walls, doors, and ceilings after Lewin Realty had actual and constructive knowledge of the flaking paint condition; and (d) Lewin Realty\u2019s failure to exercise reasonable care to inspect the dwelling\u2019s paint when a reasonable inspection would have revealed the flaking paint condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The case proceeded to trial. Before trial, Lewin Realty had moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude from the evidence five documents, each entitled \u201cEmergency Violation Notice and Order to Remove Lead Nuisance.\u201d These violation notices, which were issued at various dates in the 1980\u2019s, pertained to other properties which were not involved in this case. The notices were issued by the Baltimore City Health Department to Mr. Sober and the companies with which he was associated at the time. Lewin Realty argued that the notices were not relevant, were inadmissible as \u201cother bad acts\u201d evidence, and were overly prejudicial. While perhaps relevant to the matter of Lewin Realty\u2019s knowledge of the health hazards of lead paint, Lewin argued that, because Mr. Sober testified to having such knowledge at the relevant time, the issue was not contested and therefore the notices were not relevant. The court denied the motion <em>in limine, </em>and the notices were admitted into evidence at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The jury found that Lewin Realty was liable under count one and awarded damages totaling $750,000. After the Circuit Court denied Lewin Realty\u2019s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, Lewin Realty took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals: The arguments made to the intermediate appellate court centered upon the admission of the violation notices pertaining to the unrelated properties. The Court of Special Appeals reversed and remanded the case for a new trial, holding that the admission of the notices pertaining to the unrelated properties was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">This Court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari, <em>Brooks v. Lewin Realty, </em>365 Md. 266, 778 A.2d 382 (2001). After the initial briefing and oral argument before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>this Court, we issued an order directing the parties to file supplemental briefs and setting the case for reargument on a matter not previously dealt with by the parties or the courts below. Our order had the effect of amending the previous order granting certiorari and adding an issue or issues to the case. <em>See Robinson v. Bunch, </em>367 Md. 432, 439-441, 788 A.2d 636, 641-642 (2002), and cases there cited; Maryland Rule 8-131(b). The order for supplemental briefs and reargument pointed out that language in <em>Richwind v. Brunson, supra, </em>335 Md. at 674 675, 645 A.2d at 1153-1154, and <em>Brown v. Dermer, </em>357 Md. 344, 361-362, 744 A.2d 47, 57 (2000), requires, for landlord liability in a case like the one at bar, that the plaintiff has the burden of pleading and proving that the landlord knew or had reason to know of the defective condition, <em>ie., </em>the existence of flaking, loose, or peeling paint. The order also pointed out that in <em>Richwind v. Brunson, supra, </em>335 Md. at 674, 645 A.2d at 1153, the Court indicated that the landlord has no \u201cduty to periodically inspect the premises during the leased period for dangerous conditions to determine if repairs are necessary.\u201d The order requested the parties \u201cto address whether this Court should reconsider and modify the above-[deseribed] requirements and standards applicable in personal injury actions against landlords based on alleged lead-based paint poisoning in leased residential property.\u201d More specifically, the order directed the parties to consider the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\">\u201c1. Whether a landlord should have a duty to inspect the premises, either at the inception of the lease or during the lease period, to determine wither there exists a flaking, loose, or peeling paint condition, or a lead-based paint condition, which should be abated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201c2. Whether plaintiffs in these types of actions should have the burden of pleading and establishing that the landlords had notice of a defective condition involving flaking, loose or peeling paint, or the presence of lead-based paint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">\u201c3. Whether, when there is a dangerous lead-based paint condition in leased residential property, the landlord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>should, as a matter of law, be presumed to have notice of the dangerous condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Although set forth in three separate paragraphs, the above-quoted language does not present three separate and distinct issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">If this Court holds that the plaintiff, in cases such as this, need not prove that the landlord had notice of a defective condition involving flaking, loose, or peeling paint, or involving lead-based paint, and that, as a matter of law, the landlord should be presumed to have knowledge of the dangerous condition, then the violation notices which were admitted into evidence in this case would be clearly irrelevant to the issues of liability and compensatory damages. The landlord\u2019s knowledge would be a non-issue. Consequently, under this scenario, we would affirm the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 order for a new trial, although on a different ground than that relied upon by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Before this Court, the petitioners essentially argue that <em>Richwind v. Brunson, supra, </em>\u201cincorrectly imported the principles of two distinct common law lines of cases \u2014 breaches of covenants to repair and failure to warn of known latent defects \u2014 both of which require notice to an alleged tortfea-sor \u2014 into the consideration of ... liability for injuries resulting from an alleged tortfeasor\u2019s violation of a statute or ordinance.\u201d (Petitioners\u2019 supplemental brief at 1). The petitioners assert that these common law rules, which require that the landlord have notice or knowledge of a defective condition, only apply in the absence of a controlling statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The petitioners further contend that the Baltimore City Housing Code provides the controlling standards in the instant case and that, under Maryland law, Lewin Realty\u2019s violation of the Housing Code is evidence of negligence. Thus, petitioners reason, under ordinary tort principles, if such negligence proximately causes an injury, it will give rise to a cause of action for damages despite a lack of notice or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>knowledge on the alleged tortfeasor\u2019s part. The petitioners state <em>(id. </em>at 7, 33, 645 A.2d 1147):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201c[I]n order to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case all that a plaintiff must show is the violation of an ordinance, that the violation proximately caused an injury, and that the injured plaintiff was in a class of people intended to be protected by the ordinance. * * * The <em>prima facie </em>case makes out a cause of action for negligence which the plaintiff is entitled to have submitted to a trier of fact for determination as to negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201cIt is for a trier of fact to evaluate whether the steps taken by the landlord to ensure his required compliance with the Code were reasonable under all the circumstances proven in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Moreover, the plaintiffs argue that they should not bear the burden of proving that the alleged tortfeasor was aware that he or she was violating the law, since \u201c[i]t is the proven fact of the existence of the violation alone which is evidence of negligence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 8, 645 A.2d 1147). Thus, the petitioners continue, \u201cproof of notice to the landlord of his violation of law should not be part of the plaintiffs burden of proof....\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>With regard to a landlord\u2019s duty to inspect the premises for a defective lead-paint condition, the petitioners argue that the landlord\u2019s duties under the Housing Code cannot be satisfied without periodic inspections. The petitioners urge that landlords who do not perform periodic inspections should be charged with the knowledge of what a reasonable inspection would have revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The respondent\u2019s arguments focus on the landlord\u2019s alleged lack of control over the premises during the tenancy. Stating that \u201cnotice [is] a precursor to liability, particularly given that a landlord surrenders control when leasing a property\u201d (respondent\u2019s supplemental brief at 18), the respondent asserts that the issues addressing the duty to inspect and burden of proof as to notice both \u201cdepend to a large extent on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>fundamental notion of control\u201d of the premises during a tenancy. <em>Id. </em>at 18, 3). The respondent also argues that, since neither the common law nor any statute or ordinance expressly requires inspections during the tenancy, the Court should not impose such a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">As the parties point out, under the common law and in the absence of a statute, a landlord ordinarily has no duty to keep rental premises in repair, or to inspect the rental premises either at the inception of the lease or during the lease term. There are, however, exceptions to this general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Moreover, where there is an applicable statutory scheme designed to protect a class of persons which includes the plaintiff, another well-settled Maryland common law rule has long been applied by this Court in negligence actions. That rule states that the defendant\u2019s duty ordinarily \u201cis prescribed by the statute\u201d or ordinance and that the violation of the statute or ordinance is itself evidence of negligence. <em>Brown v. Dermer, supra, 357 </em>Md. at 358-359, 744 A.2d at 55. Almost ninety years ago, our predecessors in <em>Flaccomio v. Eysink, </em>129 Md. 367, 380, 100 A. 510, 515 (1916), held that \u201cthe violation of a statue ... is itself sufficient to prove such a breach of duty as will sustain a private action for negligence, ... and that the true rule in such cases is that the violation is presumptive evidence of negligence.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Absolon v. Dollahite, </em>376 Md. 547, 553, 831 A.2d 6, 9 (2003); <em>Bentley v. Carroll, 355 </em>Md. 312, 325-326, 734 A.2d 697, 704-705 (1999); <em>County Commissioners v.

Co., </em>189 Md. 677, 687, 57 A.2d 322, 327 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Under this principle, in order to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case in a negligence action, all that a plaintiff must show is: (a) the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff, and (b) that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of. \u201cProximate cause is established by determining whether the plaintiff is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of a kind which the drafters intended the statute to prevent. * * * It is the existence of this cause and effect relationship that makes the violation of a statute <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence.\u201d <em>Brown v. Dermer, supra, </em>357 Md. at 359, 744 A.2d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Where there is evidence that the violation of the statute proximately caused the plaintiffs injury, evidence of such violation \u201cis sufficient evidence to warrant the court in submitting the case to the jury on the question of the [defendant\u2019s] negligence,\u201d <em>Crunkilton v. Hook, </em>185 Md. 1, 4, 42 A.2d 517, 519 (1945). The trier of fact must then evaluate whether the actions taken by the defendant were reasonable under all the circumstances. <em>See also, e.g., Austin v. Buettner, supra, </em>211 Md. at 70, 124 A.2d at 798 (Evidence that stairs were in violation of the Anne Arundel County building code, coupled with evidence showing that the violation was the proximate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>cause of the plaintiffs injury, was sufficient to support an action for damages); <em>Campbell v. State, supra, </em>203 Md. at 343, 100 A.2d at 801 (Violation of a statute which proximately causes the injury \u201cis legally sufficient evidence to warrant the court in submitting the case to the jury on the question of the [defendant\u2019s] negligence\u201d); <em>Gosnell v. B. &amp; O.R.R. Co., supra, </em>189 Md. at 687, 57 A.2d at 327 (\u201c[I]t is ... well settled that where such a violation [of a statute or ordinance] is the proximate cause of an injury a right of action does accrue to the party injured\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We stress that none of the above-cited cases imposes upon the plaintiff the additional burden of proving that the defendant was aware that he or she was violating the statute or ordinance. Depending upon the statute and the particular sanction involved, knowledge, and the type thereof, may or may not be pertinent in establishing whether or not there was a statutory violation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, once it is established that there was a statutory violation, the tort defendant\u2019s knowledge that he or she violated the statute is not part of the tort plaintiffs burden of proof. It is the violation of the statute or ordinance alone which is evidence of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">This rule has been stated in the context of landlords and tenants in the Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 17.6 (1977), and cited with approval by this Court in lead paint premises liability cases. <em>See Benik v. Hatcher, </em>358 Md. 507, 526-527 n. 11, 750 A.2d 10, 21 n. 11 (2000), and <em>Brown v. Dermer, supra, </em>357 Md. at 361 n. 5, 744 A.2d at 56 n. 5. Section 17.6 of the Restatement (Second) of Property provides (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\u201cA landlord is subject to liability for physical harm caused to the tenant ... by a dangerous condition existing before or arising after the tenant has taken possession, if he has failed to exercise reasonable care to repair the condition and the existence of the condition is in violation of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>(1) an implied warranty of habitability; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">(2) <em>a duty created by statute or administrative regulation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In the instant case, the Housing Code, Baltimore City Code (2000 Repl.Vol.), Art. 13, \u00a7\u00a7 101 <em>et seq., </em>imposes numerous duties and obligations upon landlords who rent residential property to tenants. The plaintiffs are obviously within a class of persons which the Housing Code was designed to protect. <em>Brown v. Dermer, supra, </em>357 Md. at 367, 744 A.2d at 60 (\u201cPatently, by enacting \u00a7\u00a7 702 and 703 of the Housing Code, the City Council sought to protect children from lead paint poisoning by putting landlords on notice of conditions which could enhance the risk of such injuries\u201d). Under the established principles of Maryland tort law set forth in the previously cited cases, if the plaintiffs can establish a violation of the Housing Code which proximately caused Sean\u2019s injuries, then the plaintiffs are entitled to have count one of their complaint submitted to the trier of facts. Under the above-cited cases, the plaintiffs need not prove that Lewin Realty had notice of the Housing Code violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">We turn now to the pertinent provisions of the Housing Code. The Code contains a comprehensive statutory scheme aimed at \u201cestablish[ing] minimum standards governing the condition, use, operation, occupancy, and maintenance of dwellings ... in order to make dwellings safe, sanitary, and fit for human habitation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 103(a)(2). Moreover, \u00a7 103(b) states that \u201c[t]his Code is hereby declared to be remedial ... and it is the intention of the Mayor and City Council that this Code be liberally construed to effectuate [its] purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Generally, the Housing Code requires that a dwelling be kept in \u201cgood repair\u201d and \u201csafe condition.\u201d Section 702 of the Housing Code provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u201c \u00a7 702.

Prohibited occupancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">(a) <em>In general.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">(1) No owner shall lease ... any vacated ... dwelling or dwelling unit which does not comply with the provisions of this Code.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">Additionally, \u00a7 310 places the responsibility of complying with the Code squarely upon the owner or operator of a property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">\u201c \u00a7 310. Responsibility for compliance with Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">(a) <em>Responsibility of owners and operators.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">(1) Any person who is either an owner or operator of a property subject to this Code shall be responsible for compliance with all of the provisions of the Code.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3\">The division of responsibilities between an \u201cowner\u201d or \u201coperator\u201d and an \u201coccupant\u201d is further defined by Chapter 9 of the Housing Code, which prescribes the occupant\u2019s responsibilities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Chief among the occupant\u2019s responsibilities is to keep the dwelling in a \u201cclean and sanitary condition,\u201d \u00a7 902(a), which is generally defined in \u00a7 902(b) as keeping the premises free of dirt and filth.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">The removal of flaking, loose, or peeling paint is mandated in two separate sections of the Housing Code in order for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>dwelling to be deemed in \u201cgood repair\u201d or \u201csafe condition.\u201d First, \u00a7 703 provides, in relevant part as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">\u201c \u00a7 703. Standards for good repair and safe condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">(a) <em>In general.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">Good repair and safe condition shall include but is not limited to the following standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">(b) <em>Interiors.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">(3) All walls, ceilings, woodwork, doors and windows <em>shall be kept dean and free of any flaking, loose, or peeling paint. </em>...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Next, \u00a7 706(b) mandates the removal of loose and peeling paint from interior walls and requires that any new paint applied to the interior surfaces be free of lead (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">\u201c \u00a7 706. Painting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">(b) <em>Interiors.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-13\">(1) All interior <em>loose or peeling </em>wall covering or <em>paint shall be removed </em>and the exposed surface shall be placed in a smooth and sanitary condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-14\">(2) No paint shall be used for interior painting of any dwelling ... unless the paint is free from any lead pigment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">In addition to \u00a7 703(b)(3)\u2019s mandate that all interior surfaces \u201cshall be <em>kept </em>clean and free of any flaking, loose, or peeling paint,\u201d \u00a7 702(a) requires that \u201ca dwelling shall, <em>while in use ..., be kept </em>in good repair, in safe condition, and fit for human habitation.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-16\">Thus, under the plain meaning of the Code\u2019s language, it is clear that the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore mandated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>a <em>continuing </em>duty to keep the dwelling free of flaking, loose, or peeling paint, <em>at all times </em>\u201cwhile [the dwelling is] in use,\u201d in order for the landlord to remain in compliance with the Housing Code. The nature of the landlord\u2019s duty is continuous. The Housing Code does not limit the landlord\u2019s duty to keep the premises free of flaking paint to a one-time duty at the inception of the lease. The landlord must take whatever measures are necessary during the pendency of the lease to ensure the dwelling\u2019s continued compliance with the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">To facilitate such continuous maintenance of the leased premises, \u00a7 909 explicitly grants a right of entry to the landlord to ensure that he or she can \u201cmak[e] such inspection^] and such repairs as are necessary\u201d to comply with the Housing Code. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">\u201c \u00a7 909. Access for repairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">Every occupant of a dwelling ... shall give the owner thereof ... access to any part of such dwelling ... at all reasonable times for the purpose of making such inspection and such repairs or alterations as are necessary to effect compliance with the provisions of this Code.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"au-dedup-0\">Although this section may not explicitly require the landlord to perform periodic inspections, it grants such right to the landlord and shows that the City anticipated that periodic inspections might be necessary to comply with the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The respondent nonetheless urges that \u201c[d]uring a tenancy ... the landlord surrenders control of the property and, in doing so, surrenders the ability, at least in some respects, to prevent a violation of the housing code during the tenancy.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s supplemental brief at 21-22). Lewin Realty\u2019s principal argument is that the landlord has no ability to control the condition of the interior surfaces of the premises during the tenancy. We disagree. Contrary to the respondent\u2019s argument, \u00a7 909 vests the landlord with sufficient control of the leased premises during the tenancy to inspect and to rectify a condition of flaking, loose, or peeling paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Furthermore, contrary to Lewin Realty\u2019s statements in its brief, our holding in the instant case does not impose a strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>liability regime upon landlords. Whether Lewin Realty is held liable for an injury to a child, based on lead paint poisoning, will depend on the jury\u2019s evaluation of the reasonableness of Lewin Realty\u2019s actions under all the circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Lewin Realty also contends that \u201cthe imposition of a duty to inspect during [the] tenancy would create a minefield of difficulties.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s supplemental brief at 15). The respondent\u2019s concerns that a landlord will be required to \u201cinspect[ ] the property every day, three times a week, twice a week, twice a month, once a month ...\u201d are without basis. <em>(Id. </em>at 16, 744 A.2d 47.) The nature of the defective condition in question \u2014 a flaking, loose, or peeling paint condition \u2014 is a slow, prolonged process which is easily detected in the course of reasonable periodic inspections. As the respondent concedes, \u201c[w]e know that paint in a property will chip-it is just a matter of time.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 22, 744 A.2d 47). It does not occur overnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In addition, Lewin Realty raises doubts about the ability to quantify the dangerousness of a lead paint condition: \u201cIs one area in a far corner of a property a \u2018dangerous condition\u2019? * * * Is the presence of lead-based paint in the eighth layer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>of paint, covered by seven non-leaded layers of paint, a hazardous condition when present on a windowsill as opposed to the upper far corner of a wall?\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 26, 744 A.2d 47). In a negligence case, such as the case at bar, the simple answer to these questions is that it will be the duty of the trier of fact to determine whether the steps taken by the landlord to ensure continued compliance with the Code, <em>ie., </em>the frequency and thoroughness of inspections, and the maintenance of the interior surfaces of the dwelling, were reasonable under all the circumstances. The test is what a reasonable and prudent landlord would have done under the same circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Finally, Lewin Realty suggests that a tenant might object to the landlord\u2019s need to inspect the premises. That concern is allayed by the fact that the Housing Code <em>requires </em>the tenant to give the owner access to the premises \u201cat all reasonable times for the purpose of making such inspeetion[s] ... as are necessary to effect compliance with the provisions of this Code.\u201d \u00a7 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We recognize that our holding in the instant case is in conflict with part of this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Richwind v. Brunson, supra, </em>335 Md. 661, 645 A.2d 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The <em>Richwind </em>opinion, 335 Md. at 670-672, 645 A.2d at 1151-1152, recognized that a statutory scheme may impact common law principles governing the relationship between landlord and tenant, that a violation of the Baltimore City Housing Code may constitute evidence of negligence, and that \u201ca private cause of action in a landlord/tenant context can arise from a violation of any statutory duty or implied warranty created by the Baltimore City Code.\u201d The <em>Richwind </em>opinion continued (335 Md. at 672, 645 A.2d at 1152): \u201cIf Richwind violated one of the city code provisions, that violation could provide the basis for a negligence action against it and its agent....\u201d The <em>Richwind </em>opinion further acknowledged that a statute or ordinance could supersede the common law prinei-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>pie \u201c \u2018that a landlord\u2019s liability for negligence depends upon notice of a particular defect and a reasonable opportunity to correct it.\u2019 \u201c 335 Md. at 670, 645 A.2d at 1151. Finally, the <em>Richwind </em>opinion quoted \u00a7\u00a7 702 and 703 of the Baltimore City Housing Code which mandate that a landlord must keep the premises \u201cin safe condition\u201d and must keep them \u201cfree of any flaking, loose or peeling paint,\u201d 335 Md. at 670-671, 645 A.2d at 1151. The opinion then stated (335 Md. at 671, 645 A.2d at 1151):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">\u201cThus, a landlord leasing property in Baltimore City is under a statutory obligation to correct such a hazardous condition even in the absence of a contractual duty to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Nevertheless, the opinion in <em>Richwind </em>took the position that the Baltimore City Housing Code did not modify the common law notice requirement because of \u00a7\u00a7 301(a) and 303 of the Housing Code. Specifically, \u00a7 301(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u201c \u00a7 301. Violation notices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">(a) <em>Commissioner to issue.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">Whenever the Commissioner of Housing and Community Development determines that there has been a violation of any provision of this Code or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant hereto, he shall give notice of such alleged violation to the person or persons responsible therefor as hereinafter provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Section 303 requires the Commissioner to \u201corder the necessary corrections by notice and service.\u201d The opinion reasoned that \u201c[e]ach of these sections therefore provides that the landlord must be served with notice and afforded a reasonable opportunity to correct the defective condition.\u201d 335 Md. at 673, 645 A.2d at 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">The flaw in the <em>Richwind </em>opinion\u2019s analysis is its extension of \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 303\u2019s notice requirements to occupants. The Baltimore City Housing Code does not, in any of its provisions, require the tenant, or, in the Code\u2019s parlance, the occupant, to furnish the landlord with notice of a defective condition on the premises. <em>Richwind </em>relied on the provisions in Chapter 3 of the Housing Code to support the notion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the Housing Code requires the notice to the landlord as a precursor to liability for negligence. These provisions address the typical requirements incumbent upon an administrative agency (here, the Department of Housing and Community Development) before the <em>agency </em>may act upon a violation in an administrative proceeding. They provide for the normal procedural safeguards before the <em>Commissioner </em>may order a property owner to take action to correct a violation or may order that the property be razed. They are requirements of administrative due process in actions by the government against the property owner. They do not relate to the issue of what notice is required before liability may be imposed upon a landlord in a negligence action brought by a <em>tenant </em>for injuries resulting from exposure to lead-based paint in the premises. They are not directed at the landlord-tenant relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Section 301 merely provides that, whenever the Commissioner of Housing and Community Development determines that a violation of the Housing Code has taken place, the Commissioner must give notice of the violation to the owner in a specified form and manner. Section 303 provides that, in non-emergency situations, the Commissioner \u201cshall order the correction by notice and service as provided above [in \u00a7 301].\u201d Section 303 also states that, if the order is not complied with in a timely manner, it may be executed by the Commissioner\u2019s staff, and the expenses incurred by the agency will result in a lien on the property. Nevertheless, \u201cbefore proceeding to execute any such order under the terms of \u00a7 303 of this Code, the Commissioner ... shall serve and post notices\u201d as provided for in the Baltimore City Building Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The Housing Code provisions relied on in the <em>Richwind </em>opinion do not alter the requirements set forth by this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>for a plaintiff to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case based on negligence. The Housing Code does not make the landlord\u2019s notice of a defective condition a factor with regard to the landlord\u2019s duty to the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In sum, the presence of flaking, loose, or peeling paint is a violation of the Housing Code. <em>Brown v. Dermer, supra, </em>357 Md. at 361, 744 A.2d at 56-57 (\u201cTo be a violation, all that must be shown is that there was flaking, loose or peeling paint\u201d). As earlier pointed out, certain provisions of the Housing Code were clearly enacted to prevent lead poisoning in children. Therefore, the plaintiff Sean is in the class of people intended to be protected by the Housing Code, and his injury, lead poisoning, is the kind of injury intended to be prevented by the Code. This is all that the plaintiffs must show to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case sounding in negligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, the notices of violation issued to Lewin Realty by the Department of Housing for unrelated properties were irrelevant and there should be a new trial as directed by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The notice provisions of the Baltimore City Building Code are discussed in this Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Murrell v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>376 Md. 170, 829 A.2d 548 (2003). These provisions generally require the Commissioner to mail notices by certified mail and also post notices conspicuously on the property that is in violation of the Code. <em>See </em>Baltimore City Code, Art. 32, (2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 123.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">. We note that other jurisdictions have charged landlords with notice of the conditions which a reasonable inspection would have revealed.

Wavecrest Management Team, </em>88 N.Y.2d 628, 649 N.Y.S.2d 115, 672 N.E.2d 135 (1996), charged landlords with notice of any hazardous condition in the rental premises in question. The Administrative Code of the City of New York required owners of multiple dwellings to \"remove or cover\u201d paint containing specified levels of lead if the owner has been notified that a child six years of age or younger resides in the dwelling.

The majority explicitly overrules <em>Richwind v. Brunson, </em>335 Md. 661, 645 A.2d 1147 (1994)\u2014a case that, until today, had never had any doubt east upon it by this Court or any other \u2014 and holds that by enacting the Baltimore \u25a0 City Housing Code, the City Council intended to abolish the element of notice in a common law negligence action for injuries resulting from flaking, loose or peeling paint. In the process of overruling <em>Richwind, </em>the majority also reads into the Code an ongoing, affirmative duty by landlords to inspect periodically each of their housing units for loose or flaking paint for as long as they retain ownership of the premises. I disagree with the majority's conclusion that the ordinance does away with the traditional, common law notice requirement to the landlord as a. precursor to liability for negligence. I would not overrule <em>Richwind </em>in this regard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">It is helpful to understand first what the majority\u2019s holding actually means and its implications for landlords and tenants in Baltimore. A violation of Baltimore\u2019s Housing Code occurs when the landlord does not comply with \u00a7 703, which mandates, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ll walls, ceilings, woodwork, doors and windows shall be kept clean and free of any flaking, loose or peeling paint....\u201d Housing Code, Baltimore City Code (2000 Supp.) Art. 13, \u00a7 703(b)(3). The majority asserts that \u201cif the plaintiffs can establish a violation of the Housing Code which proximately caused [their] injuries, then the plaintiffs are entitled to have ... their complaint submitted to the trier of facts.\u201d Maj. op. at 81. Read together, the result of the majority\u2019s holding is astounding: <em>Any </em>flaking, loose or peeling paint in a leased premises, combined with an injury from lead paint, automatically gives rise to a cognizable action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>worthy of a jury trial. The majority admits as much in summarizing its holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">\u201cIn sum, the presence of flaking, loose, or peeling paint is a violation of the Housing Code. As earlier pointed out, certain provisions of the Housing Code were clearly enacted to prevent lead poisoning in children. Therefore, the plaintiff Sean is in the class of people intended to be protected by the Housing Code, and his injury, lead poisoning, is the kind of injury intended to be prevented by the Code. <em>This is all the plaintiffs must show to establish a </em>prima facie <em>case sounding in negligence.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 89. (emphasis added) (citations and footnote omitted). The majority\u2019s new rule means that the landlord will be forced to defend the case in court even if the plaintiff concedes that the landlord behaved reasonably in not knowing about a Code violation. Without any express instruction, the majority reads into the statute the dramatic institution of a wholly new regulatory scheme that essentially imposes strict liability upon landlords and makes landlords the insurers of litigants for injuries sustained by a minor plaintiff due to exposure to lead-based paint. <em>See Richwind, </em>335 Md. at 674-75, 645 A.2d at 1153 (noting that lack of a notice requirement to the landlord could impose a standard amounting to strict liability for any defect arising on the premises during the term of the lease); <em>Benik v. Hatcher, </em>358 Md. 507, 750 A.2d 10 (2000) (reaffirming the <em>Richwind </em>holding that there is no duty to inspect premises during the tenancy). Furthermore, the majority\u2019s new rule means that plaintiff tenants will no longer be required to notify landlords of hazards in their dwelling home, hazards that they, not the landlord, are in the best position to identify.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The common law used to deal with such unfairness by providing that a landlord who had a valid excuse, such as lack of notice, for not remedying the violation would not be held liable, <em>see </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 288A(2)(b) (1965) (excusing liability for violation of a legislative enactment or administrative regulation when defendant neither knows nor should know of the occasion for compliance). But under the majority\u2019s new rule, no such excuse is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">It is axiomatic that statutes are presumed not to make any alterations or innovations in the common law further than is expressly declared, and that when a statute does expressly revise the common law, it should be strictly construed. <em>Zetty v. Piatt, </em>365 Md. 141, 153, 776 A.2d 631, 638 (2001) (noting that absent a clear indication to the contrary, we assume that a statute or ordinance did not intend to amend, nullify, or supersede the common law); <em>see also Bruce v. Dyer, </em>309 Md. 421, 431-32, 524 A.2d 777, 782 (1987); <em>MacBride v. Gulbro, </em>247 Md. 727, 729, 234 A.2d 586, 588 (1967); 2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 50.05 (4th ed.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In this case, we have a well-settled principle in Maryland common law that an element of a <em>prima facie </em>case for negligence for injuries resulting from lead-based paint is that the landlord knew or had reason to know of flaking paint on the premises. Although we articulated this rule in <em>Richwind, </em>its principles and origins had been well-established and thoroughly developed in this State\u2019s common law. <em>See Scott v. Watson, </em>278 Md. 160, 169, 359 A.2d 548, 554 (1976); <em>Ramsey v. D.P.A. Associates, </em>265 Md. 319, 322, 289 A.2d 321, 323 (1972); <em>Katz v. Holsinger, </em>264 Md. 307, 312, 286 A.2d 115, 118 (1972); <em>Pinehurst Co. v. Phelps, </em>163 Md. 68, 73, 160 A. 736, 738 (1932). Moreover, it has been followed since <em>Richwind </em>by this Court without disapproval. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Mid-Atlantic Funding, </em>362 Md. 661, 766 A.2d 617 (2001); <em>Brown v. Dermer, </em>357 Md. 344, 744 A.2d 47 (2000). Thus, when we decided <em>Richwind, </em>we confirmed only what the common law clearly mandated, particularly in light of the City Council\u2019s lack of an express intent to abolish or modify this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Furthermore, although the majority refers to \u00a7 17.6 of the Restatement (Second) of Property in support of its holding, in actuality, when one examines the official commentary to that section, it is obvious that the Restatement affirms the common law requirement of notice, even in view of a statute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>imposes a duty on the landlord to maintain safely the premises. The commentary reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">\u201ca. Rationale. Insofar as a <em>duty created by a statute or administrative regulation </em>is concerned, the rule of this section is based on the assumption that the statute or regulation represents a legislative determination of the standard of conduct required of the landlord, so that the violation constitutes negligence <em>per se. </em>...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\u201cc. Landlord\u2019s knowledge of the condition. The landlord is subject to liability under the rules of this section only for conditions of which he is aware, or of which he could have known in the exercise of reasonable care.... Where the condition arises after the tenant takes possession, the landlord may not be able, in the exercise of reasonable care, to discover the condition, in which case the landlord will not be liable under the rules of this section until he has had a reasonable opportunity to remedy the condition after the tenant notifies him of it. Where the landlord is able to discover the condition by the exercise of reasonable care, he is subject to liability after he has had a reasonable opportunity to discover the condition and to remedy it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord &amp; Tenant \u00a7 17.6 cmt. a-c (1977) (emphasis added). The Restatement here assumes that if the landlord violates a standard which constitutes negligence <em>per se,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>no liability ordinarily attaches for injuries stemming from the violation <em>unless </em>the landlord had actual or constructive notice prior to the violation. Therefore, not only does \u00a7 17.6 not support the majority\u2019s view that notice is not required, but even in light of an applicable statutory provision that creates a duty upon the landlord, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Restatement contemplates retention of the notice element in a <em>prima facie </em>case sounding in negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">There is a plethora of support in the common law of Maryland and other jurisdictions in this country for the proposition that a notice requirement is relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>prima facie </em>case for negligence, applicable to the Housing Code violation unless the City Council had expressly removed notice considerations from the action. <em>See, e.g., Juarez v. Wavecrest Management Team Ltd., </em>88 N.Y.2d 628, 649 N.Y.S.2d 115, 672 N.E.2d 135 (1996) (holding that to be liable for injuries sustained by lead paint, a landlord must have actual or constructive notice of both the hazardous condition and the residency of a child six years-old or younger); <em>Gore v. People\u2019s Sav. Bank, </em>235 Conn. 360, 665 A.2d 1341 (1995) (violation of a state statute prohibiting flaking paint constitutes negligence <em>per se, </em>but defendant may avoid liability by showing that he neither knows nor should know of occasion for compliance); <em>Winston Properties v. Sanders, </em>57 Ohio App.3d 28, 565 N.E.2d 1280 (1989) (assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the landlord was negligent <em>per se </em>under city regulations, tenant was still required to show that the landlord had notice of the defective condition).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">But there is no support, much less express support, for an intent by the Baltimore City Council to remove entirely the notice element from these types of negligence actions. The City Council did not intend, by setting general standards for repairs and safety for all rental units, to nullify years of common law precedent. Quite to the contrary, the City Council <em>followed </em>the common law in passing the Housing Code. <em>See Richwind, </em>335 Md. at 674-675, 645 A.2d at 1153-1154. As the majority notes, \u00a7 301 of the Code mandates that \u201cwhenever the Commissioner of Housing and Community Development determines that a violation of the Housing Code has taken place, the Commissioner must give notice of the violation [to the landlord].\u201d Maj. op. at 87. Emphasizing that the <em>Richwind </em>Court\u2019s reliance on this provision was its key \u201cflaw,\u201d the majority baldly asserts that somehow the requirements of notice for the Commissioner are different and shed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>no light on notice considerations in private actions. <em>Id. </em>at 88. It seems to me that the same fundamental notions of fair play and substantial justice that underlie notice requirements for the Commissioner ought to weigh heavily against an interpretation of the statute that repudiates these wise and longstanding principles in our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">This Court restated the standard for liability recently in <em>Brown v. Dermer, </em>357 Md. 344, 744 A.2d 47. Chief Judge Bell, writing for the Court, stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">\u201c[T]o survive summary judgment, a plaintiff alleging lead paint poisoning caused by a landlord\u2019s negligence in failing to correct a defective condition in a leased dwelling must first meet the \u2018reason to know\u2019 test. Under this test, a plaintiff must present evidence that establishes that the landlord knew or had reason to know of a condition on the premises posing an unreasonable risk of physical harm to persons in the premises. The fact that a defendant is a landlord or engages in a certain trade is not enough to meet the reason to know standard. Some evidence that, by virtue of those facts, the defendant has knowledge sufficient to support an inference of knowledge of the condition is required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">357 Md. at 361-362, 744 A.2d at 57 (citations omitted). We should not overrule this case or the other progeny of <em>Rich-wind.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Realizing that its ruling necessarily entails landlords periodically inspecting the homes of tenants, the majority is forced to read such a duty into the ordinance. The majority reasons that because \u00a7 909 of the Housing Code gives the landlord the <em>right </em>to intrude into the tenant\u2019s property to make repairs, it also imposes upon the landlord an affirmative <em>duty </em>to inspect the premises from time to time. (How often? Every day? Every week? Once a month? Every few months? The majority does not specify this crucial issue.) A duty and a right obviously are not equivalent, and \u00a7 909\u2019s grant of a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>to enter implies nothing about whether the landlord retains that right when the tenant has or has not given notice of a dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Even were I to accept the majority\u2019s imposition of a duty from a patch-work of various provisions pulled together to imply a duty where none exists, the logical implications of the majority\u2019s reading of the statute are untenable. For example, the majority finds that \u201c[although [\u00a7 909] may not explicitly require the landlord to perform periodic inspections, it grants such right to the landlord and shows that the City anticipated that periodic inspections might be necessary to comply with the Code.\u201d Maj. op. at 84. Here, when the majority says \u201cthe Code,\u201d it refers to \u00a7\u00a7 702, 703, and 706 of the Code. But there is no reason why the majority\u2019s reasoning should be limited to those provisions. For example, under the majority\u2019s reasoning, periodic inspections by landlords would also be required for \u00a7 503 (requiring each unit to maintain a toilet in good working order); \u00a7 504 (requiring the same for bathtubs); and \u00a7 612 (requiring heating facilities be properly designed, installed and balanced or adjusted, and maintained in good and safe working condition).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Indeed, even if the majority could limit its holding to \u00a7\u00a7 702, 703, and 706 of the Code (which the majority cannot), the implications of its holding remain illogical. Section 703, in addition to requiring the apartment be free of flaking paint, also mandates: every \u201cfacility, piece of equipment, or utility which is required under this Code shall be ... constructed or installed to function safely and effectively and shall be maintained in good working condition\u201d; all ceilings, walls, and floors must be free from holes, large cracks, or loose and deteriorated materials; and all doors must fit into the openings for which they are hung. Must the landlord now do periodic inspections to check for each and every one of these violations as well? The majority provides no rational basis for distinguishing flaking paint from these other requirements of \u00a7 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The Connecticut Supreme Court, in considering the same issue, found that notice to the landlord was necessary before liability upon the landlord may be imposed. Relying heavily upon our reasoning in <em>Richwind, </em>that court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\u201cWe agree that the language and histories of these sections indicate the legislature\u2019s intent to prohibit the use of lead-based paints and to prevent the existence of chipped or otherwise dilapidated paint for the protection of children, but the plaintiffs have shown us nothing to indicate that the legislature intended the extraordinary result of holding a landlord liable for injuries sustained by a minor due to exposure to lead-based paint regardless of a valid excuse or justification, such as lack of notice, for the violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">\u201cAs in <em>Richwind, </em>the common law in Connecticut has always included a notice requirement as part of a tenant\u2019s cause of action. Furthermore, as in <em>Richwind, </em>the statutory scheme at issue in this case does not eliminate that requirement. Indeed, the statutory framework evinces a legislative intent to afford landlords the opportunity to remedy violations of housing standards after receipt of notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-9\"><em>Gore v. People\u2019s Sav. Bank, </em>665 A.2d. at 1352-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">In sum, I believe that absent notice, actual or constructive, the landlord has no duty, even under the Housing Code, to inspect the demised premises during the tenancy. The tenant is in a superior position to detect chipping or peeling paint and should therefore notify the landlord of the hazard. Nor does the landlord have a duty to continuously inspect premises under the tenant\u2019s control to see if there is chipping or peeling paint; that duty to inspect arises at the inception of the tenancy. This is so under the common law, and under the City Code. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">Judge WILNER has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">. In addition, under principles of <em>stare decisis, </em>the Court should not overrule <em>Richwind.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\">. In Maryland, violation of a statute is not negligence <em>per se </em>but rather constitutes evidence of negligence. The rationale requiring notice where the statutory violation is negligence <em>per se </em>applies with equal force to Maryland where the violation may be evidence of negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
