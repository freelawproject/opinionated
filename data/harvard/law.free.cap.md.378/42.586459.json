Cole\u2019s intended expert witness at trial, James Slunt, a chemist, was not allowed to testify because the trial court determined that Slunt did not have a sufficient factual basis upon which to base his opinion as to the quality controls employed in the Prince George\u2019s County Police Drug Analysis Laboratory or the specific testing of the suspected cocaine evidence in Cole\u2019s case. Cole argues that the improper exclusion of Slunt\u2019s proffered testimony was caused by the State\u2019s improper refusal of his requests during pre-trial discovery to provide certain information and documents regarding the procedures at the laboratory and the trial judge\u2019s denial of his motion to compel the State to provide that information and documents. We conclude that, because Cole was entitled to some of the withheld information and documents, the basis for the trial judge\u2019s exclusion of Slunt\u2019s testimony was erroneous. We conclude also that this error was not harmless. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgments and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">On 13 January 2000, Prince George\u2019s County police officers, pursuant to a search warrant, seized forty-six \u201cbaggies\u201d of suspected crack cocaine, $2,340 in currency, miscellaneous documents, and two handguns from an apartment in Suitland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Maryland. Cole was one of three men found and arrested in the apartment. The Prince George\u2019s County Police Drug Analysis Laboratory (the \u201claboratory\u201d or \u201clab\u201d) subsequently concluded, based on tests it conducted, that the substances within the confiscated \u201cbaggies\u201d contained cocaine. Cole was charged with, among other crimes, possession of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Cole requested from the State, in the course of pre-trial discovery, several documents related to the laboratory\u2019s determination that the substances were cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State rejected his requests. On 1 May 2000, he filed a Motion to Compel Discovery seeking to obtain twenty-six items:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">1.

At the conclusion of the hearing, the court granted the motion with respect to items numbered seven and eight, which it found were related specifically to Cole\u2019s case, but denied the motion with respect to the other twenty-four items, which it found were directed toward the lab\u2019s general procedures, policies, and personnel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">At trial, the court received, as part of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the testimony of Ms. Milagros Mayo, the lab chemist who performed the tests on the seized substances from the \u201cbaggies\u201d in Cole\u2019s case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mayo testified that she first performed three \u201cscreening tests\u201d yielding results consistent with the substances being cocaine. These tests, however, could not identify conclusively the nature of the substances. She then tested the substances with an infrared spectrophotometer, which is capable of conclusively identifying a substance as cocaine. The infrared spectrophotometer produced a graphical representation of an infrared spectrum generated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>tested substances that was substantially similar to the spectrum generated by a \u201clibrary\u201d test result of a sample of pure cocaine previously run. According to Mayo, this was conclusive evidence that the substances tested were cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Mayo testified further that she next ran a test using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GCMS). When asked why she did so even though she already had a conclusive result from the infrared spectrophotometer test, she said \u201cit was really redundant to use the GCMS,\u201d but that she wanted the GCMS test result as \u201cpart of the record.\u201d Like the infrared spectrophotometer, the GCMS, by comparing the sample in question to a known calibration sample, can identify conclusively a substance as cocaine. Mayo testified that the GCMS demonstrated conclusively that the seized substances were cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Just before Cole was to present his defense, the State moved, <em>in limine, </em>to exclude the testimony of James Slunt, an expert chemist who was to testify for the defense. Based on a proffer, the court was informed that Slunt would testify that, having reviewed the limited documents he had been given access to and having heard Mayo\u2019s testimony during the State\u2019s case-in-chief, he could not say that the State had demonstrated that the seized substances had not been contaminated, nor could he conclude, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that the seized substances Mayo tested were cocaine. In particular, Slunt was prepared to testify that he had not learned of sufficient quality control procedures employed by the lab to convince him that Mayo\u2019s \u201cconclusive\u201d test results were accurate. The trial court found that Slunt did not have a sufficient factual predicate to so testify because, by Slunt\u2019s own admission, his knowledge of the laboratory\u2019s quality control procedures was incomplete. Cole\u2019s counsel, pointing out that Slunt\u2019s knowledge was incomplete only because the defense had not been provided with all of the previously requested information regarding the laboratory\u2019s procedures, renewed his discovery motion. The court denied the motion and refused to allow Slunt to testify before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The defense ultimately presented no evidence. Cole was convicted of possession of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He was sentenced to twenty years\u2019 incarceration, with all but fifteen years suspended. On direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments in an unreported opinion by a divided panel. We granted certiorari, <em>Cole v. State, </em>374 Md. 82, 821 A.2d 369 (2003), to address Cole\u2019s arguments that the trial court erred in its handling of the discovery dispute and in excluding Slunt\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The pivotal issue is whether the trial court erred in resolving the discovery dispute as it did. Had the State been compelled to provide certain information about standard operating procedures at the laboratory, Cole argues, Slunt could have expressed a more informed opinion about the lab\u2019s procedures. Instead, Slunt was prevented from testifying because he did not have a sufficient factual basis to give a knowledgeable opinion. Neither the calibration record for the GCMS used to analyze the substances in Cole\u2019s ease nor information regarding Mayo\u2019s proficiency testing was provided to the defense. Cole argues that he was entitled to examine these records in order to determine if he should challenge the accuracy of Mayo\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Although Cole\u2019s brief before this Court included the same broad claims of entitlement to the information requested that he. made in the Circuit Court and in the Court of Special Appeals, Cole\u2019s appellate counsel explained at oral argument before this Court that Cole alleges error now <em>only </em>as to the failure to grant the defense access to \u201cthe standard operating procedures including the quality assurance manual, in general, the calibration record that went to the GCMS, and the proficiency testing record for the chemist, Mayo.\u201d We interpret this narrowed challenge to implicate only parts of eight items requested in Cole\u2019s motion to compel: (1) those six items that would have assisted Slunt in coming to a conclusion regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the accuracy of the lab\u2019s procedures,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (2) information regarding the calibration record for the GCMS employed in this case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (3) records regarding Mayo\u2019s proficiency testing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, our analysis in this case is restricted to the items from the motion to compel so narrowed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Discovery questions generally \u201cinvolve a very broad discretion that is to be exercised by the trial courts. Their determinations will be disturbed on appellate review only if there is an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>North River Ins. Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>343 Md. 34, 47, 680 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>A.2d 480, 486-87 (1996). \u201c[A] trial court\u2019s factual findings are not upset unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>364 Md. 160, 169 n. 9, 771 A.2d 1082, 1087 n. 9 (2001). The application of the Maryland Rules, however, to a particular situation is a question of law, and \u201cwe exercise independent <em>de novo </em>review to determine whether a discovery violation occurred.\u201d 364 Md. at 169, 771 A.2d at 1087. Where a discovery rule has been violated, the remedy is, \u201cin the first instance, within the sound discretion of the trial judge. The exercise of that discretion includes evaluating whether a discovery violation has caused prejudice. Generally, unless we find that the lower court abused its discretion, we will not reverse.\u201d 364 Md. at 178, 771 A.2d at 1093-94. (citations omitted). <em>See also Collins v. State, </em>373 Md. 130, 816 A.2d 919 (2003) (the trial court abused its discretion by failing to remedy a violation of Rule 4r-263(a)(2)(C)); <em>Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 786 A.2d 706 (2001) (Where the defense, citing Rule 4-263(b)(l), had requested information regarding the current location of a child witness, the Court found \u201cample good cause for the [trial] court\u2019s conclusion that the secure and protected environment of this child should not be invaded. There was no abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The resolution of discovery disputes generally is driven by how two inquiries are answered: (1) is the information or documents sought of a kind that is discoverable under the governing law or rules and (2) is the information or documents sought relevant to the subject matter of the case? In the civil context, these two questions are merged into just the second question. According to Md. Rule 2-402(a), \u201c[a] party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, ... if the matter sought is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action.\u201d A party may not object to a discovery request on the ground that \u201cthe information will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 2-402(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>There are no equivalent rules of criminal procedure to Rule 2-402(a). Because no rule provides for the general discovery of all relevant material, the two inquiries remain distinct in the criminal context. In order to show a given document or item of information is discoverable, a defendant must show that the governing law makes that type of document or information available and that the information or document is relevant to the subject matter of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Cole\u2019s primary argument is that he was unconstitutionally denied due process when the State refused to give him the information and documents he requested and the trial court refused to compel discovery of that information and documents and essentially excluded the testimony of his expert \u25a0witness for want of the desired disclosures.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We need not decide the challenge on a constitutional basis because we conclude that the Maryland Rules require the State to provide the defense, upon request, the documents and information sought here, as narrowed by Cole before this Court, so that the defense may endeavor to understand the nature of any scientific testing where the State intends to introduce the results of those tests at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Just as \u201ctrial judges have no power beyond that conferred by Rule 4-261 to order depositions in criminal trials,\u201d <em>Tharp v. State, </em>362 Md. 77, 115, 763 A.2d 151, 171 (2000), trial judges have no power beyond that conferred by Rule 4-263 to order discovery of tangible evidence or documents in the State\u2019s possession. \u201c[E]ven though we have expanded the common law and given trial courts some authority to either require or permit discovery, the right to pre-trial discovery is strictly limited to that which is permitted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>statute or court rule or mandated by constitutional guarantees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and formatting omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Discovery related to scientific tests conducted by prosecution experts is controlled by Rule 4-263(b)(4).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The general objectives of Maryland\u2019s criminal discovery rules are to assist the defendant in preparing his or her defense and to protect the accused from unfair surprise. <em>See Mayson v. State, </em>238 Md. 283, 287, 208 A.2d 599, 602 (1965) (discussing former Maryland Rule 728, a precursor to Rule 4-263). The purpose of Rule 4 \u2014 263(b)(4) is to allow the defense to prepare for expert testimony. Defense counsel cannot prepare to evaluate or challenge a State expert\u2019s qualifications or testimony without an understanding of what tests the expert performed and how the expert performed them.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For this reason, no one disputes that the procedures such an expert actually employs are discoverable. In this case, Cole was allowed to examine the State\u2019s chemist in the course of a pretrial motions hearing so as to determine what tests she performed and how she performed them. The question remaining is what further information Cole was entitled to receive, upon request, under the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The operations of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Drug Analysis Laboratory generally are shielded from outsiders. The lab is inaccessible to anyone who is not a member of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>enforcement, and the lab is not independently certified or audited.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Controlled dangerous substances (CDS) may only be tested by certified chemists and certified analysts. Only members of law enforcement may apply to become certified chemists or certified analysts. COMAR 10.10.09.01(A)(3) and (B)(3). There is no provision in Maryland statutes, regulations, or rules for the independent testing of suspected CDS in criminal cases.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Given that no outsider may observe testing within the laboratory, it is understandable that the defense would seek to obtain the lab\u2019s standard operating procedures in order to evaluate the sufficiency of those procedures and determine if they were followed in the tests actually performed in a given case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We conclude that Rule 4 \u2014 263(b)(4) extends to written standard operating procedures intended to be employed by a State\u2019s drug analysis expert or lab when those procedures are relevant to a given case. Standard operating procedures are an important part of expert testimony because, like habit evidence, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 5-406, they tend to prove that the conduct of the expert on a particular occasion was in conformity with the written standard operating procedures. Should an expert testify that she or he followed the procedures in a given case, then the defense would understand how the tests were performed. If the testimony, however, revealed that the standard operating procedures were not followed, that might be exculpatory evidence which, when brought out in cross-examination, could make a meaningful difference to a fact-finder. <em>See Commonwealth v. Brosnick, </em>530 Pa. 158, 607 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>725 (1992) (evidence discovered after trial that the State apparently had not complied with its own regulations regarding alcohol testing resulted in a new trial).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">Access to laboratory information generally is significant for another reason. The validity of testing procedures and principles is assessed in the scientific community by publishing the data in peer review journals.... [Publication of a laboratory\u2019s work product and data used in [scientific] analysis, as well as independent replication and validation studies, are essential prerequisites to reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\"><em>State v. Schwartz, </em>447 N.W.2d 422, 427-28 (Minn.1989) (a DNA testing lab\u2019s test results were deemed inadmissible because the lab did not comply with appropriate standards and controls or make its testing data and results available). <em>See generally McIlwain v. State, </em>700 So.2d 586, 590 (Miss. 1997) (\u201cA chemical analysis ... is deemed valid only when performed according to approved methods; performed by a person certified to do so; and performed on a machine certified to be accurate.... Where one of the safeguards is deficient the State bears the burden of showing that the deficiency did not affect the accuracy of the result.\u201d); <em>State v. Mehl, </em>602 So.2d 1383, 1387 (Fla.App.1992) (the state followed administrative rules for testing blood alcohol content, and was therefore entitled to a presumption of accuracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\"> Both the infrared spectrophotometer and the GCMS operate by comparing suspected CDS to a known calibration sample. For this reason, calibration records are essentially part of the test results. Although Mayo\u2019s testimony was not received formally as that of an expert in chemistry, she was allowed to give opinion testimony and the record indicates that she was viewed by both the trial judge and the jury as an expert in testing for CDS. Her qualifications, including her record in proficiency tests, also are relevant to the weight the fact-finder might give the test results based on its assessment of her competency. This kind of written information is eligible generally for discovery when it is relevant in a given case.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The trial court found that \u201c[Petitioner] has not met his burden which is to convince me that Items 1-6 and 9-26 [in his motion to compel] are relevant to this case.\u201d At trial, \u201c \u2018[Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401. The word \u201crelevance,\u201d as used in Rule 5-401, includes what previously was meant by the terms \u201crelevance\u201d and \u201cmateriality.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>371 Md. 496, 504 n. 1, 810 A.2d 449, 454 n. 1 (2002). \u201cEvidence that is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d Md. Rule 5-402. This does not mean, however, that information or documents that do not pass the Rule 5-402 test for relevance in and of themselves are not <em>discoverable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The word \u201crelevance\u201d has a different meaning in the discovery context from its meaning in the trial context.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The issue at trial is admissibility of offered evidence, while the issue in pre-trial stages is whether a party may obtain information or documents through discovery. This distinction is made clearest in the civil setting. \u201cA party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, ... if the matter sought is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action.\u201d Rule 2-402(a). A party may not object to a discovery request on the ground that \u201cthe information will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is in stark contrast to the \u201ctwo paramount rules of evidence\u201d that guide a court in determining whether evidence is admissible at trial: \u201c[Ejvidence that is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>relevant to a material issue is inadmissible ... [and] evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>371 Md. at 504, 810 A.2d at 454. Although no rule provides generally for the discovery of all relevant information and documents in the State\u2019s possession or control in criminal cases,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> irrelevant matters clearly are not discoverable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> When relevance is at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>issue in criminal discovery disputes, the standard is the same as for civil actions: ordinarily the information or documents should be deemed relevant if it reasonably is calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and their probative value is not outweighed by any privacy interests, confidentiality, privilege, or other conflicting interest, including the burden of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">To support its rejection of the motion to compel in the present case, the trial court relied on an improper interpretation of <em>Zaal v. State, </em>326 Md. 54, 602 A.2d 1247 (1992). In <em>Zaal </em>we weighed the competing interests of a witness\u2019s privilege and a defendant\u2019s right to obtain and present evidence necessary for his defense. The defendant in <em>Zaal </em>was charged with sexually abusing his granddaughter. He sought access to her confidential school records for the purpose of acquiring impeachment evidence with which to rebut her accusations. The trial court conducted an <em>in camera </em>review of the school records, without counsel present, and \u201cnoted that its review did not reveal \u2018anything that would appear to set forth any kind of evidence that would be directly admissible in this proceeding.\u2019\u201d 326 Md. at 63, 602 A.2d at 1251. We reversed, holding that in such cases \u201ca trial judge, in the exercise of discretion, must conduct a balancing test in which the privacy interest of the student is weighed against the genuine need of the party requesting the information for its disclosure. Disclosure is permitted when the need for it outweighs the privacy interest of the student or his or her parents.\u201d 326 Md. at 72, 602 A.2d at 1256 (citations omitted). Applying the test to the facts in that case, we found that \u201ccontrolled access by counsel to the records\u201d was appropriate. 326 Md. at 88, 602 A.2d at 1264. We further noted that, when a court conducts an <em>in camera </em>review without counsel present, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s review should not only be aimed at discovering evidence directly admissible but also that which is usable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>for impeachment purposes, or that which would lead to such evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">We since have faced similar issues in <em>Robinson v. State, </em>354 Md. 287, 730 A.2d 181 (1999) and <em>Goldsmith v. State, </em>337 Md. 112, 651 A.2d 866 (1995). In <em>Robinson, </em>we held that Rule 4-263 required the disclosure of certain police internal affairs documents to a defendant despite the confidentiality requirements attached to those documents under the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In <em>Goldsmith, </em>we held that the trial court properly had denied the defendant\u2019s request, under Rule 4-264, to depose the victim\u2019s private psychotherapist. In both cases we applied the balancing test laid out in <em>Zaal. See also Thomas v. State, </em>372 Md. 342, 358-59, 812 A.2d 1050, 1060 (2002) (defendant did not proffer how certain psychiatric records relating to an admission that occurred 13 years prior to the incident at issue were relevant, so the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declaring them irrelevant); <em>Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 786 A.2d 706 (2001) (State refusal to disclose the whereabouts of a child-witness who had been the victim of child abuse at the hands of defendants was not a violation of Rule 4-263(b)(l) where the witness unequivocally expressed unwillingness to speak with defense representatives.).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The trial court in the present case believed that <em>Zaal </em>required it \u201cto find a \u2018likelihood that relevant information will be obtained as a result of reviewing the records.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Zaal, </em>326 Md. at 82, 602 A.2d at 1261). This is the product of a faulty recollection. The pertinent full quotation from <em>Zaal </em>is: \u201cTo overcome a privacy interest in those records, some relationship must be shown between the charges, the information sought, and the likelihood that relevant information will be obtained as a result of reviewing the records.\u201d 326 Md. at 81-82, 602 A.2d at 1261. There is no indication of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>conflicting interest in the present case equivalent to the child\u2019s privacy interest in <em>Zaal. </em>We made clear in <em>Zaal </em>that relevant public records should normally be discoverable \u201cwhen privacy interests are not overriding.\u201d 326 Md. at 77, 602 A.2d at 1258-59. <em>See also Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 161, 626 A.2d 946, 958 (1993) (\u201ca party to ongoing litigation may subpoena, without advance notification having to be given to the other party, a third party\u2019s records for use at the trial. When, however, the records sought are \u2018confidential\u2019, before disclosure will be ordered, the moving party must show, usually at a hearing, some connection between the records sought, the issue before the court, and the likelihood that information relevant to the trial would be discovered.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The test for relevance, and the standard we employed in <em>Zaal, </em>is a balancing test where the court weighs the potential probative value of the information or documents sought against the potential burden on the State in production. In performing this balancing test, a court always must keep the applicable standard of proof in mind. Because the State\u2019s burden to prove its case \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is such a demanding standard, even a small piece of evidence may make a difference to a fact-finder in its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The trial court in this case improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defense. Cole alleged, on a good faith basis, <em>see </em>n. 1 <em>supra, </em>that the lab\u2019s procedures were inadequate, and the trial court ultimately ruled that it was not convinced \u201cby even a preponderance of the evidence, i.e. that it is more likely than not, that the defendant\u2019s general allegations are relevant to the case before this [c]ourt.\u201d Regardless of such allegations, the defendant was entitled to challenge the accuracy of any test and to understand exactly how the test was performed. He was not required to demonstrate, before even gaining access to the desired information and documents, that the test results were inaccurate or the procedures faulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The burden on the State in providing the requested information is far outweighed by its potential probative value. There was no argument made by the State in the record of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>present case of privacy interests, confidentiality, privilege, or any of the other conflicting interests addressed in cases like <em>Zaal. </em>The only burden on the State appears to be the burden of physically delivering the documents and information.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> While such a small burden usually will outweigh a defendant\u2019s request for irrelevant information, which by definition has no potential probative value, it is not sufficient to overcome Cole\u2019s interests in learning the procedures employed by the laboratory that analyzed the substances in his case. In any case where the nature of an asserted CDS is in dispute, the State must demonstrate that its chemical analysis was accurate.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Rowell, </em>517 So.2d 799, 802 (La.1988) (\u201cthe state failed to meet its burden of proving that the regulations insured the integrity and reliability of blood alcohol analyses because they did not contain provisions for repair, maintenance, inspection, cleaning, certification and chemical accuracy\u201d). Cole\u2019s right to challenge this analysis outweighs any burden on the State in providing him with its standard operating procedures and manuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The calibration record for the machine the chemist used and the chemist\u2019s own proficiency testing records with regard to the specific testing devices and written procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>are potentially relevant to the case because an improperly calibrated machine or a machine operated by a chemist who was not proficient in its use could lead to an inaccurate result. Cole was not required to demonstrate that the machine was improperly calibrated or that the chemist\u2019s proficiency testing record was less than satisfactory in order to obtain the information by which he might substantiate such allegations. Cole\u2019s general allegations may not have been admissible at trial, but, because a defendant may compel the State to prove its case, he was entitled to obtain portions of the requested items to which he now maintains an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">If Cole had requested originally and solely \u201cthe standard operating procedures including the quality assurance manual, in general, the calibration record that went to the GCMS [actually used in this case], and the proficiency testing record for the chemist, Mayo\u201d during discovery and in his motion to compel, he would have been entitled to that information. Instead, Cole\u2019s motion to compel sought, <em>e.g., \u201cAll materials </em>listing the drug-identification procedures used by the Prince George\u2019s County Drug Laboratory pursuant to COMAR 10.10.03.07\u201d (item 5) (emphasis added), \u201cResults of calibration checks and mass traceability for gravimetric determination\u201d (item 24), and \u201cThe results of any proficiency tests given to <em>each chemist or analyst </em>employed by the Prince George\u2019s County Drug Laboratory\u201d (item 3) (emphasis added). These requests, apparently directed toward every machine in the lab, every test the lab was capable of performing, and every chemist or analyst employed by the lab, clearly were overbroad.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Although the lab\u2019s procedures related to every suspected CDS that it tests are not all relevant in the present case, its standard procedures related to cocaine testing are relevant. Although the calibration records for every machine in the laboratory are not relevant in the present case, the calibration records for the equipment used to test the samples from this case are relevant. Although the proficiency testing records for every chemist or analyst employed by the lab are not relevant here, Mayo\u2019s proficiency testing records as to the equipment and written procedures she used here are relevant.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that Cole was entitled to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>parts of the narrowed eight discovery requests addressed in his brief, as further narrowed at oral argument before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Having concluded that the State\u2019s failure to provide to the defense the information described above was a violation of Rule 4-263 and that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motion to compel only as to two of the listed items when Cole was entitled to parts of eight additional items, we must reverse unless we are able to declare, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict. <em>Williams v. State, </em>364 Md. 160, 179, 771 A.2d 1082, 1093 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Even \"without the additional information we conclude that Cole was entitled to receive in discovery, James Slunt, his expert chemist, was prepared to testify for the defense that he was not convinced to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the seized substances Mayo tested had not been contaminated or that they were in fact cocaine. Had Slunt been given access to the additional information, he may have acquired the requisite factual predicate upon which to base his opinions about the lab\u2019s and/or Mayo\u2019s procedures and thereby been allowed to testify. If the information supplied in response to discovery reasonably would have allowed him to conclude that the testing procedures were insufficiently reliable to assure an accurate result, his testimony may have changed the outcome in the case. Credible identification of the substances as a CDS were at the core of the State\u2019s charges. Cole must receive a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.

The record reflects that, as the result of publicity stemming from the 1999 firing of a civilian chemist from the lab, accusations of \u201cproblems\u201d and \u201cscientific irregularities\u201d at the lab swirled throughout the Prince George\u2019s County Bar, public and private, as well as the local Bench. The accusations also received local media attention. A groundswell in discovery demands made upon the State by defendants in drug cases where the lab had tested the alleged drug evidence was an additional consequence of this speculation. Cole\u2019s case was but one of many where this occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-10\">.

The court also denied Cole\u2019s motion to order an independent audit of the lab and granted the State's request for a protective order to quash a defense-initiated subpoena issued to John Porter, the laboratory\u2019s manager. The trial court's denial of the motion to order the audit and its grant of the protective order are not at issue before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b96-9\">. We note that Ms. Mayo was not received formally as an expert witness, but she was allowed to give opinion testimony. The nature of her testimony would not seem to fall under Md.

This oversight also is not at issue before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b99-6\">. In Petitioner's Brief and at oral argument, Cole conceded that several of the twenty-six requests in his motion to compel in the Circuit Court were overbroad. In his brief, Cole specifically alleged error only as to the following items:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">the instrument conditions for the GC/MS, including all temperature records, any specific columns which were used, and the source, nature, content and testing with regard to any solvent or carrier gas which was used in this case (item 11); record of the operating conditions and criteria for variables in the GC/MS, including tuning criteria, initial calibration and continuing calibration checks (item 22); the Lab\u2019s written protocols, standard operating procedures, methods, and Quality Assurance manual (however named).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">We interpret \"the Lab\u2019s written protocols, standard operating procedures, methods, and Quality Assurance manual,\u201d along with the \"the standard operating procedures including the quality assurance manual, in general\u201d (mentioned at oral argument), to include parts of items numbered five, ten, twelve, and twenty-six from the motion to compel.

Cole\u2019s twenty-fourth numbered request was for \"[r]ecords of calibration checks and mass traceability for gravimetric determinations [.]\u201d This does not appear to have been limited in the trial motion to the machine or those machines actually used to analyze the substances in this case, but rather appears to have been directed generally toward all of the instruments in the laboratory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b99-10\">.

In 1961, the Court of Appeals eliminated this general language by amending Rule 728 to limit the defendant's access to evidence from the State to objects belonging to the defendant or obtained from others by seizure or by process, the defendant\u2019s own statements, and the names of witnesses the State intended to call. The 1961 amendment retained some judicial flexibility by adding \"[njothing in this Rule shall limit the inherent common law power of the court to require or permit discovery.\u201d Former Md. Rule 728 (as amended in 1961). In 1977, the Court adopted former Rule 741, which was substantially similar to current Rule 4-263.
