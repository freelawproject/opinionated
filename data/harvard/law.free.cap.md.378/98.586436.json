Vol.), \u00a7 3-901 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Judicial Proceedings Article, where some of the alleged wrongful acts occurred in Maryland, where other alleged wrongful acts took place in Virginia, and where the death occurred in Virginia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We shall hold that Maryland law determines the threshold matter of whether a particular party may bring the suit. We shall also hold that the Circuit Court erred in ruling that Virginia tort law applied to the alleged wrongful acts of all of the defendants. In addition, we shall conclude that the Circuit Court improperly dismissed the action on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Since the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County granted a motion for summary judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action as to all defendants, we shall set forth the facts of the case in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <em>Rite Aid v. Hagley, </em>374 Md. 665, 684, 824 A.2d 107, 118 (2003) (\u201cfactual disputes, and the inferences reasonably to be drawn from the facts, are resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment and against the moving party\u201d); <em>Messing v.

Jones and Sergeant Alexandre Bailey, of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, driving separate vehicles, followed a vehicle driven by Prince Carmen Jones, Jr. from the District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Columbia into Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, back through the District of Columbia and into Fairfax County, Virginia. Prince Carmen Jones, Jr. was a resident of Maryland and was driving to Virginia in order to visit his fiancee, Candace Jackson, who resided in Virginia. The police officers were each driving unmarked sports utility vehicles. When Prince Carmen Jones, Jr. pulled into a driveway in a street in Fairfax County, Virginia, Corporal Jones pulled up behind him and blocked his exit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Corporal Jones exited his vehicle, exhibited his weapon, but allegedly failed to identify himself as a police officer. Prince Carmen Jones, Jr. attempted to flee the scene, and Corporal Jones fired sixteen shots at him, five of which hit Prince Carmen Jones, Jr. in the back, and one in the arm. Sergeant Bailey was not on the scene at this time. Prince Carmen Jones, Jr. died a short time later in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Following the death of Prince Carmen Jones, Jr. his mother, Mabel S. Jones, was appointed, by the Register of Wills of Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, to be the personal representative of Prince Carmen Jones, Jr.\u2019s intestate estate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time of his death, Prince Carmen Jones, Jr. was unmarried but engaged to be married to Candace Jackson, the mother of Nina Jones. Nina had been born on October 2, 1999, and Prince Carmen Jones, Jr. had openly acknowledged her as his daughter. Candace Jackson consented to Mabel being the personal representative on behalf of her daughter as a beneficiary of the estate of Prince Carmen Jones, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Prince Carmen Jones, Sr., the father of Prince Carmen Jones, Jr., as co-guardian of Nina Jones and in his individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>capacity, and Candace Jackson, as guardian and next Mend of Nina Jones, filed this wrongful death action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against Corporal Carlton Jones, Sergeant Alexandre Bailey, Prince George\u2019s County Chief of Police John S. Farrell, the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, and Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 15-1001(b), the action was also to the use of Mabel S. Jones, the mother of Prince Carmen Jones, Jr. In the complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that Corporal Carlton Jones used excess force and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ay-dedup-0\">\u201cCorporal Jones and Sergeant Bailey were grossly negligent and reckless in multiple ways that led to the death of Prince Jones. This misconduct included: (1) initiating and continuing the surveillance of Prince Jones without any basis to believe that he had committed or was about to commit any crime; (2) Corporal Jones\u2019s initiating an unnecessary and unlawful encounter with Prince Jones in the driveway on Spring Terrace in Fairfax, Virginia, by blocking Mr. Jones\u2019s vehicle with his own vehicle; (3) Corporal Jones\u2019s unlawful display of a handgun coupled with his failure to properly identify himself as a police officer; (4) Corporal Jones\u2019s mishandling of his encounter on Spring Terrace with Prince Jones that foreseeably escalated into a violent altercation; (5) Sergeant Bailey\u2019s failure to properly supervise Corporal Jones during this episode.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The complaint further asserted that Sergeant Bailey, the Prince George\u2019s County Chief of Police, the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, and Prince George\u2019s County were vicariously liable for Corporal Jones\u2019s actions under the doctrine of respondeat superior. In addition, the complaint alleged that these same defendants were directly liable for their own tortious conduct. The plaintiffs contended that Corporal Jones\u2019s use of excessive force was \u201cpart of a pattern of excessive force by Prince George\u2019s police officers\u201d and was \u201cthe result of a municipal policy and custom, implemented and controlled by Chief Farrell, of providing inadequate training and supervision for its officers in how to handle street encounters with civilians without unnecessary use of lethal force.\u201d It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>was alleged that the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department \u201chad a policy of tolerating and even encouraging these episodes of excessive force by failing to investigate and take appropriate disciplinary and restraining actions against the officers involved,\u201d and that the Police Chief \u201cknew ... that county police officers were repeatedly injuring civilians by use of excessive force.\u201d The plaintiffs claimed that Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s failure and/or refusal to provide proper supervision and training to its police officers \u201cled directly to the death of Prince Jones, Jr.\u201d The complaint also alleged violations of Prince Carmen Jones, Jr.\u2019s constitutional rights under Articles 24 and 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">The complaint asserted that some of \u201cthe wrongful conduct causing the death of Prince Jones occurred in Virginia\u201d and was, therefore, governed by \u201cVirginia substantive law.\u201d The complaint also asserted that, \u201cbecause some of the negligent and wrongful conduct described herein occurred in Maryland,\u201d to some \u201cextent ... this action is ... governed by Maryland substantive law.\u201d The plaintiffs sought both compensatory and punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Mabel S. Jones, whom the Prince George\u2019s County Register of Wills had appointed to be personal representative of the estate of Prince Carmen Jones, Jr., filed a motion to intervene which the Circuit Court granted. Mabel Jones then filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 entire action on the ground that Virginia law controlled and that, under Virginia law, she, as the personal representative of Prince Carmen Jones, Jr.\u2019s estate, was the only person authorized to bring a wrongful death action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In her motion for summary judgment, Mabel Jones stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>she had brought a wrongful death action, based on the death of Prince Carmen Jones, Jr., in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants Carlton Jones, Alexandre Bailey, Police Chief John Farrell, the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, and Prince George\u2019s County also sought a dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 action on the ground <em>o\u00ed forum non conveniens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">As earlier indicated, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County granted Mabel Jones\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the entire action. The Circuit Court held that, \u201c[ujnder Maryland law, in a wrongful death action where the wrongful death occurs in another State, \u2018a Maryland Court shall apply the substantive law of that jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d The court went on to hold that the proper party to bring a wrongful death action was a matter of substantive law which was controlled by the law of Virginia, and that, under Virginia law, only Mabel Jones was entitled to bring the action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Circuit Court also agreed with the defendants\u2019 \u201cposition that Virginia is a more convenient forum\u201d because \u201c[t]he shooting occurred in Virginia. Plaintiff Nina Jones and her mother reside in Virginia. Virginia law will govern this case, and witnesses and key evidence are located in Virginia.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, challenging all three rulings by the Circuit Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>oral argument in that intermediate appellate court, we issued a writ of certiorari. <em>Jones v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>369 Md. 570, 801 A.2d 1031 (2002). We shall address all three issues raised by the plaintiffs, although not in the same order.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In a Maryland wrongful death action, based upon a wrongful act occurring outside of Maryland, the Maryland wrongful death statute itself specifies which jurisdiction\u2019s law shall govern. Section 3-903 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Code states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201c \u00a7 3-903. When wrongful act occurs outside of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">\u201c(a) <em>Application of substantive law of another state. </em>\u2014 If the wrongful act occurred in another state, the District of Columbia, or a territory of the United States, a Maryland court shall apply the substantive law of that jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">\u201c(b) <em>Maryland court to apply own mies of pleading and procedure. </em>\u2014 Notwithstanding the fact that the wrongful act occurred in another jurisdiction, a Maryland court in which the action is pending shall apply its own rules of pleading and procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Consequently, the Circuit Court erred in holding that, \u201cwhere the wrongful <em>death </em>occurs in another State, \u2018a Maryland Court shall apply the substantive law of that jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added). Under the plain language of the statute, it is the place of the wrongful <em>act, </em>and not the place of the wrongful <em>death, </em>which determines the substantive tort law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>to be applied in a particular wrongful death action. <em>See Powell v. Erb, </em>349 Md. 791, 801, 709 A.2d 1294, 1300 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">This choice of law principle was illustrated by a case in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, <em>Farwell v. Chong H. Un, M.D., Linwood W. Briggs, M.D., </em>902 F.2d 282 (4th Cir.1990). In <em>Farwell, </em>a resident of Maryland, suffering from a mental disorder or disease, was treated in Maryland by one of the defendant physicians, was treated in Delaware by the other defendant physician, and thereafter committed suicide in Pennsylvania. The decedent\u2019s widow brought a wrongful death action, based on diversity of citizenship, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, against both physicians, alleging that their negligent treatment of the decedent in Maryland and in Delaware proximately caused his death in Pennsylvania. In rejecting an argument that Pennsylvania substantive tort law should apply, the United States Court of Appeals emphasized that \u201cMaryland\u2019s wrongful death statute speaks directly to the choice of law rule to be applied in such cases,\u201d 902 F.2d at 287. The court held that, as to the claim against Dr. Un, the statute directly required \u201capplication of the law of Delaware where occurred the \u2018wrongful act\u2019 charged to him.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court continued <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201c[The statute] does not speak directly to the claim against Dr. Briggs, for the \u201cwrongful act\u2019 charged to him occurred in Maryland and not \u2018in another state.\u2019 But by the strongest implication it points to Maryland as the proper source of law for deciding the Briggs claim. This is because the Maryland statute specifically identifies the locus of the \u2018wrongful act\u2019 rather than the locus of death as the critical choice of law determinant in wrongful death actions with multi-state connections. In this respect, this statute makes specific for wrongful death cases the \u2018place-of-wrong\u2019s-standard of care\u2019 exception to the classic <em>lex loci </em>rule, thereby displacing in this context the \u2018last-act-to-complete-the-tort\u2019 aspect of that rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\"><em>See also Sacra v. Sacra, </em>48 Md.App. 163, 426 A.2d 7, <em>cert. denied, </em>290 Md. 720 (1981) (Wrongful death action based on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>automobile collision in Delaware near the Maryland border, with the vehicle carrying the decedent being propelled into Maryland where it struck a Maryland utility pole, thereby causing the death in Maryland, and the court applied the substantive tort law of Delaware); <em>White v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, </em>109 F.Supp.2d 424, 427 (D.Md.2000) (While the decedent died in Pennsylvania, and while Pennsylvania law would have been applied under the normal <em>lex loci </em>rule, in light of the Maryland wrongful death statute \u201cthis Court concludes that Maryland law applies because most of the wrongful acts charged to defendants occurred in Maryland\u201d). <em>Cf. Philip Morris v. Angeletti, </em>358 Md. 689, 745, 752 A.2d 200, 231 (2000) (The case did not involve a statute specifying the choice of law, and Judge Raker for the Court pointed out that, under Maryland common law choice of law principles, \u201cwhen the events giving rise to a suit occur in a number of states ... [, a]s a general rule, the place of the tort is considered to be the place of injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Accordingly, in a Maryland wrongful death action, where a particular defendant\u2019s alleged wrongful act or acts all occurred in Maryland, the substantive tort law of Maryland applies and not the law of another state where the death occurred. In the case at bar, therefore, the claims directly against the Chief of Police, the Police Department, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, and possibly Sergeant Bailey, based on alleged tortious \u201cmunicipal policy and custom,\u201d negligent training, and negligent supervision, all of which occurred in Maryland, are governed by substantive Maryland tort law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">On the other hand, the claim against Corporal Carlton Jones was based on alleged wrongful acts which, at least for the most part, occurred in Virginia. As the plaintiffs have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>consistently conceded, the wrongful death action against Corporal Jones should be governed by Virginia substantive tort law. <em>White v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, supra, </em>109 F.Supp.2d at 427. Furthermore, the wrongful death claims against the other defendants, to the extent that the plaintiffs seek to hold them vicariously liable, under the doctrine of respondeat superior, for Corporal Jones\u2019s alleged tortious acts, should be governed by the substantive law of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">While the Maryland wrongful death statute mandates the general choice of law principles and specifies who are the beneficiaries of the action,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the present statute is silent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>regard to the person or persons who have standing to bring the action. Nevertheless, both the history of the statute and the general Maryland choice of law principles concerning the right to bring an action disclose that, for the purposes of the wrongful death statute, this is a procedural issue governed by the law of the forum and not a substantive issue governed by the law of another state where the wrongful act may have occurred. Consequently, the Circuit Court erred in dismissing the action on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The Maryland wrongful death statute was enacted by Ch. 299 of the Acts of 1852, and it was based on the Lord Campbell\u2019s Act enacted by the British Parliament in 1846. The original Maryland statute did not deal with the applicable law if the wrongful acts or death occurred outside of Maryland. The statute did, however, expressly provide that the action \u201cshall be brought by and in the name of the State of Maryland, for the use of the person entitled to damages.... \u201d Ch. 299 of the Acts of 1852, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">In <em>Ash, Administratrix v. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, </em>72 Md. 144, 19 A. 643 (1890), the decedent, a citizen of Maryland, died in West Virginia \u201cby means of the negligent and improper structure of one of the bridges on the road of the defendant, in the State of West Virginia.\u201d 72 Md. at 145, 19 A. at 644. The decedent\u2019s administratrix, appointed in Maryland, brought a wrongful death action against the Railroad Company in the Circuit Court for Cecil County. Under the West Virginia wrongful death statute, the personal representative was the proper person to bring the action. This Court, in an opinion by Chief Judge Alvey, held that the action could not be maintained either under the Maryland \u25a0wrongful death statute or under the West Virginia wrongful death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>statute. The Court took the position that it could not (72 Md. at 147, 19 A. at 644)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY_\">\u201cattempt to give extra-territorial force to our statute, and to make it apply to acts and transactions occurring in other States. And if our statute cannot be so extended and applied, there can be no reason why statutes of other States, not similar in provisions to our own, though belonging to the same general class of legislation, should be allowed extraterritorial force and operation, by the courts of this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The Court, after discussing differences between the Maryland and West Virginia statutes, then drew a distinction between common law tort actions and statutory tort actions (72 Md. at 148-149, 19 A. at 645):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">\u201cIn Rorer on Inter-State Law, 144, 145, upon review of the authorities, the author states his conclusions to be, that in all purely personal actions of a transitory nature for torts at common law a citizen of a State may sue a citizen of another State in the courts of such other State, or of any State wherein he may reside, or may be found and served with process, \"without regard to the place or State in which the injury may have been inflicted. But that where certain acts are made wrongs by statute, which were not such theretofore, or where remedies additional to those which existed at common law are provided by statute,'advantage can be taken of these new and additional remedies only within the territory or locality in which the statute has force. These constitute new rights, so to speak, and depend for their enforcement always upon the statutes by which they are created. And such statutes will be enforced only by the courts of the State wherein they are enacted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">This Court adhered to the holding in <em>Ash </em>for the next 46 years. <em>See, e.g., Dronenburg v. Harris, </em>108 Md. 597, 608-612, 71 A. 81, 83-85 (1908); <em>London Guarantee &amp; Accident Company v. Balgowan Steamship Company, </em>161 Md. 145, 147-150, 155 A. 334, 335-336 (1931) (refusing to depart from the <em>Ash </em>holding despite its \u201cinconsistency] with the present trend of the law\u201d); <em>Davis v. Ruzicka, </em>170 Md. 112, 114, 183 A. 569, 570, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>298 U.S. 671, 56 S.Ct. 943, 80 L.Ed. 1394 (1936) (\u201c[T]he courts of this state may not be employed to enforce generally legislation of this character\u201d). <em>See also Olewiler v. Fullerton Supply Company, </em>162 F.Supp. 563 (D.Md.1958), and <em>Kaufmann v. Service Trucking Co., Inc., </em>139 F.Supp. 1 (D.Md.1956), for discussions concerning the history of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The 1936 decision in <em>Davis v. Ruzicka, supra, </em>170 Md. 112, 183 A. 569, apparently prompted legislative action. By Ch. 495 of the Acts of 1937, the General Assembly added a new section to the wrongful death statute which provided as follows (Code (1935), Article 67, \u00a7 1A):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">\u201c1A. In any action instituted in the Courts of this State where it shall appear that the death of a person has been caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of another person, firm or corporation, and such wrongful act, neglect, or default shall have occurred outside of the State of Maryland, whether in another state, the District of Columbia or territory of the United States, the Courts of this State shall apply the law of such other state, District of Columbia or territory of the United States, to the facts of the particular case, as though such foreign law were the law of this State, provided, however, that the rules of pleading and procedure effective in the Court of this State in which the action is pending govern and be so applied as to give effect to the rights and obligations created by and existing under the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the wrongful act, neglect or default occurred; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall apply to causes of action arising prior to June 1, 1937.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">This provision, later re-numbered as \u00a7 2, is essentially the same as the current \u00a7 3-903 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In 1947, the General Assembly for the first time addressed the question of the proper party to bring the wrongful death action where the wrongful act occurred outside of Maryland. Ch. 740 of the Acts of 1947 added new \u00a7 2A to the wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>death statute (then Article 67 of the Code) which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">\u201c2A. In all actions instituted in the courts of this State under Section 2 of this Article[, authorizing action where \u2018the wrongful act ... shall have occurred\u2019 outside of the State of Maryland], the proper person to bring the action shall be determined by applying the following rules:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">\u201c(a) Any person who is entitled to bring suit under the laws of the jurisdiction wherein the wrongful death occurred may bring suit in Maryland, upon proof of his qualifications and authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">\u201c(b) If the laws of the State wherein the wrongful death occurred provide for suit to be brought in the name of the State, District or Territory, as the case may be, then suit may be brought in Maryland in the name of this State on behalf of the beneficiaries protected under the foreign statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">\u201c(c) The provisions of this section shall not in any way be construed to apply to actions in which service of process can be obtained in the jurisdiction where the cause of action arose or where the plaintiff resides.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">This provision was subsequently re-numbered as \u00a7 3. <em>See </em>Code (1951), Article 67, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">As of May 31, 1962, \u00a7 2 of the wrongful death statute authorized an action where a wrongful act outside of Maryland caused a death and the same section specified what law should be applied. Section 3 set forth the \u201crules\u201d as to the persons entitled to bring an action pursuant to \u00a7 2. Section 4, <em>inter alia, </em>provided, when the wrongful act occurred in Maryland, that the action should be brought in the name of the State of Maryland. <em>See </em>Code (1957, 1961 Cum. Supp. Part 2), Article 67, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">The most significant legislative change, with respect to the issue now before this Court, occurred in 1962. Ch. 36 of the Acts of 1962, effective June 1, 1962, was a comprehensive enactment which, according to its title, \u201crelat[ed] generally to the removal of certain <em>procedural matter </em>from the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>law of the State of Maryland\u201d so that the procedural matter would be covered by \u201cthe Maryland Rules of Procedure.\u201d <em>Laws of Maryland 1962 </em>at 91, 99 (emphasis added). Section 1 of Ch. 36 specifically repealed Article 67, \u00a7 3. Section 43 of Ch. 36 repealed and re-enacted, with amendments, Article 67, \u00a7 4, to delete the provision that the wrongful death action \u201cshall be brought by and in the name of the State of Maryland for the use of the person or persons entitled to damages.\u201d <em>Laws of Maryland 1962, supra, </em>at 101, 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Ch. 36 of the Acts of 1962, therefore, represented an unequivocal legislative determination that standing to bring a wrongful death action was a procedural matter. The repeal of Article 67, \u00a7 3, which had set forth the standing rules for an action under Article 67, \u00a7 2, involving an out-of-state wrongful act, demonstrated that standing was viewed as a rule of \u201cprocedure\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2\u2019s choice of law provision. The Legislature did not repeal article 67, \u00a7 3, because it believed that the law of the state where the wrongful act occurred should govern standing. Instead, the Legislature repealed \u00a7 3 because it viewed standing as a procedural matter to be governed by the Maryland Rules of Procedure. No subsequent enactment by the General Assembly has suggested any different legislative intent concerning this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The Maryland Rules of Procedure, prior to January 1,1997, provided in Rules Q40 and Q41 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201cRule Q40. Application of Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201cThe Maryland Rules shall apply to all actions for wrongful death brought under Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3-901 through 3-904 of the Courts Article and under Article 101, Section 58, whether the cause of action arose in this State or elsewhere.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">\u201cRule Q41. Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">\u201ca. <em>Cause of Action in This State.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">\u201cWhere such cause of action arose in this State all persons who are or may be entitled to damages by reason thereof shall be named as plaintiffs whether or not they joined in bringing the action; however, the names of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>who did not join in bringing the action shall be preceded by the words: \u2018to the use of.........</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">\u201cb. <em>Cause of Action in Foreign Jurisdiction.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cWhere such cause of action arose in a foreign jurisdiction, any person who is entitled to bring suit under the laws of such jurisdiction may bring suit in this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Even though the General Assembly had treated standing to bring a wrongful death action as a procedural matter, and even though \u00a7 3-903(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article specified that Maryland rules of procedure would govern procedural matters when the wrongful act occurred in another jurisdiction, Maryland procedural law, namely Rule Q41b, incorporated by reference the standing law of the state where the -wrongful act occurred. Accordingly, if the events in the case at bar had taken place before 1997, the plaintiffs would not have been able to bring the claims based upon Corporal Jones\u2019s wrongful acts in Virginia. This would not have been on the ground that standing was a substantive matter governed by foreign law. It would have been on the ground that Maryland procedural law provided for different plaintiffs for claims based on acts in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">In 1995, however, the Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (hereafter referred to as the \u201cRules Committee\u201d), as part of a comprehensive re-codification of the Maryland Rules of Procedure concerning special proceedings, recommended to the Court of Appeals that Rule Q41a in substance be incorporated into new Rule 15-1001(b) which would provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">\u201c(b) Plaintiff. If the wrongful act occurred in this State, all persons who are or may be entitled by law to damages by reason of the wrongful death shall be named as plaintiffs whether or not they join in the action. The words \u201cto the use of\u2019 shall precede the name of any person named as a plaintiff who does not join in the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-10\"><em>See </em>the <em>132nd Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, </em>22 Maryland Register, Issue 24, P-110 (November 24, 1995). At the same time, the Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Committee recommended that Rule Q41b, concerning standing when the wrongful act occurred outside of this State, be repealed and not be incorporated in a new rule. A \u201cReporter\u2019s Note,\u201d which had been prepared for a subcommittee of the Rules Committee, stated: \u201cSection b of Rule Q41 is not incorporated, because believed substantive in nature.\u201d The Reporter\u2019s Note did not explain why the issue of standing to bring the action was regarded as \u201cprocedural\u201d if the wrongful act occurred in Maryland but \u201csubstantive\u201d if the wrongful act occurred outside of Maryland. The minutes of the Rules Committee\u2019s meeting, at which the full Committee decided to approve of and forward these recommendations to the Court of Appeals, disclose that there was no discussion whatsoever of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The Court of Appeals, at a meeting in 1996, adopted these recommendations by the Rules Committee, with the new special proceeding rules to be effective January 1, 1997. The minutes of the Court of Appeals\u2019 meeting also reveal no discussion whatsoever of the standing issue in wrongful death cases. Despite the view expressed in the Reporter\u2019s Note, the General Assembly has not enacted a statute dealing with standing in wrongful death actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In sum, there are today no Maryland statutory provisions with respect to standing to bring a wrongful death action. This confirms the General Assembly\u2019s 1962 determination that standing to bring a wrongful death action is a procedural matter to be covered by rules and not an issue of substantive law. The Maryland Rules of Procedure adopted by the Court of Appeals, which are constitutionally limited to \u201crules and regulations concerning the practice and procedure in and the administration of the appellate courts and the other courts of this State,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> provide, in Rule 15 \u2014 1001(b), that the statutory beneficiaries are the persons with standing to bring a wrongful death action \u201c[i]f the wrongful act occurred in this State.... \u201d There is no longer a rule specifying standing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>bring a wrongful death action when the wrongful act occurs outside of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">As standing to bring a wrongful death action is a procedural matter within the meaning of \u00a7 3-903 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, it is governed by Maryland law. And because no current Maryland rule or statute covers standing to bring a wrongful death action based on a wrongful act outside of Maryland, the issue would logically seem to be governed by Maryland common law standing principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Under Maryland common law, standing to bring a judicial action generally depends on whether one is \u201caggrieved,\u201d which means whether a plaintiff has \u201can interest \u2018such that he [or she] is personally and specifically affected in a way different from ... the public generally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sugarloaf v. Dept. of Environment, </em>344 Md. 271, 288, 686 A.2d 605, 614 (1996), quoting <em>Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, </em>327 Md. 596, 611 n. 9, 612 A.2d 241, 248-249 n. 9 (1992) (some internal quotation marks omitted). Under this principle, the statutory beneficiaries of a wrongful death action are obviously the persons \u201caggrieved\u201d and the persons whose interest is greater than that of anyone else. Therefore, under the Maryland wrongful death statute and Maryland standing principles, the plaintiffs were entitled to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Our holding that the right to bring a wrongful death action is a \u201crale [ ] of ... procedure\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3-903(b) of the Maryland wrongful death statute, and thus is governed by Maryland law, is consistent with general Maryland choice of law principles. For example, the issue of whether the statute of limitations bars a plaintiffs tort action in a Maryland court is governed by Maryland law and not the law of another state where the tort occurred. <em>Doughty v. Prettyman, </em>219 Md. 83, 88, 148 A.2d 438, 440 (1959). As Professor Leflar has stated, \u201c[a]ccess to forum courts is a matter for forum law to determine.\u201d Leflar, <em>American Conflicts Law, </em>\u00a7 127 at 349 (4th ed.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>In other contexts, even when the right to bring an action in a Maryland court might be deemed a substantive matter, we have on policy grounds applied Maryland law and not the law of another state where the cause of action arose. \u201cWith regard to the threshold matter of whether the court is open to a particular litigant, obviously the policy of the forum state is extremely important.\u201d <em>Hauch v. Connor, </em>295 Md. 120, 133, 453 A.2d 1207, 1214 (1983). In <em>Hauch, </em>the plaintiffs were passengers in an automobile driven by the defendant. The plaintiffs and the defendant were residents of Maryland and co-employees in Maryland of the same corporation, but they were driving in Delaware in the course of their employment. A collision occurred in Delaware, allegedly because of the defendant\u2019s negligence, and the plaintiffs suffered personal injuries. The plaintiffs received workers compensation benefits under Maryland law and then brought a tort suit against the defendant driver in a Maryland court. Under Delaware law, co-employee tort suits are prohibited and workers\u2019 compensation benefits furnish an exclusive remedy, whereas under Maryland law, such co-employee tort actions are permitted. This Court initially held that, under the rule of <em>lex loci delicti, </em>\u201call questions concerning substantive tort law are to be governed by the law of Delaware, as it is the state where the collision occurred.\u201d <em>Hauch, </em>295 Md. at 125, 453 A.2d at 1210. Nevertheless, because of the public policy of Maryland concerning entitlement to sue, coupled with the other Maryland contacts, \u201cMaryland ... law should determine the threshold question of the right to bring suit in Maryland courts.\u201d 295 Md. at 134, 453 A.2d at 1214. We re-affirmed the holding of <em>Hauch </em>in <em>Bishop v. Twiford, </em>317 Md. 170, 176, 562 A.2d 1238, 1241 (1989), pointing out that \u201c[t]he most important factor weighing in favor of applying Maryland law is the public policy of Maryland, the forum state, permitting\u201d the plaintiffs to bring the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">This Court in <em>Powell v. Erb, supra, </em>349 Md. 791, 709 A.2d 1294, applied the <em>Hauch </em>and <em>Bishop </em>principles to a wrongful death action filed in Maryland, even though the alleged negligent acts and the death occurred in Pennsylvania. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Pennsylvania law would not allow the suit, we held that Maryland law controlled and that the plaintiffs were entitled to maintain the action. The Court, in an opinion by Chief Judge Bell, rejected the defendants\u2019 reliance upon the choice of \u201csubstantive law\u201d provision in \u00a7 3-903 of the wrongful death statute, pointing out that the wrongful death statute does not \u201cpurport to deal with what <em>Hauch </em>denominated a threshold issue, \u201cwhether the court is open to a particular litigant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Powell v. Erb, supra, </em>349 Md. at 801, 709 A.2d at 1299-1300, quoting <em>Hauch, </em>295 Md. at 133, 453 A.2d at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Consequently, general Maryland choice of law principles confirm our interpretation of the wrongful death statute, that the right to bring the action is controlled by Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The Circuit Court erred when it alternatively dismissed the case on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>In Maryland, the principle is codified in \u00a7 6-104 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article which states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\u201c \u00a7 6-104. Stay or dismissal of action which should be heard in another forum; consolidation of actions in District Court and circuit court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 If a court finds that in the interest of substantial justice an action should be heard in another forum, the court may stay or dismiss the action in whole or in part on any conditions it considers just.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The plaintiffs\u2019 choice of forum is not to be lightly disturbed. <em>See Leung v. Nunes, </em>354 Md. 217, 224-225, 729 A.2d 956, 959-960 (1999), and cases there cited. <em>See also Urquhart v. Simmons, </em>339 Md. 1, 660 A.2d 412 (1995); <em>Johnson v. Searle, </em>314 Md. 521, 530, 552 A.2d 29, 33 (1989). A court \u201cmust weigh in the balance the convenience of witnesses and those public-interest factors of systemic integrity and fairness that, in addition to private concerns, come under the heading of \u2018the interest of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leung v. Nunes, </em>354 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>at 224, 729 A.2d at 959 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Maryland obviously has strong interests in this action. Denying the plaintiffs access to the courts of this State implicates important public policy considerations. In addition, all of the defendants and the intervenor are Maryland residents, as was the decedent. Perhaps the only witness, the defendant Carlton Jones, is a Maryland resident. The sequence of actions that ended in Virginia began in Maryland. Certain claims are entirely controlled by Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The intervenor-personal representative has not qualified in Virginia and thus, as her counsel acknowledged in oral argument before us, could not prosecute the action in Virginia. Moreover, no action has been filed in Virginia, and the Virginia two-year statute of limitations for wrongful death actions has expired. <em>See </em>\u00a7 8.01-244(b) of the Virginia Code. The defendants\u2019 counsel at oral argument admitted that no action could be filed in Virginia unless the bar of limitations were waived. As this Court held in <em>Johnson v. Searle, supra, </em>314 Md. at 523, 552 A.2d at 30, \u201ca circuit court abuses its discretion by unconditionally dismissing actions on the ground of forum non conveniens when the statute of limitations has likely run in the alternative forum.\u201d This was clearly not an appropriate case for applying the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. APPELLEES TO PAY COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">. This case does not involve a survival action pursuant to \u00a7 6-401(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and Code (1974, 2001 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 7-40 l(y) of the Estates and Trust Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">.

He apparently realized he was being followed and was trying to avoid leading his pursuer to his fiancee\u2019s house.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\">. Subsequently, the Orphans\u2019 Court of Prince George\u2019s County appointed Prince Carmen Jones, Jr.\u2019s father, Prince Carmen Jones, Sr. as co-personal representative. The record in this case indicates that the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s action in this regard was appealed to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, and that the appeal is still pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\">. Actually, under Virginia law, a wrongful death action may be brought in Virginia only by one who has qualified under Virginia law as the personal representative. One who has qualified as a personal representative in another state, but has not qualified under Virginia law, \u201cdoes not have standing to maintain\u201d a wrongful death action under the Virginia Wrongful Death Act. <em>Fowler v. Winchester Medical Center, Inc., </em>266 Va. 131, 133, 580 S.E.2d 816, 817 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">. In response to Mabel Jones\u2019s motion, the plaintiffs asserted that the defendants had moved to dismiss the District of Columbia action for ' lack of jurisdiction and for improper venue. As far as the record in this case shows, that motion is still pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\"><em>. See, </em>however, n. 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\">. The court did not explain what evidence and \u201cwitnesses\u201d were located in Virginia.

As to Sergeant Bailey, the record indicates that he was initially following Prince Carmen Jones, Jr., in a separate vehicle, but presumably along with Corporal Carlton Jones.
