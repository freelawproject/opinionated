Braskey, alleging violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. The Commission charged respondent with violating Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.5 (Fees),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1.7 (Conflict of interest: General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>rule),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.15 (Safekeeping property),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 8.4 (Misconduct),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Maryland Rules 16-604, 16-606, and 16-609 (regarding trust ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>counts),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Maryland Code (1989, 2000 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 10-306 and \u00a7 10-606 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (regarding trust money and trust accounts).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a), we referred the matter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Judge W. Kennedy Boone of the Circuit Court for Washington County to make findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law. Judge Boone held an evidentiary hearing and concluded that respondent had violated Rules 1.5(a), 1.7(b), 1.15(a) and (c), 8.4(c) and (d), Maryland Rules 16-604,16-606, 16-609, and \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Judge Boone made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\n<em>FINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201cRespondent is age 56 and in reasonably good health, except for an asymptomatic congenital pituitary gland condition and stress/depression as a result of the protracted proceedings herein, for which he has been prescribed paxil. However, for the time period 1989-1999, he was in \u2018good health\u2019 and was not hindered or impaired in his practice of law by medical or psychiatric/psychological difficulties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">\u201cRespondent received his undergraduate degree from Frostburg State University and Juris Doctorate from the University of Baltimore, and admitted to practice in Maryland in 1977. During the period concerning the complaint, 1989-1999, Respondent was a sole general practitioner with offices in Grantsville, Frostburg and Cumberland with support staff. His primary practice involved residential/commercial real estate closings with approximately 15%-20% of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>his practice time representing plaintiffs in personal injury matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">\u201cOn or about November 30, 1989 the Respondent was retained by John Dormio (Dormio) to represent him in a personal injury claim as a result of an automobile accident which occurred November 8,1989, Dormio being a long time acquaintance of the Respondent. Respondent agreed to represent Dormio on a contingency legal fee basis, with the written Retainer Agreement providing for Respondent to be paid one-fourth (1/4) of any settlement and one-third (1/3) of the recovery if suit was filed, with Dormio responsible for all incurred costs. Dormio, being seriously injured, incurred over Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) in medical bills which were covered through Medicare, administered by Blue Cross/Blue Shield (BC/BS), which timely notified Respondent of its subrogation lien on any proceeds recovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cRespondent negotiated an automobile liability insurance policy limits settlement in the amount of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00), with the settlement check received on February 11, 1992, which was deposited to an account at First Union National Bank and Trust titled \u2018Braskey Law Office, P.A., Attorney Trust Account, IOLTA Account\u2019 (IOLTA).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">\u201cOn February 11, 1992 the Respondent disbursed Six Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($6,250.00) to himself as a one-fourth (1/4) contingency legal fee, as well as Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750.00) reimbursement for costs incurred during representation. The balance of the settlement proceeds, Eighteen Thousand Dollars ($18,000.00), remained in the IOLTA account, pending resolution of the BC/BS lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201cOn April 16, 1992 Respondent forwarded documentation to BC/BS on behalf of Dormio and made telephone calls to BC/BS on or about July 22, 1992 and November 18, 1994 in an effort to make known he was holding funds subject to their lien, attempting to negotiate a settlement. After November 18, 1994 Respondent made no further attempts to communicate with BC/BS. Respondent was not knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>edgeable or experienced in the practice of negotiating and finalizing an agreement concerning BC/BS subrogation liens, which led to no further activity on this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">\u201cPrior to February 1996 Respondent met with Dormio to discuss options concerning the BC/BS lien. Respondent proposed, and it was alleged to have been agreed, that Dormio and Respondent would equally divide $18,000.00 held in the trust account if there was no further contact by BC/BS. It was also allegedly agreed that Respondent would defend Dormio against any legal action taken by BC/BS and indemnify Dormio against any loss. Respondent also agreed to cease any negotiations with BC/BS, thereby giving up his claim to a 25% lien recovery fee he believed he was entitled to from BC/BS. This verbal agreement was never reduced to writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cIn February or March 1996 Respondent learned Dormio had suffered a stroke, had become incapacitated, was residing in a nursing home and no longer competent to handle his affairs. His nieces, Joanna Rase (Rase) and Gail Richards (Richards) had received legal power of attorney to handle Dormio\u2019s affairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201cOn March 25,1996 Respondent disbursed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) to himself from the $18,000.00 held in his trust account as partial legal fee for Dormio representation, and on April 8, 1996 disbursed an additional Four Thousand Dollars ($4,000.00) to himself as balance of legal fees owed, for a total of Nine Thousand Dollars ($9,000.00).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201cIn May 1996 Respondent contacted Rase and Richards, consulted with them, and offered to split the $18,000.00 that remained from the personal injury settlement. Rase and Richards refused the offer and demanded the entire $18,000.00 be placed in interest-bearing account. Over a year transpired with no further activity, and a second office consultation occurred on June 26, 1997, whereby Respondent advised of the Nine Thousand Dollar ($9,000.00) fee disbursement, and Rase/Richards again requested the funds be placed in an interest-bearing account with the Nine Thousand Dollar ($9,000.00) legal fee disbursed replaced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u201cOn July 10, 1997 the Respondent wrote to Rase and Richards and represented the entire $18,000.00 received from the Dormio settlement was presently in his trust account, but on July 14, 1997 Respondent deposited Nine Thousand Dollars ($9,000.00) from his personal assets to the trust account to make up the deficit. Rase and Richards being dissatisfied, on July 31, 1997, consulted with attorney Howard J. Price, who advised them that he would not have handled the Dormio case in the same manner as Respondent, and further instructed Rase/Riehards of their right to file a complaint with the AGC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">\u201cOn August 15, 1997 Respondent disbursed Eighteen Thousand Dollars ($18,000.00) from his trust account and opened an interest-bearing account titled in Respondent\u2019s name alone; however, on June 11, 1999 Respondent withdrew Nine Thousand Dollars ($9,000.00) from the account for himself. In correspondence with Rase and Richards the Respondent made false and misleading statements concerning status of the disputed funds as evidenced by attachments to the Complaint, Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1. This matter remained unsolved, and on July 28, 1999 Rase and Richards filed a formal complaint with AGC against Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u201cOn September 23, 1999 Respondent opened a new Trust Account whereby he transferred the remaining Nine Thousand Six Hundred Twenty-four Dollars and Twenty-four Cents ($9,624.24) from his personal interest-bearing account, as well as the Nine Thousand Dollars ($9,000.00) of his personal funds, total Eighteen Thousand Six Hundred Twenty-four Dollars and Twenty-four Cents ($18,624.24).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201cOn April 27, 2000, Rase and Richards advised Respondent by letter that Dormio was deceased and an estate had been opened, whereby they were appointed personal representatives. On May 22, 2000 Respondent disbursed the entire account funds and made payable to the Estate of John Dormio in the amount of Fourteen Thousand Three Hundred Twenty-two Dollars and Eighteen Cents ($14,-322.18) sent to attorney Howard J. Price, and paid to himself attorney fees in the amount of Four Thousand Five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Hundred Dollars ($4,500.00). Respondent contends that this was an agreement reached with Price, attorney for Rase and Richards. Subsequently, Rase and Richards on behalf of the Dormio estate accepted and negotiated the check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">\n<em>Time Line of Significant Events as to Proceeds in Dispute:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVl\">11/10/89 Automobile accident wherein Dormio was injured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHa\">11/30/89 Respondent retained by Dormio for representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9T\">02/11/92 $25,000.00 settlement received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJV\">02/13/92 Deposit of gross settlement proceeds: $25,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akn\">IOLTA Account No.64-01040</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8v\">02/13/92 Respondent disburses: -$ 7,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANZ\">From IOLTA Account:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARC\">(1) Fee: $6,250.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeQ\">(2) Costs: 750.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apu\">$7,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3I\">Net proceeds remain in IOLTA Account, pending resolution of BC/BS lien $18,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACN\">03/25/96 Respondent issues check to himself from IOLTA Account. -$ 5,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag0\">Remaining net proceeds $13,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR4\">04/08/96 Respondent issues fee check to himself from IOLTA Account. -$ 4,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aio\">Remaining net proceeds $ 9,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX-\">07/14/97 Respondent deposits to IOLTA Account. + $ 9,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfK\">Total in IOLTA Account $18,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIG\">08/27/97 Respondent withdraws from IOLTA Account and deposits in savings account No. 216-023015 in his name alone $18,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfD\">04/18/99 Accrued interest + $ 519.76</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_I\">Total in savings account $18,519.76</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahc\">06/11/99 Respondent withdraws, payable to self, from Account No. 216-023025: -$ 9,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahn\">Remaining proceeds $ 9,519.76</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>07/28/99 Complaint fled with AGC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">09/23/99 Respondent opens \u2018Trust\u2019 interest-bearing Account No. 216-022841 and deposits:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">(1) Acct.

In addition, he submitted to AGC five (5) pieces of detailed correspondence from August 27, 1999 through May 2, 2000 with documentation to assist the investigation, Petitioner\u2019s Exhibits 3-7. Respondent was forthcoming and admitted the error of his ways, even though at the time he did not believe he was involved in any wrongdoing and there was no intent to mishandle funds in his charge to the detriment of his client(s). After being advised of his alleged ethical violations he accepts ignorance is no defense, is truly remorseful, humiliated, and regrets the incident, especially the contents of correspondence sent to nieces of Dormio who held legal power of attorney and later appointed personal representatives of his estate. Simply put, Respondent is not a thief, is basically a good person and hardworking attorney who cares for his clients; however, he admitted wrongdoings. He exercised severe errors in judgments in handling the Dormio case as to monies in his trust and his dealings with Rase and Richards. There are no prior ethical violations against Respondent with AGC. Since the filing of the Complaint in 1999 to date Respondent has been in \u2018agony' over the matter where he \u2018can\u2019t even go to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>mailbox\u2019 and now has two young partners/associates who have become mentors/overseers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">\u201cWithout assessing blame or finger pointing, this Complaint has taken entirely too long to work its way through the system, at least from filing through Inquiry Panel hearing (July 28, 1999 to April 26, 2002), almost three (3) years with charges finally filed on October 23, 2002. Even though Respondent was not denied due process in these proceedings, the delay has certainly \u2018taken its toll,\u2019 where he has been \u2018twisting in the wind.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">\u201cThis Court has had no prior contact socially or professionally with the Respondent and was not acquainted with him prior to the date of the merits hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">\u201cRespondent violated <em>Rule 1.5(a) </em>in that the Nine Thousand Dollar ($9,000.00) fee taken by him from the Eighteen Thousand Dollar ($18,000.00) net proceeds being held for his client was unreasonable. Said Nine Thousand Dollar ($9,000.00) fee was in addition to the Six Thousand Five Hundred Dollar ($6,500.00) fee taken by Respondent on the gross Twenty-five Thousand Dollar ($25,000.00) settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">\u201cRespondent violated <em>Rule 1.7(b) </em>in that he had a conflict of interest between client, Dormio, and his obligation to BC/BS in accordance with his agreement to protect their subrogation lien interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">\u201cRespondent violated <em>Rule 1.15(a) </em>in that he did not maintain funds retained on behalf of his client and/or third party in a properly designated trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">\u201cRespondent violated <em>Rule 1.15(c) </em>in that he withdrew Nine Thousand Dollars ($9,000.00) from his IOLTA trust account on June 11, 1999, when the interests of the Respondent and his client(s) and the Eighteen Thousand Dollar ($18,000.00) proceeds were in dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-11\">\u201cRespondent violated <em>Maryland Rules 16-604, 16-606, 16-609 </em>and <em>Business Occupations and Professions Article \u00a7 10-306 </em>with respect to the Respondent\u2019s handling of trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>proceeds. <em>Section 10-606 </em>concerning criminal sanctions need not be addressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">\u201cRespondent violated <em>Rule 84(c) </em>in that he engaged in a deliberate course of misrepresentation in correspondence with Complainants which misrepresented the location of the Eighteen Thousand Dollars ($18,000.00) in controversy and applicable statute of limitations with regard to any causes of actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">\u201cRespondent violated <em>Rule 84(d) </em>in that, under the totality of circumstances he attempted to collect an unreasonable attorney fee, which was prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">II. Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">We turn first to respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the proceedings on due process grounds. Respondent maintains that he was denied due process because the disciplinary hearing before the Attorney Grievance Commission was not completed within forty-five days in accordance with the requirements of Attorney Grievance Commission Administrative and Procedural Guideline \u00a7 5-104.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Respondent claims he was prejudiced by the delay in that he suffered anxiety, concern, and emotional stress by living under a cloud of suspicion and hostility.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The complaint that formed the basis of the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s petition was filed on July 28, 1999. On March 4, 2002, when an Inquiry Panel had yet to be convened, respondent filed a motion to dismiss, claiming a violation of his due process rights. Respondent argued that the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s internal procedural guidelines provide that the Inquiry Panel hearing shall take place within forty-five days from the date that the file is received by the panel chairperson. The Inquiry Panel hearing was not held until April 26, 2002, 312 days after the panel chairperson received the file. The Inquiry Panel denied his motion to dismiss. According to respondent, his motion was not given proper consideration by the Inquiry Panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The Review Board denied respondent\u2019s motion to reconsider his dismissal motion and on June 25, 2002, recommended to the Commission that disciplinary charges be filed. The Commission filed its disciplinary petition on October 23,2002, more than three years after the complaint against respondent was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">On December 20, 2002, respondent filed a Motion to Dismiss, a Response to Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, and a Request for a Hearing in the Circuit Court for Washington County. On March 31, 2003, Judge Boone heard arguments regarding the Motion to Dismiss. Finding that the Circuit Court lacked the authority to rule on the motion, Judge Boone denied the motion. We note that Judge Boone was correct in denying respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Harris, </em>310 Md. 197, 200 n. 2, 528 A.2d 895, 896 n. 2 (1987) (holding that the hearing judge, in attorney discipline matters, lacks authority to dismiss the petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is denied. His asserted violations of due process all relate to matters before the Inquiry Panel and Review Board, predating the filing of the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action. Even assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that errors occurred in the preliminary proceedings, dismissal of the charges is not an appropriate remedy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Rule 16-754(b), Answer, explicitly states that \u201c[i]t is not a defense or ground for objection to a petition that procedural defects may have occurred during disciplinary or remedial proceedings prior to the filing of the petition.\u201d In <em>Harris, </em>310 Md. at 202, 528 A.2d at 897, we held that \u201cany irregularity in the proceedings before the Inquiry Panel and the Review Board ordinarily -will not amount to a denial of due process, as long as the lawyer is given notice and an opportunity to defend in a full and fair hearing following the institution of disciplinary proceedings in this Court.\u201d In the instant case, even though the proceedings were delayed, respondent was afforded notice and an opportunity to defend in a full and fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">There is no statute of limitations in an attorney disciplinary proceeding and mere delay does not warrant dismissal. We have often noted that the purpose of attorney discipline proceedings is to protect the public by determining a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law, and that an attorney is entitled only to notice of the charges, and a full and fan-hearing, not anything more. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goldsborough, </em>330 Md. 342, 356-57, 624 A.2d 503, 510 (1993); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kahn, </em>290 Md. 654, 684, 431 A.2d 1336, 1352 (1981); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Engerman, </em>289 Md. 330, 346, 424 A.2d 362, 370 (1981) (citing <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Balt. City v. Posner, </em>275 Md. 250, 255, 339 A.2d 657, 659-60 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">A mere delay in disciplinary proceedings is not a basis for dismissal, absent a showing of prejudice. In <em>Engerman, </em>where Bar Counsel knew all of the essential facts supporting certain allegations contained in the petition but failed to notify the attorney of the allegations until about two and a half years later, we held that the doctrine of laches did not bar the proceedings, especially where the attorney \u201cfailed to show any evidence of prejudice fi-om any delay in commencing disciplinary proceedings.\u201d 289 Md. at 346, 424 A.2d at 370. Even in a case where we found the delay \u201cgross and inexcusable,\u201d we noted that the attorney was not prejudiced by the delay and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>that dismissal \u201cfor the sole reason that the Attorney Grievance Commission failed to proceed with the proper dispatch is manifestly unwarranted.\u201d <em>Kahn, </em>290 Md. at 684, 431 A.2d at 1352. <em>See also Anne Arundel County Bar Ass\u2019n v. Collins, </em>272 Md. 578, 585, 325 A.2d 724, 728-29 (1974) (finding that the attorney had not shown any evidence of prejudice and rejecting the attorney\u2019s exception to the hearing panel\u2019s refusal to dismiss the petition on the ground of laches).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stated that \u201can undue delay in prosecution is not in itself a proper ground for dismissal of charges of attorney misconduct.\u201d <em>In re Williams, </em>513 A.2d 793, 796 (D.C.1986). The court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cAny betrayal of the trust which the attorney is sworn to keep demands appropriate discipline; a delay in prosecution, without more, cannot override this necessity. The contrary conclusion would mean that, when licensing applicants, we would engage in a form of deceit: our endorsement of an unqualified attorney would belie our simultaneous assertion that attorneys possess the integrity and competence which they must constantly demonstrate in order to earn the privilege of practicing law in the District of Columbia. Speedy trial principles, which in criminal cases are a constitutionally required curb on the abuse of government power, in the disciplinary system take second place to other societal interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\"><em>Id. </em>This is a view shared by other courts in addressing delay in attorney disciplinary proceedings. <em>See, e.g., In re Charges of Unprofessional Conduct Against N.P., </em>361 N.W.2d 386, 393 (Minn.1985); <em>Ramirez v. State Bar of California, </em>28 Cal.3d 402, 169 Cal.Rptr. 206, 619 P.2d 399 (1980); <em>In re Bossov, </em>60 Ill.2d 439, 328 N.E.2d 309, 313-14 (1975); <em>State ex rel. Nebraska State Bar Ass\u2019n v. McArthur, </em>212 Neb. 815, 326 N.W.2d 173, 175 (1982); <em>In re Wright, </em>131 Vt. 473, 310 A.2d 1, 9 (1973). <em>See also </em>Annot., Attorneys at Law: Delay in Prosecution of Disciplinary Proceeding as Defense or Mitigating Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>cumstance, 93 A.L.R.3d \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10, at 1057 (1979). The Supreme Court of Oregon noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">\u201cIt ought to be made clear, however, that the primary-purpose of professional disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public. The punishment of an offending member of the profession is indeed a serious matter, but it is incidental to the protection of the public. If the conduct of a member of the Bar disqualifies him from the practice of law, it would not be in the public interest to dismiss the disciplinary proceedings for no reason other than the Bar\u2019s failure to prosecute them with the proper dispatch.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><em>In re Weinstein, </em>254 Or. 392, 459 P.2d 548, 549 (1969), quoted in <em>Engerman, </em>289 Md. at 346, 424 A.2d at 370. This is not to say that delay is irrelevant. If an attorney\u2019s ability to present a defense is substantially impaired, and an attorney can show actual prejudice to the defense, there might be a due process violation. <em>See, e.g., In the Matter of Carson, </em>252 Kan. 399, 845 P.2d 47, 55 (1993) (noting an attorney discipline proceeding may be dismissed because of delay, but only if the delay is prejudicial to the defense and respondent convincingly establishes prejudice); <em>In re Morrell, </em>684 A.2d 361 (D.C.1996) (holding that \u201c[i]f delay in the prosecution of disciplinary charges substantially impaired the attorney\u2019s ability to defend against the charges ... the Constitution might compel a different analysis: \u2018A delay coupled with actual prejudice could result in a due process violation\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>In re Williams, </em>513 A.2d at 797). Respondent has shown no such prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">This Court has original jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary proceedings. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>371 Md. 510, 539, 810 A.2d 457, 474 (2002).

Garfield, </em>369 Md. 85, 97, 797 A.2d 757, 763-64 (2002). The factual findings of the hearing judge will not be disturbed if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>they are based on clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>Md.

Bar Counsel has the burden of establishing the allegations by clear and convincing evidence; respondent has the burden of proving the existence of mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>Md.

On review, we keep in mind that the findings of the trial judge are <em>prima facie </em>correct and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. <em>Garfield, </em>369 Md. at 97, 797 A.2d at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">We turn first to respondent\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Dormio incurred over $30,000.00 in medical bills which were <em>covered </em>through Medicare, administered by Blue Cross/Blue Shield (BC/BS). Respondent argues that \u201c[w]e were not sure how much Blue Cross/Blue Shield (BC/BS) covered.\u201d We sustain respondent\u2019s exception, as there is no evidence in the record that Medicare covered all of Dormio\u2019s medical bills, or that the amount covered was $30,000.00.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Respondent next excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that respondent \u201cmade telephone calls to BC/BS on or about July 22, 1992 and November 18, 1994 in an effort to make known he was holding funds subject to their lien.\u201d Respondent acknowledges that he made no further attempts to communicate with BC/BS after November 18, 1994. He contends, however, that \u201c[t]here were calls as early as Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ary, 1992.\u201d Respondent testified that he thought that he contacted BC/BS on the day that the settlement proceeds arrived in February, 1992. Respondent testified that he made calls in February, 1992 to BC/BS. The hearing judge, in his report, made no note of these calls. We are unable to say why the hearing judge omitted reference to respondent\u2019s testimony regarding the February calls. It may be that the judge did not believe respondent; it may have been an oversight. In any case, even if the judge believed respondent, the hearing judge is not required to recount all of the evidence presented at the hearing. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Granger, </em>374 Md. 438, 453, 823 A.2d 611, 620 (2003) (noting that \u201cit is elementary that the hearing judge \u2018may elect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, this exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that \u201crespondent also agreed to cease any negotiations with BC/ BS, thereby giving up his claim to a twenty-five percent lien recovery fee he believed he was entitled to from BC/BS.\u201d Respondent maintains that he did not agree to cease negotiations with BC/BS. This exception is overruled. The hearing judge was not clearly erroneous in concluding from the evidence presented at the hearing that respondent and the client agreed to cease negotiations and that respondent gave up his claim to any fee he was entitled to receive from BC/BS.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In respondent\u2019s Response to Request for Admission of Facts, read into the record by Bar Counsel at the hearing, he admitted that he and Dormio agreed to split the $18,000.00 should they hear nothing further from BC/BS. In his testimony before the Circuit Court, respondent stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u201cI actually didn\u2019t decide I wasn\u2019t going to contact them. I made a contact then [in November, 1994] and I guess in my own mind, I said, \u2018Hey this is a big insurance company, they ought to get back to me,\u2019 but I didn\u2019t totally actually absolutely rule out contacting them again, but I never did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_u\">Judge Boone\u2019s inferences are properly supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that respondent learned in February or March, 1996, that Dormio had suffered a stroke. Respondent asserts that it was more like late April or early May. The record reflects the following testimony as to when respondent learned that Dormio had a stroke:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">\u201cSo I disbursed two checks to myself. One in March and one in early April simply to just give income for two months for the office. And I had been calling John during this time on the phone. I don\u2019t know if I had the secretaries call him or not, but finally I went down to his house and looked in the house. There were lights on in there, but there didn\u2019t appear to be anybody living there, and the neighbor came out. And the neighbor says or asked me who I was. I identified myself as \u2018Jim Braskey, I represent John Dormio.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Where is John?\u2019 \u2018Oh John has had a stroke. He\u2019s down at the nursing home.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Although respondent\u2019s testimony is less than clear as to when he learned Dormio had a stroke, we will sustain his exception because the record is also unclear as to the basis of the hearing judge\u2019s finding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Dormio\u2019s nieces demanded at the May, 1996 meeting that the entire amount of the trust proceeds, $18,000.00, be placed in an interest-bearing account. Respondent argues that Dor-mio\u2019s nieces did not make that demand until their second meeting in July, 1997. Both nieces testified that, at the May, 1996 meeting, respondent offered to split the money in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>trust account with them but he did not tell them he had already taken half of the money. Johanna Rase, one of the nieces, testified that she specifically requested at the May, 1996 meeting that respondent place the $18,000.00 in an interest-bearing account. Respondent testified, to the contrary, that the nieces made no such request at that time. Lynne Richards, the other niece, testified that she did not recall whether she made any specific request concerning the funds at the May, 1996 meeting. She did state, however, that respondent represented that the $18,000.00 was at his bank and that the money was going to be held until respondent ascertained whether BC/BS would assert its rights to the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">This Court gives due regard to the hearing judge\u2019s opportunity to assess the credibility of the witnesses. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 433-34, 697 A.2d 446, 453 (1997). Judge Boone was not clearly erroneous in believing the testimony of Ms. Rase and rejecting respondent\u2019s version of the meeting. Accordingly, respondent\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that he misrepresented in his correspondence to the nieces on July 10, 1997, that the entire $18,000.00 received from the Dormio settlement was in his trust account at that time. In the letter dated July 10,1997, the first of four letters sent by respondent to Ms. Richards and Ms. Rase, respondent wrote that the $18,000.00 was in his trust account. Respondent admits that half of the money did not go into his trust account until July 14,1997. This exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Finally, respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that respondent made \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d in correspondence with the nieces. Respondent does not deny that the statements he made in the letters were untrue. He argues that he believed the statements regarding the statute of limitations to have been true when written and that those statements were not meant to be false and misleading. As to the statement about the money in the trust account, respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>dent represents to this Court that \u201cSeven years have passed. I\u2019m not certain what happened. Perhaps I was unable to get to the bank as soon as I anticipated when I drafted the correspondence. Perhaps I dated the letter incorrectly.\u201d Respondent\u2019s exception is overruled. His statements in the letters were false and misleading, whether or not he intended to deceive. His state of mind is irrelevant to this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">We turn now to respondent\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s proposed conclusions of law. First, respondent contends that the hearing judge erred in concluding that respondent\u2019s withdrawal of $9,000.00 from his IOLTA trust account on June 11, 1999 was a violation of Rule 1.15(c) because the interests of respondent and his elient(s) and the $18,000.00 proceeds were in dispute at that time. Respondent argues that there was no genuine dispute because he believed that the statute of limitations on the money had run. Respondent\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Culver, </em>371 Md. 265, 808 A.2d 1251 (2002), this Court held that an attorney violated Rule 16-607(b)(2)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> by removing from an escrow account money to which he believed he was entitled. We rejected the attorney\u2019s argument that he had not violated the Rule because he believed, based on his understanding of the fee agreement with his clients, that he was entitled to the funds. We noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u201cThe test, however, is not whether, when examining the circumstances objectively, one would conclude that respondent was legally entitled to the amount claimed; rather the test should be whether there was in fact a fee disagreement between the parties concerning respondent\u2019s entitlement to the amount withdrawn at the time of the withdraw. The rule is unambiguous: an attorney may not withdraw a portion of the deposited funds when the attorney\u2019s right to receive that portion is \u2018disputed\u2019 by the client.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><em>Culver, </em>371 Md. at 275-76, 808 A.2d at 1257 (quoting <em>In re Haar, </em>667 A.2d 1350, 1353 (D.C.1995)). The <em>Haar </em>court further noted that the dispute need not be \u201cgenuine,\u201d \u201cserious,\u201d or \u201cbona fide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the court noted that \u201cthe word \u2018dispute\u2019 means \u2018to argue about; to debate; to question the truth or validity of; [or] to doubt.\u2019 <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>380 (1976).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The test as to whether the Rule is violated is an objective one, <em>ie., </em>whether there was in fact a dispute regarding the funds. An attorney\u2019s subjective belief that he or she is legally entitled to the fee is irrelevant. Nor is it relevant that the attorney is legally entitled to the fee if there is a dispute as to the fee. An erroneous belief that one is entitled to a <em>disputed </em>fee may be a mitigator with respect to an appropriate sanction to be imposed but it is not relevant to the determination as to whether the Rule is violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Respondent and Dormio\u2019s nieces disputed the ownership of the $18,000.00. Respondent\u2019s letter dated June 9, 1999, in which he calls the nieces \u201cnegligent\u201d for not having contacted him or not having filed a lawsuit, is evidence of a dispute as to the entitlement of the money. The nieces\u2019 last communication with respondent was their demand that the money be placed in an interest-bearing account on behalf of their uncle. Respondent\u2019s belief that the statute of limitations barred their claim to the money does nothing to resolve the dispute. Respondent\u2019s withdrawal of $9,000.00 on June 11, 1999 violated Rule 1.15(c). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion of law that he violated Rule 8.4(c). In concluding that respondent violated Rule 8.4(c), the hearing judge found that respondent \u201cengaged in a deliberate course of misrepresentation\u201d in correspondence with Dormio\u2019s nieces by misrepresenting both the location of the $18,000.00 in controversy and the bar of the statute of limitations to the claim. Respondent claims that he did not engage in dishonest, fraudulent, or deceitful misconduct, nor did he intentionally misrepresent anything to anyone. Essentially, respondent argues that his misrepresentations were not deliberate. First, respondent maintains that there is an innocent explanation for the four-day delay between his July 10, 1997 letter, which indicated that the entire $18,000.00 was in his account, and the date that he actually transferred half of that sum to the account. He suggests that he might have dated the letter incorrectly or have been unable to get to the bank as soon as he had anticipated. Second, regarding the statute of limitations, respondent argues that he believed his statements to be true at the time they were written.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The hearing judge found that respondent misrepresented to his client\u2019s nieces that the funds were in a particular account on a specific date and that the statute of limitations later barred their claim. This finding was not clearly erroneous. Whether respondent\u2019s misrepresentations were intentional or fraudulent is not relevant in determining whether the Rule was violated. This exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Respondent excepts to the judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 8.4(d). Respondent\u2019s final exception is also without merit. Respondent argues that because his conduct was not dishonest, fraudulent, deceitful, or an intentional misrepresentation, he could not have violated Rule 8.4(d). The hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that respondent violated Rule 8.4(d), however, was based on respondent\u2019s attempt, under the totality of the circumstances, to collect an unreasonable attorney fee, which was prejudicial to the administration of justice. The hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that respondent violated Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>1.5(a) by attempting to collect an unreasonable fee was supported by clear and convincing evidence, and respondent took no exception to that proposed conclusion of law. The collection of an unreasonable fee is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Thus, respondent\u2019s final exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">We turn now to Bar Counsel\u2019s exceptions. Bar Counsel excepts to two of Judge Boone\u2019s findings. Bar Counsel argues that the hearing judge erred in failing to find a violation of \u00a7 10-606(b) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code. Section 10-606, captioned \u201cPenalties,\u201d provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">\u201cA person who willfully violates any provision of Subtitle 3, Part I of this title, except for the requirement that a lawyer deposit trust moneys in an attorney trust account for charitable purposes under \u00a7 10-303 of this title, is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Md.Code (1989, 2000 RepLVol.) \u00a7 10-606(b) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. Although Judge Boone concluded that respondent misappropriated trust funds in violation of \u00a7 10-306, he concluded that \u201cSection 10-606 concerning criminal sanctions need not be addressed.\u201d Bar Counsel maintains that respondent\u2019s violation of \u00a7 10-306 necessitates a finding that respondent engaged in criminal conduct under \u00a7 10-606(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Bar Counsel\u2019s exception is overruled. Judge Boone was correct in concluding that \u00a7 10-606(b) need not be addressed. That section is a penalty provision, setting forth the applicable criminal penalties relevant to violations related to attorney trust accounts and the unauthorized practice of law. Except for the provision that trust account violations must be <em>willful </em>to constitute a misdemeanor, that section has no bearing on attorney discipline matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Bar Counsel also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s failure to make findings regarding a violation of Rule 8.4(b)\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>engaging in criminal conduct which \u201creflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.\u201d Bar Counsel argues that respondent\u2019s conduct that constituted a violation of \u00a7 10-306 would also violate Rule 8.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">In order for a violation of \u00a7 10-306, \u201cMisuse of trust money,\u201d to constitute criminal conduct, the conduct must have been \u201cwillful.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-606(b). The hearing judge did not find that respondent willfully misused trust money. Bar Counsel has not proven by clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated Rule 8.4(b) by engaging in criminal conduct. Rather, Judge Boone noted that respondent \u201cexercised severe errors in judgment\u201d in handling the trust proceeds. This finding does not rise to the level of criminal conduct adversely reflecting on respondent\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness to practice law. Accordingly, Bar Counsel\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We turn now to the appropriate sanction to be imposed. Bar Counsel recommends disbarment. Respondent suggests that the appropriate sanction is a private reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The purpose of sanctioning an attorney is to protect the public rather than to punish the errant attorney. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 474, 800 A.2d 782, 789 (2002). The severity of the sanction depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case, including consideration of any mitigating factors or aggravating factors. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Angst, </em>369 Md. 404, 416-18, 800 A.2d 747, 755 (2002). On occasion, in considering the appropriate sanction to be imposed, we have referred to the <em>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (ABA Standards </em>). <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Santos, </em>370 Md. 77, 88, 803 A.2d 505, 511 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 28, 741 A.2d 1143, 1158 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 484, 671 A.2d 463, 480 (1996). The <em>ABA Standards </em>contemplate four factors to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>be considered in imposing a sanction: (1) the nature of the ethical duty or duties violated; (2) the attorney\u2019s mental state; (3) the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the attorney\u2019s misconduct; and (4) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors. See Standard 3.0 of the <em>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, reprinted in ABA Compendium of Professional Responsibility Rules and Standards, </em>344 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">We first address the duties violated by respondent. Respondent collected an unreasonable attorney fee, failed to keep client funds in a separate and properly labeled account, ignored a conflict of interest between his obligations to his client and the insurance company, and made misrepresentations to the personal representatives of his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Regarding respondent\u2019s mental state, the hearing judge specifically found that respondent \u201cis not a thief.\u201d Implicit in this finding is a determination that respondent\u2019s misappropriation of funds was not done with the intent to defraud. The hearing judge also noted that respondent was \u201cnot knowledgeable or experienced in the practice of negotiating and finalizing an agreement concerning BC/BS subrogation liens,\u201d evidencing the judge\u2019s view of respondent as inexperienced but not dishonest in his failure to maintain funds in a properly designated trust account. At the same time, however, the hearing judge found that respondent \u201cengaged in a deliberate course of misrepresentation\u201d in his correspondence with Dor-mio\u2019s nieces. Thus, not all of respondent\u2019s actions were completely innocent or unintentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">As to the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by respondent\u2019s misconduct, the hearing judge concluded that the $9,000.00 that respondent disbursed to himself on more than one occasion<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was an unreasonable fee. As a consequence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>that unreasonable fee arrangement, respondent disputed the ownership of the funds for several years. Ultimately, respondent placed the settlement proceeds in a proper, interest-bearing account and, after deducting $4,500.00 for services allegedly rendered to BC/BS,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> sent a check for the remainder to Dormio\u2019s nieces. Arguably, the nieces would have received the entire $18,000.00, and received it much sooner, had respondent not insisted upon his entitlement to an unreasonable fee and not agreed to protect the insurance company\u2019s subrogation lien interest, which conflicted with the interests of his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">We must also consider the potential injury caused by respondent\u2019s conduct, as respondent\u2019s failure to abide by Rule 1.15 regarding trust accounts may have adverse effects on the public\u2019s confidence in the legal system as well as the confidence and security of the client\u2019s personal representatives in this case. As we stated in <em>Sheridan, </em>357 Md. at 31, 741 A.2d at 1159, \u201c[w]e cannot understate the importance of holding funds in escrow in accordance with Rule 1.15 and how the Rule reinforces the public\u2019s confidence in our legal system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We take note of several mitigating factors. First, respondent has practiced law since 1977 and has no prior discipline history. The hearing judge found that respondent was inexperienced in the practice of negotiating and finalizing an agreement concerning BC/BS subrogation liens, which explains his cessation of attempts to contact BC/BS. The hearing judge noted that respondent was \u201ctruly remorseful.\u201d Respondent also promptly responded to and cooperated fully \"with the Attorney Grievance Commission. Respondent\u2019s misconduct involved matters pertaining to only one client (and the client\u2019s personal representatives). Most importantly, in mitigation, the hearing judge found that respondent \u201cis not a thief, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>basically a good person and hardworking attorney who cares for his clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">With all of these factors in mind, we also consider our prior cases. We have held that disbarment is the appropriate sanction for \u201cintentional dishonest conduct\u201d and that in cases involving \u201cintentional dishonesty, fraud, misappropriation and the like, we will not accept as compelling extenuating circumstances \u2018anything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Powell, </em>369 Md. at 475, 800 A.2d at 789-90 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 413-14, 773 A.2d 463, 485 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In considering the appropriate sanction to be imposed, however, we have distinguished cases of intentional misappropriation from cases of mishandling of funds where the attorney acted with a less culpable mental state, and imposed a lesser sanction than disbarment in the latter cases. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hayes, </em>367 Md. 504, 789 A.2d 119 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jeter, </em>365 Md. 279, 778 A.2d 390 (2001); <em>Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 741 A.2d 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In <em>Sheridan, </em>the hearing judge found that, among other violations, the attorney misappropriated client funds in violation of Rule 1.15(a); failed to notify his client upon the receipt of funds and failed to provide a requested accounting in violation of Rule 1.15(b); and failed to keep disputed funds separate in violation of Rule 1.15(c). 357 Md. at 28-29, 741 A.2d at 1158. The hearing judge found, however, that the attorney\u2019s actions were not intentionally fraudulent. 357 Md. at 12, 741 A.2d at 1149. This Court accepted the hearing judge\u2019s finding that the lawyer\u2019s action was not intentionally fraudulent and ordered an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in one year. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 741 A.2d at 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">In <em>Hayes, </em>the attorney commingled client funds with his own funds in his attorney trust account and used that account as an operating and personal account. 367 Md. at 509, 789 A.2d at 122. On four occasions, the attorney also drew checks payable to cash on the account. <em>Id. </em>The hearing judge found, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>in mitigation, that the attorney\u2019s misconduct occurred while the attorney was attempting to assist his client, without compensation, in a matter unrelated to the matter in which he represented the client. <em>Id. </em>at 509-10, 789 A.2d at 122-23. The judge further found that the attorney attempted to locate the client, of whom he had lost track, so that funds belonging to the client could be returned. <em>Id. </em>at 510, 789 A.2d at 123. Noting that these findings were \u201cinconsistent with and, thus tend[ ] to negate, any dishonest or fraudulent intent,\u201d the Court held that \u201cthe automatic disbarment rule for misappropriation does not apply, that this is not the kind of willful conduct to which the rule was directed or intended to reach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519, 789 A.2d at 128-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Similarly, in <em>Jeter, </em>we recognized the importance of an attorney\u2019s intent in mishandling client funds in violation of Rule 1.15. In <em>Jeter, </em>the attorney placed settlement proceeds and personal injury protection benefits in his personal bank account rather than an escrow account. 365 Md. at 284, 778 A.2d at 393. He also failed to forward payment to the proper payee until six months after depositing a settlement check. <em>Id. </em>The hearing judge found that the attorney\u2019s inexperience in handling personal injury cases mitigated his violation. <em>Id. </em>at 286, 778 A.2d at 394. The judge also found that the attorney was remorseful and never intended to defraud his client or the proper payee of the funds at issue. <em>Id. </em>We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">\u201cClearly, one who acts with deliberation and calculation, fully cognizant of the situation and, therefore, fully intending the result that is achieved is more culpable than one who, though doing the same act, does so unintentionally, negligently or without full appreciation of the consequences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 289, 778 A.2d at 395. Recognizing that the attorney was \u201centitled to the benefit of ... [the hearing judge\u2019s] findings,\u201d we imposed an indefinite suspension with a right to reapply after six months. <em>Id. </em>at 293-94, 778 A.2d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>If respondent\u2019s conduct were limited to his failure to maintain settlement proceeds in a properly designated trust account, which the hearing judge found did not implicate any dishonesty, our analysis of respondent\u2019s conduct for purposes of a sanction would be relatively straightforward. <em>Sheridan, Hayes, </em>and <em>Jeter </em>suggest that disbarment might be an inappropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misappropriation of funds because the hearing judge found that respondent was not a \u201cthief.\u201d In <em>Sheridan, </em>in accepting the hearing judge\u2019s characterization of the attorney\u2019s conduct, we deferred to that finding because the record reflected a basis for the hearing judge to so conclude. <em>See Sheridan, </em>357 Md. at 29, 741 A.2d at 1158 (noting that the Court was \u201cconstrained to accept ... [the hearing judge\u2019s] assessment, particularly given the judge\u2019s superior ability to evaluate demeanor-based credibility\u201d). In the instant case, however, we can find no reasonable basis in the record for the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that respondent was not acting dishonestly. Respondent did not put client money into his trust account; he engaged in a deliberate course of misrepresentation in his letters to Dormio\u2019s nieces; he took $9,000.00, which he was not entitled to take, and called it a fee; and he misstated the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Respondent misrepresented the state of his trust account. On July 10,1997, respondent wrote a letter to Dormio\u2019s nieces in which he stated that the entire $18,000.00 was in his trust account. This statement was false. All of the funds were <em>not </em>in the account until four days later when respondent transferred half of the money. Respondent\u2019s explanation for the delay is not enlightening. He states that because of the passage of time, he cannot recall why the money was not in the account when he wrote the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Respondent also misstated the statute of limitations. In a letter written to Dormio\u2019s nieces on June 9, 1999, respondent represented that the insurance company\u2019s legal rights had not been extinguished. Respondent testified, however, that he believed his agreement with BC/BS to protect their subrogation interest was subject to a three-year statute of limitations, with the statutory period commencing in February, 1992. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Respondent stated falsely in the same letter to Dormio\u2019s nieces that the statute of limitations barred any claim they might have had to the settlement proceeds, even though the statute of limitations was inapplicable. Respondent had a fiduciary obligation to his client to keep that money in trust for the client\u2019s benefit. Respondent testified that he regretted writing the June 9, 1999 letter and that it was written \u201cout of anger, frustration because this thing has gone on long enough and let\u2019s get it resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Respondent\u2019s mishandling of his client\u2019s funds was particularly egregious. Respondent\u2019s act of disbursing $9,000.00 to himself after having taken one-fourth of the gross settlement proceeds of $25,000.00 went beyond collecting an unreasonable fee. Even if Dormio agreed to split evenly the $18,000.00 with respondent, the agreement was unenforceable and amounts to \u201cfee gouging.\u201d Respondent had no legitimate basis for keeping any part of the funds subject to the BC/BS lien. If BC/BS did not assert its subrogation lien, the money belonged to the client, to whom respondent was obliged to disburse the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">This Court disbarred an attorney for conduct involving exaction of an unreasonable fee from a client. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Kerpelman, </em>323 Md. 136, 145, 591 A.2d 516, 521 (1991), the attorney and client agreed that the client would pay $2,500.00 for legal services up to and including the first day of trial and $1,250.00 for each additional day of trial. The attorney estimated that the trial would last three days and agreed to return any unused portion of the fee, but he did not put the fee agreement in writing. <em>Id. </em>Before trial, and after the client had paid $5,000.00, the attorney acted abusively toward his client, who then terminated the relationship. <em>Id. </em>Although no written agreement existed, the attorney later sent his client a letter claiming that he (the attorney) had \u201cre-examined\u201d the retainer agreement and that it called for an \u201cunrefundable retainer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 591 A.2d at 521. The attorney sent his client another letter in which he misrepresented and inflated the services he had rendered. <em>Id. </em>at 146, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>591 A.2d at 521-22. In addition to his misconduct regarding the fee, the attorney ignored a clear order from a circuit court judge to refrain from making certain remarks to a jury and acted in a \u201cdisruptive and disrespectful manner\u201d during a trial in that judge\u2019s courtroom. <em>Id. </em>at 142-43, 591 A.2d at 519-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We concluded that the attorney violated Rules 1.4(a), 1.5(a), 1.16(a) and (d), 3.5(a)(8), 8.1(a) and (b), 8.2(a), and 8.4(a), (b), (c), and (d). In determining the appropriate sanction, we noted that the attorney had been suspended on two previous occasions for \u201cfee gouging and contumacious conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 591 A.2d at 523-24. In disbarring the attorney, we declared that \u201c[b]y his contumacious conduct as an officer of the court and his exaction of an unreasonable fee from a client, he has again revealed his unworthiness to hold himself out to the public as a practitioner of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 591 A.2d at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Respondent\u2019s exaction of an unreasonable fee from his client combined with the trust account violations and misrepresentations lead us to conclude that disbarment is the appropriate sanction. In the instant case, respondent engaged in a \u201cdeliberate course of misrepresentation.\u201d In addition, respondent collected an unreasonable fee \u2014 conduct which we have held to be grounds for disbarment when accompanied by other misconduct. <em>See Kerpelman, </em>323 Md. 136, 591 A.2d 516. Further, respondent, by agreeing to protect the subrogation lien interest of BC/BS in exchange for a $4,500.00 fee, had a conflict of interest between his duties to his client and a self-serving and self-imposed duty to a third party. Compounding the seriousness of these violations, respondent failed to maintain funds in a properly designated trust account \u2014 conduct which jeopardizes \u201cthe public\u2019s confidence in our legal system.\u201d Respondent\u2019s conduct is the \u201ctype of conduct against which the public is entitled to protection, conduct which brings the legal profession into disrepute.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kerpelman, </em>288 Md. 341, 382, 420 A.2d 940, 959 (1980). For all of these reasons, we order that respondent is disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST JAMES F.
