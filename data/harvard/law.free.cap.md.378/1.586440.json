We agree with the Circuit Court for Wicomico County and the Court of Special Appeals that facts placed before the trial court were sufficient to support those convictions and, therefore, shall affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">On the afternoon of 8 June 2001, Polk, accompanied by her nine-year-old daughter, went to the Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury, Maryland. Polk previously worked as a secretary in the Hospital\u2019s Heart Center, but her employment had been terminated recently. She returned on this occasion to pick up her final pay check.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">Polk first visited the Human Resources Department for her pay check, but was directed to go to the Heart Center. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>she reached the Heart Center, she was told by her former supervisor, Shannon Brady, that her check was not at the Center and that she should return to Human Resources. Soon after Polk, muttering insults under her breath, left for Human Resources, Brady located the pay check. To avoid further interaction with Polk, Brady contacted Hospital security to have the check delivered to her at Human Resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Corporal Raymond Sperl, a special police officer stationed at the Hospital for security, responded to Brady\u2019s request. He carried the check to Human Resources and there encountered Polk. When Polk asked him about the pay check, Corporal Sperl replied that he \u201cha[d] to take it to personnel.\u201d Polk responded, \u201c[F]uck you, asshole.\u201d As the officer continued toward Human Resources with the check, Polk began \u201cscreaming,\u201d \u201c[G]ive me my check.\u201d A Human Resources employee indicated to Corporal Sperl that he could give Polk the check. Polk snatched it from him, adding another, \u201c[F]uek you, asshole.\u201d Corporal Sperl described the exchange that followed as Polk walked down a hallway toward a Hospital exit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">I said just keep your mouth quiet and leave. Again, [she responded] fuck you, asshole. I said I feel sorry for your child, she had a child with her. After I said I feel sorry for your child, she said fuck you, asshole. I said keep your mouth quiet and leave or I\u2019m going to lock you up for disorderly conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The officer also commanded Polk to \u201ckeep [her] mouth shut, stop [her] cursing, [and] just leave the property.\u201d Polk called Corporal Sperl an \u201cold white baldheaded cop wannabe.\u201d In the course of their exchange, the Corporal stressed several times that \u201cshe\u2019d be locked up [for disorderly conduct] if she didn\u2019t stop her profanity.\u201d When two women at the end of the hallway \u201cheard the commotion,\u201d they walked away down another hallway. When Polk reached the Hospital exit, she turned toward, the officer and shouted, \u201c[F]uck you, asshole,\u201d once again as she passed through the doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Now outside, Polk\u2019s continuing tirade at Corporal Sperl \u201cstartled\u201d a group of ten or fifteen Hospital employees standing nearby. Corporal Sperl escorted Polk toward the Hospital parking garage. Polk was \u201cvery irate\u201d and \u201cwas letting [Corporal] Sperl know how irate she was\u201d by \u201cyell[ing] at him and cursfing] at him.\u201d At one point, Polk abruptly stopped walking, causing the officer to step on the back of one of her \u201cflip-flop\u201d sandals and almost lose his balance. When the \u201cvulgarity ... intensified,\u201d the Corporal announced that Polk was under arrest and attempted to apprehend her. He grabbed her shoulder, but she pulled away and bit his arm, breaking the skin on his wrist. During the scuffle, other security officers arrived and eventually subdued and arrested Polk.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Polk was charged with engaging in disorderly conduct in violation of Maryland Code, Article 27 \u00a7 121(b)(3) (1957, 1996 RepLVol., 2001 Supp.), resisting arrest, and second-degree assault in violation of Maryland Code, Article 27 \u00a7 12A (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County on 28 November 2001. After the State presented its case-in-chief, Polk moved for a judgment of acquittal as to all of the charges, arguing that Corporal Sperl\u2019s initial orders to \u201cstop cursing\u201d were unlawfully directed at the content of her speech and that a \u201cdomino effect\u201d made her subsequent arrest illegal. She maintained that, by using profanity toward the officer, she was engaging in protected speech. According to Polk, because she had not disobeyed a lawful police order and the officer had no reason to arrest her, she rightfully resisted the attempts to arrest her.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The Circuit Court denied Polk\u2019s motion for acquittal. The judge concluded that Corporal Speri\u2019s orders to \u201cquiet down\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>constituted lawful orders to prevent a disturbance to the public peace. The orders, in his view, were directed at the volume of Polk\u2019s speech rather than its content. In this regard, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">\u201c[Tjhere is the testimony of Corporal Sperl that Ms. Polk was irate, was using profane language, and I think it\u2019s reasonable to infer from his testimony that she was doing so loudly because he told her on several occasions that she had to be quiet and he told her that if she wasn\u2019t quiet that he would place her under arrest for disorderly conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">\u201cThere is testimony from Corporal Sperl that two other people who were in the hallway at the time changed their direction to walk away from where he and Ms. Polk were located, and it may be that they just don\u2019t like hearing someone say fuck you, asshole, but it could have also been because of the fact they didn\u2019t like the volume of the language, as well as the content.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">\u201cAnd because of that possibility, in looking at it in the light most favorable to the State, I think I have to assume at this point that they walked away for reasons other than merely the content of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">\u201cThere is also testimony from Corporal Sperl and from other people who [observed the incident outside the hospital\u2019s exit doors] that Ms. Polk was out of control at the point when she exited the building, was speaking in a manner which I think could be considered loud, Sperl said that it caught everyone\u2019s attention in [that area] when they left.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq\">From these findings, the judge concluded that a reasonable fact-finder could find that Polk failed to comply with the officer\u2019s orders to reduce the volume of her voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The jury found Polk guilty of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, but acquitted her of the assault charge. The trial judge merged the two convictions and sentenced Polk to 18 months incarceration, suspending all but 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Polk appealed. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments in an unreported opinion. Before that court, Polk again argued that the officer\u2019s orders were directed unconsti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tutionally at the content of her speech. The intermediate appellate court noted that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \u201crender[s] unlawful any order to refrain from profanity.\u201d Nonetheless, from the testimony that Polk was \u201cirate,\u201d \u201cyell[ing],\u201d and \u201claps[ed] into ... tirades of vulgarity,\u201d the court determined that she was \u201cshouting when she cursed at [Corporal] Sperl.\u201d It determined, further, that the officer\u2019s orders to \u201ckeep [her] mouth quiet\u201d sought to control the volume, rather than the content, of Polk\u2019s speech. Based on these determinations, the court concluded that a rational trier of fact could have found that \u201c[Corporal] Sperl lawfully ordered [Polk] to quiet down, and that [she] ignored the order.\u201d Because Polk\u2019s challenge to the conviction for resisting arrest also was based on the illegality of the officer\u2019s orders the court held that, \u201cthat challenge must fail as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">We granted Polk\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, <em>Polk v. State, </em>372 Md. 429, 813 A.2d 257 (2002), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">1. Does an officer\u2019s order to \u201cstop cursing\u201d and \u201cstop [your] profanity\u201d constitute a \u201clawful order\u201d to the extent that an individual\u2019s refusal to comply would be a violation of Maryland Code, Article 27 \u00a7 121(b)(3)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">2. If such an order is not \u201clawful\u201d for purposes of Article 27 \u00a7 121(b)(3), was the evidence sufficient to sustain the appellant\u2019s conviction for disorderly conduct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">For the reasons explained below, we conclude that, Petitioner\u2019s framing of her issues notwithstanding, Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders directed toward the volume of Polk\u2019s voice were reasonable and lawful orders and the evidence indicating she failed to obey those orders was sufficient to support her convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">In <em>Moye v. State, </em>we recently reiterated the standard of review for evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a criminal conviction as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. We view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution. We give \u201cdue regard to the [fact finder\u2019s] finding of facts, its resolution of conflicting evidence, and, significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d Although our analysis does not involve a re-weighing of the evidence, we must determine whether the jury\u2019s verdict was supported by either direct or circumstantial evidence^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">369 Md. 2, 12, 796 A.2d 821, 827 (2002) (Citations omitted). If the facts as found by the trier of fact are not clearly erroneous, our review of the application of the law to those facts, such as where impingement on an individual\u2019s constitutional rights may be in question, is <em>de novo. See Glover v. State, </em>368 Md. 211, 220, 792 A.2d 1160, 1165 (2002) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>the lower court\u2019s judgment on a motion to dismiss for violation of the constitutional right to a speedy trial); <em>see also Cartnail v. State, </em>359 Md. 272, 282, 753 A.2d 519, 525 (2000) (stating that with regard to a Fourth Amendment question, \u201cthis Court makes an independent determination of whether the State has violated an individual\u2019s constitutional rights by applying the law to the facts\u201d). When we perform an independent constitutional review, \u201c[w]e do not engage in <em>de novo </em>fact-finding.\u201d <em>Cartnail, </em>359 Md. at 282, 753 A.2d at 525. Instead, we defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous. <em>Glover, </em>386 Md. at 221, 792 A.2d at 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution applies to state and local governments through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 445, 569 A.2d 604, 609 (1990), citing <em>Gitlow v. New York, </em>268 U.S. 652, 45 S.Ct. 625, 69 L.Ed. 1138 (1925).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Though the U.S. Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>protects individuals from state regulation of speech, it is undisputed that \u201cthe First and Fourteenth Amendments have never been thought to give absolute protection to every individual to speak whenever or wherever he [or she] pleases, or to use any form of address in any circumstances that he [or she] chooses.\u201d <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 446, 569 A.2d at 608-609 (quoting <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 19, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 1785, 29 L.Ed.2d 284, 290 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In arguing for reversal, Polk relies heavily on <em>Diehl v. State, </em>294 Md. 466, 451 A.2d 115 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1098, 103 S.Ct. 1798, 76 L.Ed.2d 363(1983). In <em>Diehl, </em>the defendant, an automobile passenger, was convicted for disorderly conduct under a former version of \u00a7 121 after the driver was pulled over in a grocery store parking lot for a traffic violation. <em>Diehl, </em>294 Md. at 467-69, 451 A.2d at 116-117. The statute prohibited \u201cwilfully disturbing] any neighborhood in [any Maryland] city, town or county by loud and unseemly noises, or [] profanely curs[ing] or swear[ing] or us[ing] obscene language upon or near to any [] street or highway within the hearing of persons passing by or along such highway.... \u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 121 (1957, 1976 RepLVol.). Diehl refused to obey a police officer\u2019s order that he return to the car and stated: \u201cFuck you, [officer];\u201d \u201cI know my rights;\u201d and \u201cyou can\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468, 451 A.2d at 116. In response, the officer arrested Diehl for \u201cscreaming obscenities and ... drawing a crowd\u201d while protesting the officer\u2019s order. <em>Id. </em>at 468, 451 A.2d at 117. We reversed Diehl\u2019s conviction for disorderly conduct because Diehl never acted unlawfully. We concluded that \u201cwhere, as here, a person is acting in a lawful manner (a passenger getting out of a stopped car) and is the object of an unlawful police order [to return to the car], it is not usually a criminal violation for such person to verbally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>protest a police officer\u2019s insistence upon submission to such an order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 451 A.2d at 122. Because Diehl was protesting an unlawful order, any disturbance created by Diehl\u2019s protests did not constitute disorderly conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 478, 451 A.2d at 122.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"><em>Diehl </em>subsequently was qualified by our holding in <em>Eanes v. State, </em>where we affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction for disorderly conduct under \u00a7 121(b)(5)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for shouting loudly in front of an abortion clinic in a residential neighborhood. <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. 436, 468, 569 A.2d 604, 620 (1990). In <em>Eanes, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u201c[As Justice Harlan, writing for the Supreme Court in Cohen, explained:][T]his Court has recognized that government may properly act in many situations to prohibit intrusion into the privacy of the home of unwelcome views and ideas which cannot be totally banned from the public dialogue .... The ability of government, consonant with the Constitution, to shut off discourse solely to protect others from hearing it is, in other words, dependent upon a showing that substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\u201cMoreover, a captive audience that is entitled to protection may exist outside the home. Because riders on public rapid transit vehicles are captive audiences, a municipality may decline to accept political advertising on these vehicles. <em>Lehman [v. City of Shaker Heights, </em>418 U.S. 298, 304, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 2718, 41 L.Ed.2d 770, 778 (1974)]. <em>See also Grayned v. Rockford, 408 </em>U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972) (ordinance prohibiting disturbance of school).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cThe principle is grounded on the concept of privacy. \u201cThe Supreme Court permits the state to protect listeners who are \u2018captive\u2019 to unwanted speech \u2014 when speech invades their privacy interest in an essentially intolerable manner.\u201d Note, <em>Too Close For Comfort: Protesting Outside Medical Faculties, </em>101 Harv.L.Rev. 1856, 1863 (1988) [footnote omitted]. Although that protection is most often extended to those \"within their homes, <em>it may be extended to any situation in which \u201cprivacy interests [are] substantially threatenedbecause \u201cindividuals cannot escape \u2018bombardment of [their] sensibilities.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 1864 </em>(quoting <em>Erznoznik [v.

The unwilling listener is not like the passer-by who may be offered a pamphlet in the street but cannot be made to take it. The eases support the view that content-neutral regulations controlling its loudness are permissible. It may be otherwise outside the home or office, where the audience is ordinarily not captive. But \u00a7 121 prohibits only that volume level of communication that unreasonably disturbs individuals whose rights to be free from aural abuse override the right of a speaker to address them by direct or incidental oral communication. This is the type of balance of conflicting interests contemplated by first amendment jurisprudence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\"><em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 451-53, 569 A.2d at 611-12 (some citations omitted) (some emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In <em>Eanes, </em>we set forth the factors to be weighed in determining whether a regulation of speech is constitutional. Those factors include: (1) whether the regulation is content-based or content-neutral; (2) the circumstances surrounding the time and place where the speech occurred, as well as the overhearing parties\u2019 location; and (3) whether there are less disruptive alternatives available to the speaker.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 447, 454-56, 569 A.2d at 609, 613. Under <em>Eanes, </em>an order, such as Corporal Sperl\u2019s to \u201ckeep your mouth quiet,\u201d may be legitimate even if it results in a restriction on otherwise protected speech, if the three-pronged test is satisfied. <em>See, e.g., Briggs v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 60, 71, 73, 599 A.2d 1221, 1226, 1227 (1992) (upholding the defendant\u2019s arrest for disorderly conduct because of his loud and disruptive behavior, despite the fact that his speech was protected under the First Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>jWanes </em>is clearly controlling here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Diehl </em>is not applicable to, and is in fact distinguishable from, the facts of the case <em>sub judice. </em>The Court in <em>Danes </em>explained that the <em>Diehl </em>holding \u201cis only applicable when the prohibition against \u2018loud and unseemly noise\u2019 seeks to regulate the <em>content </em>of speech.\u201d <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 444, 569 A.2d at 608 (emphasis added). The trial court in the present case applied the analysis approved in <em>Danes </em>and found that (1) Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders, in the main, were content-neutral, (2) there was a sufficiently compelling state interest in protecting the rights of patients, visitors, and staff to be free from disturbances in a hospital setting, and (3) there were alternative means of expression available to Ms. Polk. Because there is sufficient evidence in the record of the present case supporting the trial court\u2019s findings that Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders, in the main, were content-neutral, the trial court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous and <em>Diehl </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Significantly, and unlike the present case, the arresting officer in <em>Diehl </em>testified that he arrested Diehl because of the <em>content </em>of his language. <em>Diehl, </em>294 Md. at 478, 451 A.2d at 122. Corporal Sperl, on the other hand, did not testify that he arrested Polk based on the content of her language. Instead, he stated that he told Polk \u201cjust shut your mouth and leave or you\u2019re going to be locked up for disorderly conduct.\u201d This testimony supports the rational inference drawn by the trial court that the order was a lawful attempt to prevent Polk\u2019s violation of \u00a7 121 due to her loud and disruptive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The first factor of the <em>Danes </em>test, whether the order was content-based or volume-based, must be considered in light of the appropriate standard of review. As noted, <em>supra, </em>we must conduct a <em>de novo </em>review regarding any constitutional implications, but that analysis is informed by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact. Thus, the issue before us is not whether Corporal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Sperl\u2019s orders were more likely content-based than content-neutral, but whether the trial court\u2019s factual determination was clearly erroneous that his orders, in the main, were directed at the volume of Polk\u2019s speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that there was sufficient evidence in the record for a rational trier of fact to determine that Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders were directed at the volume of Polk\u2019s speech. The Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ar-dedup-0\">From the testimony of Sperl and Donohoe [a maintenance mechanic at Peninsula Regional Medical Center], the trier of fact could have inferred that appellant was shouting when she cursed at Sperl. Appellant\u2019s own testimony provided direct evidence that appellant w\u00e1s \u2018yelling\u2019 at Sperl. Appellant does not dispute that, if she was making enough noise to disturb other persons in the hospital, Sperl could have lawfully ordered her to be quiet. Indeed, \u00a7 121(b)(5)(ii) of Article 27 specifically states that \u201c[a] person from \u00e1ny location may not by unreasonably loud noise willfully disturb the peace of another ... [i]n a place of business.... \u201d From Sperl\u2019s testimony, the trier of fact could have determined that Sperl ordered Appellant to quiet down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The record contains ample testimony before the trial court supporting its finding that Corporal Sperl issued orders aimed, in the main, at the volume of Ms. Polk\u2019s speech. Corporal Sperl testified that, when Polk first cursed at him outside the Human Resources Department, he told her to \u201ckeep [her] mouth quiet and leave.\u201d In addition, he warned her \u201cfour or five times\u201d thereafter to \u201ckeep [her] mouth quiet\u201d as her tirade continued. Several witnesses confirmed his testimony regarding both Polk\u2019s conduct and his response. Polk was described as \u201cscreaming\u201d to the employees of the Human Resources Division, \u201ctell him to give me my check, tell him to give me my check.\u201d Brandon Donohoe, who witnessed the incident from an outdoors smoking area, described Polk as \u201cvery irate\u201d and testified that she continually \u201clapse[d] into ... tirade[s] of vulgarity.\u201d Polk herself admitted that, as she and Corporal Sperl walked out the doors of the Hospital, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201cwas so happy to be outside [she] did just, you know, yell at him and curse him.\u201d She further acknowledged that it was not until after she began yelling that the Corporal placed her under arrest. Charles Landherr, supervisor for facilities management at the hospital, testified that \u201c[Corporal Sperl] was a little winded, but he was very calm. I thought he handled himself very professionally. He didn\u2019t use any foul language, and he was just trying to get Rhonda [Polk] to cooperate, which she obviously did not. She was totally out of control when I went out there.\u201d The Human Resources manager at the hospital, Craig Koppenhaver, a witness to some of Polk\u2019s outbursts, testified that \u201cI heard Officer Sperl at one point say something to the effect, you\u2019re going to have to calm down, otherwise I\u2019m going to have to place you under arrest.\u201d Each of these statements may be understood to mean that Corporal Sperl was attempting to do his duty to \u201cmaintain peace and order in the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The trial judge noted that the evidence would support a rational inference that Ms. Polk\u2019s unreasonable volume and disorderliness prompted her arrest, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">[t]here is testimony from Corporal Sperl that two other people who were in the hallway at the time changed their direction to walk away from where he and Ms. Polk were located, and it may be that they just don\u2019t like hearing someone say fuck you, asshole, but it could have also been because of the fact they didn\u2019t like the volume of the language, as well as the content ... And because of that possibility, in looking at it in a light most favorable to the State, I think I have to assume at this point that they walked away for reasons other than merely the content of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The dissent attempts to rewrite this Court\u2019s First Amendment jurisprudence announced in <em>jWanes. </em>The dissenting opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">\u201cAn examination of the entire record reveals that Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders unlawfully attempted to regulate Polk\u2019s protected speech. First and foremost, the officer told Polk to \u201cstop her profanity\u201d and \u201cstop her cursing.\u201d These com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>mands unquestionably were aimed at controlling the words Polk used and not the volume of her voice. Although the record indicates that Polk also was instructed to \u201ckeep your mouth shut\u201d and \u201ckeep you mouth quiet,\u201d these phrases were always used in conjunction with the references to the content of Polk\u2019s speech. Where an officer issues orders that attempt to restrict protected speech, those orders are \u201ccontent-based\u201d and must be narrowly drawn to achieve a compelling state interest. <em>See Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 447, 569 A.2d at 609 (quoting <em>Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn., </em>460 U.S. at 45, 103 S.Ct. at 955, 74 L.Ed.2d at 804 (1983)). This is so even if the \u201ccontent-based\u201d orders are combined, as they were here, with other commands that, by themselves, might not raise constitutional concerns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">(Dissent at 34).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Such a broad claim is insupportable under <em>Eanes, </em>a case which repeatedly emphasized that \u201c[e]ven protected speech is not equally permissible in all places and at all times.\u201d <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 446, 569 A.2d at 609 (citation omitted). Each case the dissent uses to support its sweeping statement involves a facial constitutional challenge to a statute and therefore is inapposite to the case at hand. Polk does not challenge \u00a7 121 as unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u201c[I]t is the statute, and not the accusation or the evidence under it, which prescribes the limits of permissible conduct and warns against transgression.\u201d <em>Thornhill v. Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 98, 60 S.Ct. 736, 742, 84 L.Ed. 1093, 1100 (1940). <em>See also Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., </em>467 U.S. 947, 104 S.Ct. 2839, 81 L.Ed.2d 786 (1984) (statute properly subject to facial attack); <em>Termiello v. Chicago, </em>337 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949) likewise. A facial challenge to \u00a7 121 would fail almost certainly because the statute is much more limited than the Kentucky statute upheld in <em>Colten v. Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972), for. example. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 121(b)(3) (\u201c[a] person may not willfully fail to obey a reasonable and lawful order that a law enforcement officer makes to prevent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>disturbance to the public peace\u201d) <em>with </em>Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 437.016(l)(f) (Supp.1968) (\u201c[a] person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he ... [congregates with other persons in a public place and refuses to comply with a lawful order of the police to disperse\u201d) (quoted in <em>Colten, </em>407 U.S. at 108, 92 S.Ct. at 1956, 32 L.Ed.2d at 589). In the few cases where the Supreme Court has looked beyond the text of a valid statute to assess the \u201caccusation or evidence under it,\u201d the Court has limited its inquiry to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See, e.g. Shuttleswoth v. Birmingham, </em>382 U.S. 87, 95, 86 S.Ct. 211, 216, 15 L.Ed.2d 176, 182 (1965) (\u201c[tjhere was ... no evidence whatever in the record to support the petitioner\u2019s conviction under this ordinance\u201d), <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 311, 60 S.Ct. 900, 906, 84 L.Ed. 1213, 1221 (1940) (\u201cthe petitioner\u2019s communication ... raised no such clear and present menace to public peace and order as to render him liable to conviction of the common law offense in question\u201d). As demonstrated <em>supra, </em>the evidence in the present case is sufficient to support the convictions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The dissent not only ignores impermissibly the clearly erroneous standard and our precedents, but cherry-picks the evidence to support its view that Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders were directed at the content of Polk\u2019s speech. The dissent states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">[a]n examination of the record reveals that Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders unlawfully attempted to regulate Polk\u2019s protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>speech. First and foremost, the officer told Polk to \u201cstop her profanity\u201d and \u201cstop her cursing.\u201d These commands unquestionably were aimed at controlling the words Polk used and not the volume of her voice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">(Dissent at 34). To the contrary, upon close examination of the record, the facts are not nearly as \u201cunquestionable\u201d as the dissent portrays. Sperl testified that his <em>first </em>response to Polk\u2019s outburst of \u201cfuck you, asshole,\u201d which occurred inside the hospital, was to request Polk to lower the <em>volume </em>of her voice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">I said just <em>keep your mouth quiet </em>and leave. Again [she said] fuck you asshole. I said I feel sorry for your child, she had a child with her. After I said I feel sorry for your child, she said fuck you, asshole. I said <em>keep your mouth quiet </em>and leave or I\u2019m going to lock you up for disorderly conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Quixotically, the dissenting opinion points directly to facts it claims do not exist, and thus exposes its own error, by observing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">[t]he majority makes a significant effort to highlight the volume of Polk\u2019s speech. It pinpoints the testimony describing Polk\u2019s behavior as \u2018screaming,\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">\u2018tirades of vulgarity,\u2019 \u2018yelling,\u2019 and \u2018loud.\u2019 The emphasis on the actual volume of Polk\u2019s speech, however, is only a diversion from the consequential issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">(Dissent at 40). To the contrary, because it has been determined <em>by the trial court </em>that Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders were directed at the volume of Ms. Polk\u2019s voice, her volume is not a diversion, but is rather the consequential issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">The second factor in the <em>Eanes </em>analysis requires an examination of both the time and place of the speech and the overhearing parties\u2019 location. <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 455-56, 569 A.2d at 613. The physical circumstances surrounding an outburst influence the legality of a restriction on speech. In <em>Eanes, </em>we emphasized that because \u201cthe character of open public places may differ widely, one from another, only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>flexible approach to volume control can adequately serve the myriad circumstances which the state can legitimately regulate.\u201d 318 Md. at 454, 569 A.2d at 613. The restriction on speech in <em>Eanes </em>was permissible under the First Amendment because Eanes\u2019s speech took place in a residential area, affecting a \u201ccaptive audience,\u201d who we defined as \u201cunwilling listener[s] or viewer[s] who cannot readily escape from the undesired communication, or whose rights are such that [they] should not be required to do so.\u201d <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 451, 569 A.2d at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><em>Eanes </em>did not limit its holding to residential areas. Significantly, we noted that \u201c[protection from unwanted speech] may be extended to any situation in which privacy interests [are] substantially threatened because individuals cannot escape bombardment of [their] sensibilities.\u201d <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 452-53, 569 A.2d at 612 (alterations in original) (citations omitted). Hospitals and their immediate environs, in particular, share with residential areas a similarly heightened need for protection. As we pointed out in <em>Eanes, </em>\u201c[a] sound level that a pedestrian on the sidewalk could not constitutionally object to might be impermissible with respect to a patient in an intensive care ward.\u201d 318 Md. at 456, 569 A.2d at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Similarly, in <em>Radford v. State, </em>640 N.E.2d 90, 93 (Ind.Ct.App.1994), the Court of Appeals of Indiana recognized the compelling state interest in protecting its citizens from unwelcome disturbances at a hospital. The <em>Radford </em>court initially overturned Radford\u2019s conviction for disorderly conduct for refusing to obey an officer\u2019s lawful order to quiet down. <em>Radford v. State, </em>627 N.E.2d 1331 (Ind.Ct.App.1994). The court then reversed itself, on rehearing, quoting from the original dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">Radford\u2019s abusive and harmful speech invaded the privacy of those patients in the hospital and destroyed their right to a quiet and peaceful environment. Patients with heart conditions and patients with nervous disorders, among others, come to the hospital expecting quietude. The intrusiveness, harm, and abuse in Radford\u2019s forum is a thousand times more sensitive than the forum [of a disorderly conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>case occurring in] \u2014 a residential alley at 3:00 in the morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\"><em>Id. </em>We agree with the reasoning of the <em>Radford </em>court and conclude here that Corporal Sperl had a compelling interest in maintaining peace and quiet in the environs of the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The dissenting opinion in the present case claims <em>Radford </em>is \u201ceasily distinguishable\u201d from the facts of the present case. The dissent is wrong. First, it states that while the officer in <em>Radford </em>never addressed the content of Radford\u2019s speech, Corporal Sperl sought to regulate the content of Polk\u2019s speech. (Dissent at 39). Again, this is a factual determination for which an appellate court cannot substitute its own finding for that of the trial court. As our analysis <em>supra </em>reveals, the trial judge\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous in this regard. Second, the dissent states that while the disruptive outburst in <em>Radford </em>occurred inside the hospital, Polk\u2019s outbursts occurred near the Human Resources office and \u201creached its pinnacle\u201d outside the actual hospital building. (Dissent at 39). Consequently, the dissent intimates that there is no legitimate interest in protecting hospital patients, visitors, or workers from disturbances under these circumstances. <em>Id. </em>In fact, Corporal Sperl initiated Polk\u2019s arrest as <em>she was leaving </em>the budding, not after she exited. Furthermore, Polk\u2019s location at the time of her arrest is irrelevant to the central question, whether she acted in a disorderly manner in and around the Hospital. The evidence shows that Polk acted in a disorderly manner while inside the Hospital, well before she was arrested. Thus, Corporal Sperl was legally entitled to arrest Polk for creating a disturbance in the Hospital, a situation identical to that in <em>Radford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The third prong in the <em>Eanes </em>test is whether there are alternative means of communication available to the speaker. In <em>Eanes, </em>we stated that \u201ca speaker will usually have a number of less noisy ways of presenting his or her message: speaking at lower volume; individual contact; use of placards or leaflets. So the balance of reasonableness may rest differently depending on the circumstances.\u201d 318 Md. at 456, 569 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>A.2d at 614. As in <em>Eanes, </em>Polk had other ways of expressing her discontent with the hospital and/or Corporal Sperl, such as speaking to a supervisor in Human Resources, writing a letter to the hospital stating her complaints, or speaking to Corporal Sperl\u2019s supervisor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the trial court correctly found that Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders were lawful under \u00a7 121(b)(3). This Court, therefore, agrees with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cbecause appellant\u2019s challenge to her conviction for resisting arrest is based on the faulty premise that her arrest for disorderly conduct was unlawful, that challenge must fail as well.\u201d Because the trial court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous, Polk\u2019s convictions for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-12\">. \u00a7 121(b)(3) has been recodified, without substantive change, at Md.

It is not at all clear that, on its facts, <em>Diehl </em>would be decided today as it was in 1982. The <em>Diehl </em>majority observed that Officer Gavin \"did not have any right to make his demand on Diehl\u201d that Diehl re-enter the vehicle following the traffic stop. 294 Md. at 471, 451 A.2d at 118. In classifying Diehl\u2019s response as protected speech, the majority\u2019s analysis depended to a great extent on the conclusion that the officer\u2019s conduct in ordering Diehl back into the car was \"unlawful,\" <em>id., </em>constituted \u201cpolice misconduct,\u201d <em>id., </em>and \"exceed[ed] the bounds of [the officer\u2019s] authority,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 478, 451 A.2d at 122. That this conclusion was important to the <em>Diehl </em>majority\u2019s reasoning is manifest from its statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">We conclude, therefore, that where, as here a person is acting in a lawful manner (a passenger getting out of a stopped car) and is the object of an unlawful police order, it is not usually a criminal violation for such person to verbally protest a police officer\u2019s insistence upon submission to such an order. We hold that the State failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>showing of a violation of \u00a7 121 and, therefore, the trial judge erred in not granting Diehl's motion for a judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the State's case or at the close of all the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">294 Md. at 479, 451 A.2d 122 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Today there is no question as to the lawfulness <em>vel non </em>of an officer\u2019s order, following a traffic stop, to the passenger of the stopped vehicle either to remain in or exit the vehicle. <em>See, Maryland v.

Although the crime of disorderly conduct can take several forms under Section 121, the jury, in this case, convicted Polk of violating Section 121(b)(3), which declares that \u201c[a] person may not willfully fail to obey a reasonable and lawful order of a law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>officer made to prevent a disturbance of the public peace.\u201d As the plain language of this provision makes clear, no violation of Section 121(b)(3) can occur unless the officer first gave an order that was \u201clawful.\u201d This aspect of lawfulness is the essence of Polk\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In granting Polk\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, this Court sought to resolve the important constitutional question of whether Corporal Sperl issued unlawful orders that infringed on Polk\u2019s First Amendment rights. The answer to this question requires a careful analysis of whether the particular police commands used by Corporal Sperl regulated the content or volume of Polk\u2019s speech. The majority characterizes this pivotal constitutional question as a factual one, stating, \u201cthe issue before us is not whether Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders were more likely content-based than content neutral, but whether the trial court\u2019s factual determination was clearly erroneous that his orders, in the main, were directed at the volume of Polk\u2019s speech.\u201d Majority at 13-14. This analysis demonstrates the majority\u2019s misunderstanding of the standard of review required in First Amendment cases. The Court should have rendered an independent review of the whole record in this case because the Supreme Court requires such independent appellate review where factual findings implicate First Amendment freedoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">It is well-established that the Court undertakes an independent constitutional appraisal of a trial court\u2019s determination of whether one\u2019s First Amendment right to free speech has been infringed. <em>See Crosby v. State, </em>366 Md. 518, 526, 784 A.2d 1102, 1106 (2001) (stating that \u201cwhen the issue is whether a constitutional right has been infringed, we make our own independent constitutional appraisal\u201d) (citing <em>Stokes v. State, </em>362 Md. 407, 414, 765 A.2d 612, 615 (2001)). In cases that do not raise First Amendment issues, the Court ordinarily accepts the trial court\u2019s findings of fact unless those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>See Glover v. State, </em>368 Md. 211, 221, 792 A.2d 1160, 1166 (2002) (applying <em>de novo </em>review to a question of the constitutional right to a speedy trial but stating that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under a clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>erroneous standard) (citing <em>Rowe v. State, </em>363 Md. 424, 432, 769 A.2d 879, 883 (2001)). In First Amendment cases, however, the Court does not defer to fact findings that have constitutional implications; rather, the Court independently examines the \u201c \u2018whole record\u2019 in order to make sure that \u2018the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bose Corp. v.

Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 284-86, 84 S.Ct. 710, 727-29, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, 709 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The Supreme Court discussed this distinct aspect of appellate review of First Amendment cases in <em>Bose, </em>466 U.S. at 498-515, 104 S.Ct. at 1958-67, 80 L.Ed.2d at 515-26. There, in an opinion prepared by Justice Stevens, the Court reconciled Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), which subjects findings of fact to \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d review, and the requirement in First Amendment cases that an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record. The trial court, sitting without a jury, had determined, under <em>New York Times Co. v. </em>Sullivan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that there was clear and convincing evidence that a consumer magazine made a false disparaging statement with \u201cactual malice\u201d in a published evaluation of a Bose brand speaker. <em>Id. </em>at 490-91, 104 S.Ct. at 1954, 80 L.Ed.2d at 510. Without deferring to the trial court, the United States Court of Appeals reviewed the determination and reversed. Bose argued before the Supreme Court that the determination of \u201cactual malice\u201d amounted to a factual finding, which according to FRCP 52(a), must be upheld unless clearly erroneous. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that \u201cthe clearly-erroneous standard of [FRCP 52(a) ] does not prescribe the standard of review to be applied in reviewing a determination of actual malice.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 104 S.Ct. at 1967, 80 L.Ed.2d at 525-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The Court in <em>Bose </em>presented several reasons why a determination of \u201cactual malice\u201d in defamation cases required such close appellate overview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ag-dedup-0\">First, the common-law heritage of the rule itself assigns an especially broad role to the judge in applying it to specific factual situations. Second, the content of the rule is not revealed simply by its literal text, but rather is given meaning through the evolutionary process of common-law adjudication; though the source of the rule is found in the Constitution, it is nevertheless largely a judge-made rule of law. Finally, the constitutional values protected by the rule make it imperative that judges \u2014 and in some cases judges of this Court \u2014 make sure that it is correctly applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 502, 104 S.Ct. at 1960, 80 L.Ed.2d at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Speaking of the second of these reasons, the <em>Bose </em>Court explained that, \u201c[w]hen the standard governing the decision of a particular case is provided by the Constitution, [the] Court\u2019s role in marking out the limits of the standard through the process of case-by-case adjudication is of special importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503, 104 S.Ct. at 1961, 80 L.Ed.2d at 518. The Court stated that \u201c[t]his process has been vitally important in cases involving restrictions on the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment, particularly in those cases in which it is contended that the communication in issue is within one of the few classes of \u2018unprotected\u2019 speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Determinations of what constitutes libelous speech, fighting words, incitement to riot, obscenity, and child pornography all involved the \u201cevaluation of special facts that have been deemed to have constitutional significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504-05, 104 S.Ct. at 1961-62, 80 L.Ed.2d at 519 (citing <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942) (fighting words); <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969) (incitement to riot); <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957) (obscenity); <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982) (child pornography)). Specifically, questions of what appeals to the \u201cprurient interest\u201d and what is \u201cpatently offensive,\u201d the Court described, are \u201cessentially questions of fact\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>yet subject to an appellate court\u2019s \u201cultimate power ... to conduct an independent review of constitutional claims.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506, 104 S.Ct. at 1963, 80 L.Ed.2d at 520 (quoting <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973)). Whenever the Court has considered the limits of unprotected speech, it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">has regularly conducted an independent review of the record both to be sure that the speech in question actually falls within the unprotected category and to conf\u00edne the perimeters of any unprotected category within acceptably narrow limits in an effort to ensure that protected expression will not be inhibited. Providing triers of fact with a general description of the type of communication whose content is unworthy of protection has not, in and of itself, served sufficiently to narrow the category, nor served to eliminate the danger that decisions by triers of fact may inhibit the expressions of protected ideas. The principle of viewpoint neutrality that underlies the First Amendment itself ... imposes a special responsibility on judges whenever it is claimed that a particular communication is unprotected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS\"><em>Id. </em>at 505, 104 S.Ct. at 1962, 80 L.Ed.2d at 519-20 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Expounding on constitutional significance of the \u201cactual malice\u201d determination, the <em>Bose </em>Court provided insight into why constitutional claims, and First Amendment claims in particular, deserve the close appellate attention of independent review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">The requirement of independent appellate review reiterated in <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan </em>is a rule of federal constitutional law. It emerged from the exigency of deciding concrete cases; it is law in its purest form under our common-law heritage. It reflects a deeply held conviction that judges \u2014 and particularly Members of this Court \u2014 must exercise such review in order to preserve the precious liberties established and ordained by the Constitution. The question whether the evidence in the record in a defamation case is of the convincing clarity required to strip the utterance of First Amendment protection is not merely a ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>tion for the trier of fact. Judges, as expositors of the Constitution, must independently decide whether the evidence in the record is sufficient to cross the constitutional threshold that bars the entry of any judgment that is not supported by clear and convincing proof of \u201cactual malice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 510-11, 104 S.Ct. at 1965, 80 L.Ed.2d at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Several commentators analyzing <em>Bose </em>have illustrated the difference between those \u201cfindings\u201d best accorded deference and those the Supreme Court has held should be reviewed independently based on the whole record. Purely factual findings worthy of deference, as one commentator suggests, answer questions that <em>\u201ccan be determined by direct observation </em>and by accepting or rejecting the testimony of witnesses who are reporting their own direct observations.\u201d George C. Christie, <em>Judicial Review of Findings of Fact, </em>87 Nw. U.L.Rev. 14, 39 (1992) (hereinafter \u201cChristie\u201d) (emphasis added). Other scholars explain that the process of establishing \u201cfacts\u201d involves answering \u201cwho, when, what, and where,\u201d inquiries that \u201ccan be made by a person who is ignorant of the applicable law.\u201d Henry P. Monaghan, <em>Constitutional Fact Review, </em>85 Colum. L.Rev. 229, 235 (1985) (hereinafter \u201cMona-ghan\u201d)(quoting, in part, L. Jaffe, <em>Judicial Control of Administrative Action </em>548, 624-53 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">On the other hand, some \u201cfactual findings\u201d cannot be made by direct observation alone, but also \u201crequire some degree of conscious reflection.\u201d Christie at 40. When such reflection is necessary, one must resolve \u201cwhy it is necessary to decide the question and what will be the consequences of deciding the question one way or the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39^0. Commentators have described the process of making determinations of this nature as \u201claw application\u201d or answering \u201cmixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>See </em>Monaghan at 236; Christie at 39. Law application occurs frequently in areas outside of the First Amendment context, such as when a jury decides whether a defendant in tort case was negligent. When constitutional rights are not at stake, appellate courts typically review these judgments with some degree of deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The Supreme Court mandates, however, that where \u201claw application\u201d implicates First Amendment freedoms, appellate courts should not defer to the trial court\u2019s judgment. Rather, the appellate court \u201chas an obligation to \u2018make an independent examination of the whole record\u2019 in order to make sure that \u2018the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.\u201d <em>Bose, </em>466 U.S. at 499, 104 S.Ct. at 1958, 80 L.Ed.2d at 515 (quoting <em>New York Times Co., </em>376 U.S. at 284-86, 84 S.Ct. at 728-29, 11 L.Ed.2d at 708-09). Sometimes referred to as \u201cconstitutional fact\u201d review, the requirement of rendering an independent determination of First Amendment law application ensures, as the <em>Bose </em>Court recognized, that the appellate courts, on a case by case basis, develop the meaning of the constitutional principles at issue. Commentators consider this a form of norm elaboration. Monaghan at 231. That is, an appellate court\u2019s case-by-case filtering of specific facts through First Amendment principles serves to assign practical significance to those principles. Without reference to specific facts, First Amendment standards are merely abstract principles. As Professor Monoghan summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-4\">Constitutional fact review presupposes that appellate courts will render independent judgment on any issues of constitutional \u201claw\u201d presented. Its distinctive feature is a requirement of similar independent judicial judgment on issues of constitutional law \u201capplication.\u201d That is, the courts must sort out the relevant facts and apply to them the controlling constitutional norms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Monaghan at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">First Amendment issues are no less apparent in the case at bar than they were in <em>Bose. </em>Corporal Sperl issued orders seeking to control Polk\u2019s speech. Whether those orders were directed at her volume, as the trial court found, or directed at her message, they must survive First Amendment scrutiny. This determination, though, dictates the level of scrutiny we apply to those orders, and, to a great extent, the lawfulness of those orders; it is inextricably tied to whether Polk\u2019s speech was protected by the First Amendment. Only by conducting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>an independent review of Polk\u2019s case based on the entire record may this Court set the limits of what types of speech are protected under the First Amendment. This Court\u2019s duty to declare the meaning of the First Amendment cannot be delegated to the trier of fact. The freedoms enjoyed under the First Amendment are simply too precious to risk a trial court\u2019s mistaken interpretation of how a police officer may control an individual\u2019s speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Moreover, the trial court\u2019s judgment that Corporal Sperl directed his orders at the volume of Polk\u2019s speech rather than its content was not the type of factual finding to which an appellate court accords deference. <em>See Wells v. City and County of Denver, </em>257 F.3d 1132, 1146-47 (10th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Bose </em>and reviewing a determination of content-neutrality independently based on the whole record); <em>AIDS Action Comm. v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>42 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.1994) (reviewing the entire record independently to determine whether a government restriction was a content-based or content-neutral); <em>see also Pack Shack, Inc. v. Howard County, </em>377 Md. 55, 71, 832 A.2d 170, 180 (2003) (considering the question of content-neutrality without regard to the trial court\u2019s finding on that matter).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The State presented evidence at trial that Corporal Sperl had issued a series of commands to Polk as she was leaving the hospital. Corporal Sperl, himself, testified that he commanded Polk to \u201cstop her cursing,\u201d \u201cstop her profanity,\u201d \u201ckeep [her] mouth quiet,\u201d and \u201ckeep [her] mouth shut.\u201d The State did not contend that the officer\u2019s testimony misstated the words he used in issuing the orders to Polk, nor did the State dispute that Corporal Sperl referred specifically to Polk\u2019s profanity in those orders. Because no conviction under Section 121(b) may rest on an unlawful police order, the trial judge had an obligation, upon Polk\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, to decide the lawfulness of police orders that sought to restrict both the content and volume of an individual\u2019s speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>To answer this question properly, the judge could not merely rely on direct observation of the testimony, which might allow him to decide the time and place the incident occurred or the words Corporal Sperl used to issue his commands. Instead, the process of making this determination involved examining First Amendment law to decide whether it permitted mixed regulation of speech content and volume. The Supreme Court in <em>Bose </em>directed that this type of analytical process must be subjected to independent review of the appellate court. Because Polk\u2019s First Amendment rights were implicated by the trial court\u2019s finding, the Court should not be bound by the clearly erroneous standard of review. The majority should have employed a <em>de novo </em>review of this case to answer the constitutional question of whether the orders given by Corporal Sperl were directed at the volume or content of Polk\u2019s speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">By deciding that Corporal Sperl directed his orders at the volume of Polk\u2019s voice, the trial judge misapplied an established First Amendment principle to the facts of this case. The First Amendment provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d This command, by operation of the Fourteenth Amendment, applies with equal force to state and local governments. <em>Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 445, 569 A.2d 604, 608 (1990) (citing <em>Gitlow v. New York, </em>268 U.S. 652, 45 S.Ct. 625, 69 L.Ed. 1138 (1925)). Without question, however, \u201cthe First and Fourteenth Amendments have never been thought to give absolute protection to every individual to speak whenever or wherever he pleases, or to use any form of address in any circumstances that he chooses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, 569 A.2d at 608-09 (quoting <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 19, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 1785, 29 L.Ed.2d 284, 290 (1971)); <em>see also R.A.V. v.

For example, consistent with the First Amendment, States may restrict the use of \u201cfighting words,\u201d <em>Chap-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>linsky, </em>315 U.S. at 571-72, 62 S.Ct. at 769, 86 L.Ed. at 1035, and in a limited way, restrict the use of \u201cobscenity,\u201d <em>see Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957); <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), and defamatory speech, <em>see Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974); <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); <em>Beauharnais v. Illinois, </em>343 U.S. 250, 72 S.Ct. 725, 96 L.Ed. 919 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Nevertheless, as the Supreme Court\u2019s and our cases make clear, \u201c[i]t is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Playboy Entm\u2019t Group, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 803, 818, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 1889, 146 L.Ed.2d 865, 882 (2000). Rather, such regulation is prohibited unless it \u201cis necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.... \u201d <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 447, 569 A.2d at 609 (quoting <em>Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn., </em>460 U.S. 37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794, 804 (1983)); <em>see also Playboy, </em>529 U.S. at 813, 120 S.Ct. at 1886, 146 L.Ed.2d at 879. Therefore, \u201c[w]here the designed benefit of a content-based speech restriction is to shield the sensibilities of listeners, the general rule is that the right of expression prevails, even where no less restrictive alternative exists.\u201d <em>Playboy, </em>529 U.S. at 813, 120 S.Ct. at 1886, 146 L.Ed.2d at 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Guided by these principles, this Court has held on two occasions that convictions for disorderly conduct based on the profane nature of one\u2019s speech run afoul of the First Amendment. <em>Diehl v. State, </em>294 Md. 466, 470-74, 451 A.2d 115, 118-20 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1098, 103 S.Ct. 1798, 76 L.Ed.2d 363 (1983); <em>Downs v. State, </em>278 Md. 610, 618, 366 A.2d 41, 46 (1976). In <em>Downs, </em>the Court addressed whether the uttering of \u201cthe fucking niggers in this county are no better than goddamn policemen\u201d constituted protected speech. 278 Md. at 611, 366 A.2d at 42. Downs spoke these words in a loud voice while conversing with three friends over breakfast in a crowded restaurant. <em>Id. </em>Overhearing the vulgarity, a police officer approached Downs, told him that his talk was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>disruptive, and warned that \u201cif he did not refrain from using such profane language,\u201d he would arrest him. <em>Id., </em>366 A.2d at 42-43. When Downs foolishly replied, \u201cYou ain\u2019t bad enough to place me under arrest,\u201d the officer arrested him, and a jury later convicted him of several offenses, including disorderly conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 611-12, 366 A.2d at 43. The Court reversed the convictions, holding that \u201cDowns\u2019 remarks were not the kind of personally abusive epithets which fall outside of the protection of the First Amendment under the rubric of \u2018fighting\u2019 words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 366 A.2d at 46. Rather, the Court concluded, \u201cHe engaged in protected speech. That his views might be offensive to someone who overheard him does not warrant a conviction for disorderly conduct.\u201d <em>Id</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The Court further developed this line of reasoning in <em>Diehl, </em>294 Md. 466, 451 A.2d 115. There, a patrolling police officer pulled over a car for \u201csquealing wheels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 451 A.2d at 116. After both the driver and a passenger got out of the car, the officer ordered them to get back into the vehicle. The driver complied, but the passenger, Diehl, yelled at the officer, \u201cFuck you, Gavin;\u201d \u201cI know my rights;\u201d \u201cyou can\u2019t tell me what to do....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468, 451 A.2d at 116. The officer again ordered Diehl into the car, warning him that he would be arrested if he did not obey. <em>Id </em>at 468, 451 A.2d at 117. When Diehl refused to follow the instructions, the officer arrested him for \u201cscreaming obscenities and ... drawing a crowd.\u201d <em>Id </em>Diehl was convicted of numerous offenses, including violating former Article 27, Section 121, which prohibited \u201cwilfully disturbing] any neighborhood in ... [any] city, town or county [of this State] by loud and unseemly noises, or ... profanely curs[ing] or swear[ing] or us[ing] obscene language upon or near to any street or highway within the hearing of persons passing by or along such highway.\u201d Following an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the convictions, we issued a writ of certiorari and then reversed. <em>Id </em>at 469, 451 A.2d at 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">At the outset in <em>Diehl, </em>the Court noted that Diehl\u2019s \u201coral communication ... clearly constituted speech\u201d and, therefore, was entitled to First Amendment protection. <em>Id </em>at 471, 451 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>A.2d at 118. Significantly, we observed that <em>\u201cDowns ... </em>teaches us that the use of the word \u2018fuck\u2019 is not punishable in the absence of compelling reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477, 451 A.2d at 122. Diehl\u2019s words, we concluded, although specifically directed at the police officer, did not qualify as \u201cfighting words\u201d because they were spoken, not as a \u201cpersonally abusive epithet hurled to invoke immediate and violent response,\u201d but as an \u201cemotional and emphatic response to [the officer\u2019s] order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 451 A.2d at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">These cases demonstrate clearly that an order directed at controlling a speaker\u2019s use of profanity constitutes an impermissible content-based restriction on free speech. Indeed, the State does not dispute this axiom, stating in its brief that the \u201cFirst Amendment would render unlawful, as constituting disorderly conduct, any order to refrain from profanity.\u201d The State also does not contend that Polk used \u201cfighting words,\u201d conceivably because there is no evidence that her speech was intended \u201cto invoke immediate and violent response,\u201d <em>Diehl, </em>294 Md. at 478, 451 A.2d at 122, or because the words were spoken to a police officer who \u201cmay reasonably be expected to \u2018exercise a higher degree of restraint\u2019 than the average citizen and be less likely to respond belligerently . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477, 451 A.2d at 121 (quoting <em>Lewis v. City of New Orleans, </em>415 U.S. 130, 135, 94 S.Ct. 970, 973, 39 L.Ed.2d 214, 220 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring)). Consequently, the content of Polk\u2019s speech, which included the same \u201cprofanity\u201d at issue in <em>Downs </em>and <em>Diehl, </em>was protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The majority determines that Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders to Polk sought to restrict not the content of her speech, but its volume. Under the majority\u2019s view, the orders were permissible, \u201ccontent-neutral\u201d regulations to control unreasonably loud noise caused by Polk. In support of its assertions, the majority relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 569 A.2d 604 (1990). The <em>Eanes </em>Court affirmed the conviction of an anti-abortion protester, whose loud preaching during the mid-morning hours in a busy downtown area constituted a \u201cwilfulQ disturb[ance] of any neighborhood ... by loud and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>unseemly noises\u201d in violation of former Article 27, Section 121. <em>Id. </em>at 440-41, 468, 569 A.2d at 606, 620. Reading the statute\u2019s restriction on speech to be \u201cclearly content-neutral,\u201d the Court subjected it to constitutional scrutiny to determine whether it was \u201cnarrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449, 569 A.2d at 610. \u201cSound,\u201d the <em>Eanes </em>Court explained, \u201cis one of the most intrusive means of communication,\u201d and the \u201cgovernment ha[s] a substantial interest in protecting its citizens from unwelcome noise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449, 453, 569 A.2d at 610, 612 (quoting <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 796, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2756, 105 L.Ed.2d 661, 678 (1989)). Because the statute \u201cprohibit[ed] only that volume level of communication that unreasonably disturbs individuals whose rights to be free from aural abuse override the right of a speaker to address them by direct or incidental oral communication,\u201d it \u201cserve[d] a substantial interest and [was] narrowly tailored to serve those ends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453-54, 569 A.2d at 612. Based on the trial judge\u2019s findings that Eanes\u2019s speech was loud and actually disturbed residents and business people in the area, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">[The trial judge] properly balanced Eanes\u2019s first amendment rights against a substantial public interest protected by a narrowly drawn, content-neutral regulation. Eanes was warned to lower his voice by a police officer whose action was based on complaints from members of the captive audience. Eanes chose not to comply. Under these circumstances, he was properly convicted of a violation of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 468, 569 A.2d at 620.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The teachings of <em>Eanes, Diehl, </em>and <em>Downs, </em>expose the pivotal constitutional question in this case: whether Corporal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Sperl\u2019s orders impermissibly restricted the content of Polk\u2019s speech. If the officer directed his orders to restrict the use of profanity, he issued a content-based order, which is unlawful unless it \u201cis necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.... \u201d <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 447, 569 A.2d at 609 (quoting <em>Perry Education Assn., </em>460 U.S. at 45, 103 S.Ct. at 955, 74 L.Ed.2d at 804. On the other hand, if the commands were an attempt to regulate the volume of Polk\u2019s language, they may be able to withstand constitutional scrutiny under <em>Eanes </em>if they were \u201cnarrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449, 569 A.2d at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">An examination of the entire record reveals that Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders unlawfully attempted to regulate Polk\u2019s protected speech. First and foremost, the officer told Polk to \u201cstop her profanity\u201d and \u201cstop her cursing.\u201d These commands unquestionably were aimed at controlling the words Polk used and not the volume of her voice. Although the record indicates that Polk also was instructed to \u201ckeep your mouth shut\u201d and \u201ckeep your mouth quiet,\u201d these phrases were always used in conjunction with the references to the content of Polk\u2019s speech. Where an officer issues orders that attempt to restrict protected speech, those orders are \u201ccontent-based\u201d and must be narrowly drawn to achieve a compelling state interest. <em>See Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 447, 569 A.2d at 609 (quoting <em>Perry Education Assn., </em>460 U.S. at 45, 103 S.Ct. at 955, 74 L.Ed.2d at 804).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">This is so even if the \u201ccontent-based\u201d orders are combined, as they were here, with other commands that, by themselves, might not raise constitutional concerns. That is, despite Corporal Sperl\u2019s alleged attempt to quiet Polk\u2019s voice, it is his order to control her speech content that dictates which level of scrutiny this Court should apply. Support for this approach resides in the Supreme Court\u2019s longstanding prohibition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>laws that \u201cdo[] not aim specifically at evils within the allowable area of [government] control, but ... sweep[] within [their] ambit other activities that in ordinary circumstances constitute an exercise of freedom of speech.... \u201d <em>See Thornhill v.

The Court concluded that, even though the statute prohibited conduct that the Constitution did not protect, such as violence and breaches of the peace, it also placed restrictions on \u201cpeaceful and truthful discussion of matters of public interest,\u201d activities that enjoy First Amendment protection. <em>Id. </em>Because the law did not \u201caim specifically\u201d at the activities that States may regulate validly, it therefore constituted an unlawful, \u201csweeping proscription of freedom of discussion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104, 105, 60 S.Ct. at 745, 746, 84 L.Ed. at 1103, 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In <em>Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972), the Court again held unconstitutional a statute that penalized a range of conduct that included certain protected speech. The Georgia statute at issue established criminal penalties for certain uses of \u201copprobrious words or abusive language, tending to cause a breach of the peace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519, 92 S.Ct. at 1104, 31 L.Ed.2d at 412. The Court recognized that statutes touching on the constitutional guarantees of free speech \u201cmust be carefully drawn or authoritatively construed to punish only unprotected speech and not be susceptible of application to protected expression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522, 92 S.Ct. at 1106, 31 L.Ed. at 414. In light of this requirement, the Court concluded that the Georgia statute, as defined by the state courts, \u201cd[id] not define the standard of responsibility with requisite narrow specificity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 92 S.Ct. at 1108, 31 L.Ed.2d at 417. Although the statute did apply to \u201cfighting words\u201d (conduct for which the First Amendment offered no protection), its strictures also affected protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>expression and, consequently, violated the First Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 528, 92 S.Ct. at 1109, 31 L.Ed.2d at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Very recently, in <em>Virginia v. Black, </em>538 U.S. 343, 123 S.Ct. 1536, 155 L.Ed.2d 535 (2003) (plurality opinion), the Supreme Court applied the principles expressed in <em>Gooding </em>to invalidate a provision of Virginia\u2019s statutory scheme, prohibiting cross-burning with the intent to intimidate. The provision at issue stated that \u201cany such burning of a cross,\u201d established a prima facie case of an intent to intimidate. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 123 S.Ct. at 1550, 155 L.Ed.2d at 554. This language, therefore, rendered all cross-burning subject to criminal sanctions, including that which was intended as an expression of ideology not intimidation. By failing to distinguish between different types of cross-burning (i.e., those carried out with the intent to intimidate and those carried out as political expression), the prima facie provision penalized both protected as well as unprotected acts of expression. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 123 S.Ct. at 1151, 155 L.Ed.2d at 556. The Court held, therefore, that the prima facie evidence provision was \u201cunconstitutional on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 123 S.Ct. at 1151-52, 31 L.Ed.2d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">Consistent with the spirit of these Supreme Court cases, Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders in this case do not pass constitutional scrutiny. The orders required Polk to \u201cstop her cursing,\u201d \u201cstop her profanity,\u201d \u201ckeep [her] mouth shut,\u201d and \u201ckeep [her] mouth quiet.\u201d The collective effect of these prohibitions embraced not only the volume of Polk\u2019s voice, but also the content of her message. The orders were not narrowly drawn to cover only the aspects of Polk\u2019s speech that were \u201ccontent-neutral\u201d and that the First Amendment allows to be regulated more freely. Rather, the orders were susceptible of application to \u201ccontent-based\u201d speech and, therefore, should be subjected to a stricter standard of constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Under this stricter standard of First Amendment scrutiny, as we have previously discussed, the content of Polk\u2019s speech \u201cis not punishable in the absence of compelling reasons.\u201d <em>Diehl, </em>294 Md. at 477, 451 A.2d at 122 (citing <em>Downs, </em>278 Md. at 618, 366 A.2d at 46). Like in <em>Diehl, </em>where the motorist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>uttered \u201cvulgar language\u201d at a police officer, there are no compelling reasons in this case that warranted Corporal Sperl\u2019s proscription of Polk\u2019s choice of language. <em>See id. </em>at 478, 451 A.2d at 122. No evidence in the record suggests that the conditions in and around the hospital necessitated completely prohibiting the use of vulgar language. In the absence of compelling reasons to forbid Polk\u2019s use of certain words, Corporal Sperl had no lawful justification for issuing orders to \u201cstop her cursing\u201d and \u201cstop her profanity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Nevertheless, the majority insists on reaching a different result in this case because the alleged conduct took place within a hospital, which has a particular interest in avoiding unreasonably loud noises. As support for this assertion, the majority points to the decision of an Indiana intermediate appellate court in <em>Radford v. State, </em>640 N.E.2d 90 (Ind.Ct.App.1994). The court in that ease affirmed the disorderly conduct conviction of Radford, a former hospital employee whose unpleasant encounter with a police officer inside the hospital led to public disturbance. <em>Id. </em>at 91-92. After receiving a report that Radford had been removing hospital property from her former work station, the police officer approached the employee in a hospital hallway near the OB-GYN clinic. <em>Id. </em>at 91. When the officer asked her to step into an alcove to avoid obstructing traffic in the hallway and demanded to see the contents of the box she was carrying, Radford \u201cloudly protested\u201d and \u201ccontinually got angry and in a very loud and abusive voice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91-92. The officer asked Radford to \u201cquiet down\u201d at least three times, but she refused. <em>Id. </em>Radford was then charged and convicted of disorderly conduct under an Indiana statute prohibiting a person from making \u201cunreasonable noise and continuing] to do so after being asked to stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">On appeal, the court initially reversed the conviction, holding that Radford\u2019s speech \u201cwas [protected] political speech ... protesting the legality and appropriateness of police conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92. The court, however, reheard the case and affirmed the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 91. The court opined that the statutory prohibition of unreasonable noise was \u201ccontent-neutral\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>applied to the volume of Radford\u2019s speech. <em>Id. </em>at 92. Additionally, the court observed that the type of speech in which Radford engaged was not \u201cpurely political\u201d in nature and that the \u201cforum\u201d of Radford\u2019s speech \u201cwas a quiet hallway of a hospital____adjacent to the OB-GYN clinic and close to the recently born baby nursery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94. It characterized Radford\u2019s loud speech as \u201charmful and abusive\u201d and stated that it \u201cdestroyed [the patients\u2019] right to a quiet and peaceful environment.\u201d The court concluded, therefore, that \u201cRadford made unreasonable noise and continued to do so after being asked to stop, as required for conviction under [the applicable Indiana statute].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\"><em>Radford </em>is readily distinguishable from the case before us on several grounds. Most importantly, unlike the present case, the officer in <em>Radford </em>never directed his orders at the content of speech. He offered instructions only to \u201cquiet\u201d the volume of Radford\u2019s unreasonably noisy voice, not to limit her word choice. In addition, the incident in <em>Radford </em>occurred entirely within the confines of the hospital walls and near the OB-GYN clinic where patients were likely to be disturbed, and the court was persuaded that this setting should be protected from \u201cdisturbing noise\u201d for the \u201csafety of those hospitalized.\u201d The episode in the present case, by contrast, took place near the Human Resources Department and eventually <em>outside </em>of the hospital. There is no evidence in the record that patients were under treatment nearby or that the area adjacent to Human Resources, like an OB-GYN clinic, required special noise control. It is also notable that Polk was arrested <em>after </em>she had left the building. The exchange between Corporal Sperl and Polk reached its pinnacle, not inside the hospital, but as she was walking outside to the parking garage. Only then, when Polk was outside the hospital and away from any sensitive areas, did Corporal Sperl decide to take her into custody, even though the volume of her voice at that point was much less of a concern. One can only speculate whether the events that transpired inside the hospital formed the basis for Polk\u2019s arrest, unlike in <em>Radford </em>where the events and arrest occurred wholly inside the hospital walls.</p>\n<p id=\"ab-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Additional aspects of the majority\u2019s analysis in this case are similarly troublesome. The majority contends that \u201cample testimony before the trial court\u201d supports that \u201cCorporal Sperl issued orders aimed, in the main, at the volume of Ms. Polk\u2019s speech.\u201d Majority at 14. This conclusion is defective for several reasons. First, the majority accepts the proposition that Corporal Speri\u2019s orders were volume-based despite Corporal Sperl\u2019s own testimony establishing that he told Polk to \u201cstop [her] profanity\u201d and \u201cstop [her] cursing.\u201d Under the majority\u2019s analysis, police would be permitted to justify content-based speech restrictions by claiming an intention to reduce the volume of one\u2019s voice. This precedent encourages unlawful regulation of an individual\u2019s message under the pretext of noise control.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In addition, the majority\u2019s reasoning inappropriately concentrates on the officer\u2019s \u201caim\u201d in issuing his order. In other words, the majority allows a police officer\u2019s subjective intentions to dictate the Court\u2019s evaluation of the police command\u2019s lawfulness. The Court, instead, should focus its analysis on the actual words used by the Corporal. A reasonable person would have no reason to believe that <em>only </em>the <em>volume </em>of his or her voice is the target of an order to \u201cstop your cursing\u201d or \u201cstop your profanity.\u201d The plain meaning of those specific references to speech content would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the officer objects to the message the speaker is conveying. The Court should not require one in Polk\u2019s position to obey a facially content-based police order because the officer intended his mandate to reach only the speaker\u2019s volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Yet, the majority makes a significant effort to highlight the volume of Polk\u2019s speech. It pinpoints the testimony describing Polk\u2019s behavior as \u201cscreaming,\u201d \u201ctirades of vulgarity,\u201d and \u201cyelling.\u201d The emphasis on the actual volume of Polk\u2019s speech, however, is only a diversion from the consequential issue. If Corporal Sperl ordered Polk to refrain from cursing, as he did, the particular order is still subject to strict First Amendment scrutiny even if the sound of Polk\u2019s voice carried across the Chesapeake Bay. Polk\u2019s \u201cuse of vulgar language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>does not evolve into a crime simply because persons in the area stopped, looked, and listened.\u201d <em>Diehl, </em>294 Md. at 478, 451 A.2d at 122. One violates Section 121(b)(3) only by wilfully failing to obey a lawful command, and the State has not presented sufficiently compelling reasons for justifying the content-based orders to Polk that she \u201cstop [her] cursing\u201d and \u201cstop [her] profanity.\u201d Consequently, Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders unlawfully restricted the content of Polk\u2019s speech.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the absence of a lawful order, Polk\u2019s conviction of disorderly conduct under Section 121(b)(3) cannot be supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Because Polk\u2019s conviction for disorderly conduct is without support, it follows necessarily that the evidence does not support her conviction of resisting arrest. It is well settled that, \u201cone illegally arrested may use any reasonable means to effect his escape, even to the extent of using such force as is reasonably necessary.\u201d <em>Diehl, </em>294 Md. at 479, 451 A.2d at 123 (citing <em>Rogers v. State, </em>280 Md. 406, 373 A.2d 944, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 928, 98 S.Ct. 412, 54 L.Ed.2d 287 (1977); <em>Sugarman v. State, </em>173 Md. 52, 195 A. 324 (1937)); <em>see State v. Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. 585, 607, 714 A.2d 841, 851 (1998) (\u201c[W]e decline to abolish the long-standing common law privilege permitting persons to resist an illegal warrantless arrest\u201d). Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders to Polk were unlawful, so his subsequent arrest of her for violating those orders was also illegal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Polk\u2019s use of force in resisting that illegal arrest, therefore, did not constitute a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">IY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">By deferring to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Corporal Sperl directed his orders at Polk\u2019s volume, the majority ignores an essential aspect of this Court\u2019s role as a appellate body. The majority opts to avoid the highly significant constitutional issue in this case in favor of upholding a police order, which, it admits, was at least partially directed at Polk\u2019s speech content. Majority at 14 (\u201cThe record contains ample testimony before the trial court supporting its finding that Corporal Sperl issued orders aimed, <em>in the </em>main&gt; at the volume of Ms. Polk\u2019s speech.\u201d) (emphasis added). Because Corporal Sperl\u2019s orders restricted the content of Polk\u2019s speech, they were not \u201clawful and reasonable\u201d as required by Section 121(b)(3). Thus, Polk had no obligation to comply \u2022with the officer\u2019s orders or submit to the arrest. I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">BELL, C.J. and ELDRIDGE, J., authorize me to state that they join in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-5\">.

Judge Eldridge, in his dissenting opinion in <em>Eanes, </em>disagreed that the speech at issue in that case warranted a criminal conviction. 318 Md. at 500, 569 A.2d at 635 (Eldridge, J., dissenting). He believed, instead, that Eanes \u201cwas engaged in free speech in its 'most pristine and classic form' \u201d at the time of his arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 472, 569 A.2d at 622 (quoting <em>Edwards v.

He also took the position that the majority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>by emphasizing the importance of volume control, \"overlooked that sound, in the form of the spoken word, is the most basic thing protected by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476, 569 A.2d at 624.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-5\">.

The distinction relied upon is without meaning. <em>Thornhill </em>and its progeny stand for the proposition that overly broad government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>speech regulation, whether in the form of enacted legislation or impromptu police orders, violates the First Amendment right to free speech. The substance of the government regulation, not its form or source, should drive the constitutional analysis. It is highly unlikely that the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis would turn on whether a police officer or legislative body acted to infringe upon one's constitutional right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b85-6\">. Other circumstances in this case undermine the State's position that Corporal Sperl issued a \"reasonable and lawful order\u201d under Section 121(b)(3). Assuming the orders in this case were lawful, which they were not, I question whether they were reasonable under the circumstances. The trial testimony suggests that the officer may have shared some of the responsibility for aggravating the commotion in the hospital. Upon first encountering Polk on the day of the incident, Corporal Sperl held her pay stub above his head and out of her reach while he asked a Human Resources employee whether he could turn it over to Polk. Even when Polk began walking toward the hospital exit to leave, Corporal Sperl followed close behind, commenting provocatively, \u201cI feel sorry for your child.\u201d It is within this context \u2014 a tense situation made worse by the officer\u2019s inflammatory conduct \u2014 that Corporal Sperl then ordered Polk not to talk.
