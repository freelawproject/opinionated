We shall conclude that both courts were in error and shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Hildreth was the sole shareholder, director, and officer of a New Jersey corporation known as HCE, Inc., which, for convenience, we shall sometimes refer to as HCE-NJ. The corporation, formed in November, 1996, engaged in the construction business as a subcontractor on various commercial construction projects. At some point in late 1996 or 1997, HCE, Inc. began to do business in Maryland and opened an office in Columbia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Hildreth had formed a number of other corporations in Maryland, one of which, Hildreth Contracting and Engineers, Inc., had forfeited its charter in October, 1996, he did not register HCE-NJ in this State, as required by Maryland Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7-202, 7-202.1, or 7-203 of the Corporations and Associations Article. Those sections, respectively, require that foreign corporations register with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation before doing any interstate, foreign, or intrastate business in Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>land. Registration requires that the corporation have a resident agent in Maryland and that it certify to the Department the address of the corporation and the name and address of the resident agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">When HCE-NJ began to do business in Maryland, there was already existing a Maryland corporation by the name of HCE, Inc., which, for convenience, we shall refer to as HCE-Md. HCE-Md, incorporated here in 1985, had no connection with the New Jersey corporation or with Hildreth and was in the business of renting portable toilets. So far as this record reveals, the two corporations had no common customers or business creditors. At some point in late 1997, HCE-Md began receiving calls from suppliers with which it had no connection, complaining about unpaid bills, as well as suit papers intended for HCE-NJ. Looking in the telephone book, HCE-Md\u2019s president, Harry Boyce, learned of the existence of the other HCE, called the number listed, and, being unable to get through to an individual, left a message asking that the company refrain from using the name HCE. Boyce said that he left that message twice. Ultimately, Boyce learned of Hildreth\u2019s existence and caused HCE-Md\u2019s attorney, in January, 1998, to write to Hildreth, complaining about HCE-NJ\u2019s use of the HCE name and threatening legal action if such use did not cease immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Evidence indicated that such use did not stop, as Boyce continued to receive correspondence from creditors of HCE-NJ and even information that HCE-NJ, using the name HCE, Inc., had filed suit in a Maryland court against the Marriott Corporation. Finally, in September, 1999, HCE-NJ registered with the Department of Assessments and Taxation under the name HCE of New Jersey, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The contract that led to the lawsuit against Hildreth was with respondent, Tidewater Equipment Company, Inc., which was in the business of renting cranes. In February, 1998, HCE-NJ rented a 20-ton capacity crane from Tidewater for one or two days and paid the rental charge as agreed. In September, 1998, HCE-NJ commenced negotiations for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>long-term rental of a crane that it intended to use in connection with a construction project in Alexandria, Virginia. The initial contact was made by an employee other than Hildreth, but Hildreth was not satisfied with the price demanded by the Tidewater salesman. Hildreth then contacted and negotiated with another Tidewater representative, Frank Kolbe, and eventually received a better price. In the course of the negotiations, Kolbe dealt with at least one other employee of HCE-NJ, Bob Condin. Condin informed Kolbe that HCE-NJ built metal walls, that its plant was in Hanover, Maryland, and that it needed the crane to load the walls on to trucks for shipment to Alexandria.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Hildreth made clear he was acting for \u201cHCE, Inc.,\u201d but neither said nor was asked where that company was incorporated. He informed Kolbe that the company had an office in Columbia, Maryland. Kolbe visited both the Columbia office and the Hanover job site. He testified that the company \u201cdidn\u2019t appear to be a fly-by-night operation,\u201d but had \u201ca nice office suite\u201d and \u201cnumerous employees.\u201d The job site in Hanover was also substantial, with \u201ca huge warehouse,\u201d a rail siding, and \u201chundreds of metal building panels.\u201d Kolbe assumed that HCE-NJ was a Maryland corporation because it had an office in Columbia. He did not order a credit report but, in agreeing to the lease, apparently relied on his site visits, his conversations with Bob Condin, his seeing the subcontracts that HCE-NJ had with the contractor, Erkile-tian Construction Corp., and Hildreth\u2019s oral assurance that Tidewater would be paid in accordance with the quoted terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The arrangement was memorialized in a series of daily contracts, as the equipment was needed, commencing in September, 1998. The rental started at $500/day plus a charge for the operator, but later was reduced to $455/day plus operator. The charges were initially billed on a weekly basis but were then converted to a monthly billing. Payment was due within 30 days, with interest at 2% per month on unpaid balances. Hildreth did not sign the contracts; they were signed on behalf of HCE-NJ by some other employee. The charges for September, October, and November, 1998, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>paid in' January and February, 1999. When payments were not received thereafter, Tidewater, in April, 1999, re-took possession of the equipment. At the time, Tidewater was owed $47,246 for the months of December, January, February, and March, and for a few days in April.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In an amended complaint filed in the Circuit Court for Howard County against HCE of New Jersey, Inc., Hildreth Contractors &amp; Engineers, Inc., and Hildreth individually, Tidewater alleged the lease of equipment and a statement of account showing $47,246 as principal due and owing, along with $7,784 in accrued interest. The suit was for those amounts, plus daily accruing interest thenceforth and attorneys\u2019 fees, provided for in the contracts, in the amount of 15%, or $7,086. The only allegations made against Hildreth individually were that (1) he operated a business at 9220 Rumsey Road in Columbia trading as HCE, Inc., (2) the corporation for which he acted with respect to Tidewater was \u201cHCE of New Jersey, Inc. t/a HCE, Inc. and/or Hildreth Contractors <em>&amp; </em>Engineers, Inc., t/a HCE, Inc.\u201d, (3) he \u201cindividually and t/a HCE, Inc. acted as if he had the authority to bind HCE, Inc. to the contract which forms the basis of the instant litigation,\u201d and (4) \u201che had no authority to act on behalf of the Maryland corporation known as HCE, Inc. and he is therefore personally liable for the debts incurred herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">As the case proceeded, the court entered summary judgment in favor of Hildreth Contractors &amp; Engineers, Inc. but against HCE-NJ. In August, 2001, a non-jury trial was held with respect to the claim against Hildreth individually. The contracts, shown to be between Tidewater and \u201cHCE, Inc.\u201d were stipulated, as were the amounts alleged to be due under those contracts. It was agreed that HCE, Inc. was lawfully incorporated in New Jersey and that it eventually registered to do business in Maryland in September, 1999, under the name HCE of New Jersey, Inc., and it was also agreed that Hildreth did not sign any of the contracts with Tidewater. Tidewater\u2019s theory of personal liability was that Hildreth was essentially an agent acting for an undisclosed principal \u2014 that he represented that he was acting for \u201cHCE, Inc.\u201d but that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>was not, in fact, acting for that corporation because he had no authority to do so, and that he never disclosed that his real principal was the New Jersey corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Relying on <em>Hill v. County Concrete, </em>108 Md.App. 527, 672 A.2d 667 (1996), the Circuit Court credited that argument. The court found that Hildreth knew that there was a Maryland corporation known as HCE, Inc. and that he had no right to do business here under that name, but that Tidewater did not know there was another HCE, Inc. or that the company operated by Hildreth was a New Jersey corporation. The court concluded that \u201c[t]he existence of a de jure Maryland corporation with the name HCE, Inc., means John Hildreth did not fully disclose his principal, HCE, Inc., to be a New Jersey corporation, nor did he partially disclose his principal.\u201d It found further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">\u201cAs to Tidewater, the identity of the principal was not disclosed and after the notices to John Hildreth from Mr. Boyce at HCE, Inc. of Maryland and the letter from his attorney in January, 1998, his continued use of HCE, Inc. was in bad faith. Consequently, John Hildreth is personally liable on the contract to Tidewater.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Upon that finding, the court entered judgment against Hildreth, personally, for the entire corporate debt, including interest and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Hildreth appealed, arguing that (1) officers and directors of a foreign <em>de jure </em>corporation are not personally liable for corporate debts solely because the corporation fails to qualify to do business in Maryland, (2) the trial court erred in finding Hildreth liable as an agent for an undisclosed to partially disclosed principal, and (3) Tidewater was estopped from denying the existence of HCE-NJ when that corporation was a <em>de jure </em>corporation and Tidewater knew that it was dealing with a corporation. The Court of Special Appeals agreed that Hildreth was not acting as an agent for an undisclosed or partially disclosed principal and could not be held liable on that basis \u2014 the only basis asserted by the trial court. The only thing that was not disclosed, the court pointed out, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>the fact that the corporation in question \u2014 HCE-NJ\u2014was a foreign corporation that had not registered to do business in Maryland. Tidewater knew that it was dealing with a corporation engaged in the construction \u2014 not the rent-a-toilet\u2014 business; it knew the actual name of the corporation and that it had offices not just in Maryland but in New Jersey and New York as well. The relationship was a contractual, not a fiduciary, one, and Hildreth therefore was under no duty to disclose HCE-NJ\u2019s status as an unregistered foreign corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The intermediate appellate court also concluded that, as a general rule, officers and directors of a valid foreign corporation are not personally liable on corporate debts merely because the corporation fails to register to do business in the forum State, but, relying on a New Hampshire case, <em>Zenane, Inc. v. Tofer, 127 </em>N.H. 366, 499 A.2d 1347 (1985), it held that the court <em>could </em>impose such liability \u201cwhen justice requires.\u201d Although acknowledging that \u201cthe traditional factors justifying veil piercing are not present here,\u201d the court determined that \u201cthis case nonetheless presents a situation in which the corporate form must be disregarded to \u2018enforce a paramount equity.\u2019 \u201d We granted <em>certiorari </em>to review that ruling. No cross-petition was filed challenging the intermediate appellate court\u2019s conclusion that personal liability could not rest on the Circuit Court\u2019s determination, that Hildreth was acting as an agent for an undisclosed or partially disclosed principal, so we shall not consider that question. The only issue before us is whether there was a basis for piercing the corporate veil of HCE-NJ and imposing personal liability for the corporate obligation on Hildreth.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In <em>Bart Arconti &amp; Sons v. Ames-Ennis, </em>275 Md. 295, 310, 340 A.2d 225, 234 (1975), after reviewing pronouncements in earlier cases and the then-accepted treatise on Maryland corporation law, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>\u201cAlthough a number of variations upon the same theme may be found, the most frequently enunciated rule in Maryland is that although the courts will, in a proper case, disregard the corporate entity and deal with substance rather than form, as though a corporation did not exist ... shareholders generally are not held individually liable for debts or obligations of a corporation except where it is necessary to prevent fraud or enforce a paramount equity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">That remains the law of Maryland. <em>Stein v. Smith, </em>358 Md. 670, 682, 751 A.2d 504, (2000) (\u201c[T]he corporate entity will be disregarded only when necessary to prevent fraud or to enforce a paramount equity.\u201d <em>(quoting Bart Arconti, </em>275 Md. at 312, 340 A.2d at 235)).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">As the Court of Special Appeals recognized, there was no allegation here of fraud on the part of either Hildreth or HCE NJ; nor was there any evidence or finding of fraud. Personal liability rested solely upon the notion of \u201cparamount equity,\u201d which, in that court\u2019s view, arose from a combination of the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">(1) Hildreth was the sole shareholder of HCE-NJ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-8\">(2) Hildreth was \u201cpersonally involved\u201d in the business transaction with Tidewater, which the court viewed as \u201cHil-dreth\u2019s dirty hands\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-9\">(3) Continuing to trade as HCE, Inc. with knowledge of the existence of a Maryland corporation of that name was evidence of bad faith on Hildreth\u2019s part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">(4) Contracts made by unregistered foreign corporations, though valid, nonetheless constitute \u201cillegal business transaction[s] on the part of the unregistered foreign corporation, for which that corporation and its agents, officers, directors, and shareholders may be penalized,\u201d which the court characterized as \u201c[t]he public policy against illegal business transactions\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-11\">(5) Maryland law precludes unregistered corporations doing business in Maryland from seeking relief in Maryland courts, which the court regarded as \u201c[t]he public policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>against unregistered corporations using Maryland courts to protect their illegal business transactions\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVM\">(6) The fact that HCE-NJ was registered after Tidewater\u2019s complaint was filed but was later forfeited in 2001 for failure to file a 2000 property return, which the court said \u201csuggests a conscious evasion of responsibility on the part of HCE-NJ and Hildreth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Although we have not heretofore given any generic definition of \u201cparamount equity\u201d in this context, it is abundantly clear from our actual holdings in cases where attempts were made to pierce a corporate veil \u2014 to hold stockholders personally liable for corporate obligations \u2014 that those circumstances, individually or in combination, do not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In a number of cases, including <em>Bart Arconti, </em>we made favorable reference to the synthesis supplied in the 1953 edition of Herbert Brume\u2019s work, Maryland Corporation Law and Practice, \u00a7 371, as to whem a corporate entity will be disregarded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\"><em>\u201cFirst. </em>Where the corporation is used <em>as a mere shield for the perpetration of a fraud, </em>the courts will disregard the fiction of separate corporate entity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-8\"><em>Second. </em>The courts may consider a corporation as unencumbered by the fiction of corporate entity and deal with substance rather than form as though the corporation did not exist, <em>in order to prevent evasion of legal obligations.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACr\"><em>Third. </em>Where the stockholders themselves, or a parent corporation owning the stock of a subsidiary corporation, <em>fail to observe the corporate entity, operating the business or dealing with the corporation\u2019s property as if it were their oum, </em>the courts will also disregard the corporate entity for the protection of third persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">There is nothing in this record that could possibly justify the first of these circumstances. As already noted, there is no claim, no evidence, and no finding that Hildreth used HCE-NJ as \u201ca mere shield for the perpetration of a fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>The third circumstance embodies what is sometimes called the \u201calter ego\u201d doctrine. Fletcher observes that the \u201calter ego\u201d doctrine has been applied \u201cwhere the corporate entity has been used as a subterfuge and to observe it would work an injustice,\u201d the rationale being that \u201cif the shareholders or the corporations themselves disregard the proper formalities of a corporation, then the law will do likewise as necessary to protect individual and corporate creditors.\u201d 1 William Meade Fletcher, Fletcher cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 41.10 at 574-76 (1999 Rev. Vol.). The doctrine, says Fletcher, is applied \u201cwith great caution and reluctance\u201d and only in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579-80. Courts will apply the doctrine when the plaintiff shows (1) \u201ccomplete domination, not only of the finances, but of policy and business practice in respect to the transaction so that the corporate entity as to this transaction had at the time no separate mind, will or existence of its own,\u201d (2) that \u201csuch control [was] used by the defendant to commit fraud or wrong, to perpetrate the violation of the statutory or other positive legal duty, or dishonest and unjust act in contravention of the plaintiffs legal rights,\u201d and (3) that such \u201ccontrol and breach of duty proximately caused the injury or unjust loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583-86. Because piercing the corporate veil is founded on equity, \u201cwhere no fraud is shown, the plaintiff must show that an inequitable result, involving fundamental unfairness, will result from a failure to disregard the corporate form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">Although there appears to be no universal rule as to the specific criteria that courts will consider in determining whether to apply the doctrine, Fletcher observes that some of the factors commonly considered, when dealing with a single corporation, are (1) whether the corporation is inadequately capitalized, fails to observe corporate formalities, fails to issue stock or pay dividends, or operates without a profit, (2) whether there is commingling of corporate and personal assets, (3) whether there are non-functioning officers or directors, (4) whether the corporation is insolvent at the time of the transaction, and (5) the absence of corporate records. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>\u00a7 41.30 at 625-28. These factors, occasionally articulated somewhat differently, have been applied in earlier Court of Special Appeals cases. <em>See Dixon v. Process Corp., </em>38 Md.App. 644, 653, 382 A.2d 893, 899 (1978); <em>Travel Committee v. Pan Am., </em>91 Md.App. 123, 158-59, 603 A.2d 1301, 1318-19 (1992); <em>Residential Warranty v. Bancroft, </em>126 Md.App. 294, 307, 728 A.2d 783, 789 (1999). <em>See also DeWitt Truck Brokers v. W. Ray Flemming Fruit Co., </em>540 F.2d 681 (4th Cir.1976), cited by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Travel Committee, </em>and <em>Iceland Telecom v. Information Systems and Net., </em>268 F.Supp.2d 585, 589-91 (D.Md.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">There is no support in this record for basing personal liability on the \u201calter ego\u201d doctrine. With respect to the more general factors mentioned by Fletcher, there is no evidence that Hildreth exercised such complete domination over HCE-NJ to warrant a conclusion that the corporation \u201chad no separate mind, will or existence of its own.\u201d There is no evidence that HCE-NJ was undercapitalized, that corporate formalities were not observed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the corporation operated \u25a0without a profit, that there were non-functioning officers or directors, that the company was insolvent when it entered into the arrangement with Tidewater, that there were no or inadequate corporate records. In part, this void in the record may well be due to the fact that Tidewater never sought in the trial court to establish liability on Hildreth\u2019s part by piercing the corporate veil of HCE-NJ, but argued only that Hildreth was acting as agent for an undisclosed or partially disclosed principal. As Hildreth legitimately complains, had the quest for personal liability on his part been premised on a piercing of the corporate veil, he might have supplied affirmative evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>negating these various factors, even though it was Tidewater\u2019s burden to prove their existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">What the record does show is that HCE-NJ was a valid, subsisting corporation which, until it suffered a reversal of fortunes, had substantial assets and business prospects. The relevant contracts, with the general contractor and with Tidewater, were in its name, and, indeed, the contracts with Tidewater were signed on its behalf not by Hildreth but by another employee. Although the conclusion is certainly warranted that Hildreth deliberately permitted HCE-NJ to operate in Maryland without benefit of registration and with knowledge of the existence of HCE-Md, there is no evidence that that conduct in any way influenced Tidewater to enter into the contractual arrangement from which this debt arose. Tidewater knew that it was dealing with a corporation, and it had satisfied itself that the corporation had substantial contracts and assets, that it had two business locations in the State, that it had numerous employees, and that it was not a \u201cone man show.\u201d Kolbe\u2019s assumption that HCE-NJ was a Maryland corporation did not come from anything Hildreth said. Indeed, much of the information apparently relied upon by Kolbe in agreeing to the contract came from Condin, not Hildreth.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">In sustaining liability on Hildreth\u2019s part, the Court of Special Appeals seemed to be applying the second in Brune\u2019s trilogy of circumstances, disregarding the corporate existence \u201cin order to prevent the evasion of legal obligations.\u201d That, in turn, appears to rest on Hildreth\u2019s failure to register the corporation and his decision to continue using the name HCE, Inc. after being advised of the existence of HCE-Md., which the appellate court treated not only as bad faith but the violation of public policy. Tidewater sees that set of circumstances as an independent basis for \u201cparamount equity,\u201d urging that \u201cparamount equity\u201d need not rest solely on the \u201calter ego\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">In <em>Bart Arconti, </em>we noted the \u201cappealing quality\u201d of the second (and third) of Brune\u2019s propositions, but also observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>that our cases have not given an expansive meaning to that proposition. <em>Bart Arconti, </em>itself, is a testament to the narrowness of that window. Bart Arconti &amp; Sons, Inc. (Arconti &amp; Sons) was a subcontractor on three construction projects and defaulted on each. The corporation, along with two allied corporations, was owned and controlled by two brothers, Bart and George Arconti. After the general contractor filed suit, the brothers allowed Arconti &amp; Sons to become dormant and placed all new business in the other two corporations. They allowed those corporations to use Arconti <em>&amp; </em>Sons assets without compensation and credited their personal indebtedness to Arconti &amp; Sons on loans from that company against salaries allegedly due them. The trial court found that the purpose of those activities was to evade legal obligations during the pendency of the action and had the effect of rendering Arconti &amp; Sons \u201call but insolvent.\u201d <em>Bart Arconti &amp; Sons, supra, </em>275 Md. at 305, 340 A.2d at 231. The court also found that the brothers, as dominant directors and sole stockholders, had \u201cpersonally directed their operations with only one purpose in mind, using the [other two corporations] to keep the subcontracting business of [Arconti &amp; Sons] but without leaving any real asset of [Arconti &amp; Sons] remaining in that corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Upon those findings, the trial court found reason to pierce the corporate veil of Arconti &amp; Sons and extend the ultimate judgment in favor of the general contractor against the brothers individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The brothers appealed, and we reversed, noting that we were unaware \u201cof any Maryland case where, on facts resembling those here, the Court has allowed the corporate entity to be disregarded merely because it wished to prevent an \u2018evasion of legal obligations\u2019 \u2014 absent evidence of fraud or similar conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311-12, 340 A.2d at 235. Though confirming that a corporate entity will be disregarded when necessary to prevent fraud or to enforce a paramount equity, we did not regard the conduct of the brothers as sufficient to establish a paramount equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">If the conduct in <em>Bart Arconti, </em>clearly designed to cause the corporation to evade a legal obligation, did not suffice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>justify disregarding the corporate entity, surely Hildreth\u2019s conduct here does not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That conduct may have subjected him to a $1,000 f\u00edne pursuant to \u00a7 7-302(b) of the Corporations and Associations Article; it would have served as well to preclude the corporation from filing suit in Maryland, <em>see </em>\u00a7 7-301; and it may have rendered him or HCE-NJ liable to HCE-Md. Section 7-305 makes clear, however, that the failure of a foreign corporation to comply with the registration requirements \u201cdoes not affect the validity of any contract to which the corporation is a party,\u201d and there is nothing in the registration statutes that permits a court to invade the corporate entity simply because of a failure to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">We do not regard Brune\u2019s second proposition as a separate basis for piercing a corporate veil. With its very limited scope, yet to be actually found in any Maryland case, it is, at best, subsumed, along with the \u201calter ego\u201d doctrine, in the notion of paramount equity, and has no application in this case. The record here reveals nothing more than the fact that a valid, subsisting corporation entered into a commercial contract and later became unable to satisfy its obligation under that contract. That is unfortunate, but it is not a basis for making someone else liable for the corporate debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Concerned that we may not agree with his argument under Maryland law, Hildreth presents the alternative argument that, as HCE-NJ was a New Jersey corporation, his liability as a stockholder of that corporation must be determined under New Jersey law. As we do agree with his primary argument, however, we need not reach that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">JUDGMENT OF COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE JUDGMENT OF CIR<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>CUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AGAINST PETITIONER; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-11\">. Hildreth maintained that HCE, Inc. did not begin to do business in Maryland until June, 1998. The Circuit Court found that it began business here in 1996 or 1997, and, for purposes of this appeal, Hildreth does not challenge that finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b780-6\">. The \"alter ego\u201d doctrine must, of course, take account of close corporation laws, which commonly allow close corporations to elect not to have a board of directors and to have the corporation run directly by the stockholders. <em>See, </em>for example, Maryland Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4-301 \u2014 4-303 of the Corporations and Associations Article; NJ. Stat. \u00a7 14A:5-21. The record does not indicate whether HCE-NJ had elected close corporation status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\">. There have been dozens of cases, some more than 100 years old, in which the Court has either sustained or reversed the piercing of corporate entities. The cases are largely fact-specific, and there is no profit to be gained in discussing them. The law was effectively enunciated in <em>Bart Arconti. See Starfish Condo. </em>v. <em>Yorkridge Serv., 295 </em>Md. 693, 458 A.2d 805 (1983) and <em>Antigua Condominium v.
