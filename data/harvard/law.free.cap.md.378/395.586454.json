The Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland has filed a Petition for Disciplinary Action against Patti Diane Gilman West and, by Order dated July 23, 2002, the matter was assigned to this Court to be heard and determined in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-757. The Respondent was served with the Writ of Summons, transmittal Order dated July 23, 2002, the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, and various discovery material on October 28, 2002. The matter came before this Court and a hearing was conducted on February 20, 2003. From that hearing the Court makes the following Conclusions of Law and Findings of Fact, each of which, the Court finds to have been established by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\n<em>Carter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">\u201cOn or about September 29, 1999, Maryland General Hospital and [name deleted], LWS, a social worker employee of the Hospital, were served with a copy of a Complaint filed against them by James Carter and others, <em>Carter, et al. v. Maryland General Hospital, </em>Case No. 24-C-99-00521, Circuit Court for Baltimore City. At the time of service, the Hospital and [social worker] were served with interrogatories, request for production of documents and notices to take depositions. In October 1999 Respondent was retained to represent both the Hospital and [social worker] in the negligence action filed on behalf of Carter and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u201cRespondent did not timely respond to interrogatories and request for production of documents in the <em>Carter </em>matter. On or about July 27, 2000 Carter\u2019s counsel filed a Motion to Compel Discovery to which Respondent failed to timely respond. By Order dated August 18, 2000, the Court in the <em>Carter </em>matter ordered that the employees of the Hospital named in the order appear for deposition and that the Hospital and [social worker] provide responses to Carter\u2019s discovery requests within thirty days of the date of that Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u201cRespondent did not take measures to effectuate her clients\u2019 compliance with that Order. On or about September 29, 2000, Carter filed a motion for judgment based on the noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u201cThe Court denied Carter\u2019s motion for judgment by Order dated November 6, 2000, and again ordered that the named employees of the Hospital appear for deposition, and that the Hospital and [social worker] provide responses to Carter\u2019s interrogatories and request for production of documents. The Court further ordered that failure to comply with discovery requests by the thirty-day deadline, without good cause, would result in a default judgment against the Hospital and [social worker].</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u201cRespondent failed to provide the discovery on behalf of the Hospital and [social worker] within thirty days of the Court\u2019s Order dated November 6, 2000. Carter filed a second motion for judgment on or about December 7, 2000. Respondent failed to respond and on January 19, 2001, the Court granted that Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\u201cRespondent also failed to effectuate her clients\u2019 compliance with the provision of the Scheduling Order requiring the designation of an expert witness on damages. Respondent\u2019s failure to effectuate compliance with the Court\u2019s Scheduling Order and two Orders responding to discovery requests left the Hospital with a judgment against it as to liability and no expert witness to defend against Carter\u2019s experts on damages. Respondent misrepresented the status of the case to the Hospital representatives. She also failed to advise them that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>she had not responded to discovery and that motions to compel and for judgment had also been filed. She failed to advise that default judgment had been granted and that she had not designated any damage expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u201cRespondent failed to provide competent representation to her clients in violation of Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1. Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.3. Respondent failed to keep her clients reasonably informed of the status of their case and to explain the status of the legal matter as reasonably necessary for the clients to make informed decisions in violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.4. Respondent knowingly misrepresented the status of the <em>Carter </em>matter to the hospital in violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(c). Respondent failed to expedite litigation in violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 3.2. Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 3.4(c)(d) by neglecting her obligation to take reasonably diligent efforts to comply with proper discovery requests under the scheduling order, the Maryland Rules of Procedure and Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. These actions are also violations of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(a), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\n<em>Davis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u201cOn or about June 8, 1998, Bridgette Davis, mother and next friend of Desmond Davis, filed a complaint against [name deleted], M.D., [name deleted], M.D., P.A. and the Maryland General Hospital, <em>Davis, et at. v. Maryland General Hospital, </em>Case No. 24-C-98-159105/CC4926, Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Respondent was retained to represent the Hospital and filed an Answer to the Davis complaint on or about August 24,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u201cRespondent failed to timely identify a damage expert pursuant to the Scheduling Order. This failure caused significant prejudice to the Hospital\u2019s defense of the case. Respondent failed timely to communicate to the Hospital or its excess insurance carrier, OHIC (Ohio Hospital Insurance Company), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>a settlement offer from Davis\u2019 counsel dated July 5, 2000. Respondent conveyed the offer in December 2000. Respondent\u2019s failure necessitated that the Hospital and OHIO agree to an unfavorable settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u201cRespondent represented to the Court that she needed continuances in the <em>Davis </em>matter based on an incapacity which prevented her from defending the case. However, Respondent was practicing law in other matters during this time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u201cIn the course of her representation in <em>Davis, </em>Respondent (1) violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1 by her failure to competently pursue the legal matter entrusted to her; (2) Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.3 by failing to diligently and promptly pursue the legal matter; (3) Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.4 by failing to reasonably communicate with her client about the status of the legal matter; (4) Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 3.2 by failing to reasonably expedite the litigation consistent with her client\u2019s best interest; (5) Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 3.3(a)(1) by her knowing misrepresentation of the need for a continuance; (6) Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 3.4(c)(d) by knowingly disobeying the obligation to provide discovery and identify expert witnesses; and (7) Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(a), (c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\n<em>Lewis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u201cOn or about November 16, 1998, Mary Lewis filed a Complaint on her own behalf and on behalf of Lakriasha M. Lewis-Dixon, Case No. 98-320105/CC10009, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City naming one of Maryland General Hospital\u2019s physicians, [name deleted], as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u201cRespondent was retained by the Hospital to represent [physician] and she filed an Answer on his behalf on December 21, 1998. On or about January 28, 1999, Respondent identified Dr. Robert Keehn as an expert who could certify that a meritorious defense existed. In August 2000, Lewis\u2019 counsel requested Respondent provide dates when Dr. Keehn could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>deposed. Respondent failed to respond to that request. Lewis\u2019 counsel served a notice of deposition of Dr. Keehn on Respondent for October 3, 2000. Neither Respondent nor Dr. Keehn appeared for the October 3, 2000 deposition. On or about October 10, 2000, Lewis\u2019 counsel filed a motion to compel discovery and for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u201cBy Order dated November 14, 2000, the Court granted Lewis\u2019 motion to compel discovery and for sanctions and ordered that Dr. Keehn be produced for deposition on or before November 30, 2000. The Order specified that noncompliance would result in Dr. Keehn being excluded as an expert. Respondent failed to produce Dr. Keehn for deposition and failed to request an extension of time. Dr. Keehn was precluded from testifying on behalf of [physician]. With no expert on the standard of care, the Hospital was forced to enter into a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u201cRespondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1,1.3, 3.2, 3.4(c)(d) and 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\n<em>Strong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\u201cOn or about January 5, 2000, Paul Strong filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City naming Maryland General Health Systems, Incorporated; Maryland General Hospital; [physician] and several of the Hospital\u2019s staff physicians as defendants, <em>Strong v. Maryland General </em>Hospital, Case. No. 24-C-00-000055. Respondent was retained to represent the Hospital and [physician] and she filed an Answer to the Strong complaint on March 9, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u201cOn or about January 25, 2000, Strong\u2019s counsel served a first request for production of documents on the Hospital and [physician]. Respondent failed to effectuate a timely response. On May 16, 2000 Strong\u2019s counsel served the Hospital and [physician] with Interrogatories and a Second Request for Production of Documents, to which Respondent failed to effectuate a timely response. Approximately ten months later, on January 24, 2001, a motion to compel and for sanctions was filed. Respondent failed to file an opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u201cBy Order dated February 25, 2001, the Hospital and [physician] were ordered to \u2018folly respond to [Strong\u2019s Interrogatories] and produce all documents responsive to [Strong\u2019s] document requests within fifteen days of [that] Order\u2019 and it was further ordered that if the Hospital and [physician] failed to respond to Strong\u2019s discovery requests within fifteen days of that Order, the Court would enter a default judgment upon subsequent pleadings. Respondent did not provide answers to interrogatories nor produce documents on behalf of the Hospital and [physician]. With its ability to defend the <em>Strong </em>matter substantially impaired, the Hospital was forced to settle.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s actions violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1,1.3,1.4, 3.2, 3.4(c)(d) and 8.4(a)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\n<em>Neal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u201cOn or about March 9, 2000, Samuel J. Neal, III filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City naming Maryland General Hospital as the defendant, <em>Neal v. Maryland General Hospital, </em>Case No. 24-C-00-001240. Respondent was retained to represent the Hospital in the Neal matter and filed an answer on or about May 12, 2000. On or about May 12, 2000, Neal\u2019s counsel served interrogatories and requests for production of documents on the Respondent as counsel for the Hospital. Respondent failed to effectuate her client\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u201cOn or about October 12, 2000, Neal\u2019s counsel filed a motion to compel and for sanctions to which Respondent did not respond. By Order dated November 14, 2000, the Court ordered that responses to Neal\u2019s discovery requests be produced within fifteen days of the date of that Order. On or about December 19, 2000, Neal\u2019s counsel filed a motion for default judgment because Respondent did not respond to the Order compelling answers to discovery. Respondent did not file an opposition to Neal\u2019s motion for default judgment. An Order of Default was signed on January 18, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\u201cRespondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1,1.3,1.4, 3.2, 3.4(c)(d), and 8.4(a)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\n<em>Stewart</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u201cOn or about August 8, 1994, Kenneth Stewart and others filed an action, <em>Stewart v. Frimpong, </em>Case No. 94220028/CL184410, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City naming as defendant [name deleted], an employee nurse-anesthetist of the Maryland General Hospital. The Hospital retained Respondent to represent [nurse-anesthetist]. Respondent obtained summary judgment in favor of [nurse-anesthetist] in 1995. Thereafter Stewart appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. That Court remanded the matter and eventually Stewart appealed to the Court of Special Appeals a second time. During the second appeal, Respondent failed to file a brief and failed to appear at oral argument. The Court of Special Appeals reversed the summary judgment and remanded for trial before the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The Hospital settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u201cRespondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1,1.3,1.4, 3.2, and 8.4(a)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\n<em>Koehler</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u201cOn or about October 25, 1999, Mark M. Koehler, Sr. and his wife filed a Complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City naming Maryland General Hospital as Defendant, <em>Koeh-ler v. Maryland General Hospital, </em>Case No. 24-C-99-005053. On or about November 15, 1999, the Hospital was served with a writ of summons, complaint, interrogatories, request for production of documents and a case civil information sheet. Respondent was retained to represent the Hospital and filed an answer on its behalf on December 7,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">\u201cRespondent failed to effectuate the Hospital\u2019s response to Koehler\u2019s interrogatories and request for production of document for over three months. Further, Respondent failed to respond to Koehler\u2019s counsel\u2019s numerous written and telephonic attempts to obtain the outstanding discovery. On or about February 29, 2000, Koehler\u2019s counsel filed a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>sanctions to which Respondent did not respond. On March 24, 2000, the Court entered an Order compelling the Hospital to respond to the outstanding discovery within fifteen days from the date of that Order. On or about April 18, 2000, Koehler\u2019s counsel moved for default judgment based on noncompliance with the Court\u2019s order. Respondent did not oppose Koehler\u2019s motion for default judgment and it was granted on May 15, 2000. A Revised Order granting default judgment was entered on June 7, 2000. Respondent moved to vacate that judgment. The motion to vacate was denied on July 14, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u201cWith no ability to defend the action, the Hospital was forced to settle. Koehler\u2019s counsel demanded $150,000.00. Respondent had failed to convey to the Hospital a prejudgment settlement demand from Koehler\u2019s counsel in the amount of $75,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u201cRespondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1,1.3,1.4, 3.2, 3.3(a)(1), 3.4(c)(d), 8.4(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\n<em>Matthews</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u201cOn or about September 30, 1999, Paul Matthews filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City naming Maryland General Hospital and several physicians including [name deleted] as Defendants, <em>Matthews v. Maryland General Hospital, et al., </em>Case No. 24-C-99-004642. Respondent was retained to represent the Hospital and [physician] and filed an answer to Matthews\u2019 complaint on October 26, 1999. Matthews\u2019 counsel served interrogatories and a request for production of documents on the Hospital and [physician]. Respondent failed to have the defendants provide complete responses to those discovery requests and failed to produce witnesses for depositions. Matthews\u2019 counsel filed a motion to compel discovery on April 14, 2000. Respondent failed to respond. On or about June 12, 2000, the Court granted Matthews\u2019 motion to compel and ordered the Hospital to provide the requested discovery within forty-five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u201cOn or about August 28, 2000, Matthews\u2019 counsel filed a motion for judgment by default based on the failure to comply with the Court\u2019s Order dated June 12, 2000 compelling discovery. The Court granted Matthews\u2019 motion for judgment by default, but granted the defendants fifteen days to provide the discovery before entry of judgment. Respondent failed to comply with the Court\u2019s Order and Matthews\u2019 counsel again filed for default judgment on December 7, 2000. Respondent filed an untimely opposition on February 23, 2001. The Court struck Respondent\u2019s untimely opposition on March 23, 2001, and subsequently entered a default judgment against the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u201cThe effect of the default was to preclude the Hospital from defending against Matthews\u2019 proof of liability or damages and from calling any expert witnesses in its defense. Respondent misrepresented to the Hospital the status of the <em>Matthews </em>matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u201cRespondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1,1.3,1.4, 3.2, 3.4(c)(d), and 8.4(a)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\n<em>Carter, Davis, Lewis, Strong, Neal, Stewart, Koehler and Matthews</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u201cThroughout Respondent\u2019s representation in the <em>Carter, Davis, Lewis, Strong, Neal, Stewart, Koehler, </em>and <em>Matthews </em>matters, representatives of Maryland General Hospital asked Respondent to provide written reports for the purpose of updating and advising the Hospital about litigation brought against it. Notwithstanding repeated requests, Respondent failed to provide written reports for the purpose of updating and advising the Hospital about litigation brought against it. Notwithstanding repeated requests, Respondent failed to provide the status reports for many months. Summaries of pending litigation were provided on or about December 15, 2000 and March 15, 2001. Those reports were misleading in that they did not reveal the pendency of motions for judgment and outstanding default orders. Further, Respondent failed to advise the Hospital in those cases that motions to compel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>and/or for sanctions were filed against it and its defendant representatives or doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u201cRespondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.4 and 8.4(c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\n<em>Hunter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u201cOn or about June 17, 1998, Kimberly Hunter and Arnold Lee filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County naming [physician], Maryland General Hospital, Dr. [name deleted] and Dr. [name deleted] as Defendants, <em>Hunter, et al. v. Maryland General Hospital, et al., </em>Case No. 03-C-98-006096. Respondent represented the Hospital, [physician] and [physician].</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u201cRespondent failed to reply to an Order in June 2000, requiring the Hospital to pay $4,500 in deposition costs. That failure resulted in a default motion being filed against the Hospital. Respondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1,1.3, 3.4(c) and 8.4(a)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\n<em>Disciplinary Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">\u201cPetitioner was notified of Respondent\u2019s alleged misconduct by complaint dated April 5, 2001, with numerous attachments. Respondent was notified of that complaint and directed to respond by letters dated May 8, 2001, May 29, 2001 and June 11, 2001. The complaint was updated by letter dated May 25, 2001. The updated complaint was forwarded to Respondent. Again, Petitioner sought her explanation and response to the complaint. Respondent failed to respond to the Office of Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">\u201cRespondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.1(b) and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">\n<em>Mitigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">\u201cRespondent has been a member of the Bar of Maryland for twenty-one years. During that time she practiced law without disciplinary incident and enjoyed good health. During this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>time she also taught at the University of Baltimore School of Law, the University of Maryland and MICPEL.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u201cIn approximately the Spring of 2000, Respondent was diagnosed with osteomyelitis. She also was faced with the serious prospect of loss of her leg. In June 2000, she traveled to Boston for treatment. She suffered complications from her treatment and was again hospitalized in September in Baltimore. During a trip to New York over Thanksgiving, Respondent was again hospitalized, this time on an emergency basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u201cThroughout her trying medical ordeal, the Respondent practiced law. Perhaps bravely, but, as is now apparent, misguidedly, Respondent continued her practice without adjusting for her medical condition. She refused help from her colleague and denied an inability to handle her legal practice. While not admitting to the violations of professional conduct with which she was charged, Respondent expressed remorse that \u2018things had slipped through the cracks\u2019 and opined that when she was ill, she should have done things differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u201cRespondent has violated Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1; 1.3; 1.4; 3.2; 3.3(a)(1); 3.4(c)(d); 8.4(a), (c), (d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Neither party excepts to any findings of fact or conclusions of law.

Bar Counsel recommends disbarment. Bar Counsel highlights \u201cdeceit on the part of the respondent that misled her clients into a false sense of security that ultimately resulted in their inability to defend themselves against liability, against damages, and ultimately resulted in serious financial losses as well as a taint upon individual professional reputations.\u201d Bar Counsel contends that, despite respondent\u2019s lack of prior misconduct, disbarment is appropriate because of the substantial number of complaints, the egregious nature of respondent\u2019s violations, and the harm resulting from those violations. Although petitioner concedes that the hearing judge determined that respondent\u2019s osteomyelitis and several hospitalizations were mitigating factors, petitioner argues that such diagnosis was unsubstantiated hearsay and witnesses testified that respondent never expressed to others that she suffered from any conditions that limited her ability to represent her clients.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Before this Court, Respondent recommends that she be permitted to continue to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Bar Counsel has the burden of establishing the allegations by clear and convincing evidence. Md. Rule 16-757(b). Respondent has the burden of proving the existence of miti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>gating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>On review, we keep in mind that the findings of the trial judge are <em>prima facie </em>correct and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. <em>Garfield, </em>369 Md. at 97, 797 A.2d at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The purpose of sanctioning an attorney is to protect the public rather than to punish the errant attorney. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 474, 800 A.2d 782, 789 (2002). Attorney disciplinary proceedings also are aimed at deterring other attorneys from committing violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 474-75, 800 A.2d at 789. The severity of the sanction depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case, including consideration of any mitigating factors or aggravating factors. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Angst, </em>369 Md. 404, 416-18, 800 A.2d 747, 755 (2002). On occasion, in considering the appropriate sanction to be imposed, we have referred to the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Santos, </em>370 Md. 77, 88, 803 A.2d 505, 511 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 28, 741 A.2d 1143, 1158 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 484, 671 A.2d 463, 480 (1996). The Standards set out a framework for consideration of discipline matters, providing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">(1) What ethical duty did the lawyer violate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">(2) What was the lawyer\u2019s mental state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">(3) What was the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">(4) Are there any aggravating or mitigating circumstances? <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>See </em>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, <em>reprinted in </em>ABA Compendium of Professional Responsibility Rules and Standards, 338-39, 344 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We first address the duty violated by respondent and respondent\u2019s mental state at the time of the misconduct. Respondent does not deny the misconduct in this case. In addition to her lack of competency, lack of diligence, and failure to communicate with clients, she lacked candor toward the Circuit Court and initially failed to cooperate with Bar Counsel. Respondent\u2019s conduct was not an isolated incident, but was a pattern of misconduct. In considering respondent\u2019s mental state, we note that all of the conduct which is the subject of these proceedings occurred while respondent was ill and was under treatment for osteomyelitis. The hearing judge found that throughout respondent\u2019s illness, she practiced law, \u201c[pjerhaps bravely, but, as is now apparent, misguidedly ... without adjusting for her medical condition.\u201d Respondent did not have a dishonest motive. Nonetheless, her client, the Hospital, and the individual physicians were injured by her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Next, we consider whether there are any aggravating or mitigating factors. The main aggravating factor in this case is respondent\u2019s misrepresentations to her client that led the client into a false sense of security, ultimately resulting in the client\u2019s inability to present a proper defense against liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We have found that mitigation includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">\u201cabsence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thompson, </em>367 Md. 315, 330, 786 A.2d 763, 772-73 (2001) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jaseb, </em>364 Md. 464, 481-82, 773 A.2d 516, 526 (2001) (quoting <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 488-89, 671 A.2d at 483 (citations omitted))).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">In mitigation, respondent was admitted to the Bar of this Court on May 25, 1982. She has had no prior offenses. She has been a respected adjunct faculty member at the University of Baltimore Law School, a lecturer for MICPEL, a faculty member at the University of Maryland Medical School, and has served on many committees of the Maryland State Bar Association. All of her misconduct occurred during the period of her illness. She had no dishonest motive. Respondent has expressed remorse and, as she has her illness under control, is unlikely to reoffend. \u201cAs to the repetition of violative conduct, we have held that an attorney\u2019s voluntary termination of the charged misconduct, when accompanied by an appreciation of the serious impropriety of that past conduct and remorse for it, may be evidence that the attorney will no longer engage in such misconduct.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Seiden, </em>373 Md. 409, 422-23, 818 A.2d 1108, 1116 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In addition to the presence of aggravating and mitigating factors, we consider our prior cases. We have noted that \u201ca less severe sanction than that ordinarily dictated may be appropriate when an attorney is able to establish the existence of compelling extenuating circumstances.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kenney, </em>339 Md. 578, 588, 664 A.2d 854, 858 (1995). At the same time, in attorney grievance cases involving \u201cintentional dishonesty, misappropriation ..., fraud, stealing, serious criminal conduct and the like,\u201d we have held that disbarment is warranted absent \u201canything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions, arising from any source that is the \u2018root cause\u2019 of the misconduct <em>and </em>that also result in an attorney\u2019s utter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and with the MRPC.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 413-14, 773 A.2d 463, 485 (2001) (citing <em>Kenney, </em>339 Md. at 594, 664 A.2d at 862).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Client neglect is a very serious violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct and of the duty owed to the client. Persistent neglect may be grounds for disbarment. <em>See, e.g., Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 347 A.2d 556 (1975). We noted there, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">\u2018Where an attorney has been shown to have been negligent, or inattentive to his client\u2019s interests, or to have exhibited a lack of professional competency in the handling of a client\u2019s affairs, in violation of the canons or of a statute, the imposition of some disciplinary sanction against him may be warranted; the extent of the discipline to be applied, however, is generally dependent upon the severity of the conduct and the particular facts and circumstances surrounding it. In determining the degree of discipline to be imposed for such conduct, it has been held proper not only to consider such circumstances as might mitigate or extenuate the offense, but also proper to consider the attorney\u2019s prior history of misconduct and any antecedent sanctions which may have been imposed. <em>See </em>Annot. 96 A.L.R.2d 823, 828-29, 853, <em>supra. Cf. Bar Assoc. of Balto. City v. Dearing, </em>274 Md. 66, 332 A.2d 649 (1975) (where neglect, without any prior history of misconduct, was found to be grounds for a one-year suspension.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 362, 347 A.2d at 561. In cases involving client neglect, we have considered the presence of aggravating and mitigating factors and imposed sanctions in accordance with the circumstances. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Manning, </em>318 Md. 697, 704-05, 569 A.2d 1250, 1253-54 (1990) (disbarring an attorney for \u201cwillful and flagrant neglect\u201d of his clients\u2019 affairs over a more than two-year period, where the attorney had a prior record and there were no mitigating circumstances); <em>Garfield, </em>369 Md. at 107, 797 A.2d at 769-70 (imposing an indefinite suspension with a right to reapply after thirty days on an attorney with a drug addiction whose \u201cprofessional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>lapses\u201d resulted in the dismissal or barring of seven cases); and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. </em>Tolar, 357 Md. 569, 585, 745 A.2d 1045, 1053-54 (2000) (noting the attorney\u2019s remorse for her misconduct and holding that a public reprimand would \u201cserve the purpose of protecting the public just as well as a short suspension\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">It is helpful to consider <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Finnesey, </em>283 Md. 541, 391 A.2d 434 (1978), a case involving an attorney\u2019s neglect and misrepresentations to his client. In <em>Finnesey, </em>the attorney falsely advised his client that a petition had been filed and misrepresented to the client that at least three different dates had been set for a hearing on the petition. Ultimately, the client retained new counsel and suffered no monetary loss. After a disciplinary hearing, the panel found that the attorney \u201cwas dilatory in performing his duties and sought to cover up his neglect by assuring the client that everything possible had been done to perfect her claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 391 A.2d at 436. The panel determined that \u201c[s]uch conduct falls somewhat short of dishonesty, fraud, and deceit which three require a debased morality coupled with an intention to injure another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545, 391 A.2d at 436. We adopted the opinion that the attorney in that case should not be disbarred. <em>Id. </em>at 547, 391 A.2d at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In the case at bar, respondent\u2019s violation of Rule 8.4(c) (conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation) closely resembles the attorney\u2019s conduct in <em>Finnesey</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Respondent misrepresented to one client, the Hospital, the status of her cases in order to cover up her neglect. In one of her cases, respondent misrepresented to the court her need for continuances. Respondent\u2019s conduct is a most serious transgression. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lane, </em>367 Md. 633, 647-48, 790 A.2d 621, 629 (2002) (finding the gravamen of the ease to be the attorney\u2019s pattern of \u201ccontinued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>deceitful misrepresentations of the most egregious nature,\u201d finding no mitigation for this pattern, and ordering disbarment); <em>see also Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 418, 773 A.2d at 488 (ordering disbarment where an attorney stole money from an employer and stating that \u201c[disbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harrington, </em>367 Md. 36, 51, 785 A.2d 1260, 1268-69 (2001) (notwithstanding absence of mitigating factors, indefinite suspension imposed, where attorney misrepresented case status to client and failed to cooperate with the Attorney Grievance Commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Petitioner relies on <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 793 A.2d 535 (2002), as support for its contention that respondent\u2019s behavior merits the ultimate sanction of disbarment. In <em>Wallace, </em>the hearing judge found by clear and convincing evidence that the attorney had violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a), 1.15(a) and (b), 1.16(a)(2) and (d), 3.2, 8.1(b), and 8.4(c) and (d). Six complaints formed the basis for the Petition for Disciplinary Action filed in that case. In addition to neglecting client matters, failing to communicate with his clients, and making misrepresentations to his clients \u2014 transgressions of which respondent in the case <em>sub judice </em>is also culpable, the attorney charged unreasonable fees, failed to account for and return monies, and failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s numerous inquiries and a subpoena. The attorney appeared for neither the evidentiary hearing nor oral argument before this Court. Most significant is that the hearing judge and this Court found no mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The primary distinction between <em>Wallace </em>and the instant case is the lack of mitigating factors in the former case. In addition, the attorney in <em>Wallace </em>committed violations over a more than two-year period, whereas respondent\u2019s actions in this case roughly corresponded with the onset and duration of her physical illness and medical treatments over approximately a one-year period. Finally, respondent has expressed remorse for her behavior, in contrast to the attorney in <em>Wallace </em>whose failure to appear before either the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>judge or this Court evidenced a blatant disregard toward the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">In cases where the attorney suffered from a serious physical or mental illness, we rarely impose the ultimate sanction of disbarment absent misappropriation of funds. The weight we accord to a physical or mental illness depends in part on whether the condition was causally related to the attorney\u2019s misconduct and the seriousness of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Murray, </em>301 Md. 506, 483 A.2d 772 (1984), the attorney, who was suffering from a physical illness, unaccompanied by any mental illness, neglected client affairs and made misrepresentations to one of his clients. His illness consisted of arterial sclerosis in his legs which prevented him from walking and required hospitalization and an operation. <em>Id. </em>at 509, 483 A.2d at 773. Considering the severity of the attorney\u2019s health problems, which spanned more than a one-year period, we imposed a public reprimand, even though the attorney had previously received two private reprimands for neglect of client affairs and related misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 513-14, 483 A.2d at 775-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Willcher, </em>287 Md. 74, 411 A.2d 83 (1980), the attorney, who suffered from manic depression and hypothyroidism, acted incompetently, neglected a legal matter, and handled a legal matter without adequate preparation. The attorney did not engage in dishonest behavior, although at the time of the hearing he was suspended from the practice of law for sixty days for misrepresentation to a client and unjustified retention of a retainer. <em>Id. </em>at 79, 411 A.2d at 86. We ordered an indefinite suspension after accepting the hearing judge\u2019s finding that the attorney\u2019s behavior was not entirely due to illness. <em>Id. </em>at 79-80, 411 A.2d at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">We also ordered an indefinite suspension in <em>Santos, </em>370 Md. 77, 803 A.2d 505, where the attorney neglected legal matters and misappropriated client funds. The hearing judge found that the attorney\u2019s neglect \u201cwas exacerbated by undiagnosed physical and mental health problems,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 84, 803 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>509, and failed to affirmatively find a violation of Rule 8.4(c) (conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), <em>id. </em>at 81, 803 A.2d at 507. In rejecting a sanction of disbarment, we placed significance on the hearing judge\u2019s characterization of the attorney\u2019s conduct in failing to return unearned fees as \u201cneglect,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 87-88, 803 A.2d at 511, and also noted that the attorney cooperated with the investigation, accepted responsibility for his actions, and had no disciplinary record, <em>id. </em>at 84-87, 803 A.2d at 509-510.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Considering all of the circumstances in this case, we conclude that the appropriate sanction to be imposed is an indefinite suspension. Although respondent\u2019s misconduct was serious and the client suffered harm, respondent\u2019s conduct occurred when she was suffering from a serious physical illness which appears to be causally connected to her misconduct. Moreover, there was no misappropriation of funds involved in the present case. As we have indicated, the purposes of discipline are to protect the public and to deter similar conduct by other lawyers. Having considered respondent\u2019s misconduct, the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and our prior cases, the appropriate sanction is an indefinite suspension from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761(B), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST PATTI DIANE GILMAN WEST.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">BELL, C.J., CATHELL and HARRELL, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-12\">.

Both provisions state that a lawyer shall not engage in \"conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b462-7\">HARRELL, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak_\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The majority generously finds that \u201crespondent\u2019s conduct occurred when she was suffering from a serious physical illness which appears to be causally connected to her misconduct.\u201d (Majority (Maj.) op. at 418). In this regard, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>majority oversteps the boundaries of the Court\u2019s role in this case. \u201cThe hearing court\u2019s findings of fact are prima facie correct and will not be disturbed unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 288, 793 A.2d 535, 542 (2002). Judge Allison, the hearing judge, in her findings of fact, did not find that Respondent\u2019s actions were caused by her illness. Rather, Judge Allison quite clearly rejected Respondent\u2019s battle with osteomyelitis as a legal cause or mitigating factor with regard to the many and serious professional lapses proven in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">Throughout her trying medical ordeal, the Respondent practiced law. Perhaps bravely, but, as is now apparent, misguidedly, Respondent continued her practice \"without adjusting for her medical condition. She refused help from her colleague and denied an inability to handle her legal practice. While not admitting to the violations of professional conduct with which she was charged, Respondent expressed remorse that \u2018things had slipped through the cracks\u2019 and opined that when she was ill, she should have done things differently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><em>Id. </em>(Maj. op. at 409). West filed no exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We recently held that exculpatory factors \u201ccause\u201d misconduct only when they alter the mental state of an attorney to a degree that excuses the conduct. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 413-14, 773 A.2d 463, 485 (2001). Nothing in the record indicates that Respondent\u2019s illness affected her mental condition or her judgment beyond that of the predictable stress any human being facing a serious medical condition experiences. While naturally one must sympathize with the difficult medical situation West confronted, stress alone does not mitigate the exceedingly poor judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>demonstrated by her consistent pattern, over several months, of neglect of her duties to the court and to her clients, exacerbated by her lying to cover up her failures. Disbarment is the appropriate sanction for this type of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">West engaged in a consistent pattern of conduct that included \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d MRPC 8.4(c). It is well settled that \u201c[disbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Cafferty, </em>376 Md. 700, 720, 831 A.2d 1042, 1054 (2003). The majority in the present case concedes that, \u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct is a most serious transgression,\u201d yet fails to note that that conduct constituted a pattern of serious deceitful conduct over an extensive period of time. (Maj. op. at 415). The hearing judge found that West, for more than six months, violated Rule 8.4(c) in the course of her representation of her clients in eight separate matters. West produced misleading reports for her clients and concealed the status of cases from her clients. In addition, she concealed her medical condition from her partners, opposing parties, and the various courts before which she practiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Even beyond her dishonesty, West\u2019s pattern of extreme neglect caused her clients serious harm. \u201c[Wjillful and flagrant neglect of a client\u2019s affairs is, in and of itself, the kind of misconduct by an attorney which can lead to disbarment.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 291, 793 A.2d 535, 544 (2002) (quoting <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Manning, </em>318 Md. 697, 704, 569 A.2d 1250, 1253 (1990)). West essentially abandoned clients in nine matters for several months and consistently lied about her actions, thus preventing her clients from learning the scope of her neglect or from taking timely remedial measures. As a result of her failure to perform even her most basic professional duties and her concealment of that failure, orders of default were entered in at least four cases, leading to at least three default judgments against her clients. Further, West\u2019s clients were barred from presenting certain expert witnesses at trial on at least two occasions and were forced into settlements in at least five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>cases. Two of those settlements, in the <em>Davis </em>matter and in the <em>Koehler </em>matter, were particularly unfavorable insofar as they were more expensive for her clients than settlement offers that she previously failed to forward to them for consideration. When all of the misconduct is itemized, the hearing judge found that West committed seventy-four separate violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Perhaps the most serious damage caused by West\u2019s deceit and inexcusable neglect was to the reputations of her clients. West represented Maryland General Hospital and several individual health care professionals, including doctors, who worked at the Hospital. As a result of West\u2019s actions, her clients either effectively were prevented from presenting a defense or had their defenses substantially undercut in at least nine professional malpractice actions. The settlements and default judgments against the medical personnel and the Hospital will stain their records and reputations for years to come. West quite likely could have prevented these losses had she disclosed her condition and asked for assistance from her law firm colleagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">As noted above, the normal sanction for client neglect of this scale is disbarment. In <em>Wallace </em>we disbarred an attorney who, in six separate cases, committed similar acts of neglect and misrepresentation as West in the nine matters described in the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact in this case. Wallace failed to file required documents with the courts hearing five of his cases. 368 Md. at 282-88, 793 A.2d at 538-42. Three complaints Wallace filed were dismissed for failure to prosecute. <em>Id. </em>Wallace failed to inform his clients that those three cases were dismissed. <em>Id. </em>The Court also found that Wallace made misrepresentations regarding the status of his cases and that he failed to return in a timely manner fees owed to his clients. <em>Id. </em>We concluded in <em>Wallace </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">The record in the case at bar does not indicate that respondent has received any previous reprimands or sanctions from this Court; nevertheless, the volume and severity of the complaints against respondent lead us to conclude that the appropriate sanction against respondent is disbarment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Respondent has engaged in a pattern of conduct that only the most severe sanction of disbarment will provide the protection to the public that this procedure is supposed to provide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">368 Md. at 293, 793 A.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Given the lack of exceptions by West to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, the only issue before us is the appropriate sanction to impose. The majority claims that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">In cases where the attorney suffered from a serious physical or mental illness, we rarely impose the ultimate sanction of disbarment absent misappropriation of funds. The weight we accord to a physical or mental illness depends in part on whether the condition was causally related to the attorney\u2019s misconduct and the seriousness of the charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">(Maj. op. at 417). This is an inaccurate representation of our cases generally and, most certainly, of our recent cases. As the majority points out, the purpose of sanctioning attorneys is to protect the public and establish standards of acceptable versus unacceptable conduct for the legal profession, rather than to punish the particular errant attorney in a given case. <em>Id. </em>at 411. The mere fact that an attorney \u201csuffered from a serious physical or mental illness\u201d is not dispositive; we only have found illness to be a mitigating factor where it <em>caused </em>the misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">As admitted in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001), our prior responses to potentially mitigating factors involving a respondent\u2019s mental and physical health at the time of misconduct were somewhat inconsistent. 364 Md. at 405-07, 773 A.2d at 480-81. In <em>Vanderlinde, </em>however, we attempted to set a single standard for future consideration of such mitigation arguments in \u201ccases of intentional dishonesty, misappropriation cases, fraud, stealing, serious criminal conduct and the like[J\u201d 364 Md. at 413, 773 A.2d at 485. In such cases, as Judge Cathell wrote for us,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">we will not accept, as \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances,\u201d anything less than the most serious and utterly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>debilitating mental or physical health conditions, arising from any source that is the \u201croot cause\u201d of the misconduct and <em>that also result in an attorney\u2019s utter inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and with the MRPC. </em>Only if the circumstances are that compelling, will we even consider imposing less than the most severe sanction of disbarment</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">364 Md. at 413-14, 773 A.2d at 485 (emphasis added). It was our intention in <em>Vanderlinde </em>to sweep behind us inconsistent prior cases related to consideration of such mitigating factors, at least insofar as the misconduct in the particular case involved \u201cdishonesty, stealing, intentional misappropriation, fraud, serious criminal offenses, and the like.\u201d 364 Md. at 414, 773 A.2d at 485-86. West violated rule 8.4(c) and engaged in other dishonest acts. Therefore, we should adhere to the <em>Vanderlinde </em>standard in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In this case, the osteomyelitis that West claims as a mitigating factor is a painful bone infection that normally does not affect the mind directly. The Merck Manual 1343-46 (16th ed.1992). As such, osteomyelitis is not the kind of physical health condition that would cause West\u2019s utter inability to conform her conduct in accordance with the law and with the MRPC, and it should not be treated as a mitigating factor to reduce the ordinary sanction for the scale and type of misconduct demonstrated by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Our purpose in <em>Vanderlinde </em>was to terminate a perpetuation of the sometimes conflicting applications in our prior cases. Yet, a scant two years later, the majority here regresses to 1978 and invigorates <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Finne-sey, </em>283 Md. 541, 391 A.2d 434 (1978), which it claims \u201cclosely resembles the attorney\u2019s conduct\u201d in this case. (Maj. op. at 415). <em>Finnesey </em>involved an attorney\u2019s misconduct in a single case where the client \u201csuffered no monetary loss.\u201d 283 Md. at 546, 391 A.2d at 436. By comparison, West appears to have cost her clients many thousands of dollars.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Of the pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Vanderlinde </em>cases, a closer match is <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Short, </em>303 Md. 317, 493 A.2d 362 (1985), where we found that an attorney\u2019s heart attack and financial difficulties did not excuse misappropriation of funds. Where the attorney in <em>Finnesey </em>\u201cattributed his neglect of Mrs. Bentley\u2019s case on mental depression brought about by personal financial reverses,\u201d <em>Finnesey, </em>283 Md. at 545, 391 A.2d at 436, the attorney in <em>Short </em>attributed his misconduct to a physical ailment similar to the one West suffered. <em>Short, </em>303 Md. at 319, 493 A.2d at 362-63. The more important point, however, is that our <em>pre-Vanderlinde </em>cases were so inconsistent that a case can be found to bootstrap just about any desired result. That is the haven resorted to by the majority here.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The argument that osteomyelitis \u201ccaused\u201d West to engage in her pattern of neglect and deceit is a strained one at best. I suspect other members of the Maryland Bar, whether in solo, small firm, medium size firm, or large firm practice, deal constructively and positively, day-in and day-out, with serious illness as it impacts on their pursuit of their law practices. Osteomyelitis very well may have caused West to be unable physically to perform her duties to the court and to her clients. If that was the case, she should have informed the courts, clients, and attorneys with whom she worked that she could no longer, or for a time, manage her caseload. The record reflects that West unilaterally rejected the notion of seeking help from her colleagues and that she hid her condition from those with which she came into contact. The misconduct in this case was caused by exceedingly poor judgment, not osteomyelitis. I would find that West\u2019s misconduct neither was caused by osteomyelitis nor mitigated sufficiently by her illness. Therefore, I would mete out the usual sanction of disbarment for misconduct of the scale and type in which she engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge CATHELL have authorized me to state that they join in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\">. Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A), governing disposition of an attorney disciplinary case on review by this Court, provides: \u201cIf no exceptions are filed, the Court may treat the findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions, if any.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">. She may have cost her clients $75,000 in just the <em>Koehler </em>matter.

After a default judgment as to liability was taken, the client settled the matter for $150,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
