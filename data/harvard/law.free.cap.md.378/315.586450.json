In December of 1999, Minh-Vu Hoang, respondent, filed a complaint in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Montgomery County, against Ho and Lisa Pak, petitioners, seeking $25,000.00 in damages for a breach of lease. Petitioners were tenants in a townhouse owned by respondent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Petitioners prayed a jury trial and the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Petitioners then filed counterclaims alleging that respondent had breached the lease and had not returned their security deposit in violation of the Maryland Security Deposit Act, Md.Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-203 of the Real Property Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In July of 2000, the Circuit Court granted petitioners\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment, dismissed with prejudice respondent\u2019s claim and entered judgment against respondent as to petitioners\u2019 counterclaims. On October 31, 2000, after a dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ages hearing, the Circuit Court entered a judgment of $7,378.91 in favor of petitioners. This sum included petitioners\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees up to that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Petitioners then filed post-judgment discovery motions in an effort to aid in their recovery of the judgment against respondent, to which there was no response. Petitioners then filed a Motion to Compel Answers to Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents in Aid of Execution. In an order dated May 23, 2001, the Circuit Court granted the motion. Petitioners thereafter filed a Petition for Civil Contempt and for the Entry of Appropriate Relief on July 23, 2001, in response to respondent\u2019s failure to comply with the Circuit Court\u2019s May 23rd order. Following a September 20, 2001 hearing, the Circuit Court entered another order directing respondent to fully and completely respond to the interrogatories and request for documents. A compliance review hearing was set for October 29, 2001. After respondent failed to appear at the October 29th hearing, the Circuit Court issued a writ of body attachment for respondent\u2019s arrest. Respondent was arrested and released on her own recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">On December 6, 2001, there was a hearing in the Circuit Court on petitioners\u2019 Petition for Civil Contempt. The court found respondent in civil contempt and sanctioned respondent with 30 days of incarceration subject to a purge provision, <em>ie., </em>respondent could purge the contempt with her complete compliance with the court\u2019s order regarding petitioners\u2019 Motion to Compel Answers to Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents in Aid of Execution. The Court set a compliance hearing for January 14, 2002. On December 6, 2001, petitioners filed a Motion for Supplemental Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees from respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Respondent paid the original judgment and all interest then due on January 11, 2002, one business day before the compliance hearing was to take place, by delivering a check to petitioners\u2019 counsel. At the January 14th hearing, the court noted that the supplemental attorney\u2019s fees motion was outstanding and set a final hearing on that motion for February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>15, 2002. The Circuit Court denied petitioners\u2019 Motion for a Supplemental Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees and a final order was issued on August 23, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Petitioners appealed that decision to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion issued on January 21, 2003, affirmed the decision of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Petitioners then filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with this Court, and, on May 7, 2003, we granted the petition. <em>Pak v. Hoang, </em>374 Md. 358, 822 A.2d 1224 (2003). Petitioners present four questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">\u201cI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">Whether the Circuit Court has the authority to award supplemental attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the Maryland Rules where a judgment debtor has willfully violated court orders and has been found in contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">II.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">Whether the Circuit Court has the power to award supplemental attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to a court\u2019s inherent powers as recognized in <em>Klupt v. Krongard, </em>126 Md.App. 179, 728 A.2d 727 (1999).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-12\">Whether the Circuit Court has the authority to award supplemental attorney\u2019s fees incident to its contempt powers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-13\">IV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-14\">Whether the Circuit Court has the authority to award supplemental attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the Maryland Security Deposit Act, Maryland Code Real Estate, \u00a7 8-203, and to enforce a judgment entered pursuant to that Act.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>We answer petitioners\u2019 fourth question in the affirmative and hold that pursuant to the Maryland Security Deposit Act the Circuit Court has the authority to award attorney\u2019s fees earned in enforcing a judgment rendered under that statute and has the authority to award attorney\u2019s fees in respect to appeals defending any such judgment. Attorney\u2019s fees earned in the filing of post-judgment motions and appeals fit within \u00a7 8-203(e)(4)\u2019s phrase \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d of the remedial Maryland Security Deposit Act. The trial courts have discretion to award such fees. As we reverse on petitioners\u2019 fourth question, we need not address the remaining questions. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">I. The Trial Court\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">On February 15, 2002, at the hearing on petitioners\u2019 Motion for Supplemental Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">\u201cI think that [respondent\u2019s] conduct is reprehensible. I think that she really has done whatever she could to throw roadblocks in the way of the other side. I think that she has defied the orders of this court. She has done a lot of things that I take a very dim view of, and I think that she ought not get away with those things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">\u201cMy problem, however, is that this was a judgment which was entered against her. She did everything she could to avoid complying with the discovery to aid in the enforcement of that judgment, but ultimately she did pay the amount of that judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">\u201cThe contempt finding ... was a contempt finding with regard to the discovery that was intended to help enforce the judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">\u201cIt seems to me that once the amount of that judgment is paid, that the thrust of that \u2014 the contempt finding disappears.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u201cSo, as much as, in fairness, I would like to go ahead and impose a sanction for that contempt ... I don\u2019t think it would be enforceable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">\u201c... I wish there were a greater sanction than that that could be imposed on her. I don\u2019t feel that I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">\u201cThere is also a request that has been made for supplemental attorney\u2019s fees under the security deposit statute, and my reading of that statute is that the attorney\u2019s fees that were awarded at the time are really the only attorney\u2019s fees you can get.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">\u201c... I don\u2019t read the statute to say that you can go back and award supplemental attorney\u2019s fees later when you have difficulty enforcing the judgment that was entered the first time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">\u201cSo, I\u2019m not going to award supplemental attorney\u2019s fees, and I am not going to impose any part of the 30 days [jail sentence] which I believe Judge Rupp had imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\u201cI regret that I am not going to do either one of those things, because I think in fairness [respondent] probably deserves them, but I work within the statutes and the rules I have to work with and that is where I come out.\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">The determinative issue on review in this case is whether courts have the authority to award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the Maryland Security Deposit Act (the Act), specifically under \u00a7 8-203(e)(4), which are earned after a judgment has been rendered in the trial court and in pursuit of collection of that judgment. ' We hold that the remedial nature of the Maryland Security Deposit Act permits a trial court to award post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees under the Act in order to ensure full vindication of tenants\u2019 rights to recover security deposits owed to them as contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">When we interpret statutes, this Court has annunciated that the \u201c \u2018paramount goal ... is to identify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute at issue.\u2019 \u201c <em>Moore v. Miley, </em>372 Md. 663, 677, 814 A.2d 557, 566 (2003)(quoting <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000)). We may ascertain the legislative intent of a statute by analyzing its plain language and by considering its context within the statutory scheme as a whole. <em>Moore, </em>372 Md. at 677, 814 A.2d at 566; <em>see also In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 711, 782 A.2d 332, 346 (2001). Where \u201c \u2018the words of a statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning,\u2019 we \u2018will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore, </em>372 Md. at 677, 814 A.2d at 566 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204, 1206-07 (1994)). In discerning the legislative intent where the statutory language is ambiguous, however, we look beyond the statute\u2019s plain language. <em>Moore, </em>372 Md. at 677, 814 A.2d at 566; <em>see also In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 711, 782 A.2d at 346. If a statute\u2019s language is found to be ambiguous, then it is appropriate to analyze the legislative history and other relevant factors, such as \u201ca bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments ... and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal,\u201d which may reveal the intent or general purpose of the statute. <em>Moore, </em>372 Md. at 677, 814 A.2d at 566 (quoting <em>In re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. 51, 58, 763 A.2d 136, 140 (2000)(internal citation omitted)). The Court must be careful, however, to avoid a \u201c[construction of a statute which is unreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 417, 722 A.2d 887, 895 (1999) (alteration added) (quoting <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590, 594 (1992)); <em>see also Moore, </em>372 Md. at 677-78, 814 A.2d at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">B. Section 8-203(e)(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The specific statutory provision at issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>is Md.Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) of the Real Property Article, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201c(e) <em>Return of deposit to tenant; interest. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">(4) If the landlord, without a reasonable basis, fails to return any part of the security deposit, plus accrued interest, within 45 days after the termination of the tenancy, the tenant has an action of up to threefold of the withheld amount, plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The parties do not dispute that trial courts may require a landlord to pay the tenant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees incurred prior to and at trial; they agree that the statute is clear and unambiguous as to that point. The plain language of \u00a7 8-203(e)(4), however, is silent, and thus, it is asserted, ambiguous, as to whether post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees, <em>i.e., </em>fees for post-judgment discovery motions and appeals, come within the provision permitting the awarding of \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Petitioners urge this Court to broadly construe the phrase \u201cthe tenant has an action of up to threefold of the withheld amount, plus <em>reasonable attorney\u2019s fees \u201d </em>to include attorney\u2019s fees occurring after judgment has been rendered, <em>i.e., </em>post-judgment motions and appeals. Petitioners argue that such an interpretation serves the remedial purpose of the statute, while a contrary interpretation would frustrate that same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">While this Court has never addressed the alleged remedial nature of \u00a7 8-203(e)(4), we have defined what is meant by remedial in construing other statutes and rules. In <em>Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 408-09, 754 A.2d 389, 395-96 (2000), this Court stated the following, <em>inter alia, </em>in determining a statute to be remedial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">\u201c \u2018Generally, remedial statutes are those which provide a remedy, or improve or facilitate remedies already existing for the enforcement of rights and the redress of injuries. They also include statutes intended for the correction of defects, mistakes and omissions in the civil institutions and the administration of the state. The definition of a remedial statute has also been stated as a statute that relates to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>practice, procedure, or remedies and does not affect substantive or vested rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">\u201c \u2018Every statute that makes any change in the existing body of law, excluding only those enactments which merely restate or codify prior law, can be said to \u201cremedy\u201d some flaw in the prior law or some social evil.\u2019 [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">3 Norman J. Singer, <em>Sutherland\u2019s Statutory Construction, supra, </em>\u00a7 60.02, at 152; <em>see also </em>2 <em>id. </em>\u00a7 41.09, at 399 (\u2018The statutes which fall into this category [of remedial statutes] are ones that describe methods for enforcing, processing, administering, or determining rights, liabilities or status.\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201cThe appellate courts of this state have also defined remedial legislation. For instance, in <em>[State of Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Amecom Div. of Litton Sys., Inc., </em>278 Md. 120, 125, 360 A.2d 1, 5 (1976) ], we said that \u2018[a]n act is remedial in nature when it provides only for a new method of enforcement of a preexisting right.\u2019 (Citing <em>[Kelch v. Keehn, </em>183 Md. 140, 145, 36 A.2d 544, 545 (1944) ]; <em>Ireland v. Shipley, </em>165 Md. 90, 98, 166 A. 593 (1933)). \u2018Under Maryland law, statutes are remedial in nature if they are designed to correct existing law, to redress existing grievances and to introduce regulations conducive to the public good.\u2019 <em>Weathersby v. Kentucky Fried Chicken Nat\u2019l Management Co., </em>86 Md.App. 533, 550, 587 A.2d 569, 577 (1991) (citing <em>State v. Barnes, </em>273 Md. 195, 208, 328 A.2d 737, 745 (1974)), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>326 Md. 663, 607 A.2d 8 (1992).\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\"><em>See also Rawlings v. Rawlings, </em>362 Md. 535, 556-57, 766 A.2d 98, 110 (2001)(determining the retroactivity of the remedial rule, Maryland Rule 15-207(e) and quoting to Langston). We recognized the remedial nature of another section of the Residential Lease Subtitle of the Real Property Article in <em>Neal v. Fisher, </em>312 Md. 685, 541 A.2d 1314 (1988), where we interpreted \u00a7 8-211 of the Real Property Article, entitled, \u201cRepair of dangerous defects; rent escrow.\u201d We specifically recognized the remedial nature of \u00a7 8-21 l(n) due in part to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the fact that the Act provided \u201cremedies not available at common law.\u201d We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201cIn short, we have before us remedial legislation. When the legislature enacts a statute designed, as the Act is, to provide remedies not available at common law, it is not desirable that construction should be mindlessly guided by a slogan, such as \u2018statutes in derogation of the common law must be narrowly construed.\u2019 Statutes of this nature \u2018are remedial and designed to close a gap in the preexisting law____\u2019A court should not permit \u2018a narrow or grudging process of construction to exemplify and perpetuate the very evils to be remedied....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\"><em>Neal, </em>312 Md. at 693-94, 541 A.2d at 1318 (citations omitted). Section 8-203 serves a similar, remedial purpose \u2014 to provide tenants with a remedy not provided for under common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">We also have discussed the remedial nature of several other Maryland statutes. <em>See, inter alia, Livering v. Richardson\u2019 s Restaurant, </em>374 Md. 566, 574, 823 A.2d 687, 691 (2003)(Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act); <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 517-18, 819 A.2d 354, 364 (2003)(Wage and Hour Law); <em>Caffrey v. Dep\u2019t of Liquor Control for Montgomery County, </em>370 Md. 272, 306, 805 A.2d 268, 288 (2002)(Maryland Public Information Act); <em>Smith v. Borello, </em>370 Md. 227, 235, 804 A.2d 1151, 1155 (2002)(survival and wrongful death statutes); <em>Katsenelenbogen v. Katsenelenbogen, </em>365 Md. 122, 134, 775 A.2d 1249, 1256 (2001)(domestic abuse statute); <em>Coburn v. Coburn, </em>342 Md. 244, 252, 674 A.2d 951, 955 (1996)(domestic abuse statute). We have said that once we have determined that a statute is remedial in nature that it \u201c \u2018must be liberally construed ... in order to effectuate the [statute\u2019s] broad remedial purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caffrey, </em>370 Md. at 306, 805 A.2d at 288 (quoting <em>A.S. Abell Publg. Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068, 1071 (1983))(alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">The right of a tenant to sue a landlord for the return of a security deposit first appeared in its current form in Md.Code (1957, 1973 Repl.Vol.) Art. 21 \u00a7 8-213, <em>see </em>1973 Md. Laws, Chap. 2, and was recodified into the Real Property Article of the Maryland Code in 1974, <em>see </em>1974 Md. Laws, Chap. 12. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The statute itself, and the title clauses to the predecessor and current chapter laws, do not directly speak to the remedial nature of the provisions related to landlord-tenant security deposits. We therefore look to whether \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) \u201c \u2018provide^] a remedy, or improved] or facilitate^] remedies already existing for the enforcement of rights and the redress of injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Langston, </em>359 Md. at 408, 754 A.2d at 395 (alterations added)(internal citation omitted). Furthermore, we look to whether \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) provides for \u201c \u2018the correction of defects, mistakes and omissions in the civil institutions and the administration of the state\u2019 \u201d and whether \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) is \u201c \u2018a statute that relates to practice, procedure, or remedies and does not affect substantive or vested rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408-09, 754 A.2d at 395 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Section 8-203(e)(4) provides a remedy to tenants who believe that their landlord has improperly failed to return to them their security deposits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute sets out a clear procedure and time line for the return of security deposits; the landlord must return the deposit with interest within 45 days after the termination of the lease. In addition to compensating the tenants\u2019 direct injury, \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) provides for treble damages \u201cof up to threefold of the withheld amount.\u201d This punitive measure, although capped at three times the withheld amount, illustrates the Legislature\u2019s concern regarding the protection of tenants\u2019 rights and remedies against improper landlord actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">This inclusion of a treble damage clause recognizes the difficulties often encountered by tenants seeking the return of security deposits from landlords. Litigation arising under \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) applies only to residential leases. It generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>involves only relatively small sums of money in the context of other civil litigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 8 \u2014 203(b)(1) sets the maximum amount of a security deposit a landlord may charge as no more than \u201cthe equivalent of two months\u2019 rent per dwelling unit, regardless of the number of tenants.\u201d A landlord not returning a security deposit, when she is required to do so, forces the tenant to bring suit. The Legislature recognized that the results of tenants\u2019 cost-benefit analyses in respect to balancing the costs of litigation against the amount of recovery, might be an impediment to the rights of tenants to seek the return of their security deposits and could result in tenants not recovering monies rightfully owed to them. The statute\u2019s imposition of attorney\u2019s fees recognizes the problem and addresses it by allowing for an additional remedy for tenants. The remedy provided for by \u00a7 8 \u2014 203(e)(4) creates a procedure by which tenants can recover monies that are rightfully theirs; it is remedial in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">As we hold that \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) is a remedial statute, we look to whether the liberal construction given to remedial statutes allows for the inclusion of post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees within the phrase \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d as stated in \u00a7 8-203(e)(4). We hold that \u00a7 8-203(e)(4)\u2019s \u201creasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees\u201d provision includes fees for post-judgment motions necessitated by the landlord\u2019s refusal to satisfy the judgment. First, logic supports such a result. Section 8-203(e)(4) eliminates some of the potential disparity between certain tenants and landlords in disputes regarding security deposits. An interpretation excluding post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees from \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) during a tenant\u2019s direct attempt to enforce collection of a judgment against such a landlord or a tenant\u2019s defense of a judgment during the appellate process, might effectively defeat the tenant\u2019s right to fully recover from the landlord. As occurred in this case, and potentially in many cases, especially those where the security deposit is a relatively small amount, a landlord could delay, impede and actively thwart the collection of the judgment until it is no longer cost effective for the tenant to pursue collection of a judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statute allows for \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d incurred in an action for a return, <em>ie., </em>actual collection, of security deposits. Until a security deposit, including attorney\u2019s fees, is actually returned it is still in the process of being collected. The statute encompasses attorney\u2019s fees associated with \u201ccollection.\u201d Considering the costs of the appellate process, precluding, categorically, the recovery of appellate attorney\u2019s fees might effectively render meaningless the remedy created by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Looking to another Maryland remedial statute for guidance supports our holding that \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d under the Act may include post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees. The case of <em>Admiral Mortgage, Inc. v. Cooper, </em>357 Md. 533, 745 A.2d 1026 (2000), is somewhat similar in that, albeit as dicta, we recognized that remedial statutes providing for attorney\u2019s fees might encompass post-judgment fees. In <em>Admiral Mortgage, </em>this Court answered the question of whether it was appropriate for a jury to determine the attorney\u2019s fee award pursuant to Maryland Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 3-507.1 of the Labor and Employment Article. Section 3-507.1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201c \u00a7 3-507.1. Action to recover unpaid wages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Notwithstanding any remedy available under \u00a7 3-507 of this subtitle, if an employer fails to pay an employee in accordance with \u00a7 3-502 or \u00a7 3-505 of this subtitle, after 2 weeks have elapsed from the date on which the employer is required to have paid the wages, the employee <em>may bring an action against the employer </em>to recover the unpaid wages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">(b) <em>Award and costs. </em>\u2014 If, in an action under subsection (a) of this section, a court finds that an employer withheld the wage of an employee in violation of this subtitle and not as a result of a bona fide dispute, the court, may award the employee an amount <em>not exceeding 3 times </em>the wage, and <em>reasonable counsel fees </em>and other costs.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">This Court, in <em>Admiral Mortgage, </em>held that \u00a7 3-507.1 was a remedial statute. In holding that attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded by the trial judge and not the jury, this Court stated in <em>Admiral Mortgage:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">\u201cAttorneys\u2019 fees and costs are another matter. For one thing, <em>they may continue to accrue after the verdict is rendered, if post-trial motions or appeals are filed, so the jury cannot determine them definitively. </em>Attorneys\u2019 fees, moreover, when allowed, have traditionally been set by the judge, who is usually in a far better position than a jury to determine what is reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>Admiral Mortgage, </em>357 Md. at 547-48, 745 A.2d at 1033 (emphasis added). <em>Admiral Mortgage </em>clearly implies that, in respect to remedial statutes, courts may allow post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See also Friolo, </em>373 Md. at 517-18, 819 A.2d at 364 (stating, \u201cUnquestionably, the provisions for counsel fees in \u00a7 3-427(d) and \u00a7 3-507.1(b) are remedial in nature and should therefore be given a liberal interpretation. Courts must keep that in mind when deciding <em>whether </em>to award a fee.\u201d) (citations omitted). The Circuit Court in the case <em>sub judice </em>was in error in believing that he did not possess the power to award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) for work done on post-judgment motions and for work done in respect to appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Federal fee-shifting cases provide additional support for the imposition of post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees in cases similar to the case <em>sub judice. See Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>478 U.S. 546, 558-60, 106 S.Ct. 3088, 3094-96, 92 L.Ed.2d 439, 451-53 (1986); <em>Garrity v.

Schafer, </em>83 F.3d 1008, 1010-11 (8th Cir.l996)(recognizing that \u201cit is generally accepted that prevailing plaintiffs are entitled to post-judgment fee awards for legal services necessary for reasonable monitoring of the decree\u201d); <em>Stewart v. Gates, </em>987 F.2d 1450, 1452 (9th Cir.l993)(providing for the award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cfor certain post-judgment proceedings\u201d pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988); <em>Duran v. Carruthers, </em>885 F.2d 1492, 1495-96 (10th Cir.l989)(upholding a trial court\u2019s post-judgment award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, for the monitoring of compliance with a consent decree regarding prison conditions and other post-judgment proceedings). Albeit that it involved administrative enforcement of a judicial decree, some of the rationale of <em>Delaware Valley, supra, </em>would equally apply to judicial enforcement of court judgments. The United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u201cAlthough it is true that the proceedings involved in Phases II and IX were not \u2018judicial\u2019 in the sense that they did not occur in a courtroom or involve \u2018traditional\u2019 legal work such as examination of witnesses or selection of jurors for trial, the work done by counsel in these two phases was as necessary to the attainment of adequate relief for their client as was all of their earlier work in the courtroom which secured Delaware Valley\u2019s initial success in obtaining the consent decree.... Instead, Delaware Valley filed suit to force the Commonwealth to comply with its obligations under the Clean Air Act to develop and implement an emissions inspection and maintenance program covering 10 counties surrounding two major metropolitan areas. To this end, the consent decree provided detailed instructions as to how the program was to be developed and the specific dates by which these tasks were to be accomplished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201cProtection of the full scope of relief afforded by the consent decree was thus crucial to safeguard the interests asserted by Delaware Valley; and enforcement of the decree, whether in the courtroom before a judge, or in front of a regulatory agency with power to modify the substance of the program ordered by the court, involved the type of work which is properly compensable as a cost of litigation under \u00a7 304....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cGiven the common purpose of both \u00a7 304(d) and \u00a7 1988 to promote citizen enforcement of important federal policies, we find no reason not to interpret both provisions governing attorney\u2019s fees in the same manner. We hold, therefore, that the fact that the work done by counsel ... did not occur in the context of traditional judicial litigation does not preclude an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 304(d) for the work done during these portions of the present action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\"><em>Delaware Valley, </em>478 U.S. at 558-60, 106 S.Ct. at 3094-96, 92 L.Ed.2d at 452-53 (citations omitted). Although it involved administrative enforcement, <em>Delaware Valley\u2019s </em>rationale is particularly pertinent to this case. The federal statutes dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>cussed in that case had the purpose of ensuring private citizens \u201ca meaningful opportunity to vindicate their rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559, 106 S.Ct. at 3095, 92 L.Ed.2d at 453. In this case, \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) similarly provides tenants with a meaningful opportunity to vindicate their rights against landlords improperly withholding tenants\u2019 security deposits. As post-judgment monitoring was needed to ensure the citizens\u2019 rights in <em>Delaware Valley, </em>post-judgment motions and appeals were necessary to ensure that petitioners could enforce their judgment in this case. The actions of respondent in this case illustrate how easily a landlord can prevent a tenant from vindicating the tenant\u2019s rights under the statute in the absence of an award for post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees. Thus, awarding attorney\u2019s fees for post-judgment motions and appeals can not only be reasonable, but may often be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Cases from other states additionally support our interpretation of \u00a7 8 \u2014 203(e)(4), as several courts have held that similar attorney\u2019s fees provisions of security deposit statutes apply to post-trial motions and/or appeals. In <em>Martin v. Allen, </em>193 Colo. 395, 566 P.2d 1075 (1977), the Supreme Court of Colorado reversed a lower court decision refusing to allow attorney\u2019s fees for an appeal. In holding that a tenant could be awarded attorney\u2019s fees for an appeal relating to that state\u2019s security deposit statute, the court stated that the Colorado statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">\u201cauthorizes the award of treble the amount of a security deposit and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees when a landlord willfully fails to return the deposit within thirty days of termination of the leasehold. This statute, salutary in nature, is designed to assist tenants in vindicating their legal rights and to equalize the disparity in power which exists between landlord and tenant in conflicts over such relatively small sums. To deny attorney\u2019s fees to tenants who are forced to prosecute an appeal would undercut the objectives of these provisions. Landlords, by the simple expedient of an appeal, could effectively discourage tenants from obtaining legal redress. We, therefore, hold that tenants who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>successful on appeal are entitled to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 396, 566 P.2d at 1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The Supreme Court of Wisconsin, in <em>Shands v. Castrovinci, </em>115 Wis.2d 352, 340 N.W.2d 506 (1983), held that the <em>actual recovery </em>of damages is the benchmark of success for a tenant in a landlord-tenant dispute pursuant to the Wisconsin\u2019s security deposit act. The provision in dispute in <em>Shands, </em>which is similar to the one in the case <em>sub judice, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201c \u2018Any person suffering pecuniary loss because of a violation by any other person of any order issued under this section may sue for damages therefore in any court of competent jurisdiction and shall recover twice the amount of such pecuniary loss, together with costs, including <em>a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 355 n. 2, 340 N.W.2d at 507-08 n. 2 (quoting Wis. Stat. \u00a7 100.20(5)(emphasis added)). The <em>Shands </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u201cA tenant action brought under sec. 100.20(5) ... is not successful until he or she <em>has actually recovered damages and attorney fees. </em>The trial court\u2019s decision may have to be defended, or an adverse decision protested, in an appellate forum. The same purposes and policy interests we identified for the original action attach to the appeals process. To permit the recovery of attorney fees for successful appellate work is simply to recognize that an attorney\u2019s effort at that stage is as essential to the tenant\u2019s success as is an attorney\u2019s work at the trial court level. Furthermore, we recognize that, if attorney fees were not recoverable on appeal, landlords could defeat the statutory purposes by the simple expedient of an appeal, which will be prohibitively expensive for many tenants; similarly, tenants would have little incentive to pursue a meritorious claim on appeal where they had not prevailed at the trial court level. <em>In short, to deny attorney fees to tenants who need to pursue appellate review to enforce their rights would undercut the salutary objectives of the statute.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u201cIn light of these important interests, we find no reason to interpret sec. 100.20(5), Stats., as limiting the award of attorney fees to the original trial court litigation. Accordingly, we hold that a tenant who has suffered pecuniary loss because of a violation of Wis. Adm.Code Ch. Ag 134 shall recover reasonable attorney fees for appellate review undertaken to attack or defend a trial court\u2019s decision in the suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYz8\"><em>Id. </em>at 359, 340 N.W.2d at 509 (emphasis added). <em>See also Schaefer v. Murphey, </em>131 Ariz. 295, 299, 640 P.2d 857, 861 (1982)(awarding, in a landlord-tenant dispute, attorney\u2019s fees for an appeal as well as for trial work pursuant to a state statute allowing for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees to the successful party); <em>see generally L\u2019Esperance v. Benware, </em>830 A.2d 675, 679 (Vt.2003)(although not the issue on appeal, the trial court included \u201cpost-judgment attorney\u2019s fees\u201d for work performed on post-trial motions in a landlord-tenant dispute under Vermont\u2019s Consumer Fraud Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">As in <em>Shands, supra, </em>denial of attorney\u2019s fees in the case at bar would diminish the remedial nature of \u00a7 8-203(e)(4). Petitioners were not successful in recovering the original judgment against the landlord until after the filing of several post-judgment motions. These post-judgment motions and the accompanying attorney\u2019s fees were necessary for petitioners to receive their full remedy under the statute, <em>ie., </em>recovery on their judgment against respondent. Without the post-judgment motions, and subsequent appeals by petitioners, respondent could have successfully thwarted \u00a7 8-203(e)(4)\u2019s purpose merely by refraining from repaying the security deposit. Interpreting \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) to not include post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees might encourage similar actions by landlords in the future, thus further frustrating the remedial purpose of \u00a7 8-203(e)(4). As a result, we hold that the inclusion of post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) may be \u201creasonable\u201d and in accord with \u00a7 8-203(e)(4)\u2019s remedial purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Respondent argues that a holding by this Court that \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) authorizes the awarding of post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees would be the practical equivalent of this Court adding the following emphasized language to the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>\u201c(e)(4) If the landlord, without a reasonable basis, fails to return any part of the security deposit, plus accrued interest, within 45 days after the termination of the tenancy, <em>or if a landlord fails to pay a judgment entered pursuant to this subsection, or if a landlord fails to respond to post-judgment discovery propounded by a tenant having a judgment entered pursuant to this subsection, </em>the tenant has an action of up to threefold of the withheld amount, plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Respondent\u2019s contention is misplaced. Our interpretation does not add language to the statute; it is merely an interpretation of \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d in light of \u00a7 8-203(e)(4)\u2019s remedial nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">In conclusion, we hold that although \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) is silent as to whether \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d includes fees earned in the pursuit of post-judgment motions to collect the judgment from a landlord and appeals incurred in an effort to defend and collect a judgment in favor of a tenant, the remedial nature of \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) necessitates that a court has the power to include such fees in the award. Reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 8-203(e)(4) may include post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees in order to avoid rendering the remedy provided in \u00a7 8 \u2014 203(e)(4) relatively meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND THE IS CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE THE ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY DENYING A SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD OF ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

Att\u2019y Gen. 523 (Md.l977)(stating, in reference to another section of the Residential Lease Subtitle, \u00a7 8-211, that \u201c[t]he thrust of the State\u2019s rent escrow statute is to provide tenants with additional judicial remedies in support of a limited, implied warrant of habitability\u201d)(alteration added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\">. Petitioners state in their brief that the $2,500 security deposit for respondent's \"upscale townhouse in Bethesda, Maryland\u201d was \"likely in the upper range of security deposits handled by Maryland's District Courts.\u201d The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) report on fair market rents for the fiscal year 2003 supports this contention. <em>See </em>67 Fed.Reg. 61405 (September 30, 2002). Pursuant to that report, for a two-bedroom rental in the greater Baltimore area (including Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford, Howard, Queen Anne\u2019s Counties and Baltimore City) the average rent is $844 per month. <em>Id. </em>The average for Columbia is $952 per month. <em>Id. </em>For the greater Washington, DC area (including Calvert, Charles, Frederick, Montgomeiy and Prince George's Counties) the average is $1154 per month. <em>Id. </em>The average for Cumberland (Allegany County) is $535 per month. <em>Id. </em>And for Cecil County, the average is $752 per month (including the greater Wilmington Newark area). <em>Id. </em>Doubling the highest of those averages for metropolitan areas of Maryland, $1154 for the greater Washington, DC area, still does not equal the security deposit imposed in this case, and thus illustrates that this case represents the higher range of security deposits in Maryland.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b373-5\">. Even if a landlord\u2019s appeal was made in a good faith belief that it was warranted, the added cost in post-judgment or appellate attorney's fees alone could create an unreasonable disparity for a successful tenant. For example, if an apartment rents for $500 per month, the maximum amount that a landlord could hold as a security deposit is two times that amount, or $1000. The trial judge may award the tenant up to three times that amount plus interest. If, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the case is appealed to the Court of Special Appeals and then to this Court, the cost of prosecuting an effective appeal may nullify the judgment of the trial court even if the trial court had awarded the maximum amount under the statute. Therefore, even where a landlord acts in good faith when appealing, if the tenant ultimately prevails the statute contemplates that judges have discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees relative to that appeal. The addition of deliberate delays and contemptuous behavior by the landlord, as in this case, would only add additional costs to the litigation and, unless recoverable, would further diminish the statutory remedy afforded to tenants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>RAKER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Au6\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">I respectfully dissent.
