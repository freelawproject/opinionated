(Orbit), is, for the purposes of this case, a garage in possession of a motor vehicle subject to a garageman\u2019s lien. The vehicle\u2019s owner failed to pay Orbit for the repair work and services that gave rise to the lien. Orbit intends to sell the vehicle, as authorized by Md.Code (1975, 2000 RepLVol.), \u00a7 16-207 of the Commercial Law Article,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in order to recover the value of the services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Petitioner, Friendly Finance Corporation (Friendly), is a lender holding a purchase money security interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>motor vehicle that was perfected before Orbit came into possession of the vehicle. The vehicle\u2019s owner defaulted on the purchase loan and Friendly, in this replevin action, seeks to forestall Orbit\u2019s sale of the vehicle and to take possession of the vehicle without having to pay Orbit for its repair services.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Because the General Assembly intended the holder of a garageman\u2019s lien to have priority of possession over any holders of perfected security interests in a motor vehicle when the holder of the garageman\u2019s lien intends to conduct a statutory sale of the vehicle under \u00a7 16-207, we shall affirm the judgments of the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Prince George\u2019s County, and the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, each holding that Friendly is not entitled to possession and that Orbit may complete its statutory sale of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\n<em>Undisputed Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">On 31 August 2000, Israel Atkins bought a red, previously owned, 1998 Plymouth Neon four-door sedan. He financed the purchase of the vehicle with a loan provided by Friendly and secured by the vehicle. That loan, a Maryland Closed-End Credit and Security Agreement, was perfected in Washington, D.C. on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Orbit performed significant repairs and maintenance on the vehicle at Atkins\u2019s request in April 2001. Atkins did not pay Orbit for the repairs, and Orbit became the holder of a garageman\u2019s lien<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for charges that eventually added up to $2,137.21: $1,162.21 in unpaid repairs (after payments under a mechanical repair contract were deducted), $300 in storage charges, and $675 in lien expenses. Atkins defaulted on his purchase money loan from Friendly and, on 5 November 2001, he informed Friendly that Orbit had possession of the vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Friendly filed in the District Court, on 29 November 2001, a replevin action to gain possession of the vehicle from Orbit without paying the charges due to Orbit. Orbit responded by asserting its garageman\u2019s lien and seeking dismissal of Friendly\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The District Court interpreted Title 16 of the Commercial Law Article to provide that a garage\u2019s right to possession pending sale is absolute unless or until either (1) the repair bill is paid or (2) the lien is discharged through some other statutory means. Finding that Orbit\u2019s repair bill had not been paid and that none of the statutory provisions by which the lien could be discharged were applicable, the court held that Orbit\u2019s right to possess the vehicle and its right to sell the vehicle were superior to Friendly\u2019s right to possession. It dismissed Friendly\u2019s replevin action. On direct appeal, the Circuit Court affirmed. We granted Friendly\u2019s petition for certiorari, <em>Friendly Finance v. Orbit, </em>374 Md. 358, 822 A.2d 1224 (2003), to consider the following questions (rephrased for clarity):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">1. Is a garageman\u2019s lien on a motor vehicle subordinate to a previously perfected purchase money security interest if the garage intends to conduct a statutory sale of the vehicle under \u00a7 16-207?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">2. Is the holder of a previously perfected purchase money security interest an \u201cowner\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in \u00a7 16-208 (Replevy of property by owner)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">The Court of Appeals will set. aside the judgment of a court based on the factual findings of that court only when those findings are clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 8-131(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. The legal analysis of the District Court and of the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Court, however, enjoy no deferential standard of appellate review. <em>Helinski v. Harford Memorial Hosp., Inc., </em>376 Md. 606, 614-15, 831 A.2d 40, 45 (2003). We review <em>de novo </em>their interpretations of the relevant statutes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\n<em>Principles of Legislative Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In order properly to interpret a statute, a court must ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>MVA v. Lytle, </em>374 Md. 37, 50, 821 A.2d 62, 70 (2003). A reasonable statutory construction is one that is consistent with the purpose, aim or policy of the Legislature reflected in the statute. <em>Id. </em>Statutory analysis begins with the plain meaning of the words of the statute. When those words are clear and unambiguous, and the result is not absurd, no further inquiry into legislative intent is required. <em>See Lytle, </em>374 Md. at 57, 821 A.2d at 73; <em>Medex v. McCabe, </em>372 Md. 28, 38, 811 A.2d 297, 303 (2002). When there is some ambiguity in the meaning of statutory language or when the language conflicts with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>larger statutory scheme, the statutory language must be construed in light of and governed by its context within the overall statutory scheme. <em>Lytle, 374 </em>Md. at 57, <em>821 A.2d </em>at 73. The legislative history or other sources extraneous to the statute itself may shed light on the legislative intent. <em>McCabe, 372 </em>Md. at 38, 811 A.2d at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The District Court\u2019s bases for concluding that Orbit was entitled to retain possession of the vehicle were twofold, each interpreting different provisions of Title 16 of the Commercial Law Article of the Maryland Code. The first was that a motor vehicle lien held by a garage under \u00a7\u00a7 16-202(c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 16-203(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> enjoys priority over a previously perfected purchase money security interest in the vehicle if the garage demonstrated an intention to sell the car under \u00a7 16-207.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The second was that only an \u201cowner\u201d could file a \u00a7 16-208<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>replevin action in order to gain immediate possession of a motor vehicle held subject to a garageman\u2019s hen, and that Friendly was not an \u201cowner\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in the statute. Friendly argues that these were each misinterpretations of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The Maryland General Assembly, when it enacted the provisions relating to garageman\u2019s liens, envisioned the statute would operate according to the following sequence of events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">(1) The owner in possession of the motor vehicle takes it (or has it towed) to the garage and requests that it be repaired. \u00a7 16-202(e)(l).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">(2) The garage performs the requested repairs, creating a lien in favor of garage for the repair bill, and bills the owner. \u00a7 16 \u2014 202(c)(2)(i).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">(3) The owner fails to pay the bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">(4) The garage stores the vehicle, creating a lien in favor of the garage for storage costs. \u00a7 16-202(c)(l)(ii).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">(5) The garage retains possession of the vehicle until either the charges are paid or the lien is otherwise discharged. \u00a7 16-203(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">(6) The garage, within 30 days of the creation of the lien, sends notice of the lien to all holders of perfected security interests. \u00a7 16 \u2014 203(b)(l)(i).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">(7) If the bill remains unpaid for 30 days, the garage, at its option, may initiate a public sale of the vehicle. \u00a7 16-207(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>(8) The garage sends notice, at least 10 days prior to sale, to the owner, all holders of perfected security interests, and the Motor Vehicle Administration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u00a7 16 \u2014 207(b)(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">(9) The garage publishes notice once a week for the two weeks immediately preceding the sale in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the county where the sale is to be held. \u00a7 16-207(b)(l).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">(10) The garage sells the vehicle. \u00a7 16-207.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">(11) Proceeds of sale are applied as follows: \u00a7 16-207(e)(1).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>i. Expenses of the sale. \u00a7 16-207(e)(l)(i).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">ii. Third-party storage fees. \u00a7 16 \u2014 207(e)(l)(ii).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">iii. The lien claim for garage repair and storage bills. \u00a7 16-207(e)(l)(iii).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">iv. Any purchase money security interest. \u00a7 16-107(e)(l)(iv).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">v. Any remaining secured parties of record. \u00a7 16-107(e)(l)(v).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">vi. Any remaining balance to the owner. \u00a7 16-107(e)(4).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayn-dedup-0\">By its own admission, Orbit did not follow one of these steps. Specifically, it failed to give the notice required by \u00a7 16 \u2014 203(b) to Friendly, the holder of a perfected purchase money security interest in the vehicle.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The penalty for this omission, however, is laid out clearly in \u00a7 16-207(e)(3): if the notice required under \u00a7 16-203(b) is not sent, the garage may not recover any amount for storage charges incurred or imposed pursuant to \u00a7 16-202(e)(l)(ii).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The failure to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>notice does not affect the \u00a7 16-202(c)(2)(i) lien for the repair bill. Orbit would be entitled to sell the car and recover the expenses of the sale and the value of the repairs notwithstanding its failure to give the \u00a7 16-203(b) notice to Friendly.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Orbit otherwise followed the statutory requirements in establishing and maintaining its statutory garageman\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The holder of a garageman\u2019s lien need not relinquish possession of the vehicle prior to sale unless either the charges that give rise to the hen are paid or the lien is \u201cotherwise discharged in accordance with this subtitle.\u201d \u00a7 16-203(a). In the present case, the charges have not been paid. The means by which a hen may be \u201cotherwise discharged in accordance with this subtitle\u201d are (1) surrender or delivery of the property by the garage under \u00a7 16-204 (Effect of surrender of possession); (2) the filing of a bond by the owner under \u00a7 16-206 (Proceedings if charge disputed); (3) sale by the garage under \u00a7 16-207 (Unpaid account settled by public sale; applicability of notice requirements); or (4) replevin by the owner under \u00a7 16-208 (Replevy of property by owner).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Friendly cites \u00a7 16-205(b) as the basis for its right to possession of the vehicle. \u201cA motor vehicle [garageman\u2019s] hen is subordinate only to a security interest perfected as required by law, except in the case of a motor vehicle sold under \u00a7 lb-207 of this subtitle.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u00a7 16-205(b). If not for the reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\u00a7 16-207, it would appear that \u00a7 16-205(b) conflicts with \u00a7 16-203(a). On the one hand, \u00a7 16 \u2014 205(b) is not one of the means by which the garageman\u2019s lien may be discharged according to \u00a7 16-203(a). On the other hand, \u00a7 16-205(b) seems to make Orbit\u2019s motor vehicle lien subordinate to Friendly\u2019s perfected security interest. It is our view, however, that the reference to \u00a7 16-207 in \u00a7 16-205(b) gives a garageman with such a lien priority of possession over the holders of perfected security interests when the garage intends to sell the vehicle under \u00a7 16-207, but makes garage-man\u2019s liens subordinate to perfected security interests in all other situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Friendly argues that the use of the past tense in \u00a7 16-205(b) (\u201csold\u201d) indicates a legislative intent to give the garage-man\u2019s lien priority over perfected security interests <em>only if </em>the \u00a7 16-207 statutory sale has been completed. On the contrary, the Legislature intended the garage to retain priority of possession throughout the process leading to a \u00a7 16-207 sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The word \u201csold\u201d in \u00a7 16-205(b) originally was meant to be read in the conditional present tense rather than in the past tense. The reference to \u00a7 16-207 was added to \u00a7 16-205(b) by amendment in 1982. 1982 Md. Laws, Chap. 890. The original bill would have amended \u00a7 16-205(b) to read: \u201cA boat lien or motor vehicle lien is subordinate only to a security interest perfected as required by law, except when sold pursuant to \u00a7 16-207 of this article.\u201d The Legislature amended the bill before its enactment. The version that the Legislature enacted read: \u201cA boat lien or motor vehicle lien is subordinate only to a security interest perfected as required by law, except in the case of a motor vehicle lien when a vehicle is sold pursuant to \u00a7 16-207 of this article.\u201d Each version employed conditional language: \u201cwhen sold\u201d and \u201cwhen a vehicle is sold.\u201d The version that the Legislature enacted contained the word \u201cis,\u201d confirming that the statute was to be read in the present tense.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The fact that the Legislature used the phrase \u201cwhen a vehicle is sold,\u201d rather than \u201cwhen a vehicle has been sold,\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>persuasive evidence that it intended to extend the garage\u2019s special priority over all other lienholders to embrace the entire process leading to a \u00a7 16-207 sale. Although the statute was amended in 1986 to remove the conditional language, 1986 Md. Laws, Chap. 418, the 1986 amendment seems to have been intended to remove the unnecessary redundancy of the word \u201cvehicle\u201d and generally to shorten the provision. The resulting language could be read in either the conditional present tense or the past tense, but it does not appear that the Legislature intended in 1986 to change the tense. The statute\u2019s tense has not been changed since.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">This conclusion is confirmed by our review of the rest of the statute. Section 16-207 quite clearly gives garageman\u2019s liens priority over perfected security interests after the sale\u2019s completion, so the reference to \u00a7 16-207 in \u00a7 16-205(b) would become surplusage if it only applied after a sale was completed. We consistently have noted that statutory interpretations that result in surplusage or meaningless language should be avoided. <em>See Eng\u2019g Mgmt. Servs. v. Md. State Highway Admin., </em>375 Md. 211, 224, 825 A.2d 966, 974 (2003). Section 16-207(d) gives the purchaser of a vehicle sold in a \u00a7 16-207 statutory sale the right to title \u201cfree and clear of any lien.\u201d Sections 16-207(e)(l) and (e)(3) give the holder of a garage-man\u2019s lien for repair work on a motor vehicle priority in the distribution of the sale\u2019s proceeds over any perfected security interest holder. There would be no need to make an exception for \u00a7 16-207 in \u00a7 16-205(b) if the Legislature had intended that exception to apply only after the sale was completed because the parties\u2019 respective positions after a statutory sale already are clear in \u00a7 16-207. The reference to \u00a7 16-207 only has separate meaning if it applies throughout the course of carrying out a statutory sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The Legislature\u2019s choice to grant priority so that a garage may recover the value of repairs it performed on a vehicle is a sensible one objectively as well. The garage has added value to the vehicle. A secured interest holder would receive a windfall if it were to obtain the right to possess and sell the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>vehicle without first paying the garage\u2019s repair bill. For example, in this case Orbit replaced a leaking head gasket and a substantial portion of the front suspension, along with performing several other repairs. It also performed routine maintenance, such as changing the oil and aligning the front wheels. It is fair to say that the vehicle was worth more after the repairs than at the condition it was in at the time Atkins brought it to Orbit.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Friendly sought a writ of replevin under \u00a7 16-208.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Issuance of such a writ would discharge the garageman\u2019s lien and Friendly would be entitled to possession.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Section 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>208, however, is only available to \u201cthe owner of the property.\u201d Friendly is not the owner of the vehicle, but is rather the holder of a secured interest in the vehicle. Accordingly, Friendly is not entitled to replevin under \u00a7 16-208.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Title 16 of the Commercial Law Article includes a broad and open-ended definition of the term \u201cowner:\u201d \u201c \u2018[o]wner\u2019 includes a person lawfully in possession.\u201d \u00a7 16-101. The statute offers no further explicit elaboration; however, when considered in its varying contexual usages within the statutory scheme,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the word \u201cowner\u201d assumes different meanings in different contexts. So considered, the use of that word within the context of Title 16 makes clearer its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The Legislature treats owners and perfected security interest holders quite differently throughout Title 16, indicating its intention that the term \u201cowner\u201d not include perfected security interest holders. The clearest example of this is found in \u00a7 16-207 (Unpaid account settled by public sale; applicability of notice requirements), where owners and the holders of perfected security interests are given different levels of priority with respect to the proceeds of a statutory sale. Other examples include \u00a7 16-203 (Retention of possession by lienor; notice of lien), which makes several references to the notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>which holders of perfected security interests are entitled without mentioning owners, and \u00a7\u00a7 16-204 (Effect of surrender of possession), 16-206 (Proceedings if charge disputed), and 16-208 (Replevy of property by owner), which make reference to the owner of the vehicle or property without referring to any perfected security interest holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Another indication of the Legislature\u2019s intended meaning of the word is found in \u00a7 16-202: \u201cAny person who, with the consent of the owner, has custody of a motor vehicle and who, at the request of the owner, provides a service to or materials for the motor vehicle, has a lien on the motor vehicle.\u201d \u00a7 16-202(c). It follows that any person authorized to consent to give a garage custody of a vehicle or to request that the garage perform services on it is an owner of that vehicle. Following that statutory test, Friendly had no authority to give Orbit custody of the vehicle or to request that Orbit repair the vehicle, without regaining possession from Atkins.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_F\">[T]he buyer [of a vehicle] is the substantial owner. It is he who has the control, possession, care, and maintenance of a machine, which was second-hand when bought, and which must frequently require repair that it may continue in operation and be kept in proper condition, and this possession, use, and custody is exclusive of every one else but the seller or its assignee, and of it only if and when he make a default in his obligation to pay or to perform some of the terms of the contract looking to the preservation of the security afforded by the reservation of title in the article sold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><em>Universal Credit Co. v. Marks, </em>164 Md. 130, 135-36, 163 A. 810, 812 (1933) (construing a conditional sales contract, a precursor to modern security interests, where the secured party, not the purchaser, retained title to the vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Nor was Friendly a \u201cperson lawfully in possession\u201d under \u00a7 16-101. Atkins had sole possession of the vehicle at the time it was delivered to Orbit for repairs, and had not yet defaulted on Friendly\u2019s purchase loan at that time. Friendly had a security interest that could mature into a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>possession of the vehicle, but did not then possess the vehicle. In <em>Central GMC, Inc. v. Helms, </em>303 Md. 266, 492 A.2d 1313 (1985), we concluded that a purchaser of a vehicle who had not yet taken possession was not its owner for the purposes of \u00a7 16-203. Rather, the party that sold the vehicle to the purchaser and still had possession pending delivery of the vehicle was its owner. <em>See also Wolf Org. v. Oles, </em>119 Md.App. 357, 705 A.2d 40 (1998) (purchasers who had not yet taken possession of a house were not \u201cowners\u201d of the house for the purposes of the Maryland Mechanics\u2019 Lien Statute, Md.Code (1974,1996 RepLVoL), \u00a7\u00a7 9-101 through 9-114 of the Real Property Article). Friendly may have a superior right to possess the vehicle to that of Atkins, but had not taken possession and therefore was not the vehicle\u2019s owner for the purposes of Title 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

These are the same standards of review that Circuit Courts, following Maryland Rule 7-113(1) in cases such as the present one, should apply when they review District Court judgments. The Circuit Court in this case, however, may have applied a \"clearly erroneous\u201d standard to its review of the District Court\u2019s legal analysis. We glean this from the fact that, in its written opinion, the Circuit Court made reference only to the deferential clearly erroneous standard. Maryland Rule 8-131(c) has nearly identical language to Rule 7-113(1) regarding the scope of appellate review, and cases interpreting Rule 8-131(c) are persuasive regarding Rule 7 113(f). <em>See Ryan v. Thurston, </em>276 Md. 390, 347 A.2d 834 (1975) (cases applying former Rule 886, which was substantially similar to current Rule 8-131(c), are controlling authority governing interpretation of former Rule 1386, which was substantially similar to current Rule 7-113(0). Under Rule 8-131(c), clear error is the proper standard for review of the evidence, but it is not the proper standard for questions of law, which are reviewed <em>de novo. See Helinski, </em>376 Md. at 614-15, 831 A.2d at 45. Because we agree that the District Court\u2019s legal analysis was correct, the Circuit Court\u2019s possible application of the incorrect standard of review was harmless error if it was error at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">. \u00a7 16-202(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">\n<em>Motor vehicle lien.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">(1) Any person who, with the consent of the owner, has custody of a motor vehicle and who, at the request of the owner, provides a service to or materials for the motor vehicle, has a lien on the motor vehicle for any charge incurred for any:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">(1) Repair or rebuilding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">(ii) Storage; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">(iii) Tires or other parts or accessories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">(2) A lien is created under this subsection when any charges set out under paragraph (1) of this subsection giving rise to the lien are incurred.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b388-13\">. \u00a7 16-203(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-14\">\n<em>Retention of possession.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-15\">The lienor may retain possession of the property subject to the lien until:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-16\">(1) The charges which give rise to the lien are paid; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-17\">(2) The lien is otherwise discharged in accordance with this subtitle.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b388-18\">. \"If the charges which give rise to a lien are due and unpaid for 30 days and the lienor is in possession of the property subject to the lien, the lienor may sell the property to which the lien attaches at public sale.\u201d \u00a7 16-207(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b388-19\">. \"If the owner of property subject to a lien institutes an action of replevin and establishes a right to the issuance of a writ but for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>defendant\u2019s alleged lien under this subtitle, the court shall issue the writ.\u201d \u00a7 16-208(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b389-14\">. \u00a7 16 \u2014 203(b)( 1)(i) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-15\">[W]ithin 30 days after the creation of a lien ... the lienor shall send notice of the lien by registered or certified mail to all holders of perfected security interests in the property who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-16\">1.

Any perception of ambiguity in the language of these provisions is quickly eliminated by a review of the legislative history. The relevant language was added in 1992. 1992 Md. Laws, Chap. 595. The 1992 amendment, as it was originally drafted, was intended to encourage lienholders to give notice of their liens by providing that failure to give such notice would make their liens subordinate to previously perfected security interests. Before the 1992 amendment was passed, it was itself amended to add \u00a7 16-207(e)(3). The new language limited the penalty for failure to give notice of a garageman\u2019s lien to loss of priority for storage fees. <em>Id.
