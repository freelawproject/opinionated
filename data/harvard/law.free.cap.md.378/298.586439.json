The trial court determined that the probationary employee could be terminated without regard to \u00a7 11-106. The Court of Special Appeals agreed and, therefore, affirmed. <em>Smack v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>134 Md.App. 412, 759 A.2d 1209 (2000). We issued the writ of certiorari to review this important question. 362 Md. 359, 765 A.2d 142 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The facts out of which the present controversy arose are not in dispute. At the time of her termination, the petitioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Stephanie Smack, was a probationary employee of the Somerset County Health Department. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-402 of the State Pensions and Personnel Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Having been employed on October 8, 1997 as a Social Worker I and assigned to the Addiction Unit, her probationary period would not have expired until April 8,1998. \u00a7 7-402(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The petitioner\u2019s duties required her to conduct weekly group therapy sessions in Crisfield, Maryland. The group therapy session scheduled for January 29, 1998 was to begin at 2:00 p.m. On that day, there was flooding in the area, the result of a \u201cnor\u2019easter,\u201d as the major storm causing it was described. The petitioner\u2019s supervisor and three of the group members nevertheless were able to get to the group session and therefore, were present. The petitioner did not attend the group therapy session.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">According to the petitioner, she left her office at approximately 1:45 p.m., the location of the group therapy session being approximately a ten-minute drive. When the petitioner approached the location of the session, she was told by an unnamed person that the street leading to the group therapy location was under water and that members of the group had not been able to make it because of the flooding. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>petitioner also observed two vehicles having difficulty traversing the flooded street, and a radio broadcast reported rising tides. As a result, she determined that her car could not make it through the flooded streets. Consequently, she returned to her office, from where she called, without success, the facility where the group therapy session was to be held. The petitioner stated that she did not call before because she had neither money for a telephone call nor a cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Following discussions with her supervisor and the head of the Agency over the next several days, the petitioner was terminated on February 9, 1998. She was told that it was for failing to attend the group session and failing to report her absence to her supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The petitioner appealed the termination pursuant to State Personnel <em>&amp; </em>Pensions Article, \u00a7 11-110.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge, she complained that the respondent had failed to follow the procedure for \u201ctaking ... disciplinary action related to employee misconduct ...\u201d prescribed by \u00a7 11-106. The respondent conceded the point, but it argued that the section was inapplicable to the termination of a probationary employee. The respondent submitted that such terminations are not firings for \u201cmisconduct.\u201d The Administrative Law Judge agreed and, subsequently affirmed the decision to terminate the petitioner\u2019s employment. The petitioner then filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Worcester County. That court also affirmed the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That court likewise affirmed, as we have seen. <em>Smack, supra. </em>134 Md.App. at 417, 759 A.2d at 1212. It reasoned that resolution of the issue of the petitioner\u2019s termination is controlled by \u00a7 11-303, <em>id. </em>at 419, 759 A.2d at 1213, and not by \u00a7 11-106, as the petitioner maintains.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Resolution of the issue this case presents is a matter of statutory construction, the .canons of which are well settled and have been oft repeated. The predominant goal of statutory construction \u201cis to ascertain and implement, to the extent possible, the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002). <em>See Toler v. Motor Vehicle Administration, </em>373 Md. 214, 220, 817 A.2d 229, 233 (2003); <em>Dyer v. Otis Warren Real Estate, </em>371 Md. 576, 580-581, 810 A.2d 938, 941 (2002) (\u201cThe goal with which we approach the interpretation of a statute is to determine the intention of the Legislature in enacting it.\u201d). We begin the interpretive analysis with the words of the statute and, when they are clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>unambiguous, there is no need to search further. <em>Medex v. McCabe, </em>372 Md. 28, 38, 811 A.2d 297, 303 (2002); <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 301, 783 A.2d 667, 670 (2001); <em>Harris v. State, </em>353 Md. 596, 606, 728 A.2d 180, 184 (1999); <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 417, 722 A.2d 887, 895 (1999). \u201c[W]e look first to the words of the statute, on the tacit theory that the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u201d <em>Witte, </em>369 Md. at 525, 801 A.2d at 165. In that regard, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, \u201cnot one that is illogical or incompatible with common sense.\u201d <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>366 Md. at 302, 783 A.2d at 671; <em>State v. Brantner, </em>360 Md. 314, 322, 758 A.2d 84, 88-89 (2000). Moreover, statutes are to be interpreted so that no portion is rendered superfluous or nugatory. <em>See Taylor, </em>365 Md. at 181, 776 A.2d at 654; <em>Blondell v. Baltimore City Police Dep\u2019t, </em>341 Md. 680, 691, 672 A.2d 639, 644-45 (1996). Words may not be added to, or removed from, an unambiguous statute in order to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature chose to use, <em>Medex, </em>372 Md. at 38, 811 A.2d at 303, \u201c[n]or [may we] engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Nations-Bank, </em>365 Md. 166, 181, 776 A.2d 645, 654 (2001); <em>Mid-Atlantic Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>361 Md. 196, 204, 760 A.2d 1087, 1091 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">When the statute is ambiguous \u2014 the words do not clearly disclose the legislative intention or, while clear and unambiguous viewed in isolation, the terms are ambiguous when it is part of a larger statutory scheme, <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 130, 756 A.2d 987, 992 (2000), we look for legislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other sources extraneous to the statute itself, <em>see Medex, </em>372 Md. at 38, 811 A.2d at 303; <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590, 594 (1992), as well \u201cas the structure of the statute, how it relates to other laws ... its general purpose, and the \u2018relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>Toler, </em>373 Md. at 220, 817 A.2d at 233, quoting <em>Witte, </em>369 at 525-26, 801 A.2d at 165. We pointed out in <em>Witte </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqq\">\u201c[o]ne aspect of examining these indicia is the presumption, which itself is a rule of construction, that the Legislature \u2018intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law,\u2019 <em>State v. Ghajari, </em>346 Md. 101, 115, 695 A.2d 143, 149 (1997) (quoting <em>State v. Harris, </em>327 Md. 32, 39, 607 A.2d 552, 555 (1992)), such that no part of the statute is rendered meaningless or nugatory. <em>Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426, 428 (2002); <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523-24, 636 A.2d 448, 452(1994).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><em>Id. </em>In that regard, where the statute to be construed is a part of an entire statutory scheme, construction of the provisions of the scheme must be done in the context of that scheme. <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>366 Md. at 302-303, 783 A.2d at 671; <em>Blondell, </em>341 Md. at 691, 672 A.2d at 645. When, in that context, two statutes conflict and one is general and the other specific, \u201cthe statutes may be harmonized by viewing the more specific statute as an exception to the more general one.\u201d <em>Government Employees Ins.

Browning-Ferris, </em>292 Md. 515, 526, 438 A.2d 1356, 1363 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The provisions of Maryland law governing probationary employees are a part of a comprehensive statutory scheme. <em>See WCI v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 807 A.2d 32 (2002). That scheme is embodied in the State Personnel Management System Reform Act of 1996, <em>see </em>1996 Md. Laws, ch. 347, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>product of the deliberations of the Governor\u2019s Task Force to Reform the State Personnel Management System, which, by Executive Order No. 01.01.1995.15, dated June 9, 1995, was established to address the need for \u201ca personnel management system that is more flexible, decentralizes personnel management functions, simplifies and streamlines personnel procedures and provides for the consistent application of personnel policies throughout a diverse State government.\u201d Its charge, more specifically, was to conduct a \u201ccomprehensive review of the Maryland State Personnel Management System contained in Division I of the State Personnel and Pensions Article to determine necessary and appropriate revisions to that law.\u201d <em>WCI, </em>371 Md. at 145-146, 807 A.2d at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The requisites of, and for, employment in the State Personnel Management System are treated in Title 7. That Title \u201capplies to all employees in the State Personnel Management System,\u201d \u00a7 7-101(a), except temporary employees. \u00a7 7-101(b). Probationary employees are the subject of Subtitle 4. Its provisions make clear that employees in the skilled and professional service, \u00a7 7-401 (a), must serve a probationary period, upon initial appointment, following a competitive promotion and, under some circumstances, <em>see </em>\u00a7 7-402(b), following a reinstatement, \u00a7 7-402(a), but that employees in the management service or who are special appointments, whatever the service to which appointed, do not. \u00a7 7-401 (b). The probationary period, which may be extended, <em>see </em>\u00a7 7-403,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>six months, \u00a7 7-402(a), and is concluded when the employee \u201cdemonstrate[s] proficiency in the assigned duties and responsibilities of the position to which the employee is appointed.\u201d \u00a7 7-402(c). Responsibility for orientation and evaluation, including holding conferences with the employees, is placed on the appointing authority and the supervisor, \u00a7 7-404, with, given the goal of the probationary period \u2014 to allow an opportunity for gaining proficiency in the position \u2014 , the emphasis being on timely assessment of the employee\u2019s work and progress and providing the employee with timely feedback. Section 7-404 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">\u201c(a) Duties of appointing authority and supervisor generally. \u2014 Each appointing authority and, where applicable, supervisor has the responsibility of properly explaining the duties and responsibilities of an employee\u2019s position to the employee, providing the employee with a written position description and otherwise orienting the employee to the operations of the employee\u2019s unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201c(b) Conferences with employee. \u2014 Periodically during the probationary period, an appointing authority or an employee\u2019s supervisor, as appropriate, shall confer with the employee about the employee\u2019s performance and improvements in that performance that are necessary to satisfactorily complete probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201c(c) Evaluations.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201c(1) An appointing authority shall ensure that at the end of an employee\u2019s first 90 days of probation the employee receives a written evaluation of the employee\u2019s performance and any recommendations for improvement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">\u201c(2) If the appointing authority extends an employee\u2019s probationary period, the appointing authority shall ensure that the employee receives additional written evaluations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u201c(i) at the end of the employee\u2019s initial probationary period; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">\u201c(ii) at the mid-point of the extension period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The question of how probationary employees are to be terminated or disciplined is the subject of \u00a7 7-405, captioned \u201cDisciplinary actions.\u201d It instructs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">\u201cAn appointing authority may take disciplinary action against or terminate the employment of a probationary employee in accordance with Title 11 of this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Title 11 covers \u201cDisciplinary Actions, Layoffs, and Employment Terminations in State Personnel Management System.\u201d Subtitle 1 applies to \u201cDisciplinary actions\u201d and, like Subtitle 4 of Title 7, extends to all employees in the executive branch, except temporary employees. \u00a7 11-102. Thus, the provisions in this Subtitle, including \u00a7 11-106, would appear to be applicable to probationary employees. Subtitle 3 narrows the focus, governing \u201cEmployment separations and terminations.\u201d Sections 11-303 and 11-304 address specifically probationary employees, their termination and demotion and removal, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Therefore, there are at least three provisions in Title 11 that apply to the discipline and termination of probationary employees. Two of them may apply to the termination of a probationary employee\u2019s employment; one definitely applies and the other only arguably may apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The first, on which the petitioner relies, is, as we have seen, \u00a7 11-106, \u201cDuty of the appointing authority prior to imposing sanctions.\u201d <em>See note </em>1. That section, as we pointed out in <em>Geiger, </em>371 Md. at 143, 807 A.2d at 43, prescribes the prerequisites that must be met before the appointing authority may impose disciplinary action for employee misconduct. Specifically, we held in that case, <em>see id., </em>the appointing authority has thirty (30) days from when it \u201cacquires knowledge of the misconduct for which the disciplinary action is imposed,\u201d to investigate the alleged misconduct, meet with the accused employee, consider mitigating circumstances, decide on the discipline to be imposed and give the accused employee writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ten notice of the disciplinary action and of his or her appeal rights. \u00a7 ll-106(a). The employee in Geiger was not a probationary employee and we have not construed \u00a7 11-106 in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">As we have previously pointed out, <em>see note </em>1, COMAR 17.04.05.04D, the regulation implementing \u00a7 11-106, is worded almost identically, adding only that which almost necessarily is implicit, that the appointing authority shall \u201c[n]otify the employee of the misconduct and provide an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence.\u201d Another regulation, COMAR 17.04.03.17, deals with probation and presumably was promulgated to- implement the provisions that comprise Subtitle 4 of Title 7 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article. As pertinent to the issue sub judice, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">\u201cF. Discipline of Probationary Employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">\u201c(1) Initial appointment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">\u201c(c) The provisions of State Personnel and Pensions Article, \u00a7 11-106, Annotated Code of Maryland, control the discipline of a probationary employee for misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">The second provision, \u00a7 11-303, clearly applies to a probationary employee. Indeed, located in Subtitle 3, Employment Separations and Terminations, of Title 11, it is captioned, \u201cTermination of probationary employees.\u201d Section 11-303 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">\u201c(a) Authorized. \u2014 An appointing authority may terminate the employment of a probationary employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">\u201c(b) Notice. \u2014 Before terminating an employee who is on probation, the appointing authority shall give the employee a notice of termination at least 10 days before the effective date of the termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">\u201c(c) Suspension during interim. \u2014 An appointing authority may suspend a probationary employee with pay between the date of the notice and the effective date of the termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>\u201c(d) Appeal limited. \u2014 A probationary employee may appeal a termination under this section only on the grounds that the termination is illegal or unconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Section 11-104 sets out the disciplinary actions the appointing authority is permitted to take. One such action is the termination of the employee\u2019s employment, with or without prejudice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relying on this section, the petitioner notes that termination of employment is a disciplinary action. She argues, therefore, that, as \u00a7 11-106 governs disciplinary action against State employees who engage in misconduct, that section applies to the termination of her probationary employment in this case, there being no exception for probationary employment stated in either the statute or the regulation. The petitioner submits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">\u201cThere is neither illogic nor inconsistency in empowering an employer to fire employees without stating a reason, on the one hand, while requiring the same employer to observe certain precautions before stigmatizing an employee for \u2018misconduct\u2019 on the other. The legislature no doubt had its reasons in adopting such a policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Stated differently, she draws a distinction between \u201cmanagement\u2019s discretion to fire an employee without giving a reason\u201d and imposing on management certain procedural obligations prerequisite to taking disciplinary action when \u201cmanagement does give a reason and the reason is \u2018misconduct.\u2019 \u201d The petitioner also finds persuasive that the regulations implementing the provisions of Subtitle 4 of Title 7 contemplate that \u00a7 11-106 control the discipline of probationary employees for misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">We reject the petitioner\u2019s argument. Section 11-303 is clear and unambiguous in its application to the termination of probationary employees. Subsection (a) states unequivocally, and without limitation or exception, that the appointing authority may terminate a probationary employee. And when this provision is read in conjunction with subsection (d), prescribing the limited grounds for appeal of the termination decision, it is clear that the termination may be for any reason that is not illegal or unconstitutional. Moreover, \u00a7 11-303 contains its own notice provision, requiring the giving of 10 days notice prior to the effective date of the termination. \u00a7 11 \u2014 303(b). The statute does not, and there is no need to, refer to any other statute with regard to procedural requirements. That \u00a7 11-303 is wholly self contained is buttressed by its having, in addition, its own separate appeal provision, subsection (d), and by the fact that subsection (c) permits the probationary employee to be suspended, with pay, between the time of the giving of the notice of termination and the actual termination itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">To be sure, \u00a7 11-106 does apply to disciplinary actions against probationary employees and, as we have seen, termination is a disciplinary action. On the other hand, it is undisputed that \u00a7 11-303 does as well. This being the case, the statutes would appear to be irreconcilably in conflict. Section 11-303 is more narrowly focused, however, than \u00a7 11-106, referring only to one form of disciplinary action, termination. Thus, they can be reconciled by treating \u00a7 11-303, the more specific of the two, as an exception to \u00a7 11-106, the more general. Of course, if there were no \u00a7 11-303, \u00a7 11-106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>undoubtedly would apply to the case <em>sub judice. </em>Where, however, as here, there is a provision that specifically, and without any doubt, addresses the termination, as opposed to the discipline generally, of probationary employees, that provision must control over a provision that applies, but only generally, as \u00a7 11-106 does.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The pronouncement in COMAR 17.04.03.17 F(l)(c) does not change either the analysis or the result. This is true notwithstanding the great deference to which the interpretation given a statute by the agency charged with its administration is entitled. <em>See Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59,69, 729 A.2d 376, 381 (1999); <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. 145, 161-62, 501 A.2d 1307, 1315 (1986).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is, in reality, no contradiction or inconsistency between COMAR 17.04.03.17 F and our holding that \u00a7 11-303, rather than \u00a7 11-106, applies to probationary terminations. A termination is but one form of disciplinary action. As \u00a7 11-104 makes clear, sanctions and discipline short of dismissal or termination, i.e. \u201cwritten reprimand,\u201d forfeiture of annual leave, suspension without pay, denial of annual pay increases, demotion, qualify as, and are, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>disciplinary actions. This was certainly recognized by the General Assembly when it enacted \u00a7 11-405, making disciplinary actions subject to Title 11; rather than refer only to \u201cdisciplinary actions\u201d generally, it chose to draw a distinction between \u201cdisciplinary action\u201d and \u201ctermination.\u201d Thus, the General Assembly specifically permitted an appointing authority \u201cto take disciplinary action against\u201d a probationary employee or to \u201cterminate\u201d that employee, both in accordance with Title 11. That \u00a7 11-303 alone applies to the termination of that employee does not deprive \u00a7 11-106 of meaning or render the regulation illogical or inconsistent. Indeed, the regulation is totally consistent, as paragraph F(l)(e) of COMAR 17.04.03.17 makes clear. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">\u201c(e) An appointing authority who terminates an employee under this subsection shall do so in accordance with State Personnel and Pensions Article, \u00a7 11-303, Annotated Code of Maryland. The appointing authority\u2019s notice to the employee shall be in writing with a copy to the Secretary. The appointing authority shall provide notice at least 10 days before the effective date of the termination. The notice shall state the reasons for the termination, the effective date, and the appropriate appeal route. If the termination is for a reason specified in State Personnel and Pensions Article, \u00a7 11 \u2014 105,'[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] Annotated Code of Maryland, the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>pointing authority may disregard the requirement for 10 days notice and immediately submit a written termination notice to the Secretary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Section 11-106, consequently, remains the applicable provision, and must be applied, whenever a probationary employee has disciplinary action taken against him or her that is short of termination. Contrary to the protestations of the petitioner to the contrary, albeit in a broader context, there is logic and symmetry in such a dichotomy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOs\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\">.

The intermediate appellate court seemed to suggest another reason for concluding that the failure to comply with \u00a7 11-106 was of no moment. Its opinion can be read to state that the petitioner was not terminated for \"misconduct, that the respondent merely gave a reason for the termination. Specifically, rejecting the argument that \"even if a probationary employee's employment could be terminated at the discretion of the employer, nevertheless, \u00a7 11-106 would be applicable in this case because [the petitioner] in fact treated this as a misconduct case,\u201d the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\"The statute does not define misconduct, but it is clearly a concept distinct from lack of proficiency in employment, although the two could overlap. Appellee did not use the label or in any way assert 'misconduct'; it simply gave a reason for the termination of appellant\u2019s employment, a reason consistent with lack of proficiency. It is immaterial whether the same conduct constitutes 'misconduct' within \u00a7 11-106. We see no statutory prohibition against giving a reason for termination even if the right to terminate is discretionary. On the other hand, if appellee had chosen to comply with the procedures in \u00a7 11-106, even though not required to do so, it would not have violated the statute. The bottom line is that appellee did not comply with the procedures in \u00a7 11-106, and in our view of the case, it was not required to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\"><em>Smack v.
