This was an action brought by Webster against Humphries, the constable, for the amount of an execution, at the suit of the said Webster against Andrew Alston, which the said constable had not returned agreeably to the command thereof; and thus rendered himself liable. <em>Big. </em>341.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-6\">The question was, whether the justice had jurisdiction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-9\">Wales, for plff.

It must be in tort. An action for money had and received, could not be sustained. Though the Act makes the constable equally liable as if the money had been received, it cannot affect the form of the remedy, which must show the special matter on which the constable\u2019s liability arises, and must therefore, be a special action on the case, founded on the neglect of duty, and the statutory liability. Such an action is not within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
