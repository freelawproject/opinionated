This note having been indorsed by John Hartwell, he has no longer any interest in it, and cannot sue upon it, nor can Henry Hartwell, the indorsee and present holder, turn himself into a cestui que use. The suit should be brought in his name, as the party having the legal title to the instrument.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-26\">\n<em>Hamilton.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A15v\">The indorsee of a note is not bound to sue in that character, but may use the name of his indorser. In the case of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>assignment of a bond, the assignee may sue in the name of the obligee for his own use, without stating the assignment. It was so decided, by the court of common pleas in <em>Broom </em>vs. <em>The Female Benevolent Society.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-4\"><em>Bayard. </em>The case of a bond with warrant of attorney to confess judgment stands on different ground. The warrant is usually to executors and administrators\u2014seldom extends to assigns. The party, therefore, would have to use the assignor\u2019s name to avail himself of the warrant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-7\"><em>Plamilton, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-8\"><em>J. Ji. Bayard, </em>for defendants,</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b372-5\">A majority of the court refused the nonsuit, the chief justice dissenting. The majority agreed that a blank indorsement was sufficient to transfer the right of action to the indorsee, but while it remains in blank he may consider himself as a cestui que use, or servant, and the action may still be brought in the name of the indorser. If the indorser turns the blank indorsement into a special one, as he may do, the property in the note is then transferred to him, and he only could bring the action. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>174; <em>Salk. </em>130; 12 <em>Mod. </em>193; <em>Selw. N. P. </em>331-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Treating this as an action between the original parties to the note, the coui\u2019t permitted evidence to be given of a want or failure of the consideration, and the plff. finally submitted to a nonsuit. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>91.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
