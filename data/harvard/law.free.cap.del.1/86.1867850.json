A probate is for the security of the estate, and the law requires that the person making it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>should disclose all credits within his knowledge. A general reference to the deft\u2019s, books without this, might in many cases evade the check which the law designed to impose upon all claims made upon a deceased person\u2019s estate. The demand here is of $840, with a general reference to the deft\u2019s, books for credits, without specifying a single credit, though it is proved that the plff. has on other occasions, admitted the receipt of specific sums, as being within her recollection and knowledge.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b95-5\"><em>Ridgely </em>for plff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b95-6\"><em>Clayton </em>and <em>Bates </em>for defts.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
