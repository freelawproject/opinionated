Reading; that a half year\u2019s rent ($312 50) was growing due at the time of the taking of Reading\u2019s goods, being upon said premises, by MTlay under process of attachment at the suit of one Ford, issued by justice M\u2019Dowell on the 28th September, 1833. That Reading confessed judgment in said suit on the 15th October, 1833, and a fi. fa. was issued on the same day, under xvhich M\u2018Clay sold the goods (still being on the premises) for $135 11, which he has neglected and refused to pay over to Thompson in part payment of the rent afsd.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-7\">The rejoinder xvas \u201cThat before the said rent became due, the said Allan Thompson, to wit: on the-day of-entered upon the premises so leased to the said Hugh H.

He was accompanied by his family with the exception of a bar keeper who said that he was not authorized and would not take the responsibility of keeping the house open. It was a large tavern establishment in the city of Wilmington. On the 26th September Thompson, the landlord, levied a distress on the goods remaining upon the premises, locked up the house and took charge of the key; and afterxvards let the house to another tenant, his term to commence on the 25th of March, when Reading\u2019s xvould expire. The succeeding tenant filled the ice house in January, and for this purpose got the key of Thompson. The goods were sold on a judgment recovered by Ford, the bar keeper of Reading on a foreign attachment, sued out on the 28th of September; and the constable paid the money over to the attaching creditor, without satisfying the landlord\u2019s claim for rent. The only question was whether there had been an eviction by the landlord, and a consequent discharge or forfeiture of the rent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-11\"><em>Mr. JR.

An eviction is any entry by the landlord upon the possession of his tenant with a design to injure or prejudice the tenant\u2019s right of possession. The premises in question were rented by Reading for one year from the 25th of March, 1833. On the 25th of September he absconded in the night time and left the state, taking with him a part of his goods. The goods left on the premises were sold by the deft. M\u2018Clay on execution process. They were also levied upon by distress at the suit of the plff. for rent; and it is not denied that he is entitled to be paid out of the proceeds of the sales unless his conduct in taking possession of the' premises occasioned a forfeiture of the rent. If a tenant absconds and goes out of the government and abandons the property, common sense would teach that the landlord had the right to take proper care of the abandoned premises to prevent their going to destruction. The object, therefore, of Mr. Thompson in entering upon these premises and locking up the house should govern in ascertaining whether there was an eviction. If he entered with a view of dispossessing the tenant, keeping him out, or prejudicing his rights as tenant; or if he did so dispossess him, against his will; it would be an eviction; but if all the acts of Thompson amounted only to reasonable care of his property; and were not designed and had not the effect to dispossess or keep out Reading against his will, they would not constitute an eviction. The fact of again leasing the property is no evidence of an eviction, for the term was not to commence until the expiration of Reading\u2019s lease; and these arrangements for a new tenancy must always be made before the expiration of the old. The entry by the new tenant for the purpose of filling the ice house is not proved to have been by authority of the landlord; and it would, perhaps, be justified by the custom of the country. Necessity and the custom require that the incoming tenant should be permitted to fill the ice house before his term commences as much as that the way-going tenant shall return to reap his wheat crop.</p>\n<p id=\"AW7\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
