It commanded the sheriff to <em>sell the goods, \u00a1je. </em>levied on by virtue of the afsd. fi. fa. for residue; to <em>levy and make </em>of the goods, &amp;c. of the said Jacob Biddle any <em>residue </em>that should remain after such sale; and to <em>summon the garnishees </em>of the said Jacob to answer, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-3\"><em>Frame, </em>in support of the rule.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYm\">The writ is irregular and this motion to set it aside proper. <em>Tidd. 934. </em>As far back as 1825, the plff. took in execution goods to nearly double the amount of his debt, as appears by the inventory and appraisement. This is a legal satisfaction of the debt until more appears. 2 <em>Tidd. </em>937, 912, 934. It may be said that the return shows that these goods were <em>subject </em>to other demands. In the first place such a return without any specification of sums or persons is a mere nullity. The act of assembly provides for this, and if the sheriff follows its directions and specifies prior <em>executions </em>and their amounts, they may be deducted; but not where he specifies neither the number, amounts nor parties in the executions, much less can prior <em>claims </em>be allowed, which means any thing or nothing. The court therefore cannot regard this qualification of the return, but will take it according to the appraisement that a sufficient amount of goods were levied to satisfy the debt, until the contrary be shown. For all that appears by the record the debt is legally satisfied by the levy. On this ground the alias fi. fa. must be set aside. Second. But supposing it should turn out that the levy after a sale and deducting prior liens was not sufficient to satisfy the debt, <em>until this appears </em>no fi. fa. for residue can issue, for until the sale non constat that there is a residue. A writ for a residue must show that there is a residue and the <em>amount </em>thereof; \u2022 that is, it must show absolutely what has been made on the first levy. So are all the forms. <em>(Tidd. Appx. </em>273; <em>Ch. </em>41, <em>sec. </em>65 explains the text of 2 <em>Tidd.) </em>I take the ground then that after a levy of goods to the amount of the debt according to the inquisition and appraisement, no fi. fa. for residue can be issued until a <em>return of the sale </em>of the goods and of the application of the proceeds shows that there is a residue. It is true that in England a fi. fa. for residue may accompany the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>venditioni exponas for the sale of the first levy; but this is because the sheriff is there always accountable to the amount and the residue is ascertained and known from the date of the levy. (2 <em>Tidd. </em>935.) It is not so here and I am by no means satisfied that in <em>any case </em>'a fi. fa. can accompany the venditioni. It is impossible to say, with certainty, that the first goods will not sell for enough. Third. There is another legal satisfaction of this debt appearing on the record, and that is a portion of the levy on land, the tract No. 3, which has never yet been sold as appears by the record. Fourth. <em>Tidd. </em>p. 931, says a subsequent writ of execution must be tested on the return day of the former. There is here a lapse of several years between the fi. fa. and venditioni exponas and alias fi. fa. I contend therefore that this is irregular as a continuing execution; and further, fifth; that no new execution <em>original </em>in its character, as this alias fi. fa. for residue is, could be legally issued after the year and day without a previous <em>scire facias. </em>I am not positive that a venditioni exponas could issue for the sale of an old levy, and as a continuation of that execution process, but I insist that proceedings in the nature of <em>new </em>execution process cannot be <em>originated </em>after this lapse of time without a scire facias.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-3\"><em>Bates, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUH\">It is impossible to specify the amount of residue in a fi. fa. for residue under our practice. The English forms must therefore necessarily be varied from to suit the different construction we make to the sheriff\u2019s liability. In England the sheriff is liable at once to the amount of the levy; the goods are his goods, he seizes and takes them away. It is not so here; and our invariable practice has been to issue for residue without showing what has been before made, or the exact amount, or any amount of residue; the plaintiff, of course, always levying further at his peril. Is this practice of twenty years standing now to be changed by reference to the English forms when so substantial a reason exists for the difference? Second. The sheriff\u2019s return here does show the amount of rent to which the first levy was subject, <em>($375) </em>and taking this from the amount of the appraisement it <em>ascertains </em>a residue without regarding the prior liens mentioned in his return, and of which the prior <em>executions </em>must undoubtedly be noticed. This entitled us to a fi. fa. for residue, and according to the practice and the law, we had the right to connect with it a venditioni exponas for the sale of the old levy. Third. Is the undisposed levy on land No. 3, an objection to the issuing of this writ? Although lands are made liable to be sold in payment of debts it has never been decided that a <em>levy </em>on land is a satisfaction. If it were so it would compel every creditor to go on and sell or extend the land after having once made-a levy without resort to subsequently acquired personal property. The practice is altogether different, and so is the policy of the law? After inquisition the creditor may elect to take the land or wait for satisfaction out of the defendant\u2019s goods. The law only makes the land liable to be sold in the <em>last resort; </em>not when any money can be made from the personalty. Fourth. Should asci. fa. have been issued before the alias fi. fa. for residue? The practice has obtained in Sussex, and it has been understood to be under the sanction of the court, to issue a <em>vice </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>comes </em>within the year and day, and <em>at any time after </em>to enter continuances, and issue further execution process.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-3\">(The Chief Justice referred to a decision heretofore made in the case of <em>Cooper and wife </em>vs. <em>May, ante </em>18, in which this point was considered.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-4\"><em>Frame, </em>in reply. I deny any practice in this state of connecting a fi. fa. for residue with a venditioni for the sale of the old levy unless it be the practice of the gentleman opposed to me; and that practice is not of an earlier date than 1825, and has been resorted to in but few instances. If it has not been arrested it may be because it has not heretofore been questioned. It at least has never been ratified by any decision of the courts, and has not been followed by others. The rent specified in the sheriff\u2019s return was for the year 1825, and as the goods have not been sold it must long since have been paid without resort to them. The claim itself is now barred by limitation. It is therefore not <em>now </em>to be deducted from the levy in any inquiry as to how much of that levy is applicable to this debt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-9\"><em>Frame, </em>in support of the rule.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-10\"><em>Bates, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b511-5\">\n<em>By the Court. Clayton Chief Justice:</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The motion to set aside this writ of venditioni exponas which has in it a fi. fa. for residue must prevail. In England where the levy is not to the amount of the debt the venditioni exponas may include a fi. fa. for the residue, but there the sheriff is answerable for the amount of the goods levied on at the value as returned by him. Here he is answerable for the goods, but not for the value at which they are appraised, and the amount for which the fi. fa. should go is not ascertained, nor can it be ascertained except by an actual sale. The English practice ought not therefore to be introduced here; nor should a fi. fa. for residue issue until there has been an actual sale of the goods. The practice therefore of issuing a venditioni exponas and inserting in it a fi. fa. for residue cannot be sanctioned by this court. No fi. fa. for residue should issue until it is ascertained by a sale what that residue is.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Rule made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
