It then accrued. The declaration sets out a demise on the tenth of October, 1833, some fifteen days previous to the date of his title. The plff. must show that his demise rests on sufficient legal title in the lessor at the time of the demise. This is an elementary principle. The demise must be laid <em>after </em>title accrued. <em>Buller, </em>105; 2 <em>Sellon\u2019s Prac. </em>93.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b473-4\"><em>Bayard, </em>for plff.,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5U\">did not controvert the principle if it applied to the case, but he thought that the title, though perfected by the deed, would have relation to the sale, or at least to the confirmation. The sale of the land here was in January, 1833, and it was confirmed at the May term following. The act of assembly \u201cconcerning the action of ejectment\u201d <em>(Dig. \\10) </em>has provided that no objection shall be made to the form of action, or to the right of the lessor of the plff. to make the demise, if he could recover the premises in any form of action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b473-8\"><em>J.

The plff.\u2019s title accrues from the sheriff\u2019s deed. It commenced with the sale, but was not perfected until a deed was executed; and though he has certain rights given to him by act of assembly as to rent from the time of sale and to possession in a summary way, the legal title is not in the purchaser until a deed is executed. In this state a deed has always been considered necessary to perfect the title by execution and enable the purchaser to bring ejectment, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The sheriff seldom receives the purchase money, or, at least, all of it, until the deed is made. The practice is to require a deposit of ten per cent, at the time of the sale. The act referred to was intended merely to do away the old actions of assize and writ of right. To apply it to such a case as this would be to enable the plff. to recover on a mere equitable title. And even that is not shown; for there is no proof of the payment of the purchase money but what is furnished by the deed, and that is <em>after </em>the demise.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\"><em>Mr. Bayard </em>suggested that the narr was against Roe, the nominal deft., and had not yet been altered for the present deft. Green, and asked if the court would not now permit an amendment. The <em>chief justice </em>said that the alteration was always presumed after the real deft, had appeared and entered into the common consent rule. The court would allow him to be substituted even after verdict and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The plff. was nonsuited.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b473-10\"><em> </em>4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>434.
