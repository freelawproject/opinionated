It is a wise provision to insure notice to the party before a judgment by default shall bind him. Here the service was at an office, a place where the family do not usually reside. The constable need not state in his'return that all the requisites to a legal service were observed; but if he states any thing which shows that the service was not regular, the judgment cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
