The plea puts in issue the whole declaration, of course denies the plff\u2019s right to the services of the boy. He produces an indenture by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Maryland. By what authority did this court bind him? Plff. must either show a common law right; or, if he goes upon a statutory right, he must show the statute. The foreign law on this subject is matter of evidence. The authority to bind a boy must depend on statutory provisions. It is not a common law right; at common law the father is entitled to the services of the boy. I don\u2019t say the record is not evidence, but that the law authorizing the binding must, be shewn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-10\"><em>Hamilton, </em>for the plff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9q\">insisted that the action of the court in Maryland on this subject was entitled to full credit and their jurisdiction would be implied.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-15\"><em>Hamilton, </em>for plff. <em>Bayard, </em>for deft.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b131-11\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AiP\">\u2014This is not the common case of a judgment recovered in the courts of another state.
