The proof shows that Benton Harris was the owner of this property; on his death it descended to the heir; the heir., therefore, and not the ex\u2019r., is entitled to the rent. The action is assumpsit for use and occupation, to recover a reasonable sum for the occupation of the house of plff.

He must count in a special action on the case under the act of assembly. It was so decided in the case of Joseph Parsons, adm\u2019r. <em>vs. </em>Allee, in Kent, at the Nov. Term, 1831. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">On the other point, we are of opinion that an ex\u2019r. cannot recover accruing rents after the death of the testator; and, therefore, there must be a</p>\n<p id=\"b15-8\">Judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b15-13\"> \u201cJoseph Parsons, being tenant for life, in his lifetime, let to Abraham Allee a tract of land by paroi, from year to year, rendering rent one-third of the corn, and two-fifths of Lite wheat. The leUing was from the 1st of March. Parsons died on the 20th of October. To recover under the Slat. 11 <em>Geo. </em>3 <em>Ch. </em>19., a proportion of the rent the adm\u2019r. after the expiration of the year, brought Lis action, and filed his navr in general- indebitatus assumpsit a Hedging that Allee was indebted to Parsons in his lifetime for Ihe use and. occupation of the premises for a long time then elapsed, in consideration whereof, he promised to pay the said Parsons in his lifetime, &amp;c. It was objected that general indebitatus assumpsit will not lie. Second, that it should have been alledged that deft, being liable to the ex\u2019r., undertook and promised to pay him as ex\u2019r. Accruing rent being- neither <em>d\u00e9bilwn </em>nor solvendum, a release of all actions does not release such rent. <em>Lilt. Sect. </em>513; <em>Co. Litl </em>293-6. There being no debt or duty at the death of Parsons, it would seem that in an action brought by Ms adm\u2019r. after his death the declaration ought to have stated the tacts specially, to wit: the use and occupation by permission of Parsons in his life time; the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Parsons; the legal liability of the tenant to pay to the adm\u2019r., and his undertaking to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-9\">(See, form of declaration for ex\u2019rs.
