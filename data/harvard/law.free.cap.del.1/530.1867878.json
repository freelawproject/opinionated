The deft, submitted to go into a trial without objecting to the process on which he was arrested; and the irregularity in the form of the process does not affect the jurisdiction. Freehold is a privilege that the party ought to avail himself of at a proper time: it would become the means of great injustice if it could be waived at one time and afterwards set up to avoid the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
