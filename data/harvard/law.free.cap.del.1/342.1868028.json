Egbers and Logan purchased together a schooner called the Ohio; and sailed her on their joint account for some time. Logan afterwards entered the vessel at the custom house in his own name, took out a license as sole owner, and then sold her without the knowledge or consent of his partner Egbers. He offered the license in evidence, and it was objected to.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-13\">\n<em>Bayard.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7Z_\">The license is no evidence of ownership. The ships husband is the proper person to take out license and give bond; nor is it necessary, by any means, that the names of all the owners should appear in the license. The bill of sale is the only evidence of property. 2 <em>U. S. L. </em>171, \u00a7 4, <em>of act of </em>1793; <em>Abbot on Ship. Old. p. 94, </em>86; <em>Th.

It is evidence to establish a conversion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-2\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\n<em>Hamilton.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANg\">The question before the court is one of <em>property </em>as well as conversion. Proof of one must precede the other. Can the property in this vessel be proved by such evidence as this? Moreover the paper itself is not authentic.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-5\"><em>Read, jr., </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-6\"><em>J.

The older cases are against the action; but a doubt is expressed in <em>2 Johns. Rep., </em>and very strong in 7 <em>Com.
