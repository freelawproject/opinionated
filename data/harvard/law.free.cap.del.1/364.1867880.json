Elliott from the estate of Caleb Kirk of $&gt;191 57, accruing from hire and claiming a preference under the law of this state, being a less sum than one year\u2019s wages.\u201d <em>Dig. </em>225. Judgment was rendered on this award, and the administrators having refused to pay, the present action is brought suggesting a devastavit. The fact that this claim is of a character preferred by the act of assembly to other debts is established by the award itself. It is apparent that they had this subject before them and examined into the nature of the claim with a view to determine its grade. They were competent to decide this question, and the award is conclusive as to it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-15\">\n<em>Wales.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1j\">The first question is whether the character or grade of the debt or the order of preference was submitted to the referees; if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>so submitted, they could not try it. The rule of reference is to ascertain an amount claimed to be due, and not to try the character of the demand. In the next place, it is not certain that they did in point of fact ascertain the nature of this claim. The note appended to the report, that it was <em>claimed </em>as a preferred debt, does not show that it was so decided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-4\"><em>Bayard. </em>The rule of reference submits \u201call matters in controversy between the parties.\u201d The referees have expressly the power to find assets. They may therefore find the nature of the debt in order to show what assets are applicable to it. The expression is not that the plff. <em>claimed </em>a preference, but that the <em>wages </em>claimed a preference by law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-7\"><em>J.

They might find a sum due on bond, or for rent, or for wages; and if the party meant to controvert the fact, or to object to the award for stating extraneous matter, he should have done so before the confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
