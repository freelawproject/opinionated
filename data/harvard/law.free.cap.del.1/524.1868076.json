The devise in this will to Saint Andrew\u2019s Church, is a plain and direct violation of the act, and is consequently null and void. The important question therefore is between the heirs at law and the residuary devisees in relation to this property) which the law will not permit to go in the manner intended by the testatrix. If this question is to be decided by the <em>intention </em>of the testatrix (and this is said to be the rule by which wills ought to be expounded) it is per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>fectly clear that Mrs. James did not intend this property to go to the residuary devisees, and did not suppose it to be embraced in the general residuary clause. She supposed she was giving it to the church and that she had the right so to give it. But it may be answered, no more did she intend it to go to her heirs at law, having manifested a different intention by attempting to dispose of it otherwise. Granted; but still the heir at law shall be preferred; he shall never be disinherited but by express words or necessary implication. <em>Prec, in Chy. </em>473; <em>Cowp. </em>99; <em>Cruise Dig. </em>The distinction is well established between a lapsed legacy and a lapsed devise of real estate; the former passes into the residuum because the will passes all the personal property which the testator may have at the time of his death, but as to the real property it regards only such as he may have at the date of the will. A lapsed \"devise therefore is regarded as not having been disposed of by the will and goes to the heir at law. 4 <em>Kent. Com. </em>541; 8 <em>Vezey,jr. </em>24; 6 <em>Cruise Dig. </em>169.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-4\">A further distinction has'been attempted and is loosely recognized by respectable authority, between a lapsed and a void devise. 4 <em>Kent. Com. </em>542; <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Sheffield, </em>13 <em>East, </em>526; but is not well supported by the English authorities; has not been followed by American cases; and is unintelligible .in principle. As referred to the intention of the te,stator, it cannot be supported. There is no such distinction between lapsed and void legacies. (5 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>500; 2 <em>Vernon, </em>394) and there exists no reason for it in the case of real estate. It is a distinction without a difference. And the case of <em>Green et al. </em>vs. <em>Fennis, </em>6 <em>Conn. Rep. </em>292, adjudges the land to the heir though the devise was void from the beginning. <em>Hormer </em>Chief Justice said \u201cThe devise being void, it is to be considered whether the land descended to the heirs at law of the devisor or were transferred to the residuary devisee.\u201d In relation to real estate it is an established principle, that, in case of a lapsedx devise, the estate does not vest in the residuary devisee but descends to the heir at law of the testator. Wills must be construed by the intent of the devisor at the <em>time of maleing them; </em>of consequence, when property is given to a person incapable of taking and there is a general devise of the residue, so far as respects the estate specifically devised at the time of the will being made, there is an intentional disposition, and it never was designed that it should fall into the <em>residuum. </em>The law respecting the bequest of personal estate is different; but as to the realty, the decisions have been uniform and unquestioned. <em>Fortesq. </em>182; <em>Willes\u2019 Rep. </em>293, 7; <em>Amb. </em>338, 9, 580, 643, 5; 3 <em>P.

The counsel for the church having abandoned the cause so far as they are concerned, I shall not consider it necessary to examine the first question, whether this devise is void. On the other question, the distinction is well established between lapsed and void devises; and whether proceeding on broad or narrow grounds it is fully taken. But the reason of it is sufficiently apparent. In the construction of wills we are always to refer ourselves to the condition of things at the time of making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the will and not after. <em>(Wittes Rep. </em>297.)' \u201cWhere the testator has given away all his estate and interest in certain lands, so that if he were to die immediately, nothing would remain undisposed of, he could not intend to give any thing in those lands to his residuary devisee.\u201d The reverse of this proposition must also be true that where the testator has <em>not </em>disposed of certain property by a specific bequest it falls within the general residuary bequest of \u201call the residue of her estate real and personal:\u201d and this constitutes the plain difference between a lapsed and a void devise; in the former the devise is good at the date of the will; the subject of it is actually disposed of by the will and cannot sink in <em>to the </em>residue; the latter is void from the beginning; passes not by the specific devise, but is included from the moment in the residuary clause. All the cases cited on the other side are cases either of lapsed or of conditional devises. <em>Kezey,jr. </em>is a lapsed devise; <em>P. Wms. </em>and <em>Ambler </em>contingent, and so of the rest. The only exception is the case from Connecticut Reports, where the residuary clause seems from a remark in Kent\u2019s commentaries (4 <em>Kent. Com. </em>542) to have been considered as not sufficiently comprehensive; but which, if considered as a case in point, is against all the authorities. 13 <em>East, </em>526; 3 <em>Maule &amp; Selwyn, </em>300.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-4\">\n<em>Read, Jr.,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ4\">on the same side. Looking at the train of authorities, what has been the rule of decision in cases similar to the present in the courts of that country from which we derive our common law? Have those decisions been varied or altered by the cases in our own courts; or is there any thing in our condition or policy which should vary our views of this question from those which the most learned judges have taken of it? It is not enough to sa)r that, the rule is based on a refined and unintelligible distinction; by this argument many of the best established maxims of the law might be shaken; the rule in Shelley\u2019s case for example. It is enough for us to say ita lex scripta est, and to enforce the rule of stare decisis by that sensible observation of a learned judge, that \u201cit is perhaps of less importance how the law is determined, than that it should be determined and certain.\u201d <em>(Per Ashhurst J. </em>7 <em>Durnfd. &amp; East </em>419; <em>Ram on Judgment, </em>5. The first object in construing a will, is to discover if possible the intention of the testator. What was it in this case? She evidently designed to part with all her property by will and not to die intestate as to any portion of it. She intended that her heirs at law should become entitled to her property only under her will. She commences with a direction about her funeral expenses, &amp;c. parcels out her property to the objects of her bounty according to her pleasure, and concludes by a general .bequest to William Ball, Mary Ball and John McKnight, of \u201call the residue of her estate real and personal.\u201d Is it not apparent that at the time of making this will Mrs. James did not intend that her heirs at law should have <em>anymore or </em>other part of her estate than she had specifically devised to them? With regard to the particular estate in controversy doubtless she intended the church should have it. That was the first object of her bounty. Who next? We are not left without an alternative; the will shows who; the residuary devisees were designed to have all her estate both real and personal which she had not disposed of to others. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The present property is precisely in that condition; and it affords an illustration of the distinction between lapsed and void devises which has been pronounced unintelligible.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-3\">\n<em>Wales,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlQ4\">in reply, for the heirs at law. Beyond a doubt the intention of Mrs. James was to give this estate to Saint Andrew\u2019s Church. It is equalty clear that she supposed she had effected this intention. How then can it be argued that there is an intention to be collected from the will itself, of giving this same property to other persons. Because she gives all the \u201cresidue\u201d of her estate to Ball and others, it is argued that she intended to include in this residue that which was not residue, but which she had previously disposed of in another manner. It is impossible to sustain a decision giving this estate to the residuary devisees on the ground of the intention of the testatrix. Can it be sustained on the authority of adjudged cases? The other side is confident that it may, but it is remarkable that they have not produced a single adjudged case sustaining their principle to its extent. In <em>Stewart\u2019s lessee </em>vs. <em>Sheffield, </em>(13 <em>East 526;) </em>the land was adjudged to the particular devisee; it was not the case of a void devise; and though the judges speculate on what would have been the-consequence if it had been, the point was not considered or decided. Neither does Doe ex dem. <em>Wells </em>vs. <em>Scotts et al. 3 Maule &amp; Selw. </em>decide the question. And the elementary writers lay it down loosety; some of them with hesitation. (4 <em>Kent. Com. </em>542.) In the absence of any proof of intention on the part of the testatrix, the only safe rule is that of the common law, that the heirs shall not be disinherited but by express words or necessary implication. <em>Free, in Ch\u2019y. </em>473.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-4\">Cur. adv. vult.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b536-5\"><em>Chief Justice Clayton </em>delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<author id=\"ADM\">\n<em>Clayton, Chief Justice.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AC7y\">\u201cMary James being seized in fee of the premises in question by her will duly executed, dated 30th July, 1831, gave and devised to \u201cSaint Andrew\u2019s Church in Wilmington, all a certain lot of land therein described, to have and to hold the use of the said house and lot to the said church forever; but not to be sold on any account whatever.\u201d And after bequeathing sundry legacies, there is this clause in her will:\u2014\u201cItem, I give, bequeath and devise to William Ball and Mary Ball, children of James Ball, deceased; and to John McKninght all the residue of my estate real and personal of whatever kind it may be.\u201d The lessors of the plff. are the residuary devisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">It is not contended in this case that the devise to Saint Andrew\u2019s Church, passes any estate in the premises in question to the church; but it is admitted that the devise is void by the laws of this state. That question was decided at the last May Term in Kent, in the State <em>use of Wiltbank et al. </em>vs. <em>Bates. </em>The question here is, who take? the heirs at law of Mrs. James, or her residuary devisees?</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Since the case of Doe on the demise of <em>Morris </em>vs. <em>Underdown, Willes </em>293, that question seems to be completely settled in England. In that case the distictiou, as far as we can ascertain, was first established between a lapsed devise, and a void devise. The principles laid down by the chief justice in that case were these: that the intent of the testator ought always to be taken as things stood at the mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ing of his will, and is not to be collected from subsequent accidents which the testator could not then foresee; and that when a testator in his will has given away all his estate and interest in certain lands, so that if he were to die <em>immediately </em>nothing remains undisposed of, he cannot intend to give any thing in these lands to the residuary devisee. This latter rule would govern all cases of lapsed devises; for if the testator were to die immediately upon the making of the will there would be nothing undisposed of, and the devisee would take; but if the devisee were to die between the making of the will, and the death of the testator, the devise would lapse and the heir at law would necessarily take in preference to the residuary devisee, for it was not undisposed of <em>at the making </em>of the will, but the devise was rendered inoperative by a subsequent accident\u2014the death of the devisee. This is not so in the case of a void devise; for there at the making of the will nothing passes, nothing is disposed of, and the residuary devisee under the clause \u201call the residue of my estate\u201d takes, and not the heir at law. <em>In Doe lessee of Stewart </em>vs. <em>Sheffield, </em>13 <em>East </em>536, this is considered as the settled law; and in Doe on the demise of Wells and others <em>vs. </em>Scott and another 3 <em>Maul\u00e9 and Sel. </em>300, Lord Ellenborough in delivering the judgment of the court recognizes the authority of the two preceding cases as \u201cadmitted law\u201d on the subj\u2019ect.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b537-5\"><em>Macbeth </em>and <em>Wales, </em>for the heirs at law.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b537-6\"><em>Gray </em>and <em>Read, Jr. </em>for the residuary devisees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b537-7\"><em>Booth </em>and <em>J. </em>\u00ab/2. <em>Bayard, </em>for the church.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">We are not unaware of the American decisions on this subj\u2019ect in 6 <em>Conn. Rep. </em>292 and in <em>Lingan </em>vs. <em>Carroll, 3 Har. and McHen. </em>333; but we prefer following the authorities which we have cited. The heirs at law do not appear to have been obj\u2019ects of the testator\u2019s bounty; they are no where mentioned in her will. This circumstance is not relied on in forming our j\u2019udgment, but merely to show that the testatrix did not desire that her heirs at law should derive any benefit from her estate. Our decision is founded upon the authorities which we have cited, and upon the principles established by them. Our opinion is therefore for the residuary devisees, and judgment is accordingly given for the plffs. in the case of the lessee of McKnight and others vs. Hedges; and in the other case, lessee of J.
