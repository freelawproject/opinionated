Rodney and Henry F. Hall.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b442-8\">After a general leave granted to amend the pleadings without qualification, the Court will not, on motion, strike out a plea of the statute of limitations entered under the leave. But if objected to at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the application to amend, after issue joined, the Court will not permit it to he entered.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b443-3\">In an action on an executor\u2019s bond, the party for whose use the suit was brought for a legacy, recovering judgment, was ordered to enter into bond to the executor to refund, to meet outstanding debts, &amp;c., and execution stayed till the order should be complied with.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-4\">This was an action of debt, against Henry F.

But in this case no such question was made at the time of the application, and a general leave was granted without qualification to amend, which authorized the plaintiff to reply de <em>nova, </em>if he saw proper, and it was therefore now too late to object to the replication, or to move to strike it from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">On the trial the plaintiff recovered a verdict for $386.78, for which the Court gave judgment. ' But as it was alleged and made to appear on the part of the executor that the estate was not yet settled, and that there were outstanding debts against it still unpaid, the Court made an order, requiring the party for whose benefit the suit was prosecuted, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>enter into bond with security to the executor to refund,' &amp;c;, pursuant to the provisions of the statute. <em>Rev.
