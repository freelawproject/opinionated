Non est factum and nil debet put every thing in issue. The loss is stated in the narr to dispense with the necessity of profert; when the loss is proved; proof of execution must followj and this must be made by subscribing witnesses exactly as if the paper was produced; or, if there be no instrumentary witness,\u2019then by-proof of handwriting, -&amp;c.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b453-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Huffington, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b453-13\">Frame, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">The <em>plaintiff </em>was then offered to prove the loss or destruction of the notes, &amp;e., and objected to.</p>\n<author id=\"b453-4\">\n<em>Frame.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A75\">To admit this testimony would be to permit the plaintiff to prove his whole case. The ordinary course of business is for a man to tear up, cancel or destroy a note when it is paid off; cancellation is itself prima facie evidence of payment. And shall the plff. himself by his own oath contradict this and set up such a paper? It would be a doctrine of extreme danger and not warranted by the authority of adjudged cases here or in England.</p>\n<author id=\"b453-5\">\n<em>Huffington.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AfA\">The rule is one of necessity. If papers are burnt, lost by accident or destroyed, the party who was in possession at the time of the accident is the only one who can prove the loss. The party is allowed to prove the death of a subscribing witness; and if admissible (as the cases in this country go to establish) to prove the loss, he must from the same necessity be allowed to prove the <em>manner </em>of the loss, or destruction, as a part of the very transaction. 16 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>193; 4 <em>Binney </em>314, 38; 2 <em>Phillips\u2019 Ev. </em>87, note. And this question is for the court and not for the jury. See also 2 <em>Stark.

In 1 <em>Jltk. Rep. </em>288, the party was allowed to prove the fraudulent possession which at once established the paper. The principle of that case and this is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The plff. was then sworn and after he had deposed to the destruction,</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\"><em>Frame </em>asked leave, before the case went further, to produce witnesses to impeach his credit.</p>\n<p id=\"A9qd\"><em>Per cur. </em>The loss or destruction of the instrument declared on must be made out as any other fact by <em>credible </em>testimony. The court have to be satisfied of the fact, and if the plff. can be shown to be unworthy of credit it is not proved to their satisfaction. The deft, is therefore at liberty, at this stage of the cause, to impeach the credit of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">On the suggestion of the court, however, the whole matter was by. consent left to the jury, and the case proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
