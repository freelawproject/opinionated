Hood Senior U.S. District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case presents a human tragedy. Plaintiff Jessica Allen lost her child and her liberty when she was wrongfully imprisoned in connection with her infant daughter's death. Allen spent more than three years behind bars before Kentucky courts overturned her convictions of criminal abuse in the first degree and complicity to first-degree manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Allen believes that Defendant Virgil Rucker, a state police officer, was at least partially responsible for her misfortune. She claims Rucker fabricated evidence, falsified testimony, conducted a shoddy investigation, and pushed for her prosecution. So she has filed this malicious prosecution lawsuit seeking monetary damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   But to bring her lawsuit, Allen must show that Rucker acted without probable\n   cause. And when a grand jury issues an indictment, that indictment presumptively establishes probable cause. In some situations, a plaintiff can rebut the presumption, but in the absence of specific factual allegations against Rucker, Allen has failed to do so. Thus, this Court must dismiss her Complaint, and for the reasons stated herein Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [DE 6] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jessica Allen (\"Allen\") gave birth to her daughter, Kaylee Buchanan, in April 2008. [DE 1, p. 3, \u00b6 15]. Three months later, Kaylee was dead. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6, \u00b6 30]. This case involves Allen's criminal prosecution after Kaylee's death and whether state police officer Virgil Rucker (\"Rucker\") violated Allen's Fourth Amendment rights in the process. The facts in this case come from Allen's Complaint, which the Court assumes to be true for the purposes of the present motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Allen and her boyfriend, Terry Buchanan (\"Buchanan\"), moved in together in April 2007. [DE 1, p. 3, \u00b6 14]. Months later, the couple learned Allen was pregnant, and she gave birth in April 2008. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15]. Allen returned to work three months after Kaylee's birth, and Kaylee stayed with a babysitter from about 2:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. each day. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16]. The babysitter-identified in the complaint only as \"Mrs. Meade\"-described Kaylee as \"normal and healthy\" and never noticed any strange marks or bruising on Kaylee. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4, \u00b6 17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shortly after Allen returned to work, she and Buchanan took Kaylee, and Allen's other son, Braden, to a campsite for the day. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18]. Allen's mother and other family members joined the trip, during which the family fished and enjoyed the outdoors. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The family spent hours together before departing at about 2 or 3 p.m. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Kaylee \"seemed happy and normal\" during the trip. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon returning home, Allen fed Kaylee a bottle and laid her in a bassinette before cooking dinner. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20]. At some point, Kaylee begin to stir and Allen asked Buchanan to watch Kaylee while she showered and spent time in a tanning bed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21]. After showering, but before entering the tanning bed, Allen heard Kaylee giggle from the other room. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. She then entered the tanning bed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While tanning, Allen heard Buchanan tell Braden to go to bed and she observed a shadow pass by the tanning room. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5, \u00b6 22]. She assumed Buchanan was putting Braden to bed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. She then heard what she described as \"not a normal cry\" from Kaylee, but Allen stayed in the tanning bed and did not check on Kaylee. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23]. Kaylee eventually stopped crying. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As Allen finished tanning, Buchanan ran into the tanning room and lifted the tanning bed lid; he was holding a limp and unresponsive Kaylee in his harms. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24]. Allen attempted rescue breaths, chest compressions, and the Heimlich Maneuver. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25]. A volunteer firefighter then arrived and began rescue breaths. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26]. Kaylee had a slight pulse when she arrived at the Fleming County Emergency Room. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27]. The doctor noticed irregular symptoms, and a CT scan showed swelling and blood around Kaylee's brain. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 5-6, \u00b6 28]. Kaylee was pronounced brain dead on July 23, 2008; an autopsy showed she died of blunt force injury to the head. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30]. Kaylee also had a muscle injury on her right leg, which a doctor said would have occurred eight to ten days prior to her x-rays in the emergency room. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 30-32].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A Fleming County Grand Jury indicted Allen, and she was tried and convicted of\n   criminal abuse in the first degree for the leg injury and complicity to first-degree manslaughter for failing to prevent Buchanan from inflicting the fatal injury to Kaylee's head. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33]. Several years of appeals followed. And eventually, the Kentucky Court of Appeals reversed both of Allen's convictions. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p.7, \u00b6 37]. The appeals court reasoned there was \"no evidence\" of the requisite mens rea on the complicity charge. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38]. The court also reversed the criminal abuse charge. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 8, \u00b6 40]. The Fleming Circuit Court dismissed the charges against Allen on September 27, 2016. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Allen then filed this lawsuit seeking damages against Rucker. She claims Rucker \"had no more information than that which was presented at trial when he made, influence, and participated in the decision to prosecute Ms. Allen.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41]. Allen alleges Rucker investigated witnesses in a manner which was intimating, threatened witnesses and coerced them to give false testimony, omitted material exculpatory facts from his investigation and report, presented false or misleading information in the application and affidavit submitted to obtain a search warrant, and presented false and misleading evidence to prosecutors and the grand jury. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp 8-9, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 47-48]. This, Allen argues, amounts to a malicious prosecution in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49]. She sued under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rucker has filed a Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). [DE 6]. Allen responded [DE 10] and Rucker replied [DE 14] making this matter ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

A plaintiff in a malicious prosecution case must prove four elements: \"(1) a criminal prosecution was initiated against the plaintiff and the defendant made, influenced, or participated in the decision to prosecute; (2) there was a lack of probable cause for the criminal prosecution; (3) the plaintiff suffered a deprivation of liberty,\n   as understood under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, apart from the initial seizure; and (4) the criminal proceeding was resolved in the plaintiff's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277456\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/568/#p582\">\n    852 F.3d at 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff argues that during Rucker's grand-jury testimony Rucker improperly stated Allen had \"probably\" been drinking, despite having no evidence of alcohol use. [DE 10, p. 10]. Plaintiff also claims Rucker testified that, while at the hospital, Allen did not wish to speak to police. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 9-10]. This statement, Allen argues, violates her Fifth Amendment right to silence because the statement raises an inference of guilt. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 9]. Defendant argues that Rucker's testimony was not false because Allen\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   decline to speak to police at the hospital and Rucker further stated \"I don't know\" when asked about alcohol consumption. [DE 14, pp8-9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties' argument over this standard is immaterial because it is not the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Recent cases from the Sixth Circuit and Supreme Court have altered the grand-jury indictment rule. First, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Rehberg v.

Thus, as the Sixth Circuit has since acknowledged,\n   <em>\n    Rehberg\n   </em>\n   forecloses the possibility of using grand-jury testimony to rebut probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277456\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/568/#p582\">\n    852 F.3d at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Rehberg\n   </em>\n   made clear that absolute immunity is to be afforded to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   grand-jury witnesses, even law-enforcement officers who have 'conspired to present false testimony.' \").

And in each case, the claims survived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, Allen's complaint fails to plausibly state a claim because she fails to adequately plead a lack of probable cause. Plaintiff does not identify\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   specific instances of Rucker presenting false testimony, fabricating evidence, making misleading statements, or omitting exculpatory information. Of course, at this stage, Allen need not detail every instance of Rucker's alleged wrongdoing. But she must point to\n   <em>\n    something.\n   </em>\n   Instead, Allen provides a \"formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But Allen does not identify\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   specific improper tactics Rucker used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Allen alleges Rucker \"concealed facts that were consistent with Plaintiff's innocence\" and he \"conducted an investigation in which Defendant fabricated conclusions that were both unsupported by the data, failed to and/or attempted to suppress exculpatory evidence.\" [DE 1, pp. 1-2, \u00b6 2]. But Allen does not tell us what facts Rucker concealed and fabricated, and she never points to any specific exculpatory evidence Rucker suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Allen next contends Rucker investigated \"witnesses in a manner which was intimidating and threatening in order to coerce them to give false testimony.\" [DE 1, p. 8, \u00b6 43], but she does not tell us how. She claims Rucker \"ommitt[ed] from his investigation and reports material facts which tended to show Ms. Allen's innocence, by presenting false or misleading information in the application and affidavit submitted to obtain a search warrant and by presenting false and materially misleading evidence to prosecutors and to the grand jury.\" [DE 1, pp. 8-9, \u00b6 43]. But she never identifies\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   Rucker omitted from his investigation and reports. She never tells us\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   false or misleading information the affidavit for a search warrant contained-indeed, she does not tell us anything about the affidavit. And she fails to identify\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   specific misleading evidence Rucker might have presented to prosecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In sum, although Allen\n   <em>\n    says\n   </em>\n   Rucker employed improper tactics, concealed facts, suppressed evidence, omitted material facts, presented false information, and misled prosecutors, Allen fails to explain any of her allegations. She does not point to a single\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   instance of any of these things happening. Simply saying so does not make it true. Nor does it satisfy the federal pleading standard.

State Malicious Prosecution Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The state-law malicious prosecution claim also fails. Kentucky follows a similar standard as federal law. The elements for malicious prosecution are: \"1) the defendant initiated, continued, or procured a criminal or civil judicial proceeding, or an administrative disciplinary proceeding against the plaintiff; 2) the defendant acted without probable cause; 3) the defendant acted with malice, which in the criminal context, means seeking to achieve a purpose other than brining an offender to justice; and in the civil context, means seeking to achieve a purpose other than the proper adjudication of the claim upon which the underlying proceeding was based; 4) the proceeding, except in ex parte civil actions, terminated in favor of the person against whom it was brought; and 5) the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.
